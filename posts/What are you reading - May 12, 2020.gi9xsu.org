** Title: Kicking Gotham

Author: Steelbadger

Pairing: N/A

Rating: T

Linkffn(Kicking Gotham)

Lately, I have been on the hunt. I have been looking for post Hogwarts stories. Where Harry does not play quidditch, and is not a useless idiot. It has been harder than first thought.

Now if anyone recognises the Author, just go read it now. If not, well. Go read it now, and anything else, that they have put to 'paper'.

Regardless, this is a tightly paced story, with exciting action sequences. That doesn't overstay it's welcome. I won't spoil any of the story beats. Just recommend you check it out.

** With Shadows of Angmar updating, I took a look at the author's other work. linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) is older, and I think the author has improved since then - but it's complete, which is a plus. If anyone is enjoying Shadows of Angmar but a bit lost in the history aspect, this one is set during Lord of the Rings.

Ultimately it only makes minor changes to the storyline, such as Theoden surviving the Pelennor Fields; it's primarily about how Harry responds to the world he's in, and his developing relationship with Eowyn. I'm not sure how well it would have stretched out to a longer story, but as it is, it's short enough to stay interesting.

** Title: Loose Cannon

Author: manatee-vs-walrus

Rating: M

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]

Comments:

I've grown bored of telling [[/u/TE7]] that nobody comes close to his level of writing on Quidditch and saw this story recommended somewhere as a Quidditch story, so I decided to give it a try. Minor spoiler, it's not *really* a Quidditch story, although the sport features heavily.

The good:

I reached the end of what's been written so far and that's always a good sign - not all that many stories make me keep going to the end these days.

There are a few genuinely original things that happen in the story. I won't spoil them here but I want to say it's good to see an author putting thought into new things without having to go to new places.

It's a story for grown-ups. The story is firmly post-Hogwarts and totally EWE and lets the characters we know explore growing up.

The bad:

It's all a bit easy. There aren't any real problems for the characters as they make their choices. Not as bad as Novocaine, which I see people are *still* recommending despite it being awful, but still could be better.

There are a lot of OCs, which isn't bad in itself, but they never really develop their own personalities. There are certainly some nods to a character being "the one who does this thing" and another being "the one who does this other thing" but unless they're actually doing those things, they are pretty much indistinguishable.

Conclusion:

I've made it through 49 (damn, I see there are now 51) chapters and >350k words without wanting to strangle the author, and that's a rare, rare thing these days. If you want a fairly interesting post-Hogwarts story then give this a go.

** I don't know whether there are any crossover readers out there, or if any are Doctor Who fans, but the really long, WIP Visited by a Doctor manages to explore Doctor Who expanded universe thoroughly, and to delve deeply into all the adventures of all the Doctors. And the Harry is smart, but not OP. There's eventually a Harry/Daphne relationship, but it's not romantic and "true love", etc. It's more realistic than that and isn't really a huge part of the entire story. Also, the story is mostly gen with a greater focus on DW than HP. There are some side stories and a sequel, even though the main story is a WIP.\\

Status; WIP; 45 chapters and counting

Kirby Lane

Harry finds an injured Snape on his doorstep and must hide him from the Dursleys. To complicate matters, a series of strange dreams portends a frightening future unless the two can find a way to work together.

My comments; The story's best point is that it's realistic. Snape and Harry don't just bond together in the beginning; their relationship blooms over relatable circumstances. Even then, their constant bickering is ever present. Apart from that, the compelling plot and snarky humor just make my day. A must read.

In this fic, the number of magical children are slowing declining in number (less magical children are being born each year and admitted to Hogwarts. So, McGonagall asks him to investigate, but Harry ends up dying when the wards in Diagon Alley stop working (due to a lack of magic they use to power themselves). Anyway, he gets transported to an alternate universe where Neville is the BWL, and has to survive where he has no family connections. It's a pretty good fic, as the interactions are realistic and it's pretty engaging.

  Magic is an eco-system, and the magical world has been culling magical people and creatures for generations. It has finally gone too far - and the collective consequences are finally being felt. When magic starts disappearing, crumbling quietly in post-war Britain, it causes a cascade effect across the wizarding world. Not a single magical child has been born in almost a decade.Twenty-three-year-old Harry Potter discovers this when the wards of Diagon Alley literally come crashing down on top of him. So ends the life of the Boy-Who-Lived. Yet again, he returns to the station between life and death.With a new chance in a new world, Harry - now eleven-year-old Harry Fleamont - is given a chance to figure out how to save his dying world. In a new world that seems much more perfect in every sense of the word, Harry is faced with a growing threat from a much more dangerous Voldemort, and the reality that jumping universes just makes vulnerable and poor wizards who just want to eat a regular meal and afford to buy a pair of Merlin-damned socks.

The start of the story is that Snape is sent to live as Dudley after an accident with some accidental magic and trust between him and Harry occurs as part of this. And this is not even the interesting part of the story. No no no. It's not some big Snape and Harry mentor fic with Snape swooping in, there's gradual character development. But the story is really that It's gets to be Harry's fifth year and Umbridge is being cruel, Harry is having blackouts and all while, people are mysteriously disappearing from Hogwarts Are these all related? We don't know! This story is just so well developed from characters to plot, and has so many cliffhangers.It's been a great mystery to read. The author updates religiously every Tuesday and Friday and leaves you excitedly waiting.

** Decided to go through all of the endless7 Harry Potter work.

I like most of it primarily for the melancholy and sadness Harry has. Harry potter I feel is at his best when sombre. It contracts with the ridiculousness of the setting as well as grounds his heroism into a mantle forced upon him rather than a choice.

The very real attempt to breath life into quidditch is something I really like without the constant need to play snarky with how terrible it is in concept. It's something Harry can actually be good at and live a life not with a further continuation of violence, struggle and despair that his life would be as an auror.

The second Gabrielle one the shorter isn't great definitely weaker then the first, but I also really liked the Luna one for its attempt to keep his marriage with Ginny clearly a mutual failure based on an inability to communicate.

The Gabrielle love interest story I really like also because it feels very natural. His slow easing off of Daphne and her quiet disappointed conversation is also something I liked. It's at times plodding and Harry can be a little over the top flirty but it does something most fics don't:

Harry seems like a decent person, and realistically likeable.

Titus is seemingly an endless7 of but he's very necessary in that he's what Ron should have been. An equal that Harry can talk to.

I found this fiction while looking for Ron Weasley centric fanfiction. It's quite good. Love the author's writing. The author put the genre as suspense & hurt/comfort; but i think he/she should put horror.. haha but it got a happy ending. Don't worry. Just don't read this in midnight like me because I can't sleep afterward LOL..still have the adrenaline.. I'm such a scaredy-cat xD

** Title: before the door of hell lamps burned

Author: basketofnovas

Rating: T

Pairing(s): Harry Potter/Cho Chang

This fic caught my eye earlier in the month and I've just finished reading the latest update. This is an AU of book five where Harry goes to live with Sirius in the summer following POA and Pettigrew is en route to Azkaban. The characterizations of everyone are spot-on and I love experiencing Harry find a home with Sirius. The author expands on the Black family lore and we get insight into Sirius's relationships with the Black sisters growing up. I particularly enjoyed the author's characterization of Bellatrix. She's more fleshed out as a person and her reasons for joining up with Voldemort are less clear-cut than in canon.

I suspect that there may be more cliches here than I realize because most Voldemort centered fic is Harry/Voldemort which has always been a non-starter for me. Well, even if so, this one is well-written and has a fun Indiana Jones thing going as alt-Tom rushes off from time-to-time for various exotic tomb raiding magical archaeological adventures to uncover the secrets of his crazy elder self.

Rating: T

Status: Completed

Summary: Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.

Extra Notes: There are a few grammar mistakes here and there, but according to the author they have Dyslexia, which really, for having it, their grammar mistakes aren't as much. Enjoyable read so far. Has a lot of boxes checked off that I wish more authors did with the characters.

  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.  That's the tea.

** This week I stumbled into two of the very /very/ few 10/10 fanfics I've ever read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing]]

A series of snips detailing a world in which Riddle is sorted into Gryffindor rather than Slytherin. He's still a violent megalomaniac, but embraces his half-blood nature rather than pretending to be a pureblood.

Equal parts brilliant, touching, and unnerving, this story is poetic, both in its deft use of language and in the way it gives us an impressionistic view of this world through short snips rather than a full, plodding narrative.

On a completely different note, there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][Second String]].

Harry "survives" the Dementor's Kiss the summer before his 5th year and finds himself transported back to the 1970's.

While it starts with the unreadably tiresome trope "omg I can't change the timeline!!!" it quickly morphs into a story of unexpected mentorship, surrogate family, and Harry flinging himself headlong at danger.

The writing easily qualifies as professional-level with only the tiniest of missteps here and there. It's exciting, heartwarming, and often feels like a better read than many "real" books I've paid good money for. Given how much I disliked Books 5-7 in canon, I think I'm going to take PS through GoF, followed by The Second String as my personal headcanon of Harry's real adventure.

** I'm rereading curse of fate where Harry is a vampire and went back in time. He pretends to be Voldemort and gains control of his followers. It's Harry Potter/Lucius Malfoy rated M. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2703901/1/curse-of-fate]]
