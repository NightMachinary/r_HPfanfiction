So this is definitely my favorite fan fic of all time. I've read this since I was a teen. It's a great story that's actually really well done and very in depth. The paring is tonks/harry. Yes I know the age gap but hey when you've faced Voldemort twice and been through the shit that he has it's ok. It takes place immediately post OOTP. Harry takes control of his life and tonks helps him. I really like this one because it goes really in depth to the mechanics of magic and protection. I forget what's cannon and what's not. Jk Rowling has read this one as well. Well here it is and I hope you enjoy.

** this is a 15 year old fic that has aged horribly and already gets posted here weekly, if not more frequently.

*** But I have to ask you, why do you think it has aged horribly? I'm not looking to start anything just genuinely curious.

** I agree, that it's aged badly. I don't really know why. I suppose it's like with movies like Top Gun, Commando... good when I saw them the first time. Not nearly as good now. It might just be a case of people growing up...
