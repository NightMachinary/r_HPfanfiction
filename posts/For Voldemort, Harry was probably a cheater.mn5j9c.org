I just thought about something, for Voldemort, Harry must have been the most infuriating thing possible. He is that kid in the playground that always invent to new rule when he starts to lose, except Harry does it "for real" :

- Be Voldemort, Dark Lord of the verge of conquering Magical Britain. Hear about a prophecy, beginning talked how a baby that could kill you is just born, didn't hear the rest.
- No problem go kill baby. . . and baby appears to be the first person in history to survive the Killing Curse. Also just lost body, wraith life.
- 10 years later, manage to possess someone and infiltrate a school to steal a artefact. Baby is there . . . and he has a burning touch. Lost host, back to wraith.
- 3 years later, finally got a body. Kid is there and can't burn anymore, time to kill . . . and now he summon the ghost of dead people and use them to escape.
- 1 year later, maybe the end of the prophecy say something important, time to hear it. Find cool connection with kid, use it to get the prophecy. . . plan failed, prophecy destroyed and now connection hurt.
- 2 years later, kid doesn't have any more protections, time to kill it (again). Use other wand to not summon dead people . . . his wand turns into a laser gun with auto aim, fucking cheater.
- Same year, got a cool new wand to finally kill him. Use strongest spell against one he learnt in 2nd year . . . his spell beat yours. You die because the wand he never touched decided he was the boss.
- Be dead

No matter what Voldemort did, Harry always had a way to survive/ escape (pretty much always deus ex machina). I kinda understand his obssession with killing him at the end.

- He killed a 60 feet snake with a sword, surviving a "mortal" injury because a bird cried on him
- He learnt a spell difficult to adults while in 3rd year (driving off a hundred dementor with his first try, while most struggle with one)
- He outflew a Dragon

His two friends have superpowers too (being brains and common sense) and get into their fair share of crazy situations, but in the end, he Magic Kung Fu's his way to victory while they're incapacitated or holding the line elsewhere.

** - Your lieutenant mentions an incredibly talented half-blood in Hogwarts. Always have a spot for the smarter ones do you? Oh, he got a bad breakup from a Muggleborn he fancied? The more reason for him to dedicate for the cause. Too bad from the self-fulfilling prophecy he told you, his request for sparing the Muggleborn, and up to the very last act he did, all contributes to your downfall.

- Your lieutenant provides you his home for keeping prisoners and holding meetings. Great! They can't possibly lose wandless prisoners and failed to keep beaten-up teens from escaping. Oh, the elf who served for his family has OP-magic.

- /Seven/ Horcruxes. No one is going to figure out you even have one. Except for your old head of house that is. And the very same lieutenant who carelessly gave it away. At least that cave is safe, what do you mean /another/ elf took it away with OP-magic, and after serving a muggle-hating family for decades he'd spill the secret to a trio of Muggleborn, half-blood, and Muggle-loving teens?

- Well at least that boy is dead. Surely you can trust the wife of that lieutenant to verify that, a quick severing charm to the neck will do if he still actually survived AK all this time. Right, she lied to protect her baby boy.

Voldemort would be ruling Magical Britain if he just killed Lucius in their first meeting.

- Sent his house elf to protect Harry with orders to paint himself as an abusive owner.
- Made it unbearably obvious to anyone who looked that the Minister was corrupt. Practically had a neon sign saying 'Remove him from office' floating over Fudges head.

Tom Riddle's scheme is to bring down purebloods supremacy using Voldemort to discredit pureblood supremacy while legislating it out of existence as Thomas Gaunt. Severus Snape is spying on the Circle of Agastya (a cabal of dark mages who hunt down dark lords) for Thomas Gaunt, spying on the Death Eaters for the Circle of Agastya, spying on Dumbledore for the Death Eaters, and spying on the Death Eaters (again) for Dumbledore.

Malfoy being able to competently act alone on his own plots suggests that Riddle wasn't as active in binding the second generation of Slytherins to him. Or maybe he stopped making Horcruxe appetizers out his soul.

It kinda reminds me of the nice, happy moments I felt while watching any of the Fantastic Beasts movies, where I idly wondered about American and British magical espionage. I like that we can see how Grindelwald (and Dumbledore) reshaped the WW, that Tom Riddle continued their plot.

To be honest this one's on Voldemort, he was very lackluster and melodramatic with his horcruxes, and his (and the evil pureblood supremacists' in general) tendency to underestimate small, unimportant and shabby people and creatures such as house elves is a big moral theme of the books.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Honestly im surprised voldemort didnt cut Harry's head off in the forest then toss it at the defenders when he came to brag. Thats if you accept him being a showboat who wants to silence rumors of him being afraid of/weaker than Harry, or whatever nonsense protagonists say to bait the villian, way back when he got rezzed in 4th year. His baby wouldnt die to the killing curse, he had the protection in first year, you got the cocky "i can touch you now" phase out the way, he bullshits his way out an ambush with ghosts a rare wand effect and some quick thinking. At that point id respect him on a level where not only is he a maybe threat, but also a rat to the highest degree, which was showed in voldemorts thinking of needing the full prophecy to get answers. The whole ministry battle was a big L that im not going to touch, but now id be setting up to get PERMANENTLY get rid of him at the earliest opportunity.

*** Books 6 and 7 weren't magical. They were McGuffin hunts that dragged out endlessly. They were about things, not spells or people. That massive tonal shift ruined those books for me. They're not fun or interesting. Book 5 is kinda borderline. I really only like the ending, the last 15-20% of the book, because the rest is annoying teenage angst and whining more than anything. Books 1-4 are magical fairy tales about wizards and witches in school, but the rest are kinda trash.

***** While Harry Potter develops a tone oriented more towards young adults in later books, it's still a fairy tale at its core and as rudimentary as you might think the conflict may be, the moral superiority is there. Just think: Harry loves people and he is loved, while Voldemort is feared and loves himself. Harry accepts death as a natural thing and is rewarded for that, while Voldemort tries to cheat death by defying the laws of nature and is punished for that.

******** How do those points indicate that Harry has virtue or accepts death or whatever? All that they indicate is that he had dead parents, and that the author didn't have a plausible way for him to defeat someone 6 times his age and therefore had to resort to bullshit deus ex machinae that had no buildup or basis in the story. They certainly had nothing to do with Harry's innate value, character, or actions.

Keep in mind that your initial argument is "The protagonist overcomes the antagonist not through strength, but through superior morality or wits" and that has NOTHING to do with HP. He doesn't win through morality or wits; he wins because the author says so. I think the only time he wins through morality is when he's possessed by Voldemort in book 5, where his personality is what drives V out. That was the only victory that depended on the character as written rather than some extra thing the author threw in at the last minute.

Even the final deus ex machina, where Harry kills Voldemort because the Elder Wand recognizes him as master, is bullshit. Harry "won" the wand by shooting Draco in the back when Draco wasn't even wielding the wand, yet after that Voldemort flat-out KILLED Harry and yet the wand didn't change alliegance to him.
