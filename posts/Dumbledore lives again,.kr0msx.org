When he regains consciousness, he finds out he's a baby again and back in time.

What would he do?


** First, growing a little, you can't do much when you're a little baby.

Joke aside, he could start protecting his sister from the three muggles attacking her, thus preventing his father from being sent to Azkaban.

After that, tere's the whole Grindelwald part.He could be more cautious around Gellert, maybe trying to temper the man and his world domination plans.

If it doesn't work, only one thing left : beating the crap out of dear Gellert before he start being a real threat.

Then, maybe he would get Tommy out of the orphanage ; even better, he could find Merope before she gives birth to her son, and raise the baby as his own family.

If that doesn't work, he should stop him before there's too much losses.

â€‹

There's so many possibilities, it could work, but it could also backfire severely.

Changing anything from Dumbledore's past has the potential to wreck the entire plot :

- If Albus protects his sister from the Muggles, his father doesn't go to Azkaban and Albus isn't treated as an outsider when he arrives at Hogwarts (which may change his relation with Elphias Doge).
- If Ariana isn't "ill", she doesn't kill her mother and Albus doesn't have to return home after his 7th Year to take care of the family, letting him go to a world trip and thus, not meeting Grindelwald.
- If Albus manage to stop Grindelwald before he does too much damages (either by vanquishing him or convincing him), he isn't treated as a "Saviour" like in Canon and may have less powers.
- Finding Tom Riddle earlier than in Canon may ends up with a magically raised Voldemort, just as ambitious but without the problem of being a thought Muggleborn.

Why let it get to that point? Find a way to rescue Merope from the Gaunts. Tom is never a thing.
