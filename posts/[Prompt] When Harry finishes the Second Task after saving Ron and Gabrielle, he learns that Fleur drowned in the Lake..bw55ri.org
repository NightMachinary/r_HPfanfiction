** The Beauxbatons students spent their remaining few days at Hogwarts huddled in tight group's whispering or they were found in unexpected corners of empty classrooms staring off into space,not saying a word. Madam Maxim was forever in the Three Broomsticks,downing Firewhiskey after Firewhiskey and not caring what anyone thought.It was almost a certainty she would lose her position. The Hogwarts and Durmstang students attempted to get on with their lives but it was immensely complicated.

Roger Davies missed classes and could be found kneeling in front of the bush he and Fleur had been kissing in on the night of the Ball. Most of the other Ravenclaws were extremely worried about his mental health and one night,Stephen Cornfoot gathered every sharp object in Roger's dormitory and disposed of it.

Hogwarts would close tomorrow while an investigation into the death of the young girl took place. Most of the students spent the evening huddled in their common rooms talking about the poor dead girl. Harry had received a detention from a volatile Snape and was walking back to the tower with sagged shoulders.

" Potter ! It was Professor Moody." I need some help clearing out my classroom before we all have to leave "

Harry shrugged lackadaisically " Sure "
