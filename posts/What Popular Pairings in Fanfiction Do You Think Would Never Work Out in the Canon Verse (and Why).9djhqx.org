Besides, Snape also lies to his other DE followers, and to the light side. There's lies within lies with Snape. The only one who gets the truth from him is Dumbledore, otherwise, everyone else gets different lies.

I feel like this involves a pretty high emotional intelligence level, high enough to read delicate social situations and know what to say when. And all this while being under a tremendous amount of stress.

The studies I read showed that even in the cases where lying was understood, there were still some issues with how far the complexity of it could go and how it was employed.

** Harry/Daphne, Harry/Tracey, or Harry/practically every Slytherin. This is mostly because Harry is constantly pitted against /almost/ exclusively Slytherins, and he has a tendency to take things exactly as they appear except when he doesn't like them.

Harry/Draco is worse than Harry/Snape, which would also never happen. Draco never really had any significant redemeptive qualities; he was just a stuck-up ponce who got slapped by the real world hard. Snape at least did /something/ redeemable, regardless of everything else. Still an arse though.

Harry/any woman with a bigger than five year age gap. This is less of a gripe and more of an observation that most relationships in magical Britain seem to be rooted especially in /people you interacted with at Hogwarts/. Its not an exagerration to say Hogwarts is probably the defining period for most of their lives (it is awesome after all), and the friends they make their tend to stay with them for a long time. Even Bill met Fleur at Hogwarts after graduating five or six years later. Remus and Tonks are weird though in almost every way, so I say they get a pass.

Hermione/Draco is even less likely than Harry/Draco, and Harry's not gay in canon. They have nothing in common aside from being occasionally stuck-up, and that is a relationship doomed for implosion.

Dumbledore/anybody is to muddied by the Grindelwald situation.

Hermione/Sirius has ironically similar issues to Hermione/Draco, though I could maybe see Hermione/Remus as a long shot. Outsiders comforting one another and so on.

Ginny/any Slytherin is also to screwed up by her past with Tom's Diary and her rather competitive nature in general (i.e. Quidditch). If we're getting down to it, every boy she dated was a quidditch supporter/player, and it seems like the game was very much central to making or breaking each relationship.

Harry/Gabrielle has the problem that she has Ginny's crush with none of the shyness. Shyness is endearing in its own way I suppose, however awkward, but Harry never really reacts well when others try to get his attention. I guess he needs to move at his own pace.

Harry/Voldemort needs no explanation. Ditto for Harry/Narcissa or Harry/Bellatrix.

**** Its not really about their tastes though. Its about Harry's. In canon, Harry is pretty much a skin deep thinker. He pretty much takes everything /exactly/ as it appears, and whenever his head is forcefully shoved into the dirty truth he turns into a mopey angsty wreak.

Harry is the most prejudiced towards Slytherin's out of all the trio, though I can somewhat understand his viewpoint (Hagrid muddied the waters right off the bat in Diagon Alley after all). He could never really accept a Slytherin like that. Besides, as Hermione points out a lot of the halfbloods are probably just pretending to be purebloods (HBP). She could have been more prejudiced than Draco, just not as open about it.

Point is, doesn't matter how she was, Slytherin was never an option for Harry in canon. He's never even comfortable with Slughorn, even if the man is mostly harmless and did far more than many of the non-Slytherin characters to help out. He is, to put it bluntly, prejudiced.

I think this is a difficult point to argue for or against. The fact of the matter is, JKR describes very few meaningful interactions with Slytherins outside of Malfoy and company, and only ever describes those interactions in terms of conflict.

The HP series isn't a first person narrative. Harry doesn't describe his thoughts and feelings directly to the reader, and the narrator's descriptions of people and events shouldn't be treated like a window into Harry's mind. Harry treats the Slytherins he encounters canonically as antagonists because they invariably behave antagonistically. We don't know how he interacts with or thinks about the likes of Tracy Davis or Daphne Greengrass, because no interactions or thoughts are ever described in the original heptalogy.

That Snape is a better person than Draco doesn't make him a more likely love interest.

1. He hates James Potter. Harry is supposed to resemble james.

2. He was supposedly in love with Harry's mother, which would make it incredibly creepy and weird.

3. He's the same age as Harry's parents. There's no indication he's some kind of pedophile.

4. He's Harry's teacher, which would make any relationship even more predatory than it already is, more than just because of the age difference.

Draco has none of these issues. He could conceivably fall in love at first sight and turn his live around at the age of 11 in order to be with Harry. Yeah that's incredibly unlikely, but any relationship between Harry and Snape is a complete non-starter from the outset (before Harry is even born).

Isn't that beside the point? He's certainly not doing it because he had some kind of revelation about Voldemort's political platform. If he indeed didn't even love Lily properly (a interpretation that I agree with) and he still does these things which are extremely detrimental to his future well being... doesnt that make the notion that Draco could defy his father for love (or even just infatuation) seem reasonable?

People change, often significantly.

It's quite common for adults to completely repudiate their teenage beliefs or that of their parents. The millions who defied their religious fundamentalist parents to read Harry Potter is just one such example.

Oftentimes, converts make the best fanatics. Paul had enthusiastically persecuted Christians for the longest time before becoming its greatest champion. Gunter Grass and Hans-Dietrich Genscher were both former SS members, but became top anti Nazi advocates in Germany after the war. Millions of Germans shared similar experiences.

In Draco's situation, he was already questioning Death Eater's cause before the end of DH. His side was then completely and utterly defeated and discredited. His formerly beloved father was exposed as a cowardly and weak traitor. He himself was saved by the mercy of his former enemies. And you think someone going through that would not change or question their entire life up to this point?

I reject the notion that people cannot change, and I see Draco having a high probability of fully repudiating his past and working for the new cause.

But at the end of the day he tried to murder various people, nearly killed Katie Bell, and got marked. So yeah, I understand why people side eye his redemption arc, especially as he never even served time for his crimes. Frankly, his redemption arc would have made more sense if he spent a few years in prison and then was on parole.

And it's not narrow minded to write people off when they cross a certain line. There's a difference between a racist person who uses racist terminology, and someone who joins a hate group or commits violent crimes based on someone being a different religion or color or sexuality.

And a lot of things are plot dependent. If you are asking 'what relationships would have worked keeping mostly canon events' I point you to the any number of canon rehashes out there.

*** For me H/G always seemed likely because they made such a big deal about her liking him through book 4. Narratively, it wouldn't have made much sense to keep harping on that. It also explains why Rowling made sure to frequently mention Ginny's dating life. If she never got with Harry, it would've been completely irrelevant to the story.

******* Well, the Magical World of 'Harry Potter' is in some aspects very different from our Muggle world:

- The wizarding world was very small, and Hogwarts was the ONLY magical school in Britain. The kids didn't have a lot of choices unless they were willing to marry Muggles or foreigners.
- Harry's generation was further bonded by the War. Most named characters in the Books went through hell and back together, and you think they were your AVERAGE high school teens?
- In case of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, they were best friends and war comrades whose relationships were closer than the greatest majority of your average high schoolers could possibly imagine.
- Ron and Hermione relationship might not have worked in a real world Muggle environment, but their special circumstances and their deeply forged bond would make their relationship withstand strains far greater than normal couples.

**** Popular blank slate pairing character for harry in fanfiction, generally used to add a slytherin perspective to Harry's headstrong nature and make him slow down and think things through. Most fics with that pairing also use the whole Ancient and Noble Houses etc. etc. cliche and do a lot of politics. Fairly common for dumbles to be either manipulative greater good!dumbledore or evil!dumbledore who is hiding harry's heritage from him.

​

Often includes weasley-bashing too or at the very least Ron being extremely distrustful and often going off in a snit and not talking to the group for a while.

​

Most stories involving her start either in book 4 with her helping him with the tournament or in books 1-3 with Harry finding a marriage contract when he goes to gringotts (side order of helpful goblin cliche is quite common too). Occasionally you'll have book 5 with her helping him learn occlumency in exchange for favours (example: linkffn(Grass is Always Greener by kb0)

Draco is a wizard racist and even white Hermiones are seen by his kind as subhuman.

Everything that annoys Hermione about Ron are qualities and behaviours that Harry exhibits too, it's just that narrator Harry doesn't talk about them as much and when we see him is a bit more timid after the way he was raised.

#+begin_quote
  Once a well know ballet dancer in St. Petersburg, Victor Nikiforov finds himself exiled to Sakhalin Island as a political convict in 1881. As a man sentenced to katorga he will never return to European Russia or his life on the stage. Known as the "Edge of the World," his life on Sakhalin could not be further from the life he once knew. Strange circumstances lead his path to cross that of a young Japanese man, one of the very few still living on the island. Katsuki Yuuri leads a life of exile of a different kind, one that is largely self-imposed. Drawn to each other, despite their differences, something slowly begins to grow between them. When a narrowly avoided tragedy leaves them stranded together for a long, cold Sakhalin winter, they are challenged to face what their relationship really means, and what future it could possibly have.

Draco's honestly not even much of a bully in it either. He spends most of the book looking sick, concerned, and afraid. Even at the end, I felt a lot of sympathy for him. Harry is a pretty empathetic guy (until he isnt). Again, it's possible that he would try to help Malfoy in some way or another.

He was ignoring obvious come-ons because he's an awkward teenager, he was following Malfoy and thinking about him because he was convinced from nearly the beginning of the book that Malfoy was on a mission from Voldemort. None of that alludes in ANY WAY to romance.

I wasnt saying you said they were exclusively straight, calm down. I was simply pointing out that their sexuality is never explicitly stated in canon (yes, I know they both married women canonically. My uncle Chris was married 20 years and had 4 kids before coming out. What I mean to say is it's not impossible to be closeted for so long).

I think Sirius would need someone who would give him plenty of space, but Hermione would be intense and demanding and have quite distinct expectations. Sirius would kick back against those demands. I love him but I think it is in his nature to be quite cruel. It would be just awful and cause terrible divisions among their mutual friends.

** Harry and Hermione is the obvious one. They're both far too intense. Neither have a chill option. Its why Ron and Hermione work so well together, they balance each other. Over the series we see Ron mellow out. Without Ron Hermione burns out. Without Hermione Ron takes everything too easily. Hermione in canon is annoying. She is an annoying know it all with a spiteful streak. Ron grows to admire that. For all Hermione claims about Ron lacking emotional understanding she's just as bad. Harry and Hermione is a blow up waiting to happen. Neither like being told what to do whereas Ron minds less. Ron is okay with playing second fiddle by the end of the series and while Harry claims to want to avoid attention equally won't let someone do something he could do to make it easier for a friend. Ginny is far more relaxed than Hermione. She is also in the perfect window for Harry where she knows most of what happened by being on the edge of events but not being so involved that she's not a breath of fresh air and an escape from what happened. She doesn't have to push him for information but she would be a willing listener for anything he wants to tell her. Ginny could listen and withhold judgement. Hermione likes to let everyone know how she has judged something.

Snape/anyone is something I struggle with. Everything I've seen shows him as an arse of the highest order. Other people can see it differently and they are welcome to but I don't see it and I very much doubt I will.

I guess I could also throw in every slash pairing that we have canon evidence the character doesn't swing that way but I've never bothered to think about the personality match ups much.

For me any eventual pairing with Harry is either going to be supportive, either Ginny or a Hufflepuff, or it would be someone a bit colder and more distant. Harry has never really experienced love so perhaps he would feel smothered by affection and prefer a more hands off relationship which is why I could see a post-Hogwarts relationship with a former slytherin work out. Hermione smoothers without providing emotional support.

*** I don't really see these. Hermione is pretty clearly shown to understand people's emotions, most especially Harry's (see OoTP, it's not even disputable there with like three major instances of it in that book alone). If anything, the series does the old trope of "Girls grok emotions, boys are emotional idiots". Ron hates being told what to do, especially by Hermione; I don't see him being any different than Harry in that regard. And when did Ron start being okay with playing second fiddle? Wasn't that the main grievance he had with Harry and part of why he left? I mean, all the things the Locket Riddle said were variations on "You're of secondary importance".

​

The only thing I think I agree with there is that H/Hr involves two people who are very stubborn and intense. But that's pretty evenly counterbalanced by the understanding they have of each other, it's not much on its own. Relationships aren't about finding your opposite or whatever (it's too vague a concept anyway). Making things work - yes, /making/ them, they never come flawlessly, sorry romance stories - involves a helluva lot of developing a fundamental understanding of the other person, flaws and all. Definitely not saying they'd be perfect (whatever that means), but they're pretty compatible by the end.

***** The way I've always seen it is that Ron and Hermione may be okay together as a short fling while they're teenagers, but as lifelong partners, Hermione would be much better with Harry. Once they've both mellowed out and aren't stressed 24/7, their issues would be pretty minimal. They're extremely loyal to each other, can actually have fun if Harry isn't under stress (for example, the segment in HBP where they laugh together at the thought of Filch and Pince bangin), they both have the confidence that wouldn't lead to any jealousy or insecurity (which R/Hr would lead to). It wouldn't be perfect, but they go together very nicely once they've grown up.

****** Ron and Hermione is definitely a case for teen romance and it completely makes sense in that context. They have the whole opposites attract thing (which is super fun at first but not so fun in a serious relationship) which leads to sexual tension. They are the only two people who have the unique position of Harry's close confidants. They spend the most time with each other if not with Harry. So yeah, I can see why it went that way. However I think it would be challenging if not impossible to maintain outside of a short fling because they are just so different. Hermione is an ambitious activist and Ron on more than one occasion has shown he's more into the settled family life.

Harry and Ginny I could see maybe more functional as a long-term couple, but that really is just because Ginny isn't that developed as a character to imagine otherwise. The only problems I could see them running into is maybe being TOO much alike. They're both very heady and passionate, whereas I think Hermione's logical planning side is the perfect counterbalance to Harry's brash impulsiveness.

Because like I said, they would work wonderfully together as adults and if Hermione's marriage was having issues, she may gradually find interest in someone else, whether she wants that or not.

I think Ron has been shown to want a lot out of life, but he prefers to not bang his head into a wall until it caves. Hermione needs someone that can take the edge off. Someone that can make her laugh or can make her feel like a kid again. As JK Rowling has said, Ron has a good sense of business and turned WWW into an even bigger operation than it was under Fred and George. And I doubt Ron would want a /big/ family considering his upbringing, but he's definitely family-oriented, as is Hermione by how much she loved the Burrow.

I think all four of them ended up as busy-bodies as adults. Ginny on the go as a Quidditch player, Harry as an Auror and then Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Ron as a businessman, and Hermione as a politician.

I think going into business shows that he's more interested in managing his own affairs and isolating himself from those issues, which possibly burnt him out during the war. Hermione and Harry jumped right into the thick of it after the war, with Harry being an Auror and Hermione managing the administrative law side (which is an extension of what I said earlier as Harry being the fighter and Hermione being the planner). I guess that doesn't necessarily HAVE to mean they are better suited to each other, but that I just find them to be better matched for that reason.

I think that's just how it always was. If you look back from the second book, Ron only ever cared about helping his friends. After the chess game, it was never about stopping Voldemeort but about supporting Harry and Hermione and being there for them. He went into the forbidden forest to support Harry and help find a way to unpetrify Hermione. He went into the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. He stood up to Sirius to protect Harry. He nearly started a fight with Karkaroff for giving Harry a low score. He went to the DoM to support his friends. He even went on the horcrux hunt to help Harry and Hermione when he could have been safe at Hogwarts, well-fed and protected by his pureblood status.

Ron's just always been the type to protect those close to him and say "Screw everybody else, they're not my problem." Never one for the grandiose of heroism.

Hermione wanted a distraction to get them out of their sticky situation (and to prevent Harry getting cruciated), and it's fairly obvious she didn't think it through - she seemd pretty surprised to see Grawp. I think you're romanticising that friendship a bit too much, mate. This isn't this oh-so-beautiful revenge act that you're presenting.

Also, dismissing it as an idiot ball is also taking away an important part of her. Her obsessions getting in the way of her otherwise tactful and rational self is an important part of her character; something that makes her more human, even. Remember that she was rather nasty to Luna in the beginning of fifth year (at the age of [almost?] 16, btw.), just because Luna clashed so much with Hermione's attitude towards the more... esotheric stuff.

Also, she must have been fed up with Harry's theories (they thought Snape was the bad guy in first year and it turned out they were wrong), so she must have thought 'not again'. But people interpret things differently. It's also the same year she refused to help Hagrid (Aragog's funeral), maybe she's just had enough.

All he does is open the door because he is shocked she is there. It's only when Ginny reminds him why he wasn't possessed that he begins to feel better.

It's fairly well established in canon that Hermuione and Harry have an older sister/younger brother dynamic. Harry literally tells Ron this in DH. Hermione is a nag and constantly bullies her opinions on Harry, who prefers to escape her rather than argue the point. Ron, meanwhile, enjoys arguing with Hermione. During OOTP, Harry is really annoyed by their incessant bickering, but when he calls them out on it, they are genuinely surprised as they themselves clearly don't mind arguing with each other.

The thing with Harry is he really needs someone to back him up and empathize with him. Hermione has very strong emotional intelligence when it comes to analyzing things from an outside perspective but can fail to exhibit that intelligence when it directly involves her. Take the scene in HBP with the potions book. Harry nearly kills Draco and feels awful about it. At that moment, instead of comforting him, Hermione chooses to rub it in how she was right about the book. It's more about her feeling vindicated as still the smartest witch instead of understanding what Harry is experiencing. But Ginny senses this and defends him to Hermione.

That said, you don't need to convince me about HBP. The problem with that book is how OOC everyone is, especially Harry and Hermione. Harry had just torn apart Dumbledore's office in anger and despair but he seems to get over it far too quickly (a few weeks, I think). Then half the year is spent on a poorly constructed set of romance subplots and people all of a sudden giving Draco the benefit of the doubt. Elsewhere Hermione was as comforting as you'd expect (GoF when everyone's against Harry, OoTP when Harry's pissed about people's reaction to his claim that Voldemort is back, the scene at the grave of the Potters, etc.) One of the reasons I don't go reread HBP very often...

And yes I know Harry says that in DH. But JKR has been clear on this afterwards, she considered pairing Harry and Hermione after Ron left. But because she didnt, she needed to give an explanation for why they didn't. They obviously understand each other well, they're good friends most of the time. So that's really the best way to allay Ron's fears and sum up his feelings for her in canon.

Regarding Rowling almost putting them together, I interpret that as more of a "here's a unique situation where any two random people might find themselves getting together" rather than it saying something specifically about Harry and Hermione. I think if she actually went that route, it would've basically destroyed all characterization and plot development up until that point. Personally, I don't believe she ever genuinely considered pairing them after Ron left, and her writing reflects that since they barely interacted. She probably had the thought enter her mind simply because of the situation, then realized others could interpret the situation that way, so she deliberately wrote everything after to assure both herself and the reader that there was no chance in hell.

I don't really see how it would have destroyed their characterization though. Nothing about them getting together seems to entail a shift in their personality or something. Them not interacting initially was about the raw feelings of how Ron left. We know Hermione was attracted to Ron, and on top of them being without a real plan it was too much for both of them initially. Granted, you'd need to be delicate if you insisted on doing this as it could derail the plot of their attraction becomes the focus instead of a layer that influences how things play out.

But here's my point on that: For 6 and 1/2 books, we have been set up to believe Harry and Hermione work as a brother/sister type friendship. At no point do either of them express or otherwise show actual feelings or attraction to each other. Rowling has also clearly set up Ginny and Ron as their partners. So to pair Harry and Hermione in that moment would fly in the face of all of that plot and character development. Also, for the story, it would really create issues. How does this not basically ruin the friendship between Harry and Ron and Ron and Hermione? How does Ginny accept what Hermione and Harry did? Harry genuinely loves Ginny by this point and we can also presume the feelings are shared. After the dust settles, can you really picture them all going back to great friends with Harry and Hermione now dating? And if they don't date and just share a passionate one-off moment, how does that help the plot? That just creates a mess. Narratively, pairing them just doesn't work.

*************** But that wasn't really set up in the first 6.5 books. Prior to the scene with the Locket, there just wasn't a comment on it aside from drama drummed up by Skeeter. Neither of them commented on it either way (though Harry's "I don't think you're ugly" line is a hoot, I admit), leaving the reader to assume they were close friends. It wasn't until HBP that Harry - spontaneously - is attracted to Ginny, and as I mentioned before, it's one of the really poorly done parts of that book. It drops out of nowhere and ends in less than a month due to the Hunt, so the later pining makes no sense with respect to a barely existent high school relationship. Ron and Hermione at least have the build up that hints at their mutual attraction, but it's almost entirely negative up to that point (HBP is just a lower point in that) which really ought to count against them working. And once Ron leaves, well, that's a perfectly sensible time to end it. It's a watershed moment in the trio's relationship and it cracks them apart from Ron (and to a smaller extent, from each other for a few weeks) and Hermione makes her choice even if it deeply wounds her. And we can't forget, the reason things led to Harry saying that are precisely because JKR decided not to pair them together. My suggestion isn't that there should be a total 180 in the direction of the writing. Prior to that (and especially in and after OoTP) it was perfectly possible for things to have gone differently.

​

Would they be great friends? I don't know, you'd have to handle it delicately. Here's the issue. With Ron's dramatic exit, it's hard to look kindly on him even if you can understand what led him to. The series pretty much didn't let him develop at all and that's a shame. I'm doing a crossover and it starts at this tail end of DH. My preferred way of handling it to make this pairing make sense at this time is that Ron basically has to grow up. Yeah, it's ass to lose a girl you have a crush on to your best friend but running out on them during a world-saving mission is much worse. When it comes down to it, he has to make the choice about whether their friendship matters more than the "betrayal" of them getting together. It would at least feel like he actually grew a bit if he got passed it, because in canon nothing Ron does is actively punished by the plot or themes. Everyone just gets over it after a few days anyway. I won't comment on Ginny because, as I said, it just didn't make sense to me (especially since Harry broke things off).

​

Sorry about the length, I'm trying to make it clearer if I failed to before.

  Ron hates being told what to do, especially by Hermione;
#+end_quote

He hates when he feels like she's talking down to him. All in all, he's like a puppy on a lead; doesn't really want to do what you tell him, but will anyways, because he's a good boy.

#+begin_quote
  I don't see him being any different than Harry in that regard.
#+end_quote

Harry is just rebellious in general, to pretty much anyone that tells him what to do. He's very instinct driven and relies on gut feelings and intuition to guide him. This is a complete contrast to Hermione, who is logical to a fault.

#+begin_quote
  And when did Ron start being okay with playing second fiddle? Wasn't that the main grievance he had with Harry and part of why he left?
#+end_quote

No. Ron never had a problem with Harry, but only ever Harry's circumstances. Harry stumbles into glory, which Ron doesn't blame him for, but just dislikes how it plays out, as he knows Harry is just a normal kid for the most part. His problem with playing second fiddle is that he feared that's all anyone would ever see; "Harry Potter's stupid friend". And above everyone else, he feared Hermione thinking of him as a consolation prize or second rate to Harry, because deep down he knows he's great in his own regard, but he doesn't think anyone will ever notice it as he constantly puts himself in the shadows of others.

I think H/Hr could work potentially, but there's not the emotional connected needed for two people to be in love and they'd end up like those two people at the neighbor's Christmas party who put on fake smiles and whisper harshly into each other's ears about how they'll "talk about this at home." I just see no way for these two to grow alongside each other, so they stay the same emotionally stunted teenagers they always were. And that just seems like a miserable existence to me.

#+begin_quote
  I think H/Hr could work potentially, but there's not the emotional connected needed for two people to be in love
#+end_quote

I don't agree with this, it seems exactly the opposite to me. A few examples come to mind:

-Hermione immediately knew Harry didn't enter himself into the TWT. Remember, even Dumbledore had to ask Harry directly if he entered (and almost certainly looked into his mind when he asked). But she says she knew instantly that couldn't be true where everyone else thought otherwise. That's a deep kind of trust that doesn't exist without strong emotional bonds.

-OoTP has several instances I could use, but the best is, I think, near the end. Harry wants to rush off to save Sirius but Hermione urges caution as she could see it being a ploy by Voldemort to exploit a weakness of his. All the others present - Ron, Neville, Ginny, Luna - just accept what Harry says more or less. And then she and Harry get into an argument about what they should do. Everyone else present is described as just watching them go at it, because they're just on a different level with each other (in terms of understanding the other). And despite what he thinks is happening to his last decent relative, he still listens to her and tries to verify if Sirius is at Number 12.

-DH probably has the best moments for this point, even despite the conflicts. The graveyard scene was rather powerful, I find it impossible to imagine anyone else there with him because of Hermione's consistency in standing with him when the chips were down. Much as in OoTP, she understands what he's lost, what he's feeling there and what he needs to hear.

As far as emotional connections go, I can't really see any other two people having as many examples as those two have.

You said that was his grievance with Harry, but his grievance with Harry was that they were sitting around twiddling their thumbs while his family was in danger and they no way to destroy the horcrux they had, nevermind the four they didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione immediately knew Harry didn't enter himself into the TWT.
#+end_quote

Because that's plain to see. It has nothing to do with an emotional connection. Ron was so caught up in his brooding that he refused to swallow his pride and think logically until actually seeing how dangerous the tournament was and realize that Harry's not the type to want to put himself in those kinds of situations.

#+begin_quote
  Remember, even Dumbledore had to ask Harry directly if he entered (and almost certainly looked into his mind when he asked).
#+end_quote

He calmly asked, as Dumbledore already knew that Harry didn't, but was simply asking for affirmation for the people in the room with them, like Snape , Moody, and Crouch.

#+begin_quote
  But she says she knew instantly that couldn't be true where everyone else thought otherwise.
#+end_quote

Because none of them know Harry. Harry really only has two friends that he interacts with regularly, and that's Ron and Hermione. He's more familiar with Hagrid than he is his own dorm mates.

#+begin_quote
  That's a deep kind of trust that doesn't exist without strong emotional bonds.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They're not though. In Goblet of Fire, Harry thinks about how he wishes he and Ron were on speaking terms because he didn't like hanging out with Hermione by himself because she's no fun and only tells him to do his homework. And aside from being an emotional cripple, Harry isn't very in tune with Hermione's emotions. The only time they're ever sympathetic to one another is when they're both experiencing the same jealousy over Ron and Ginny. And do you remember the weeks of silence when Ron left? She apparently wept for a week and Harry did nothing to comfort her. Harry and Hermione just don't work on their own.

You're not making sense. Your claim was that Harry and Hermione didn't have the necessary /emotional/ connection to have a good intimate relationship. So I gave examples of how they do. That response was utterly irrelevant.

You might want to recall why that happened. Namely, the wreck that was the Horcrux hunt and Ron's abandonment. If Harry and Hermione don't work because of that then Ron and Hermione (who spend a significant part of the series actively antagonizing each other) must, by your logic, be impossible to work.

#+begin_quote
  That's called empathy for a seventeen year old boy with the weight of the world on his shoulders that is standing in front of the graves of the parents that were taken away from him.
#+end_quote

You don't seem to be able to stick to the points you made initially. It's easy to say that empathy is easy. But even in HP we have Ron routinely not able to understand Harry's situation because of his own jealousy and anger over his own circumstances. As I say, without being out of character there's really no one else in the story that could have worked in that scene besides Hermione. That's indisputable proof that they have a deep understanding of each other, something that was already clear in OoTP.

#+begin_quote
  So they have to be experiencing the same things to empathize with one another? Seems very egocentric.
#+end_quote

Are you serious? Hermione hadn't had a parent die so obviously I wasn't saying they had to experience the same thing to have empathy. My point was it's an intense moment that no other character could believably have taken her place in. It's (as JKR herself has said) a culmination of Hermione's tendency to stick with Harry no matter the circumstance or the distress he's in.

They had seen themselves at their best, and at their worst. You couldn't simply judge their relationships based on average high school couples. The bond they forged through this trial by fire would make their relationships withstand far greater strains than normal couples.

He needs someone who is incredibly patient with him, is his equal, and knows how to handle him. I think Hermione could fit a lot of that, but the problem is Harry simply doesn't like her like that and their personalities would clash way too much.

Hermione is also really tough to pair with anyone but Ron. Ron likes arguing with her and doesn't mind her bossiness. I just don't know of any other character who is happy to deal with that.

**** I'm not a huge R/Hr shipper and haven't really given them much thought as a couple so I could be way off on this, but I always thought that Hermione enjoyed arguing and enjoyed being right. She certainly came off as bossy to most students. She also liked a project. But we also know that Ron liked hanging out with her and they spent a lot of time together. He also clearly was attracted to her. So I have to imagine that since Ron and Hermione bickered a lot, but that they both still liked spending time together and were attracted to each other, that they actually did enjoy their dynamic.

I also think that Hermione liked Ron specifically because she was his better in certain aspects, and thus for someone who liked arguing and winning arguments, Ron was a good partner. She could control things a bit more, perhaps shape Ron into the man she wants him to be, and he'd be ok with that.

I don't think Hermione actually wants someone who is her equal at least in terms of intellect. Remember when Harry was besting her in potions; she was extremely jealous and resentful of the fact.

I say I can see Hermione with Ron over pretty much everyone else because no other character, Harry included, seemed to enjoy her argumentative style. I think that's key here because when arguing against Ron/Hermione since they argue, we are assuming that Hermione would not argue with others. But that's wrong. She enjoys arguing and proving herself right. It's part of her personality.

****** Eh, you could be right. I just know they spent a lot of time together, and argued a lot yet still were best friends. I don't see them as friends if Ron genuinely hated arguing with her.

But I also generally agree that couples that argue all the time are usually poor matches. Which means that Hermione would probably never have a good, long-lasting relationship since she likes to argue.

******* Might I add that Hermione probably likes to debate rather than argue. Arguing suggests they don't get along well. A heathly debate is probably a different story.

******* She doesn't like to argue per se, she argues when she perceives something as wrong. Which admittedly happens quite often, but she doesn't get off it.

She doesn't like to argue, she's just very opinionated and likes to express them. Ron takes these as nagging and that's why they argue alot. She just needs someone who shares most of her views on stuff.

So I agree with the person above that she'd fit more with a muggle or muggleborn because most of her views are basically comparisons to a more progressive muggle world. Most muggleborn would share those opinions with her.

*** I think Harry is easy to pair with most people, but the problem lies in that most people change him fundamentally to suit the interests of either themselves or the SO.

Though I agree with Ron and Hermione. You can see them shaping to conform to each other as the series goes on and I can't really picture them working out well with anyone else. If you look back at any argument they've had after the charms class incident, it's always a result of outside forces. First because of Scabbers and Crookshanks, then Harry's Firebolt, then Krum, then Lavender, then Harry and the Horcrux. Aside from that, they bicker, but that's just who they are.

** I know Sirius Remus is quite popular. But I doubt it could ever work out in canon, because I don't think Remus would ever be attracted to someone who used him to pull a prank on someone, it just doesn't sound like a healthy relationship to me. Also, Sirius tells in OOTP that James was the best friend he ever had. So James was his best friend, and for some reason he was sexually attracted to Remus? I don't think so.That paring always surprises me. The way Tonks is portrayed in this fandom reminds me of Sirius, and I don't like this at all.
