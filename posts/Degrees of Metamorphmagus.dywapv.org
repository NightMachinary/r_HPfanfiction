Metamorphmaguses/Metamorphmagi aren't really covered, but from the wiki I found that Tonk said she only had the ability to change her appearance, +where as the wiki says some can also completely change into animals...+ [[/u/aAlouda]] corrected me - I read the article wrong, whoops!

SOOOOOOOO

Does that mean that a metamorph could have a wide range of transformative abilities? Some can go full animal, some can change their gender, some just change their hair and eye color?

Just compiling fic ideas >.>


** While the wiki itself isn't trustworthy, it doesn't claim that some can turn into animals, in fact it accurately mentions that it wasn't revealed that they could turn into animals and that Tonks only mentioned appearance.

*** You are correct, I read it wrong.

That being said... degrees of change? Some change gender, some just change color?

**** I dont think so, it doesn't really fit the way magic is portrayed in the books, which is basically something you either have or dont, with differences in ability being the result of skill.

So I think all metamorphmagi would basically have the same potential in what their ability could do, and any differences arent a result of the power itself.

** The idea of partial metamorphs are fanon, the only one we meet is Tonks and there's never any mention of partial metamorphs in canon. There's also no animals (or partial animal) morphing, what Tonks does with the pig snouts and duck bills are just changing the shape and color (maybe texture as well) of her facial features to mimic an animal's. Also, there's no mention of gender swapping, however Tonks is able to disguise herself as a male guard in one of the books I think. It makes sense, since even if there's no gender swapping traits women have the potential to grow facial hair, so she's be able to make that grow out, and change her facial and body features to be more masculine.

*** So if my character could only change their hair and eye color, no one would shoot me? I know that some tropes are really hated, lol.

**** I mean, it's fanfic, nobody really cares if you switch it up a bit (well, some might, but it's practically impossible to read through a fanfic without coming across wards, rune stones, magical cores, Lords, or any number of other fanon/tropes). At the very least this doesn't contradict canon, it's just never stated within canon. I would recommend at least making use of those abilities in the plot rather than just using them to make a quirky OC character or something.

***** Ohhh, wards are a trope? What kind of wards? I mean, there are magical barriers like used to conceal #12 and when the trio were on the run and such... are those not wards?

And the fic involves Snape having a baby thrust upon him, and the kid's gunna have metamorph powers without anyone knowing it XD

****** The term ward is a fanon thing. While there are magical protections like what's on grimauld and what Hermione uses at the camp, they are never called wards so some people get very annoyed when you use the term. I personally use it just because wards sound nicer than area defending enchantments or something like that.

******* Yeah, they're technically charms that are cast on the area. The wards/runic ward stones don't bother me, they're just not canon and might turn some people off of a fic.

**** Unless your character needs to be a child you can say they rely on human transfiguration to do the change and are simply really good at it.
