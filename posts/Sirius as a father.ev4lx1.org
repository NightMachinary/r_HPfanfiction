I've seen fanfics where Sirius is shown as a good father, particularly to girls. One author even said they love the idea of him having a daughter. Would this be true of canon Sirius? I'm sure he loves Harry, but Harry is a teenager and James's son, so that seems like a different case to me. I also always saw him as that brooding type and wondered how this would affect his relationships.


** I think we have never seen Sirius in his real natural condition. He is always shut in the Grimmauld Place, depressive, and without friends. I think it is quite possible his real persona in the normal life would be quite different.

On the theme of his parenthood, I like linkffn(9739418), which is a prequel to the excellent linkffn(9566537).

*** That's true.But I ca't say that younger Sirius struck me as very erm nice man. I know he was a teenager, but there's something in him I can't quite describe that makes me wonder where women got this idea he would be a good father to a girl. Just like I was surprised when he was paired with a shy girl when he is a rather cruel, hauty byronic type. I suppose if he hadn't gone to prison, he'd be a different person. But I can't say I believe he would have matured right away even without Askaban.

He was fighting a civil war since his teenage years and had family troubles since he was 11. He voluntarily joined a militia to fight for what is right, so he was on the right track. Also, parenthood changes people. A lot.

He broke out of Azkaban because he thought his godson in danger. He tried to help Harry during the TWT despite facing summary execution and having found refuge in a tropical paradise. Compare that to let's say Lupin who didn't bother to visit at all.

He was the only one who actually valued Harry as who he was rather than uphold some odd delusions like, for example, Dumbledore and Molly did when they claimed that Harry, after facing Voldemort 3 times and defeating him twice in single combat, was too young and should be kept in the dark (that worked out great, didn't it?).

**** Sirius's wealth and looks made his social life easier at Hogwarts. Thinking back on my own teenage years, I was a self-absorbed git. The only reason I didn't bully anyone was because I wasn't popular enough to do so. His home life, as well as the people Snape was hanging around with, made Snape (Slytherin, DE sympathizer) a particular target. I don't remember anything in canon about Sirius still being a git in the period between when he graduated and when he was jailed. This in no way excuses his time as a teen bully, but that relatively short period of time should not be what defines his character.

Sirius's parents were abusive because he rebelled against their racist propaganda which makes me think that he is by nature a good person - not particularly nice, but good.

***** I know it's not fair to use his teenage behaviour against him, but in that behaviour I see the sort of cruelty that I associate with the Black family for some reason. I'm not saying he'd be cruel to kids, but it's something I can't get over for some reason. It's hard for me to explain what I mean but to me cruelty= not gentle or kind and I'm not sure it was just because he was a teenager. And to be honest, I don't think every kid bullies other kids so that does mean something.

** I think he'd have the capacity to be a great dad under the right circumstances.

At 21, during the war? Eh. But then few are mature enough at that age and he's at least willing to step into the role and take responsibility if his interaction with Hagrid at Godric's Hollow is any indication. That's no small bit of it.

Some child he never met who gets thrust on him by an ex girlfriend after Azkaban? Eh again. I could see that taking a while to warm up to, the kid would feel like a stranger and a reminder of the years he lost.

But his own kid? At some point when he hasn't been sent to torture island, and isn't rendered useless and stuck in his mum's house? I would buy that scenario in a fanfic, definitely. He's not a perfect father figure to Harry in canon, but as others have mentioned we only see him after a really specific set of circumstances. Fanfic is where you can play with the "what ifs." From how he is with Harry in canon, I think there are hints of the kind of parent he'd be. Not perfect (is any?) but the most important things come naturally to him, like showing up and showing you care. Sirius listens until Harry talks himself into silence, he coaches him, he doesn't judge him, he takes him seriously, he worries for him and tells him. Harry's immediate thought when he dies is that he must not be coming back because Sirius showed up whenever he needed him. He's not a soft and fluffy person, but in Rowling's own words, his great redeeming quality is his deep ability to love. I wouldn't expect him to show any less affection for /his own/ child.

Thank you for this. Rowling for all her faults, made some truly compelling characters who rang true in many readers hearts. It's important I think for those of us who've been reading so much fanfiction to remember the canon before the fanon.

*** I've seen this idea used in fics that dealt with Sirius's character pre and post Azkaban, so I think it's popular regardless of what happens to Sirius. And I think it's the fact that he isn't 'soft' that makes me doubt this. To some kids this might be what they need. But then again, maybe I'm confusing soft with harsh or morose.

**** He seems to be quite hurt by his upbringing and fixated on the idea that his family didn't love him and preferred his brother. Dad!Sirius would probably try really, really hard not to repeat those mistakes. Maybe he's too screwed up and would be doomed to do so. But I think it's more likely he would at least try to give a kid what he needs. If that's a 'soft' dad, then prepare for awkward, gruff dad hugs.

If anything, I'd see his flaws as a father as being overbearing or likely to spoil by setting no boundaries on the misguided idea that any discipline means you don't accept your kid fully. Also, massively overprotective if this is after the betrayal/death/war (and perhaps rightfully so).

****** Hmm, no. I'm thinking more of canon and just adding a kid to the mix.

So you have someone who is deeply lonely, feels useless, and probably has trust issues (from his friend betraying another to his death, framing him, and then, ya know, everyone he's ever known turning his back on him...)

That feels like a recipe for having his identity wrapped up in a kid's presence, safety, and success.

You already get a little in canon. When Harry comes for Christmas he sings carols, bakes a turkey, decorates and cleans, and Harry can't recall a time he's seemed so happy. But as they get ready to return to Hogwarts, he turns sullen and withdraws to his room.

It's like he's not able to make his own life so Harry and his life become his major source of happiness. That's ... a lot for a kid to deal with. I don't think Sirius would be like that in all scenarios, especially if he's a free man with a life of his own. But if you keep the canon situation he finds himself in then the suggestion is there.

** the sirius we met in canon

lost his best friend James after another friend he suggested to be a secret keeper betrayed them.

he then spent over a decade in a place that played his worst memories on looop.

I imagine sirius would have been a bit broody due to his upbringing but his time in azakban pushed it to new hights.

we know James and the potters loved sirius and I imagine they brought out the best in him you know.

Sirius might be a good father, he has a good example of what to not be but he could also be a terrible one as abuse victums can sometimes continue the cycle at alarming rates.

*** Abuse victims are often triggered by kids, so he'd probably freak out over ordinary child behavior. He'd know what not to do, but that doesn't mean he knows what to do. James's parents may have set a good example for him to emulate, but that wasn't until he was a tween or teen.

Therapy would help. At least he knows the cycle of abuse needs breaking. He wouldn't be one of those parents who's like, “Well my parents raised me like this and I'm obviously fine.”

***** Actual abuse victims do this sort of thing. Toddler does some normal toddler thing like scribbling on a wall. Adult survivor of abuse has a panic attack because he remembers what his parents did to him when he did that. He isn't even able to think, since he's in fight, flight or freeze mode.

The less self-aware sort of parent interprets his reaction as anger, which is all the fault of the toddler for doing such a terrible thing, so the toddler deserves the worst punishment the parent can imagine, which is probably what his parents did to him.

The more self-aware sort of parent recognizes that what his parents did to him was wrong, but he literally isn't able to think of a better alternative because people can't think while under such stress. He might run away to stop himself from hitting the kid, or sit there frozen while the kid scribbles, unable to think anything other than “I'm not like my parents.”

A parent who doesn't have this baggage doesn't have such an emotional reaction, so he's able to think. He realizes he should have kept the crayons out of reach and let the kid use them only under supervision. He maybe has the kid help him clean the wall, then gives him some paper so he learns what's an appropriate surface for scribbling.
