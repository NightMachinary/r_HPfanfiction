** The term you want to search for is podfic. Once you have that, you should be able to Google for what you want.

** +PotterCast+ Potter Heads Anonymous Audio Fanfic has several, but they are all robot voiced if you can stand that.

** I haven't read an entire FF by myself in like a year, Siri swipe down/highlight read with the male British character is awesome. Not to the same level as a professional reader and sometimes you miss some of the exclamations and what not, but it's free (if you ignore the need for an iPhone) but it does allow for multitasking and feeds my addiction well enough.

Btw. It's a bit robot-y but Siri's accent is good at pronouncing non-made up words.
