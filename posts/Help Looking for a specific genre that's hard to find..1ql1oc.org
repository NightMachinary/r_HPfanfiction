** Aww man, I totally sympathize. I love this genre too! It's so hard to find good fics that are both well-written and believable. Unfortunately, I'm into slash so I can't help you, haha. Good luck!

** I've read good ones over the years. Sometimes it's easiest to visit The Petulant Poetess or Granger Enchanted {[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][links]]}, pick the ship you like, and then skim the summaries for references to Marriage Law.

** I enjoyed a few Snape/Hermione ones. Google "Chaos is Come Again" (it's own site), "Cloak of Courage", "Chasing the Sun"

These are pretty good - unfortunately back when I was really into that genre, I didn't think to back up and save the ones that I really loved and can't even remember what they were.

Also - not a marriage law fic, but a heavy focus on Hermione/Draco without getting mushy - "Parade of the Sun".

Edit: found more in my archives, these should all be on FFN

"Falling Further In" by kaz2, "A Law to Herself" by shiv, "Stolen" by Elsie girl, "Where Your Treasure Is" by zeegrindylows, "Spellcaster" by SGCbearcub, Pet Project by Caeria

*** Seconding Spellcaster - it is one of the most powerfully written fics I've every read. I've reread it way too many times

*** I honestly haven't found anything I've liked. It all ends up mushy Draco being head over heels for hermione. Which is wrong in so many ways. Haha!

** A couple involving Harry are a bit tongue-in-cheek:

Luan Mao's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9076277/1/Unfortunately-Unbreakable][Unfortunately Unbreakable]] involves a forced marriage on Harry and Pansy. It has a bit of a crackfic tone (like many marriage law stories).

Another is Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_Widower_Maker/The_Widower_Maker/][The Widower Maker]], in which Harry is forced to marry (and marry, and marry...)

Edit: S'TarKan (of /Nightmares of Futures Past/ fame) also wrote on titled [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], but it's been ages since I read it and I don't recall if it's very good.
