Maybe Hermione goes back in time to free Harry from Dumbledore's shackles or Draco realizes that Potter isn't the problem and starts taking action to save him from the Weasleys and/or the dark lord. Bashing (obviously), slash and crossovers are fine. Please no romance-driven plot, pottercest, mpreg or genderbending. Thank you!


** i always wanted to read a story where the weaslys and dumbledore are as awful as every bashing fic, but, they don't manipulate harry because they like him. just everyone else. harry just walks into shot occasionally while they're gossiping.

** I ran across one where Snape goes back and takes Harry under his wing. Sadly I don't recall if its slash...

This one I think?

AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** linkffn(11568661) is Lucius-centric. There is some romance but not much.

  Lucius visits Death and is sent back to right some wrongs and fix his family and the Potter boy. Narcissa and he learn to trust not only one another but the outside world and find freedom in their choices. Lucius guides Harry but this isn't an adoption story, as he moves towards his destiny regarding not only Voldemort but Hermione. Rated T for now but it will be rising to M
