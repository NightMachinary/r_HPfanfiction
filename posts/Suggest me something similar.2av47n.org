I recently read and liked 'Harry Mcgonagall' and 'Harry Crow' and I liked them both.Are there any other good fics where the story sets off in a different direction from the start. HHr would be an added bonus, but wouldn't mind it either way. Thanks in advance.

*** Just checked his profile and it looks like he has left FF.net. Which kinda sucks. Stories are up but he has removed his profile info and posted a "that's all folks" picture for his profile pic.

** Every Robst story follows the same basic plotline, I've read them all with no regrets.
