** I hate to say “that seems far-fetched” when talking about fanfic based on fantasy books, but I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief here. If he's going back in time anyway, can't he do anything better than that? I read a story where he went back in time and actually made himself useful.

*** He canonically was very upset at Marlene McKinnon's death. I've always wondered why more fics don't use that as a plot point.

***** Lily's letter to Sirius in DH mentions:

#+begin_quote
  "Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons [referring to their death]".
#+end_quote

When I read it, I had the feeling JKR was implying this is when he started betraying them for real. I specifically noted Marlene because she's an explicit member of the order, around Peter's age and therefore the member who would have had the most contact with him.

****** Although that's the McKinnons, plural, so someone else in the family could have been the one whose death particularly upset him.

******* True, true. I just said Marlene because she's the only member of the family whose name we know & she was in the Order.

*** What was the story? I'm curious.

I don't love Peter Pettigrew, exactly, but I find him interesting and very underused in stories, even when it's set in the Marauders Era.

**** Sorry, I'm trying to remember it but I didn't bookmark it. I remember he didn't get any credit for saving the world since he acted in secret. His friends still thought he was a bit of a coward.
