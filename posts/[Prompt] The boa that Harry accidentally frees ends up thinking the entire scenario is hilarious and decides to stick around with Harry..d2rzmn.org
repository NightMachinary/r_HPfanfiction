Bonus prompts:

-Hedwig and him get into fake little fights but are actually good friends

-Secret tryst between the boa and Nagini that ends up with her leaving Voldemort's side and declaring her love for "Emilio" or whatever the boa's name may be

-Maybe Harry ends up in Slytherin because snakes are cool; maybe Parseltongue loses its taboo because Harry normalizes it. Imagine Rita Skeeter writing an entire article about the dangers of one of the most famous Wizarding heroes knowing being a Parselmouth, what if he turns dark, blah blah blah, and everyone is just like "Yeah it's actually pretty cool. Harry keeps the snakes on the forest from attacking Lavender's pet rabbit."

Alternate prompt: the boa goes to Brazil and somehow sends Harry letters (he's a magic snake idk) or they keep in contact in some way. When Sirius needs a place to crash to evade the cops, Harry mentions his special friend in Brazil. This, of course, leads to semi crack magical hijinks with Padfoot and "Emilio" tearing up Brazil, lots of "my big snake" pickup lines from Sirius, and just general mayhem. Or go the other way and make it a serious world building exercise.


** I like the alternate prompt.

** The alternate prompt feels like it needs to parody or outright crossover with The Hangover, Animal House, or both.

Bonus points if they just manage to get on a plane to escape the authorities... and sit down next to Samuel L. Jackson.

Who /is/ Kingsley, who uses body doubles and Polyjuice to moonlight as Samuel L. Jackson.

Years later, when SoS has been revoked and the worlds have merged, the documentary has Kingsley as Samuel L. Jackson playing Kingsley as Samuel L. Jackson.

** LullabyKnell had an excellent drabblefic collection on ao3 that I can't find anymore.

In one of the drabbles Ginny ends up a parselmouth due do possession by horcrux, and Harry and Ginny start becoming friends by talking to each other in snake and freaking everyone the fuck out, but what they're saying is shit like 'pass the salt' or 'how cool is quidditch'.

Later on when they get married and have kids, they also turn out to be parselmouths, and so parseltongue ends up becoming a Potter family trait. So 19 years later and they're at the train station and Ginny is fussing over her children in snake and James II is ribbing Albus Severus in snake and so on and so forth.
