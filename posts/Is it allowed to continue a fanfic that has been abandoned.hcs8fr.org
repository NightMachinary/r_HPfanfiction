Hello I know many stories that stopped abruptly in the middle of the action and unfortunately I am trying to avoid this kind of fanfictions due to unavoidable disappointment. Though many of this stories are more than good. Therefore my question whether it is ethically correct to continue, in other words to write the remaining (supposed) chapters of a given story ?

Edit: I am talking about stories that were written by other authors (not me).


** I would highly recommend to NOT do that. Ask the writer first if you want to continue their story.

** I have seen some folks take over a fic and even some folks write a fic of a fic. In both cases they reached out to the original author first and got permission.

If the author disappeared and you can't reach them (and nobody is able to put you in touch with them) then you have a decision to make. Either don't continue the story or to continue with the story.

If you decide to continue with the story I would recommend you go "whole Hog" with the disclaimer. For Example (we'll call the story you want to continue - Unfinished Story with the author as AuthorX) since the story will be showing up under your account change the title to AuthorX's Unfinished Story. Then the disclaimer will be something like.

"I truly enjoyed AuthorX's Unfinished Story and was disappointed that it was never completed. I tried reaching out to AuthorX and asked for assistance from the community in the hopes that they could put me in touch with AuthorX. Regrettably I was never able to contact AuthorX to get permission to continue Unfinished Story. However, I really would like to see it completed. So I have decided to finish it. Now I don't know where AuthorX wanted to take Unfinished Story but I believe what I have come up with should flow well with what AuthorX has done. Everything from AuthorX's Unfinished Story Chapter 1 through Chapter 26 is AuthorX's work in its entirety and which I have not changed. My work starts from Chapter 27 onwards and I hope it does AuthorX proud."

Then the last thing I would do (actually before you write or post anything) is contact the administrators of the fansite you want to use and tell them what you want to do including a copy of the disclaimer you are going to use to ensure that you won't get in trouble with them. You may even get lucky and find that they have a good contact for AuthorX so you could actually get permission.

Edit: this was written under the assumption that you are using large chunks if not all of AuthorX's writing. If not then it could just be considered a fic of a fic but it's usually frowned on if you don't have permission.

*** I then assume that it is not completely unethical to continue an unfinished fanfic but you ought to have the right approach and what is the most important make sure that the author of original part is either informed and gave his approval or got all the credits for his idea and his work.

That is actually what common sense says however I was not sure whether fanfic community (let's put it that way) would approve. There are always some... unspoken rules. ;) Thank you for your broad and clear answer.

** Is this an abandoned story that you started and left alone?

Or is this story abandoned by an author that is /not/ you?

**** Get permission from the author. That work belongs to them and is their property. You don't know where they were taking the story or what they were doing with their interpretation of the characters. If you can't get permission, then don't continue the story.

** It's frowned upon, if done without permission, and depending on the website, it might violate their policies.

** In my opinion it's no different from writing fanfic about unfinished books, like about the last GoT books. If fanfic in general is okay then so is fanfic continuations of fanfic. But as other people have said it's generally not done and I don't think it's allowed on ffn or ao3 without permission

** I agree with the disclaimer idea. One good way to check is if the author profile says that it's abandoned/they've left fandom. If someone says they are never going to finish a fic, you've reached out and you want to continue then I think you're good to go.

Be aware that you might lose a lot of viewers if you don't have permission because some people feel strongly against this.

I would also suggest that instead of copying the fanfic into your work, you link the original chapter at the start of the fic and then suggest readers come back to your work to finish it off. That way it is like a fanfic of a fic, rather than copying huge portions. (Unless the author gives you permission, of course.)

Similar to how you can' get away with writing out 12 chapters of Harry Potter into a fanfic before you diverge.

** *Do* ask for permission first, but if given (or if sufficiently long time and after numerous attempts to contact no reply is given) I would go for it. Actually, I did write couple of stories like that myself (see mcepl on AO3).

** As other people have said, you should probably ask for permission, however, you can just write a "new fic" that is heavily inspired by that fic and just keep the plot u like and change the writing so it isn't plagirism.

** Ask first. Then if you have their blessing it's fine, and if you don't, because they refused or didn't reply, you can write your continuation anyway.

I personally wouldn't do it, but as far as I know no one asked JK Rowling before writing their fanfictions, and even things she explicitly asked the fandom not to do (graphical violence and sex) is published all the time and even recommended here.
