** I personally find this comment from VonPelt in particular very instructive

**** Not quite. A harem is a relationship-centred around one person. Usually a bunch of girls all basically serving one guy, although the reverse also happens occasionally.

IRL, even a threesome with that dynamic is likely to cause issues with jealousy, inadequacy and the like. On the other hand, if you have an actual poly-relationship, everyone is interested in everyone (to some extent, although not every relationship in a group does have to be romantic) and therefore, that seems to be less likely to leave someone feel left out. Probably the likeliest ways to get into such a relationship would be to have an established couple and invite someone else for fun times (and then grow attachments) or have two couples join forces.

** I'm not sure this'll be very clear; I'm having trouble verbalising how I view the differences, but I'm going to try with examples.

Poly -- Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in an equal relationship with each other. The sexual dynamics could vary -- they all have sex each other, or maybe the boys only sex have with Hermione; it could be all three in bed at once or only ever two (any two) at a time -- but the emotional dynamics are very much equal. That's not to say all the relationships have to be romantic -- Ron&Harry could be pure friends, but that friendship is just as important to their lives as their romance with Hermione (i.e. nobody ever feels like a third wheel).

Harem -- Harry has a relationship with Hermione, Ginny, Susan, Hannah, Padma, Parvati, Lavender... etc, etc, and while the women may have relations with each other, they /don't/ have relations with another man (unless that man is also part of the harem). Emotional relationships may vary between harem members, but for each one Harry is the most important person to them.

Multi -- Harry's in a relationship with Ginny, but Ginny's also seeing Dean, and occasionally Harry gets with Hermione, who's on-off with Ron, who has a tendancy to shag Lavender when they're off... basically, while there may be multiple sexual partners, the emotional dynamics between those people vary wildly. I would also use the term "multi" to refer to a promiscuous character who has a lot of relationships one after the other.

I also think a degree of awareness and respect is important in these definitions -- I wouldn't use multi or poly to describe a man who's cheating on his wife because his secretary's prettier, but I would if the man was taking other lovers with the wife's blessing because she isn't that into sex and is happy for him to get his kicks elsewhere.

I think the line between multi and poly is a bit blurry, and you can have both at the same time, but I also think there are people out there who are so purity-focused or obsessed with their OTP or really believe in One True Love who'll cry harem/multi at the slightest deviation from their prefered pairing, and those people need to grow up and realise /very few/ people in the world only ever has one romantic relationship.

**** Yeah a lot of fanfics don't bother with setting up relationships that fail, or the idea that you can be attracted to more than one person at a time without pursuing both. It's usually very much “he/she/they is/are my one true love(s) and nothing will ever break us apart”

** I feel like the true difference between poly and harem, as someone who's a big fan of the former and hates the latter, is that in harem fics the love interests feel like accessories.

Even in V-style polyamorous relationships, the two "arms" have their own relationship(s) & agency outside the person they're mutually dating. They also still interact with each other, even if not romantically. In harem fics, they have the illusion of token "personalities" (Luna = quirky, Ginny = sporty, Hermione = smart, etc) but lack agency. They're not fleshed out beyond what's needed for the harem.

Good polyamory focuses on character development. It makes you want the characters to get together because they all complement each other, fit together better than a pair would.

I feel like for people first writing poly, don't know if that applies to you, it's easiest to start writing an existing pairing and add a character in. For example, Harry & Ginny realising they need Luna in their lives or Ron & Hermione knowing they can't function without the full trio.

*** You've explained it so well, imo. Especially the accessories part. I hate harem stories that do that. Reducing characters to objects that the MC has acquired...Pisses me the hell off.

** The way I see it

Polyarmory: everyone is into everyone. There is a mutual need and love. No one person connects to only one, everyone is connected to others. relationships is equal to any permutations.

I.e. A and B both need C, C loves them both equally. Or A is with B, C, D, E but A does not serve as a link to everyone, and people aren't reduced to people who love A so we get along but rather we get along because we love each other even without A.

Multi: an inter connected Web but varying degrees of relationship with all if participants. A mutual open relationship

I.e A is with B,C,D, E, F while B is into C and A, D just like A but willing to share, E and F is into each other but want a guy for reasons so added A into mix or A and B is a thing but A is okay if B goes with C if he can go with D but B an D are just friends.

Harem: one is to many. Relationship between concubine is not necessary everyone can do things on their own when not with the 'one'. They function to assist the one and generally serve him. No need for characterization or real relationship each concubine is designated a role and that just that. Technically, they are just sharing the one and may or may not like the others. They are titled consort, the children are considered under the consort born under.

I.e. Each kid gets a designated title. Heir black, heir Greengrass, Child of the main wife, or you are main wife, she is first concubine, I'm third so it's fine if he prioritize you over me so long as I get my share.

** My iron rule: Harem starts at 3. Example: Harry Potter-Black needs a wife for each family. Would you call that a harem? No. Now, Harry and the Carrow Twins. Is that a harem? No.

To me, harem is all about devotion to one person. Poly, is the more respectful term.

The real question to ask is: can a relationship be reliably maintained with all of the mentioned people in that story? If the answer is no, that means you have what I coined a "Pokemon Harem". Because you gotta catch'em all!"
