  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/14/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][This one]] it's not perfect, but I like it the best of the ones I've read. It's main problem is Irreverent Super Harry, "I'm super powerful so I act like a fool most of the time."

** Usually your criteria is done in the crossover section like (Magician by wise tomato;Wizard Runemaster by plums;Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage;Whiskey Time Travel by Private Jenkins;The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801;Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988)

Other than Whiskey Time Travel, which is an in universe thing rather than a crossover. Most of those cover what you're looking for.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
