  When a man with startling green eyes who looks strikingly like James comes to tutor the young Black generation, Sirius is sure he'll hate the git. Who is this man who charms the notorious Blacks? And how does he see through Sirius' pranks? [Earlier chapters edited and beta'ed] Mentions of het, slash, femslash. But a gen fic.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell might be something you'll like. Basically, Harry went back in time to try and save people, but could not because he came too late in the past. However, the person that he could save in time was Regulus from the cave. Excellent read overall.
