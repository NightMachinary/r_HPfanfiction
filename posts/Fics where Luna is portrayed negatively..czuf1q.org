Negatively from the perspective of narrative and/or main character. I don't think that I've ever seen it done, but surely it must exist somewhere?


** The closest ones I can think of are jbern's /Bungle in the Jungle/ and its sequel where she's only pretending to be Loony but has really wide emotional swings.

If your definition of a negative portrayal includes sad and depressed, there's /Friends/ by the psychotic house elf (formerly glue and tar). Really well written, super dark.

*** Nah, being depressed doesn't count in and of itself. I'll check them both out though, thanks.

** How dare you! Luna is an angel.

seriously though, the closest i think think of are various evil luna fics that tend to have some/a lot of smut and consist of her either alone or with harry taking over hogwarts/england/the word.

Even in those she isnt really portrayed negatively since the whole fic is themed as such.
