:END:
It's a Haphne story where Harry is labeled a dark lord and he goes back in time to 4th year with Dobby where he kills the dragon gets resorted into Slytherin and he hates Neville Hermione and Ron and he fights a evil necromancer at the end


** Paid in Blood is the story I think, except the author deleted it and even on the wayback machine it diesnt have the entire fic (first two chapters are there but chap 3 isnt)

*** So unless someone saved the fic - which is unlikely since there have been 4-5 different posts looking for this fic and nobody has had it - then your out of luck.
