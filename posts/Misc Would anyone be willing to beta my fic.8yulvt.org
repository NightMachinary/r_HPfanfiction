Would anyone be willing to beta my Harry Potter fic? Before I started on this fic I hadn't written anything in about eight years. I could really use a fresh set of eyes for some overall story feedback. I don't want to officially release anything until I've completed the entire year (I'm about 60,000 words in so far). The main thing I'm worried about is pacing and if the self insert is likable or not. I've been writing fanfiction off and on for about 15 years now so I can handle some constructive criticism. I'm willing to reciprocate and be a beta if desired.

It's a self insert story set in Hogwarts. I know that sounds horrible... However, there will be no pairings between the self insert and any canon characters, the self insert has no special powers, the self insert isn't in Gryffindor (despite wanting to be), isn't related to anyone in canon/in someone else's body, and the story has already veered off from canon. It has a lot of comedy so far (or my attempt at comedy). It's entitled "What's Her Name in Hufflepuff".

Here's my profile if anyone wants to get an idea of my writing style ("Learning" is probably my best story): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/12472/ashez2ashes]]


** I can give it a try, with the caveat that I'll give a final opinion on whether I'll keep betaing it after I've read the first chapter or two.
