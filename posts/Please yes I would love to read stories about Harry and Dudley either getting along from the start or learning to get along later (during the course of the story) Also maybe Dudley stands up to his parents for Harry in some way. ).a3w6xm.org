  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

***** Well mainly it is just offensive to people with disabilities; you don't give someone a "fake" disability, just so you can still make them a super badass action star guy. Either you commit to it or you don't. You don't romanticize it. You deal with the issues and work your story around them, or you don't do it at all. If you want your character to be able to do things, and giving them a disability would prevent that realistically, then don't give them a disability and then just go "Oh yeah and he can also see with his magic!".

That is just horribly insulting and offensive. At least to me, it's like all those movies and stories about people on the autism spectrum being "Super memory genius hacker code-breaker detail-retaining suspect identifiers!". I am on the autism spectrum, and I hate THAT so much. I dropped out of high school because I just could not learn multiplication or division, and I STILL struggle with adding and subtracting double digits and above.

I am not even very smart in general, I am terrible at understanding people or conversations, or word choices and definitions and a lot of things beyond the literal and basic. I am also NOT as mature as any other 23 year old woman, but I am mentally evaluated to be on the level of a girl ten years younger, and that will not change and I will not magically get past it like "Blindness" Harry just gets to miraculously have a workaround for his disability. I could not imagine how it feels to actually be blind and read "Blindness," and see Harry "isn't really blind."

Other issues I had with it were the sentence structures and the words they used for it. It just did not work for me. I could not get into it. It is all written in a past tense sense, and is more like a list than a story. I did not like that either.

******** There's a vaguely similar premise in the comics of Daredevil. Boy gets blinded by accident. Finds out he has super hearing (like a bat, if he makes sounds he can "see" outlines of things and people) and eventually runs into an old martial artist who takes pity on him and teaches him how to fight to make up for his diability.

And he eventually becomes the super hero known as Daredevil. The guy whose blind, but not really, who goes around dispatching vigilante justice in Manhattan (he can literally hear crimes in progress, and the sound of a gun's safety being pulled back within an entire city's radius).

Really most of his problem's come from his complete inability to stop lying to those closest to him, being unable to read facial expressions, him being completely pathetic in his choice of girlfriends, and him being the universe's equivalent of a chew toy. If something bad could happen to Matt Murdock, the universe will make it so.

********* Yeah, but especially in the recent depictions of him (i.e. the Netflix series) they do a good job of actually showing him struggle on a day to day basis. His superpowers are cool, but it's not like he stops being blind, and his blindness and how he relates to the world are all very well done. The Daredevil series still shows him feeling around in a very realistic manner. With the Blindness fic, the disability thing is basically thrown out the window once Harry gets magesight and it's not actually a functional limitation at all.
