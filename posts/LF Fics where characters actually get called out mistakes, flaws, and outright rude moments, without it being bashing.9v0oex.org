Snape is actively a dick as is Malfoy and both get away with it the entire time. Dumbledore suffers from "Idiot Adult" Syndrome, which is necessary to make Harry etc the Hero, but it just makes the Adults seem like they would all be in Prison for neglect, rather than anything malicious. Dursleys, well... They ARE abusive. Locking someone in a Cupboard without food, or Harry "Having to duck the frying pan a few times" IS Abuse, no matter how you look at it. Make Malfoy get punished for being a Death Eater, House Arrest, Fines and most of his "I am Rich, I can bribe my way out of trouble" Money being gone, and Lucius ACTUALLY punished and in Azkaban.

Then there's Hermione. Book 1 Hermione is 11, sure, but she has horrendous manners.

"At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling" During the first potions class. You don't literally stand up to get the teacher's attention when you want to answer a question. She doesn't even lose points for it, or get a Detention.

I want to see a Fic where everyone is called out on their shit, without exaggerating it to the point of bashing. Threaten to send Ron and Hermione to an Etiquette Class, (Ron has awful Table Manners, which is also noted in the books) get Harry mental help. (Oh, you just watched your Godfather die? Oh well, back to your Prison I mean home")

Even the Dursleys were redeemed by the end, for nothing they did to earn it. They got NO punishment..... /endrant


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6654621/1/Beside-Me-Always][Beside Me... Always]] linkffn(6654621) isn't the greatest fic, but I like this exchange between Dumbledore and Snape, because it sums up why I never had much sympathy for his ongoing feud against James/Harry.

  "They all got away with almost killing me! You never punished them..." Severus almost yelled.

  "Got away?" Albus asked sadly, staring at him hard. "How could they? Look at what has happened to them all. While you have suffered greatly Severus, you were safe here in the school that you love so dearly. But look at how they all suffered... James is dead, Sirius was imprisoned in Azkaban for a crime he didn't do, Remus had spent so many years alone - struggling to find work and Peter Pettigrew was forced to hide in fear as a rat. And here we have you... tormenting a child who had nothing to do with any of that. Why?" Albus asked him in an almost earnest way. "Haven't they all paid enough? Hasn't Harry suffered enough for what his father had done to you?"

Um, this seems kinda trivial. Like the point of the scene is Snape is literally bullying Harry in front of the class and he doesn't care if anyone knows the answers to his questions. Saying this is horrendous and requires an etiquette class is ridiculous.

**** Many of those fics take the idea from some particular fics, where it was made clear that it's a cultural thing. Prince of Slytherin comes to mind. Cultural norms just are, they don't always have to make sense. For example, people don't talk on phones in the subway in Japan.

Personally, I feel that Hermione's 'in your face' personality is just annoying.

****** Canon Snape isn't the best classification of a well adjusted adult.

I never said anything about shunning. I personally find it annoying but that's my feelings.

This is a genuine question. It's been a long time since I've read canon. How does Hermione behave in Potions after the first class?(i.e. After that chapter till the end of Book 6) She was corrected (not politely) but did that change her behavior?

*** Implying that the teacher is blind? He couldn't see her hand when she was seated? That kind of exuberance can be seen as insulting.

If you raise your hand and are ignored, proceeding to bounce in your seat, stand up, jump on the desk or setting off fireworks all amounts to the same thing. If you aren't called on to answer, the solution is to make a nuisance of yourself till you are?

**** As someone who teaches occasionally, this is pretty standard fair with children. No, I'm not calling on you, because I want the kid who I know needs to think about the answer to think about the answer, rather than have him just listen to the smart kid answer the question for us.

That said, some of them are a little keen, and want to make sure you're aware of them. Usually a "Sit down, I've called on so and so for a reason" suffices.

***** It's not really applicable to the scene in question though, it's outright written as Snape being unfair to a student for no reason whatsoever. And the OP's suggestion that it was so bad it required etiquette lessons is pretty silly. Your response at least makes sense.

****** Hermione is very in your face and demanding. It was ONE part of why i made the comment about etiquette. She should have got a Detention for being a pest in Class. Standing up in class and basically bouncing on your feet whilst waving your arm around in the magical equivalent of a Chemistry lab would get you at the very least a punishment.

Hermione, in Snape's eyes, is a Know It All Mudblood, a chance to humiliate her as well wouldn't have been out of character , and yet... I'm 90% sure Hermione's only detention is the Forest one, in the entire series.

******* She wasn't being "in your face" in the scene, you can read it over as I just did. She wasn't bouncing, she stood with her hand raised. There were no potions nor ingredients out, Snape was doing orientation. This laser focus on it being "horrendous" doesn't make any sense, so I won't belabor it. Even Snape would have a hard time making "She stood in class" into a detention worthy offense.

**** Exactly! Someone gets my point. She should have been told "Sit Down Granger! 5 Points from Gryffindor and a Detention" rather than just told to sit down. It's the easiest to point Example that Hermione isn't the Worshipped Deity that Fanfictions write her as.

**** She stood up, that isn't making a nuisance of oneself. Again, there's no suggestion that she or anyone thought Snape was blind. Snape was bullying a student and Hermione was trying to answer the question under the assumption he'd stop. I really don't understand how anyone could honestly make such a big deal out of it.

****** That's a likely possibility (probably the actual reason honestly). But given Snape suggested the class were all dunderheads it's not hard to see someone with her personality wanting to prove she wasn't one.
