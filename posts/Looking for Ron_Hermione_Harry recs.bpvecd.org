I'm just looking for any genre where Harry Ron and Hermione are in a romantic relationship as a threesome.


** Unfortunately, this favorite pairing of mine has very few completed fics to begin with, and most of these are smut without a plot. But two of them are very good:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is very popular on this sub, although the Trio relationship is only implied.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), is a crossover that should not have worked, but I like it very much.

*** Does "The Sum of Their Parts" count?

Because from what I remember they are extremely close, but really in a romantic relationship. I think Ron and Hermione even got together as in Canon but later break up.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/137248][And On The Third Day]] is the best trio fic I've read - the friendship, the romance, the awkwardness of new beginnings, the banter - it is so well written and I wish very much this was longer.

** Quite honestly the most logical ship in the whole series. And so under appreciated.

Shorter Stories:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13964817][Things We Do in the Daylight]] linkao3(13964817) Classic morning after and lovely.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16129562][Wished Into Existence]] linkao3(16129562) Lovely and fluffy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/466349][the restless ghost in his old hotel]] linkao3(466349) Each of the trio and their own insecurities.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/54808][Find Our Mortal World Enough]] linkao3(54808) Older but an absolute classic. Hermione and Ron protecting Harry, them all seeking comfort in one another.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/508725/chapters/895835][Through Their Eyes]] linkao3(895835) A newly updated story about when the (epilogue compliant) kids catch the trio being more than friends.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15506883][Replacement]] linkao3(15506883) Ginny centered stream of consciousness, but still deserves a read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/204026][Pyrrhic]] linkao3(204026) Very angsty, not exactly a trio fic but still worth recommending. My favorite line is: "Always thin, she was now positively ethereal, and the set of her mouth was disconcerting on somebody so young, speaking of too much suffering in too short a period of time."

​

Arguably smut (but I read them for the plot):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000792][I Can See Us Dying ... Aren't We?]] linkao3(1000792) unrequited love, but beautiful and gives it iconic line of: "Does he know that Ron is --- was --- the thing Harry would miss most?"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13035315/chapters/29816373][With the Edges Worn Down]] linkao3(29816373) I can't speak highly enough of this story. Set post kids, tells a story of the three of them (finally) coming together. Very pure and gives the absolutely perfect line of "life rolled"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10049897/chapters/22388945][Small Fires]] linkao3(22388945) A little smuttier than the others but absolutely heartbreaking.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3499913/chapters/7691726][What it Comes Down To]] linkao3(7691726) The most honest and realistic PTSD story I have ever read. This one is /rough/ rough but a good read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951061/chapters/1859733][Always & Forever]] linkao3(1859733) I avoided this one for forever and when I finally read it I cried like a baby. So good, one of the best epilogue compliant ones I've ever read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/59435][Bed and Board]] linkao3(59435) Okay, this is straight up smut but a must read. The most authentic getting together story I have ever read of the three of them. Most (all) of my head cannons are based in this story for me.

​

And just to rec my own:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17804468/chapters/44760826][the whole world was watching (but no one really saw)]] linkao3(44760826) Ongoing (and almost finished) AU where after Ron goes missing, Harry is forced to reexamine his unusually close relationship with Ron and Hermione.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]] linkao3(16957743) Set directly after the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him cope. No spoilers, but this one will break your heart.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17975564/chapters/42458912][Consequences of Time: Origin]] linkao3(42458912) The first in a seven part, time travel fix-it series.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.
