Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed through the portrait hole, Harry looking glum, Ron looking more worried than anyone had ever seen, and Hermione looking quite put out. They took a spot with a good view of the fireplace. Fred, George, and Lee all looked up from their little huddle as trio came in. Fred and George exchanged a glance, nodded at once, then turned to Lee.

“Excuse us,” said Fred, as the twins stood up. The twins walked over to the trio.

“Harry, Hermione, ickle Ronnikins,” said George.

The trio barely acknowledged him. Harry looked up briefly, then went back to staring at the fire. Hermione barely glanced at them before got back to staring at Harry, with worry and annoyance warring on her face. Ron just grunted, not even acknowledging the diminutive nickname the twins had just used.

Fred and George exchanged another glance. After a long moment, they turned back to the trio, and Fred opened his mouth. “What's got your broomsticks in a tailspin?” He asked.

“Trelaweny,” they said unison, though their tones varied, matching their expressions.

“Death predictions?” Asked George.

“The old bat,” Fred added.

They were greeted with another round of minimal acknowledgement.

“Who was it?” George asked.

“The old bat,” Fred repeated.

The trio shared their own glance. Finally, Harry looked up and said, “Me.”

“Well don't worry about her,” said Fred, ruffling his hair. “She predicted mine two years ago, but I'm still here.”

“The old bitch,” said George, matching Fred's earlier tone.


** RIP Fred :(

There's a couple things like this in canon, if you squint real hard. In PoA, when Trelawney is upset about dining with the others at Christmas because "when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die". But there were /already/ thirteen before she sat down, because Scabbers was there; and Dumbledore, the first to rise, was indeed the first of them to die.

And some of Harry and Ron's Divination homework is downright prophetic, /especially/ the stuff they make up - in GoF, predicting that they will be "in danger of burns" (dragons), "lose a treasured possession" (Ron), "be stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend" (Ron again), and "come off worse in a fight" (the graveyard). And Harry's crystal ball final in PoA where he "sees" a Hippogriff flying away.

The movies are actually pretty bad, the last half of the series are, anyways. Full of holes that weren't in the books and a lot of characterization just goes out the window. The books have plenty of flaws and room for criticism, but shouldn't be blamed for the movies' shortcomings.

*** That's because JKR knew how to play it right afterwards and said in some interview that if George were to look in the Mirror of Erised he'd see Fred or something along those lines and for some reason it stuck with the fans. For Sirius and Dumbledore, we spend an entire volume bonding with each character through Harry's eyes so their death is devastating at the end. In DH all the dead characters are secondary and not that important to Harry, (not even Lupin), but I am sure that if someone were to write a very good fic from, say, George's or Dennis Creevy's perspective, Fred's or Collin's deaths would impact the reader more.

****** I will admit that Harry and Daphne's relationship is not immediately obvious on a casual read of the books. However, on a close read, I think it's clear that their relationship is one of the cornerstones of the HP series.

Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione has a certain dynamic to it. It's burns hot, lots of ups and downs, lots of arguments and adventures. His relationship with Daphne is different, and that's why it's not as attention grabbing as some of the other characters in the series. Daphne really is Harry's emotional rock (or perhaps, ice-cube), always dependable, never-melting.

Not once in the books does Daphne tag along when Harry is hanging out with his friends. She respects that he has his friends, she has her friends, and they can each do their own thing.

It's not necessary for couples to spend all their time together, and that's really the bedrock of Harry and Daphne's canon relationship. They give each other the space they need to be themselves, to feel like they have a life outside of their relationship. That gives them something meaningful to share with each other. They each bring something of value to the relationship; neither one is hanging off the other.

On top of this, of course, you have Daphne's numerous other qualities which make her relationship with Harry the strongest one in the books:

- Unlike Ron, she never betrays him.

- Unlike Ginny, she never needs rescuing by him.

- Unlike Hermione, she never nags him, goes over his head, or considers her opinion more important than his.

- Unlike Cho, she never makes him uncomfortable.

- Unlike Luna, she never does anything weird.

- Unlike Fleur, she never looks down on him.

- Unlike Susan, she never gossips about him.

For those reasons, Harry's relationship with Daphne in canon is undoubtedly his strongest, even if she doesn't have the most lines of dialogue.

******* Yes but you mustn't ignore the bad when looking for reasons.

- Daphne offers not one word of support when Umbridge is torturing Harry with the blood quill. Or banning him from Quidditch. Or calling him a liar and attention-seeker.

- Harry almost gets crucio'ed by Umbridge in 5th year. Hell, Harry DEFINITELY gets crucio'ed by Voldemort in 4th year. Daphne's reaction? Pretty much invisible! It's like she couldn't care less about Harry...

- She does not accompany him to the Department of Mysteries even though he would have been in mortal peril.

- When Sirius falls into the veil and Harry almost loses his life jumping after him, Daphne does not lift a finger to help things. If it hadn't been for Remus, the war would have been lost right there and then.

- When Harry calls out for help at Malfoy manner, who responds? Daphne? Oh hell no. Aberforth steps up. One might argue that even Harry knew there was no point in calling Daphne so he just asked for Dumbledore.

Based on these additional points, I feel that Harry's relationship with Daphne may be strong at times, but overall it is much like a breakfast during a milk shortage: *very flaky*.
