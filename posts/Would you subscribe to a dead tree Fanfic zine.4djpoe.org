Something written on intentionally crappy paper and only in black and white but with stories, artwork, and articles and the like?

Edit: At the moment after doing some research, this is feeling pretty viable, already got a great quote for the print cost of a 64 page zine, sent off some variable questions.

My thoughts are a patreon where a 2 dollar patron would get a digital copy whereas one who is a 5-7ish (still pricing printing and shipping costs) would get the dead tree and pdf version. These costs would basically JUST cover the printing and shipping cost. (Maybe figure out something else to tack on for people who wanna do more: custom stickers or the like.)

Any overprints could then be taken to cons, sold for people looking for back issues in a web store, just dropped off in small book stores to be sold by them, and so on.

Those are my thoughts right now on it, they'll evolve as more research is done.

I kinda figure i would need a staff of about four people to do the editing and one or two for layout. I'd prefer to work with people close by but really this could all be done by people around the world if they're really dedicated and i would basically go to the printer, package for ship, and then drop off at the post office.

** I wouldn't. I've been switching to electronic media for all my reading, with the exception of comics.

*** Ahh man, that was gonna be part of the whole thing, intentionally poorly done to really harken back to the old days of enthusiastic but not really competent editors. :D

**** Haha well that does have a certain sort of aesthetic to it! And I wouldn't really object to that at all --- I guess upon more reflection what I'd really love is stories in the vein of those found on livejournal and the melange of other sites, all of which have a much fresher feel to me than ff.net. Less polished, of course, but if you want to hearken to something, hearken to that!
