** This is actually the system of magic in Carry On by Rainbow Rowell. The magic is based on terms and phrases known by the population: for example, /Bugger Off/ would work as a banishing charm in the UK, but not in the US as it's not a term used here.

*** Lol, except by tea-bos who attempt to use British slang and spelling to make their fanfics feel more immersive. I read a fic once where Harry lost the ability to cast in anything but Parseltongue but incantations didn't translate and he had to figure out what he intended the spell to do when he first learned it and it worked like this.

PS, I like your name. My husband and I have had several discussions about the differences between HP universe magic vs. Full Metal Alchemist. He was /not/ happy when I told him about McGonagall turning her desk into a pig in the book.

** This is like Carry On. I like it. They never really give a concrete reason why latin is used for spells.
