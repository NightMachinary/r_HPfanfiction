There is one only thing that I don't understand . Why Harry ask Dumbledore to help him find another home when it is not in the duties of a headmaster to do it at all. Such demands are to be brought to the Ministry child services or DMLE . A headmaster might be under obligation under British law to send to the authorities any hint of abuse but it stop at that. Why Dumbledore would be the one to receive such queries ?


** In the books, Dumbledore is the main authority figure. We have no real indication that the ministry has child services or that the DMLE really looks into that sort of abuse - along with the abuse itself being more used in a Roald Dahl style and played off as a joke (for an out of universe reason).

Back to in-universe, the ministry is fairly incompetent, and Harry was not placed with the Dursleys by them - but by Dumbledore. Harry doesn't know how the laws work, he eventually learns that Dumbledore is the one pushing him to go home every summer (for the blood protection), etc. In the end, him going to someone /other/ then the main authority figure in his life would have to rely on a lot of changes - a more explicit legal system built into the Ministry to deal with child services, a law that Harry would then have to look up/find out about, then go to contact them (presumably without Dumbledore finding out about it), etc. That's a lot of hoops to jump through.

** THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS WHY HE SHOULD REACH OUT TO DUMBLEDORE (OR MCGONAGALL)

Harry wasn't raised in the magical world. His sole exposure to it was Hogwarts and Diagon Alley.

He didn't really know much about the Ministry (let alone where it was) until fifth year, only having snippets to go off of from then onwards.

We don't even know if the Ministry HAS a child services department, or if the DMLE even handles these sorts of disputes. So put yourself in Harry's shoes:

He's effectively alone in a world he doesn't know or understand. I doubt he even knew about social workers or the like in the Muggle world, so I don't think it would click to try a magical equivalent.

Like it or not, the Dursley's put on an image that they are upstanding citizens, which likely deterred Harry from making them out to be anything other, as it's his word (as a grubby ruffian who they graciously took in) against theirs. He has no reason to believe that the Aurors would see it any differently.

If he is taken from the Dursley's, then what? Privet Drive, as much as he hates it, is still the only home he's ever known (with the Dursley's the only family he has). Yes he's desperate to leave, but he has no idea who or what awaits him beyond. We know he can't stay at the castle, it's a school. And the Weasley's are poor, he'd refuse to impose on them.

It's likely that as much as Harry doesn't like living in Little Whinging, he doesn't register his childhood as filled with abuse and neglect. He rationalises it as the family not liking him, but never seems to make the leap that what they are doing to him is wrong. So I don't think that, even if he knew child services existed in the magical world, that he would reach out to them. Also because he's proud, and would likely just not see it as abuse.

So, of course he'd reach out to his teachers (who, like in the Muggle world, should get child services involved when faced with evidence of possible abuse).

This is the most important part. IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

No child is expected to reach out to child services themselves, they tell teachers or other adults in their lives about things and it is THEIR responsibility to pull that trigger and get them involved. It's not on Harry to get the DMLE involved, because if he has to that means the adults in his life have failed him.

Assuming there are child protective services in the magical world (which we'll never know, as Dumbledore would have never contacted them anyway) Harry was absolutely in the right for reaching out to his headmaster.

*** If I was in Harry shoes with the same lack of knowledge, the first think I would do is research in books this knowledge and then reach out to the legal authorities.

In the muggle world it may be the responsibility of teachers but in the Wizarding World it may be different. We may even infer that in the wizarding world family is more important. Therefore it would be responsibility of the family (cousins, other with blood ties) not the responsibility of teachers. As demonstrated when Hagrid was sent for Harry or when Hagrid was given teaching responsibility.

And it is flagrant that Harry hasn't any adult in his live, because they all think that they know him because of the boy who lived business , he doesn't have the privilege of being a child.

**** Harry was eleven.

Like it or not, he wasn't some cynical super genius, he was an eleven year old boy who didn't even know he was able to leave the Dursley's. Hence why he asked and then begrudgingly accepted Dumbledore telling him to go back to them. No kid has any real grasp on how these things work at that age unless they've already been exposed to the system.

Harry's perspective on the situation isn't just lack of knowledge (which I highlighted in the other comment). He's young and has no idea how anything works in the Muggle OR Magical world. Why would he even think to go scouring through legal books that the Hogwarts library may or may not have and he would absolutely NOT UNDERSTAND AT HIS AGE. Hell, I argue that even Hermione would have no clue how to navigate through legalese in first or second year.

You claim that's what you would do, but I doubt that if you were in Harry shoes (having lived the life he'd lead) that you would do any differently. Again, if Harry had been exposed to the system at a younger age (e.g: a social worker was sent the Dursley's way at some point) then he'd likely see if the magical world had equivalents, but it is likely he didn't even know what they were, or that there were people that look out for abused children (as there is no way the Dursley's would have brought that up). So, he can't go looking for something he doesn't know exists.

****** Fucking WHO?!

The only parents of people in his school that he is om speaking terms with are Molly and Arthur, and she doesn't exactly react with horror when the boys tell her about the bars on his window. And he didn't really know them like that until long after he asked to stay at Hogwarts.

Harry is a private person, has few friends and doesn't even tell them about the full extent of what was going on at the Dursley's. Harry's hasn't even met Hermione's parents on page or screen, it is not on Harry to flag down a completely unknown adult and ask how child protective services works in the Magical world.

Again, Harry was correct to reach out to Dumbledore. It was up to him (if the laws and people for child protection exist in the Magical world) to either look into what was happening to his student or have the correct authorities look into it. And if there aren't child protective services, from an ethical standpoint (both as his teacher AND as the person who left him there in the first place) Dumbledore was the one to step up and find out why Harry was so adamant not go home.

******** I'm sorry, are you seriously suggesting that Harry should have gone to Draco Malfoy's parents for help? Harry didn't get along with Draco from the first time they met at the robe shop, where his parents weren't present. He didn't “meet” Draco's parents until his second year - when Mr. Malfoy proceeded to: brawl with Mr. Weasley in the bookshop, was present when Hagrid was arrested and taken to Azkaban, and when Harry realized that he was the one who gave Ginny the diary. None of these actions scream “this is a trustworthy adult who I should ask to help me get out of abusive home.”

******** That's not how ethics works, you idiot. But it is further compounded by the fact that Dumbledore was aware that Harry's life with the Dursley's was poor and he apologised for leaving him there. So, under normal circumstances, Dumbledore should have been expected to look into the situation.

Yes, Dumbledore is an unknown. But he is also his HEADMASTER and has given him no reason to distrust him. It's not like he hadn't seen or spoken to him at previous points in the year; Harry should have gotten detention (for being out past curfew) when Dumbledore caught him at the Mirror of Erised, but Dumbledore just gently explained the dangers of the mirror and urged him along. That's more than enough to give Harry the idea that he is both trustworthy and willing to help him.

You're not winning this. Harry was in the right to ask Dumbledore for help as he had no reason to believe he was:

A) Unwilling to help.

B) Completely unable to help.

and,

C) Not knowledgeable on the subject.

********** All teachers have this moral obligation:

"The term in loco parentis, Latin for "in the place of a parent"[1] refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.[1] Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.[2]" [[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis]]]

The Ministry of Magic writes laws relating to magic, we have nothing in canon that suggests other British laws (such as against theft and murder) do not apply just because there are wands involved. Thus this^ principle still applies.

Meaning even his headmaster is responsible for this. In loco parentis means Harry should have been able to go to ANY Professor (even Snape) and expected them to do something.

*********** As the equal opportunities laws does not apply in the Wizarding World we can infer that muggle laws do not apply. Therefore it would fail to the Ministry of Magic to write such laws. And therefore would the Wizard think that teachers are acting in loco parentis ? I don't think so because it isn't in their culture that a child could be abused.

************ There's a whole lot of reaching you have to do to get to that point:

- Where does is say the equal opportunities act doesn't apply? One, it was enacted in 2010, nearly 20 years AFTER Harry went to Hogwarts. And two, you could argue it only applies to humans.

- Muggle laws not applying because ONE law isn't represented in the Ministry is a fallacy.

- With student attending Hogwarts year round with trips home only authorised during the holidays, it is right to assume that parents would expect Hogwarts professors to act in loco parentis. As for seven years of their childrens lives, they will be having more interaction with them than their actual parents. Additionally, you can extrapolate from McGonagall's mentioning of Houses being like family that this is the case.

- We have nothing that suggest the wizarding world as a whole doesn't believe a child can be abused. No one knows if Neville being thrown out of a window was reported to the Auror's and Harry's circumstances were exasperated by the fact that Dumbledore wanted Harry to stay at the Dursley's despite knowing what they were like.

Don't state headcanon as fact.

** Ok, reading the other comments, I'm pretty sure you are disingenuous and just want people to jump of the Dumbledore's hate train (and did you seriously propose the fucking Malfoy as a better alternative than Dumbledore for questions?). Anyways, here are some facts :

- Harry went to Dumbledore because Dumbledore is the archetype of the old mentor who answers the heros question (not to mention that Harry respect him and listen to him). If you don't like it, ask Rowling because she is the only one who could answer it.
- We don't know if the Magical World even has a child service. Canon shows us 3 orphans (Tom Riddle, Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom). And judging by the fact that one of them grew up in an orphanage, and thee 2 others lived with relatives, I want to say that it doesn't.
- As seen with the discussion between Fudge and Harry at the start of PoA, the Ministry knew where Harry lived and approved. They may have changed their mind if they knew everything that went at Privet Drive, but since it's the same organization that let Umbridge torture Harry because he was an annoyance, I wouldn't bet on it. Also, Fudge would be a terrible guardian, as would anyone chosen by him (such as the Malfoys since he seemed to like them).
- Outside of his position as Headmaster (and maybe all the other political ones), Dumbledore never had any power. Outside of Harry's living arrangement (that was also supported by the Ministry), nobody was ever forced to listen to him. In OotP, Ron and Hermione didn't give any information because they chose to listen to Dumbledore, and Sirius never left the House because he chose to listen to him. Technically they had the freedom to do what they want but decided that Dumbledore gave good advice.

Harry discover that Dumbledore placed him with the Dursleys without legal authority with any ministry employee or Gringotts => Dumbledore manipulation.

**** As far as Dumbledore knew, the Dursleys were his last remaining living relatives. It's something that was done, back in that time, giving an orphan to their (close, of course) family.

Dumbledore never intervened more than that in Harry's living conditions. For all we know, it was also perfectly legal- we never know if Dumbledore has or hasn't filled the proper forms for taking a child and bringing them to their family.

"On which authority Dumbledore had Harry placed with the Dursleys?" As a simple deliveryman. As a friend of the family. And remember, Hagrid and McGonagall also were there when the delivery was made. Do you believe Rubeus "oh yeah I actually told someone how to defeat the first layer of defence to a powerfull artefact by mistake" Hagrid kept it a secret that he brought Harry to his relatives?

So, I believe that Harry being in the Dursleys' care is, strictly speaking, legal. It's at least legal in the eyes of the Muggle world, since, y'know, he went to school and shit.

I also believe that, despite letting him in front of the door like a bottle of milk, magic makes it so that Harry was never in any danger. You know, heat so you don't die of cold, sleep until your aunt come and accept you here or not so you don't wander off, the whole package.
