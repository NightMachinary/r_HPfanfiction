So I started reading the Red Knight but really not keen to invest anymore time to it after first few chapters (too many cliches, too slow etc)

But I kinda want to know the main plot points because premise was interesting. Can someone give me a brief synopsis of what happens?


** I ended up skimming through this pretty fast, so some of the plot details might be a little rough.

- Ron travels back in time (or to another universe or something)

- He gets sorted into Slytherin

- He befriends some Slytherin OC's

- Harry is a girl for some reason, called Violet Potter

- It turns out that Violet and Hermione are also time travelers, and this is, like, their 4th attempt to get things right

- The Ron from their timeline was a rapist who kept Hermione a sex slave

- Violet and Hermione think that the protagonist-Ron is rapist-Ron from their timeline

- Ron tries to destroy the Horcruxes, starting with the Diary

- Hermione tries to kill Ron

- Violet is sort-of Ron's friend now, and she's unsure as to Ron's actual origins

Everyone is either an OC or out of character, and it's filled with the typical tropes you see in stories with Slytherin protagonists. The most interesting thing is the multiple time-travelers angle, but its pacing is too slow and the Hermione bashing is too extreme for me to really enjoy it.

*** Ah ok. Now Hermione's behaviour makes more sense. Yeah I figured that Violet and Hermione were time travellers (thx to sorting hat comment). So fem-Harry is never explained? That's pretty much all I needed to know so thank you for saving me from having to read it :-)

**** its basically just ron thinking he traveled back in time when he actually took the place of the other ron from a parallel universe and fem harry is one of the differences of the universe(other differences are stuff like a meaner fleur and a molly who heavily favors Ginny)

**** A bit more to the point: Violet and Hermione are looping, in the same universe, and their Ron was looping with them. This Ron is reincarnated from his universe, which is different from Violet and Hermione's universe, somehow either removing their Ron from existence or temporarily stopping him from reincarnating (we won't know which it is, for obvious reasons). And every universe varies from each other, there is a female Harry in this one.

Unless you are asking about the behaviour of Violet's, in which case it's caused by them having already gotten through however many loops.

**** So I also had the same padding and whatnot issues with the fic, but why would femHarry need to be explained?

***** Because canon Harry is Harry not Violet. Because Ron had no idea what was going on and thus we had no idea what was going on. Seems straightforward to me.

*** I don't think its really Hermione bashing per say. The three basically aren't even pretending to be the same characters they are in the books.

*** I mean if you were kept as a sex slave and you saw your captor out free you would probably not be civil towards him. And if killing was something you already did, you would probably try to kill him the first chance you got.

I think her behavior makes complete sense in the context of the story, as she doesn't realize/know that this isn't the same Ron. Iirc, they've had issues with their Ron coming back in time with them, so they tried something new this time -- but instead of just not bringing their Ron back, they brought canon Ron into their timeloop for some as of yet unexplained reason. So Hermione just thinks that whatever they did failed, as Ron shouldn't be so charismatic, be in Slytherin, be a good duelist, or get good grades. Everything points to him being a time traveler, and the first assumption made isn't going to be "alternate dimension time traveler". So I don't think bashing is the correct term.

*** The only thing I want out of this fic is an explanation about what is going on. I don't care for the characters or the setting, I just want an author explanation. When I realized the author wasn't going to give one I stopped reading.

*** Thank you. I don't need to continue the fic then - dropped it somewhere between chapter 10 and 20 because I hated how adult Ron in child body was acting around the stupid Slytherin kids - since it's rather clear that the trio won't get together.
