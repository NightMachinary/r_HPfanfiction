:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember too much about this fic, but Harry and Hermione were super super close. Not sure if romantic or not though. He is some kind of bird animagus and manages to get into the girls dorm through an open window to talk to hermione. Iâ€˜m pretty sure that someone (Maybe Lavender) got McGonagall and she had a wack reaction. Then it turned into a whole school-wide joke about how to get into the girls dorm without being noticed. It's probably a dark!harry fic, considering how many of those I read lol. It's not a lot to go on but I'd appreciate some help friends.


** I wanna say a Marauders Plan linkffn(8045114) But I very well could be wrong. I know I read a fic where this happens sometime in the last two weeks though

** Oh I read this just recently!! I had a feeling that maybe Harry and hermione went back in time to marauders era though? Maybe I'm mixing it up with another fic though.

** I remember one in 3rd year where Hermione gets in an accident with her time turner and is in the girl's dorm and they can't get to her to find out what's wrong until Harry reveals that he's a wolf Animagus.

That would be Impose, one of the sequels to Innocent.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".
