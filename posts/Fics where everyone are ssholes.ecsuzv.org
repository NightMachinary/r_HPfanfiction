While Voldemort is evil bastard so is Dumbledore for those whose magic isn't aligned to light. Fanatic light families want to get rid of everything that is neutral or darker and drive them to seek Dark Lord for protection. Traditionalist hate muggle-borns as they don't follow said traditions, while muggle-borns hate them for being racists.


** Not exactly along your lines, but everyone including the protagonists in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), is imho an asshole.

** *Imprisoned Realm* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245967/LoveHP][LoveHP]] linkffn(2705927) absolutely fits this request- even characters who are completely 'good' are driven to being assholes when they feel justified.

I second *Hail Odysseus* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] linkffn(10645463).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569][Seven Names]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/angelholme/pseuds/angelholme][angelholme]] absolutely fits the bill as well. It's got a confusing start, but I think that is intentional and it all comes together in the end. The moral of the story is that everyone does shitty things in war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]] and the sequel series that follows [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice Series]] isn't as clear of a match. I think, in general, Harry is the golden good boy we expect but he's not overwhelmingly in the first one and after that he is certainly flawed. Most of the characters are really complex though and the main character, Ginny, absolutely does shitty things.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/][Renegade Cause]]

Linkffn(4714715)

I haven't been able to finish reading this one yet, as everyone is /exhaustingly/ psychotic. I burst out laughing when Dumbledore, half way through asks ,"Has noticed Harry is a bit angrier these days?"

The author has to be trolling in his opening remarks that he tried to make everyone behave realistically, that or they've no idea on basic humanity.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
