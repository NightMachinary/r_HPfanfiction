It's pretty common to see time travel fics where they change something related to them but don't do much else. I'm looking for some where they see the bigger picture.

For example in /In the Bleak Midwinter/, it's a time travel story where Hermione is in the 1930s to prevent Tom Riddle from growing up the wrong way. But since she's already there they also use her knowledge to speed up the development of antibiotics by a few decades and if the fic continues where it's heading they might do things like preventing WW2. [[https://xkcd.com/1063][After all, according to xkcd everyone agrees that if you have a time machine, you gotta kill Hitler.]]

Even a 2000s to 1980s redo time travel story could have similar ideas. Maybe go after Osama Bin Laden once Voldemort is dealt with, and prevent thousands of deaths and two decades of war in Afghanistan. What kind of time traveler would NOT do that?


** So is this specifically for time travel, or other fics that are /very/ AU from canon?

*** Or fics that start in cannon and go crazy with the world/empire building?

** Oh, and as for the killing Hitler bit, ask the Command an Conquer RTS characters how that worked out for them. If I remember right the point where history in that universe divulged from ours is that Albert Einstein built a time machine and killed hitler long before he did anything.
