The regeneration potion required blood of the enemy and Voldemort told Harry that Lily's blood protection is void as he has gotten Harry's blood. So I wonder what DNA testing on Voldemort's corpse after the Battle of Hogwarts will reveal. Furthermore, if they are genetically identical are there any fics on Voldemort (going to Gringotts and) becoming Lord Potter and casting Harry out of the Potter family. I have read too many fics where goblins help a super harry and right now I am in the mood of one in which goblins screw Harry.


** Taking the ritual very literally, I think he would be more of a chimera (genetic version, not the creature) in that different parts of him would genetically test as different people. He'd have Harry's blood, his father's bones, and Pettigrew's flesh and skin, and of course, his own soul/spirit/whatever.

***** Chimerism isn't always benign. In some cases it leads to severe autoimmune disorders (the body's immune system attacking parts of itself).

- Here's [[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a18754259/chimerism/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=Social&utm_term=1380763299&utm_campaign=Women%27s%20Health][one well known example]] of a woman who was born with chimerism and has numerous health issues as a result.
- Chimerism has also been linked to [[https://ard.bmj.com/content/66/12/1568.short][systemic lupus erythematosus]] (a rare autoimmune disease).
- Organ transplants ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2344125/][especially bone marrow transplants]]) can cause chimerism. If the host and donor are not compatible (they need to have the same 'human leukocyte antigens' (HLA) in their blood), then the host body will have a severe autoimmune response.

**** If we actually take this scenario literally, then chimerism would be the least of Voldemort's worries. The ritual would be equivalent to an instant full blood transfusion and bone marrow transplant, but without all the handy safety measures that muggle's invented to prevent organ rejection and the mixing of incompatible blood types.

If Voldemort's new body literally had different genetic makeup in Pettigrew's flesh, Riddle Sr.'s bones, and Harry's blood - and assuming that he didn't win the one-in-one-hundred-million chance of randomly selecting three donors with matching HLA (human leukocyte antigens) - then he would become deathly ill within 24 hours.

Details:

In hospitals, blood packs for transfusions have been stripped of white blood cells (the cells that attack foreign matter as part of an immune response), and the remaining red blood cells are always checked for compatibility with a patient before transfusion begins. The ritual didn't include those steps, so most likely the white blood cells in Harry's blood would begin attacking every part of Pettigrews' 'flesh' that they come in contact with. Meanwhile, the white blood cells residing in Pettigrew's lymph nodes would begin attacking Harry's blood right back.

Voldemort would immediately experience the symptoms of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076326/][acute hemolytic transfusion reaction]]. If anemia and shock didn't kill him quickly, then within 6 hours he would die of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507846/][transfusion-related acute lung Injury]] due to the antibodies in Harry's blood attacking Pettigrew's lung tissue. If he survived longer than that, then he'd get to experience renal failure and a cascade of all of his other organs failing due to the massive accumulation of blood clots and tissue necrosis. If he was miraculously lucky and Harry and Pettigrew turned out to be HLA matches (1/10,000 chance), then he'd still likely develop [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2018687/][acute graft versus host disease]] once the new blood generated in Riddle Sr.'s bone marrow starts violently mixing with Harry's/Pettigrew's blood/tissue.

Of course, all of this assumes that the ritual didn't just a) magically alter the HLA of the three donors to match, and/or b) include the magical equivalent of muggle immunosuppressant drugs.
