Like the HP Fanfic Subreddit awards for fics published completed in 2019?

What sorts of categories would you like to see if it were indeed a thing? I have my own ideas but would like to here what others have to say.

Not really looking for an nominations. Just how you would envision it running.

Mods, please pop in you 2 cents too


** If there is enough interest, we could certainly host voting around December 2020 for this year. We haven't done something like this before, but I personally agree. It would be rather fun. I will bring this up with the team.

Personal note: in addition to stories started/finished in 202, I think it'd be fun to have a legacy category for best story finished over 10 years ago.

Hell yea. I've been reading FF since just after I finished GoF, and it'd be lovely to dig up some of the classics that I loved.

...

Holy shit, I've been reading HP FF for 20 years.

** Personally I like:

Best Alternate Universe

Best one-shots (because they don't get as much love)

Best rare pair

Best Alternate Perspective Cannon Re-telling

And probably a wild card category for a theme that was prevalent that year, even if it's a weird/ Crack-y theme

There's probably more.

Also, how would you define those categories.

Like if Best Rare Pair was a category how would you determine if the pairing was rare or not.

Anyways, you get the point. I don't think that FFN is a good metric for the rarity of a ship. There are only 431 H/DG fics around, and I wouldn't call Daphne a rare pair by any stretch of the imagination. And funnily enough, there are only 15 Cho fics around, yet that's a canon pairing. The line for rare pairing is kinda blurry.

******* I think I wasnt using language english but I was looking at length > 1000

Well tbf I wouldnt use cho/harry as a good metric because basically no one likes her as a character. Theres way more daphne/harry fics even more lavender/harry I think.

I cant really think of any other metric. Maybe using the pairings on AO3? Or if theres not a dedicated fan site for x pairing then likely it's a rare pair.

I get 13 Harry/Lavender fics compared to the 15 for Cho. Parvati and Padma check in at 6 each.

*** Best long form story started that year

Best short story completed this year (<40k words)

Best novella story completed this year (40k to 60k words. If I recall correctly, actual publishing uses 70k, but that's not an option in ff.n)

Best long form completed this year (>60k words)

As for rare pair, I'd say it needs to be less than 1-2% of things written or updated this year in the fandom, that has pairings, though I don't know how to sort that.

If that's still too much, maybe add a filter that it's less than x% of the pairings involving the more popular of the two characters. IE (and these are totally made up numbers) but lets say that Hermione/Grayback is 0.5% of the fan fic meta, but it's actually 5% of the fics with Hermione, who is five times as many fics as Greyback, so I'd say that for that character, it's not a rare pair.

*** To start with, you could do best new author. More or less saying who was the rookie of the year award for HPFanficion given to. That sort of thing. However, for guidelines I do something like: quality, consistency (updates), quantity, etc. This is for novel length stories, not short stories as a note.
