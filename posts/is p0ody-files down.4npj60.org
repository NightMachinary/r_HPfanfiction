I've tried several of the ffbot's links and the site doesn't seem to exist anymore...


** Not exactly, but it has moved domains. Instead of [[http://www.p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/]] the new link is [[http://ff2ebook.com/old/]]

The posts from the last few days should have been updated to use the new target, but you'll need to change the old links manually.

** It says this post has 3 comments, but I can only see one. Anyway, the site moved [[http://ff2ebook.com/old/][here]].

** According to the [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][link I found]] when I searched for p0ody-files, the domain name has expired.
