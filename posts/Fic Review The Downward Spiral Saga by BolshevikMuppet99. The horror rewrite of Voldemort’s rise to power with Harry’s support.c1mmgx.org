I have to preface this review with a loud and clear trigger warning. There are mentions of torture, suicide, murder, sex between minors and childhood sexual abuse. I do not recommend reading on or looking up the fic if any of these things are distressing to you. I will not be linking the fic directly as this is contrary to rule 8 of this subreddit.

*The Premise*

Harry Potter is bastion of good in the face of Voldemort's evil in our canon story, but what if he had been abused as a child, befriended by Draco Malfoy, and sorted into Slytherin? What if Voldemort had been smarter, come back sooner, and reached out to Harry much younger? The Downward Spiral saga is an experiment in nature versus nurture -- in how much a person's life could be different as a product of circumstance, what we can learn to accept and normalise, and how easily the balance of power can tip.

As with many of the fics I've been recommended, this is a rewrite of the Harry Potter books, beginning on Harry's eleventh birthday. The saga has one book per Hogwarts year, but finishes in the book 6 timeline rather than book 7.

*The Plot*

There are two central plot elements running through the saga. One is Voldemort's return and the war he wages against the wizarding world. The second is the war waged in Harry's head about good and evil. Both are handled cleverly and thoughtfully, and I applaud the author particularly for writing appropriate connections between action and consequence for all characters involved. No one is over-powered and most of what occurs follows a creative and logical path whilst keeping major canonical events woven throughout the years.

The establishing chapters change a great deal for Harry, and his story resembles Voldemort's even more closely than canon. In this story, the Dursleys do not keep Harry, but drop him off at a muggle orphanage the same day they find him. It is Dumbledore rather than Hagrid who makes the journey to tell Harry of his magical abilities and place at Hogwarts, and he learns from the orphanage matron that Harry was severely bullied by his peers and sexually abused by the janitor Mr Roberts, though Harry never confessed to the latter. Dumbledore also surmises that the subsequent deaths of the bully and Mr Roberts were the results of Harry's early accidental magic protecting him. Although Harry's conscience wrestles with these deaths on his hands for years, he also comes to partially blame Dumbledore for having allowed him to grow up in the orphanage and failing to protect him.

Like Tom Riddle, Harry takes himself to Diagon Alley alone. As in canon, he meets Draco in Madam Malkins, but in the absence of Hagrid, Draco doesn't offend Harry, and Hagrid doesn't predispose Harry to hate Slytherin. Instead, they become good friends when Draco expresses horror and sympathy at Harry being left in a Muggle orphanage. They later sit together on the train, and Harry hears all about how great Slytherin is. As we know, the only reason Harry was not sorted into Slytherin in canon was because he asked not to be. In this universe, Harry is not only a natural fit for it, but his influences about the houses have been inverted, and the only friend he has in Hogwarts has already been sorted there, so it feels inevitable when Harry goes with the sorting hat's recommendation and becomes a Slytherin.

The trickle-down effects from one decision leading to another are masterfully done in this story. Harry's sorting and the report from Dumbledore about Harry's childhood suffering has a positive influence on the way Harry is treated by Snape, and in turn makes Snape into a mentor figure to Harry rather than an antagonist. Draco taking the place of Ron also means that the Malfoys take the place of the Wealseys in being the surrogate family to Harry, and he is exposed in positive ways to pureblood culture and traditions.

Voldemort makes different tactical decisions in this story, learns vital information much sooner, and through his increased cleverness becomes a far more threatening presence through the story from the end of book 1 onwards. Early on, he catches Snape letting slip his feelings for Lily, cluing him in about Snape's spy status. Rather than wait four years to bait Harry into touching the Triwizard Cup, Quirrel simply knocks Harry out cold in the corridors of Hogwarts one day and steals a vial of his blood, removing the need for Harry to be present at the ritual to return Voldemort to his body. The ritual takes place at the end of Philosopher's Stone using Quirrel as the willing servant, but the separation of the two kills Quirrel, paving the way for the DADA teacher curse to continue and Lockhart to come in for CoS.

From here Voldemort acts covertly. Rather than immediately summoning his circle, he drops in on Lucius Malfoy unannounced and intimidates him into reaffirming his loyalty and giving up his resources. He then uses Lucius to bring an unsuspecting Snape into Malfoy Manor and forces him to make an unbreakable vow to serve him faithfully. Thus in two well-calculated moves, Voldemort takes total control of the two adult men Harry looks up to the most, and moves to bring Harry into his circle during CoS when Harry comes to stay with the Malfoys for the holidays. When Harry meets Voldemort, he is twelve years old, completely alone, everyone he trusts has encouraged him to be here, and there is a threat on Draco's life if he doesn't comply. So when Voldemort demands Harry's loyalty, Harry reluctantly agrees to give it, and context makes it believable (if tragic) that he would make this choice.

It continues down this way as we go on. Mostly of what I read was intelligent and well set up, although there were several plot points (usually related to magic) which were unbelievably convenient. Things like:

- The Unbreakable Vow canonically is choice between obedience or death, but the choice is yours. In this story it acts like a selective imperius curse, preventing Snape from doing anything the Dark Lord won't like, but also preventing him from committing suicide, which felt like an easy way to remove Snape's autonomy very early on.

- In despair over the above vow, Snape brews a potion which removes his conscience for what he must do under Voldemort, but it also destroys his love for Lily. Later, he administers the same potion to Harry to prevent the latter from having a mental breakdown over the guilt associated with a murder. As with Snape it removes his guilt, but for some reason has no effect on his love for his girlfriend. It also seems to be a one-dose-fixes-all, when in my opinion it would have been more effective if Harry had periodically exhibited unstable behaviour as he went into withdrawal and became dependent on the potion so he wouldn't have to face and process what he had done.

- Voldemort and the overall death eater movement was much more focused on being anti-muggle than anti-muggleborn, and there isn't any particular reason given for this shift from Voldemort's canon ideals, but it does work to make Harry more in favour of the ideology.

- Perhaps the deus ex machina moment of the fic comes during the battle of Hogwarts. Without giving too much away, there is one POV paragraph dedicated to Sanguini at the eleventh hour of the book. He reveals that vampires are the undoing of inferi, and that because he is an old and powerful vampire, an army of thousands of inferi is rendered back into inanimate corpses at his whim. This is not foreshadowed or explained but does much to turn the tide of the battle.

Overdrawn conveniences aside, the plot had a strong backbone and follow-through, which got me hooked and didn't let go once it really got rolling.

​

*The Writing*

Downward Spiral is an extremely unpolished work, and the writing is by far its weakest point. For context, there are 6 books and a one-shot encompassing the saga, making a total of 372,000 words. The first chapter of the first book was published in March of 2018, and the last chapter of the last book was published in October of the same year. That's an average of 53,000 words a month, which is more than NanoWriMo and blows my mind. The obvious downside is that there is a glaring lack of review happening. The author often notes in the early books that he doesn't have a Beta reader, and unfortunately it shows.

There are no period markers at the end of quotation markers, so it feels like everyone has been cut off before the end of their sentences. Apostrophes are almost invariably used incorrectly. Then & than get confused, as do wandering and wondering. All easy fixes which could have made a vast difference to the average readers' first impressions of his work -- including mine. Had this saga not been a recommendation, I would not have pushed past the first two chapters, although retrospectively I'm glad I did.

There is a somewhat jarring overuse of American slang and swear words. It's understandable to an extent in terms of the fic trying to portray a level of realism in how teenagers speak, but I had to laugh out loud when Professor Kettleburn dropped a “Holy shit” in Chamber of Secrets. Having said that, I did see the word ‘tosser' used at least once, so points there.

My last criticism of the writing is the use of thought speak. The story is told in 3rd person limited (with the occasional dabbling into 3rd person omniscient), but Harry's italicised thoughts are constantly punctuating the dialogue, and it gets very clunky. When someone is speaking to him, we always get his angry, vicious thoughts, followed by his much more reasonable-sounding verbalised response, especially when he is speaking with Dumbledore. The ensuing result is often that any given conversation Harry is involved in reads like two people having a conversation that a crazy person on the street keeps trying to jump into and derail with their screams. There are moments when knowing Harry's real thoughts on what he's hearing is useful for the plot, and I concede that it reminds me a lot of how my own teenage conversations would go when I was trying not to lash out, but I still think this mechanism could have been utilised much more conservatively for easier reading.

​

*Characterisation*

I think this was one of the strongest elements of the fic. The Harry of Downward Spiral is very different to canon from the get-go, from the premise that the intensity and horror of what he suffered when he was young made him much more introverted, but with heavily repressed rage.

Although he doesn't read like canon Harry, he does read like a very believable 11-year-old. He is still naïve and impressionable and desperately out of his depth in processing what happened to him. Draco offers the alternative narrative to Harry that muggles are scum and that is why he was treated so badly, and this seems to be backed up by the warmth and support Harry receives from the Malfoys and the wizarding world at large. Down one line of thinking, Harry can let himself drown in the guilt of having murdered two people and go on thinking there is something fundamentally wrong with him. Down the other, the only real crime was that Harry was left to the mercies of people little better than animals, and their deaths were entirely justified. Whilst of course neither of these options are correct when looked at objectively, Harry was never presented with a third option, and it makes a lot of sense that a child would cling to the belief that exonerated him, especially since Draco, Lucius and Snape all backed this one up.

From here, the development of Harry's tragic downward spiral is done extremely well and very believably. He isn't a psychopath or a monster from birth, but the path he walks down has been influenced and supported every step of the way by the death eater community who welcomed and loved him.

One particularly tragic instance is that after Pansy breaks up with Harry because she is frightened of him and the sexual things he's pushing her into, Daphne steps in and puts all the blame squarely on Pansy. She completely invalidates that Harry needs to respect his partner's boundaries and simply asserts that she is as dark and sadistic as he is and fine with “rough sex", despite being 14 and a virgin. This wipes away Harry's self-doubt and starts the darkest true love romance you've ever seen. It's actually an extraordinarily well-written romance too -- I give top points for both it and the characterising of Daphne. At first I thought this was highly over-sexualised behaviour for 13/14-year-olds, but after some reading up on after effects of sexual abuse it turns out that age-inappropriate sexual behaviour is common, so it wasn't an unrealistic development, although the sex scenes made me very uncomfortable.

There are instances throughout Harry's years that make him fluctuate and doubt and even send him into moral crisis. At one stage, Harry must kill someone close to him on a snap decision, but the ensuing guilt very nearly breaks him apart, and the repercussions on Harry's mental state were intense and very well written. In short, I was impressed by Harry's characterisation throughout.

The author is also skilled at separating his characters' voices, especially as the books go on. Snape, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Sirius, Draco, Pansy and Gellert Grindelwald all have different dialogue markers and sound very much like what you would expect from J.K Rowling. I particularly loved Gellert often using terms like “upstart” and other words to convey the arrogance of accumulated age. There are some authors who only have one ‘voice', and all the characters say the same things as the others, but this is not at all the case here, and it breathes life into the characters.

One bad side, although author specifically states that this is not a Manipulative!Dumbledore story, he gives Dumbledore so much heart instead that he becomes frustratingly naïve and unaware of Harry's mental state. He informs the staff of what Harry went through before he starts at Hogwarts, but does not offer him any kind of counselling until things get so bad that Harry nearly kills Ron in a flash of temper in book 5. Dumbledore provides a mind-healer, but Voldemort has gained so much traction by this point that he is able to wrangle one of his own loyalists to be hired, thus heading off the opportunity for someone to teach Harry a way of thinking that doesn't line up with everything Voldemort himself says. In short, this Dumbledore has been dumbed down into someone who fails Harry time and again without meaning to.

​

*It's kind of torture porn.*

This is where I talk a bit about the trigger warnings, all of which should be taken seriously if you plan to read the fic. Whilst the first two books are comparatively light and feel like a slightly darker version of canon, book 3 onwards leans gradually into graphic brutality. My stomach turned a bit the first time I came across a description of a curse which slowly peeled the skin off the victim. Yes, there is a significant plot and time is dedicated to character development, but there are also huge swathes of chapters devoted to lovingly-detailed and unnecessary torture, to the point where I assume this is probably a thing for the author. Whilst there are gratuitous sex scenes, including a randomly thrown-in incestuous threesome and lots of underage sex, sex scenes tend to be touched on and then brushed over, where the torture is lingered on and eventually sexualised as well.

I do want to draw attention to the author's handling of his themes though, because I think he did it well. He gives clear trigger warnings several times, but through his author notes he also makes it plain that what he writes is not designed to romanticise Death Eaters, Voldemort, or anything he stands for. He is not an apologist for the bad guys, but is simply writing a story in which they are the protagonists. This is why even though the violence leaps over a line into gratuity, I don't find the writing of it objectionable, since it is still presented as something horrific and awful and unjustifiable.

I also found myself favourably comparing the treatment of child abuse in this fic to the way it was handled in Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches. Both stories feature a young protagonist who faced significant childhood sexual abuse before the age of 10, but Princess of the Blacks exonerates the protagonist's rapist and treats the sexual abuse as though it was something the child had agency over and agreed to do. The Downward Spiral on the other hand shows us how the abuse detrimentally affects Harry's thoughts and behaviours for years afterwards. One extremely effective scene shows us Harry's first class with Lupin, where as per the canon, the class faces a boggart. But Lupin is a new teacher and hasn't been briefed on Harry's childhood, and in this version decides to let him have a turn. When the boggart turns into Harry's rapist in front of his class it is so horrific it sends chills down your spine.

​

*Final thoughts, or TL;DR*

There is a LOT more I could have talked about in this review, as there is a LOT in the fic. I can't outright say that I enjoyed it -- it is a hell of a downer of a story, but as that's by design I also have to commend it for really bringing out the emotional response in me it was designed to do. It definitely needs to be re-posted after a good Beta review as that will shine it up significantly, and certain plot conveniences were too heavily relied upon, but it's really quite a solid story. The set up and development of Harry's character was exceptional, characterisation in general was very strong, the romance was natural and brilliant, and the plot was executed heartbreakingly well. If the level of heavy violence isn't likely to bother you and you're into very dark stories, I'd recommend giving this one a try.

A few people mentioned the epilogue and the timing of it, though I didn't mind it. Possibly it should have been combined with the chapter beforehand, but contentwise I found it to be a suitably horrifying inversion of the canon epilogue.

*** Oh wow, this is the first review I've done which has actually been seen by the author! I'm glad you liked it.

In regards to a), I think you can give yourself the promise to only fix up the grammar on the rewrite, and not change any of the plot in order to keep the integrity of what you wrote. It was clear to me that you really got your stride in the later books, and I noticed a dramatic increase in the quality, so I can tell that as you go forward you'll keep writing even better stories. The only "change" I would recommend in terms of plot is to maybe add in something explaining what happened to the diary horcrux. The way the events of CoS panned out, by rights Ginny should have still been in possession of it, but given that the trio walk into a trap looking for that particular horcrux, it seems apparent that this is not the case, so maybe write in a line or two explaining how Voldemort got it back.

Otherwise yes, I think your idea of getting all your ideas down and then letting them sit for a few days is great. Personally I'm seriously impressed at the rate at which you write - you obviously love it. I just think you'll really up your readership with a little bit of polishing.

I did want to tell you as well that I particularly loved your characterisation of Snape and Gellert. Especially when Snape was scolding Harry and even trying to give him deeply flawed life advice in the later books I could really feel Snape coming off the page in the dialogue you wrote for him. Made it a really gripping story :)

** Amazing review i have to say, the series was one of the best works I've ever read in YEARS. It was such a breath of fresh air, extremely believable, doesn't torture you with clichés and tropes that we've been used to. The character developments are extremely well made and honestly? I hope this doesn't get downvotes but the torture/rape/porn was one of my favourite parts. Call it morbid if you and any but it extremely appealed to me. More so when it was Daphne and Harry together, if anything it only solidified just how much they're meant for each other and the fact that Daphne IS the one that he needed to keep up with his nature. The scenes were brutal and bloody hell were they well written so you can FEEL the pain and sadism from both sides. I loved it. A lot. The epilogue felt a bit underwhelming for me but overall the series entertained me during my binge reading :)

*** Thank you very much! This review took me the longest to write so far, so I appreciate the comments :)

Yes, the way Daphne was written was very, very clever. In a way, she is made for Harry and they fit together extraordinarily well, to the point that no one else could have made Harry as happy as she did. But simultaneously it's clear that her influence in his life was a tragedy, because he was on his way to taking some responsibility for the appalling way he treated Pansy before Daphne came along, and it became just another lost opportunity for Harry to become a better person.

I don't really think there's anything inherently wrong with enjoying horror and torture porn as a genre, so long as there's always a level of awareness maintained that this would never be a good or desirable or justifiable thing outside of the realms of fiction. If it's your thing, more power to you.

** Good review. I think I've read the first part of this series, but skimmed the later ones and decided to skip most of it because I wasn't particularly interested in reading about torture porn at that time. But I am curious about the characterizations, so maybe I'll give it another go.
