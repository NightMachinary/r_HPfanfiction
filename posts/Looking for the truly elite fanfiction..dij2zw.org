** Linkffn(beyond the curtain). The writing is the best ive seen in fanfiction. Great worldbuilding and characterisation. Very original but the characters are still similar to their canon selves.

The premise is that Voldemort wins the war and takes control of Britain and eventually Europe, isolating it from the rest of the world with a curtain. Most of the resistance ran away and Bill, Neville and a few OCs are trying to get in for a mission, and Harry (who is still inside the curtain) helps them.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide Neville's team through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* stars from DLP.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes; The Unforgiving Minute) Loved the spellcrafting and invention of magic in The Arithmancer & Lady Archimedes, but I was really struck by the emotional impact of The Unforgiving Minute.

  The Unforgiving Minute
#+end_quote

Man, I haven't heard of this one in a *long* time. I can't for the life of me remember if it was in this one where one of the most memorable scenes I've read in a fic took place. Refresh my memory, was it here where some bodies are burned in a mass grave by a certain prominent character? I'm afraid to say more for fear of spoilers, but if it is this one, you should know what I'm talking about.

**** I don't think so. I do know that his time travel device was called the Big Combination, and was located in the Department of Mysteries. Shouldn't be too spoiler-y, but might help?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
