Harry, at some point, be it during his school years or after, finds a bunch of old parchment in an abandoned room at Hogwarts. So many letters to the Boy Who Lived that never made it to their intended recipient.

Some are cute, some are funny. Some few are heartrending.


**   The war was done. All that was left was the rest of his life. It was late but Harry couldn't bring himself to sleep, and found himself wandering through the halls of Hogwarts. It was quite late, or quite early, depending on your point of view, but well outside of curfew.

  Mrs Norris apparently survived the battle, strolling down the corridor, her eyes flashing with reflected torchlight in the dark, while Harry silently cursed himself for forgetting the Cloak. Unusually, she didn't go running off yowling for Filch, but instead she walked calmly up to the puzzled Harry and butted her head gently against his shin and meowed. Harry, with some trepidation, reached down to stroke the normally bad-tempered cat, but she batted his hand away. She turned around and waving her tail and stared at the Man-Who-Won. Harry stood frozen on the spot. She meowed plaintively.

  "She wants you to follow her," Filch said.

  Harry yelped and turned around, whipping out his wand, only to see the cantankerous old caretaker, and the spell on his lips sputter out.. Filch was clearly quite amused by his response, judging by his expression. "What?" He said, as his heartbeat returned to normal.

  "She wants you to follow her," Filch repeated.

  Harry was utterly bewildered by Filch's behavior. "Sorry, but shouldn't you be screaming at me, threatening me, giving me a detention?"

  "You really think I'm gonna bother doin' all that? You're an adult, you just won a war. I'll settle for making you jump out of your skin," Filch replied with a grin.

  "Thanks for that. Why do you think she wants me to follow her?" Harry said. Another plaintive meow floated down the corridor, as Mrs. Norris sat impatiently.

  "Can't say that I know," said Filch. "We're close, and I can understand her enough to know when she wants me to follow her, but why? She's a cat. Can't hardly talk now can she?"

  Harry nodded, and started following Mrs. Norris, with Filch hobbling along next to him. "You're coming along then?"

  "'Course I am. She's my cat." Another meow echoed back, this one sounded more... affectionate?

  Harry was a little unnerved. He'd never seen Filch smile without musing about torturing rule-breakers. "Had her long?"

  Filch nodded. "Yep. Since she was a kitten. Gift from a friend of Albus's. Arabella."

  "Arabella Figg?" Harry said, surprised.

  "You know her?" Filch asked in response, sounding just as surprised.

  Harry nodded. "She used to watch me whenever the Dursleys went on vacation. Or out to a fancy restaurant. Or even a day outing. She was... As kind as she could be, given the situation."

  "Unkind childhood, eh?" Filch nodded.

  "I wouldn't say that," Harry said.

  "Boy, I may not be one of you fancy wand wavers or counted among the wiz ards," He said, separating the words, almost as an insult, "But I know well what it's like to have an unkind childhood. Wasn't born with the name Filch."

  Harry winced at the pronouncement. "I'm sorry. Sounds like you might have been treated worse than I was for being a wizard."

  Filch shook his head, and they drew to a stop.

  Mrs Norris had stopped before an old door. She was looking at Filch. She reached up, scratched at the door, and meowed again.

  Filch reached into one of the many pouches he had on his belt and took out a keyring, squinting as he looked at each of the keys and holding them up to the lock. Finally, he saw what he was looking for, and unlocked the door. When he opened it, a plume of dust flew out, causing Harry to sneeze.

  Filch moved to enter the room, but Mrs Norris moved to block him. Filch looked down at the cat curiously. "Guess you're meant to go in there on your own," He reached out a hand towards Harry.

  Harry grabbed it almost automatically.

  "Thank you, Harry," He said, clasping the proffered hand. "I don't know if you know this, but those scum were using me for Unforgivable training, at least when there wasn't halfbloods and blood traitors in detention to practice on. 'Who cares about the squib?' I'm not sure how much longer I'd have survived that."

  Harry nodded solemnly. "I'm sorry that happened to you, and you're welcome."

  "Right then. I'll leave you to it. C'mon, Missy," Filch said to the cat, and he sloped off down the corridor.

  Mrs. Norris took a moment to butt her head against Harry's shin again, this time accepting a stroke on the back from him, and then she trotted off after Filch, tail in the air.

  Harry turned his attention to the open door before him. The room was dark, and what little he could see was covered in dust. He pulled out his wand. "/Lumos/!" he intoned, a light igniting at the end of his wand. What he wasn't expecting was candles all around the room to flare to life as he did so. He stared about the room. It was full of shelves, and the shelves were all full of rolls of parchment, many of which looked yellow with age.

  Harry reached for one of the oldest pieces of parchment. None of them were old enough to have crumbled to dust, even without preservation charms, but some few were quite yellow, like the one in his hand. He unrolled it. The handwriting was blotchy and uneven. Like they hadn't practiced with a quill much. It was also very short, with a few spelling errors, and several words crossed out in the middle.

  Harry read the letter and wondered if this was the same Zacharias Smith he went to class with. He set the letter down and reached for another roll of parchment.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
