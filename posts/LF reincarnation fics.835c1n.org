Hello! I'm looking for fics in which the main character is reincarnated as someone else or has their consciousness sent back to the younger version of themselves!

Thank you in advance


** I've got quite a few here all related to Hermione with time/crossovers.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ymqb6/my_hermione_timetravel_compendium_of_the_last/?st=je4ukmwd&sh=939dd187]]

Six pomegranate seeds is probably my favorite fic at the moment with Hermione as a Rosier who loves parallel to her original self and is busy doing other things than the stages of canon. It's so well written it makes other fics seem bad where before I may have only thought they were mediocre.

Champion was a decent fic too.

The elvenqueen is a good lord of the rings rebirth crossover

Game of thrones hp crossovers are full of crap-to-decent reincarnation fics in that universe. In fact I'd say it's the dominant trope.

Amalgum Lockhart's folly is a funny harry-as-Lockhart reincarnation fic.

I have read so many of these!

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  Harry falls through the veil chasing after Sirius during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Unfortunately, Death isn't too pleased with this and sends him back in time to fix things up. fem!Harry. dark!Harry. Elemental and Dark Magics. Rated M for language and future content. Story will deal with some heavy topics.
