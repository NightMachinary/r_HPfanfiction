Here's what I remember

Harry is on the side of Voldemort. Harry and Voldemort imprison their opponents in Azkaban by using an advanced form of polyjuice, which need to be renewed once every two weeks. They polyjuice their opponents so they look like Death Eaters, and the actual Death Eater walks out.

Harry ends up resurrecting Voldemort in the end.

Thanks in advance

EDIT: Found the story - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5563431/][Dabbling With The Dark]]


** Well... there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]] which more or less fits your description... At least Voldemort and Harry get about twenty Death Eaters out of Azkaban by feeding their opponents a variation of Polyjuice Potion. Only that this one lasts indefinitely... And I'm not so sure about Harry ressurecting Voldemort at the end, so it might not be the same fic, but you never know... :)

*** It isn't Xerosis. I remember that Ron and Hermione were polyjuiced as well. Hermione worked for the ministry.
