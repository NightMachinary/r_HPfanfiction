:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im looking for a completed HP/HR fanfic where after the war, harry travels back to his body during his sorting at his first year, and proceeds to take care of Voldemort and exile himself rom the wizarding community, not before admitting his love to Hermione. After he leaves he sends hermione gifts throughout her years at hogwarts including rare books and expensive jewelry. The fic ends with Hermione meeting Harry, Sirius, and Remus at a bar, celebrating Harry's birthday, with Hermione surprising harry by using a fake name and in disguise. I can remember how to find it and I want to read it again. Thank you for your time.
