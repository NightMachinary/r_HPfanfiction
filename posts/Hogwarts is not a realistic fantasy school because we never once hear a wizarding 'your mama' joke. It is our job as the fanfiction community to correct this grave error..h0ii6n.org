** Not to mention all other toilet humour. And pranks like flushing peoples heads, hiding their things, moving their beds to the hallway in the middle of the night through their sleeping - boarding school life is kind of Lord of the Flies.

I know it wasn't up to JK Rowling to make boarding school realistic but can you IMAGINE the shit that would go down with a bunch of boarding school munters with actual magic at their fingertips?? Fred and George were vanilla. Gorgeous, lovely creatures. Balm for my soul. And totally vanilla.

*** Some of those things might be exlusively American things as well, like I'm not British, but flushing someones head in toilet is not a thing in my country, like it's in America (though could be a thing in Britain).. So some things that are usual in school in US, would not nessesarely be done in UK.

**** I agree. I'm not american and there are certain hazing/pranks that are very specific to my country also. Stephen Fry's biography was very elucidating on boarding school life in a bygone UK era, a wee bit before the marauders time I believe, but very interesting to learn about. The things they got up to would certainly not make it into a children's series!

** I think there's a cultural gap here.

The Wizarding World at large seems to value family pretty highly, plus the "your mum" joke is not as much of a phenomenon in Britain to begin with, so I think a "your mum" joke would fall /seriously/ flat in a British Wizarding school.

That said...

"Your mum's so ugly, when she went to the dungeons Professor Quirrell freaked out about another troll"\\
"Your mum's so stupid, she failed Muggle Studies. You're Muggleborn, right?"\\
"Your mum's such a duffer she got sorted into House Elf"\\
"The Black Lake used to be a lot bigger, but then your mum decided to cannonball into it."

** "I heard that Potter passed out!" Malfoy taunted. The story of the dementors on the train had already spread, it seemed.

Harry shrugged. "Yeah. If you saw what I saw, Malfoy, you'd pass out too."

"Oh yeah, Scarhead?"

"Yeah," Harry replied, sipping his pumpkin juice. "Let me put it this way, kid. Your mum's not nearly as afraid of grims as she should be. Yecccch." Harry shuddered theatrically.

Draco paled. "You take that back!"

"I didn't take it in the first place, Draco," Harry said. "That was your mum."

  "Hey. Hey Harry," said the troll. "I heard your mom was a witch too."

  Harry didn't say anything, and just waited.

  "But she was so fat," he said, his voice rising, "She got sorted into all four houses! Mwahahaha!"

  "Really original," said Harry.

  "In fact, she was so big," said the troll. "Her Patronus was a cheesecake!"
