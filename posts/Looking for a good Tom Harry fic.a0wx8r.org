Anyone know a good fic where Harry and Tom grow up as childhood friends? Any rating is fine. I don't mind if it's finished or not. I just want to read more fic where Harry and Tom grow up together and Harry being a positive influence to Tom.


** well i really like fates favorite by the fictionist. but harry and tom dont grow up together per se but harry accidentaly goes back in time for one year and befriends tom. then he comes back to the future but tom tom finds out a way to follow him and thats where the story pics up. they do mature together and tom definitely gets changed through the friendship with harry, but they dont really grow up together. nevertheless its a really great ff. sorry it doesnt really fit what you askfor but i couldnt resist recommending it nontheless :)

** There is Reaching Through Time by Ethril - they grow up together in an interesting fashion. Tom is still Tom but Harry is definitely a positive influence on him. I haven't read the last chapters yet. I am waiting for the final one so I can binge all 3!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] is my favorite story with that premise. I'm sad that it's a dead fic, but the existing portions are substantial and very well written. I highly recomend it if you haven't read it yet.

*** Twist of Fate is one of my favorite fic out there! I think this is the fic that introduced me to "Harry grows up with Tom" niche fic.
