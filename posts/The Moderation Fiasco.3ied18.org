First things first, I want to say that we definitely could have handled this better. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] has acknowledged that he should've talked to me first. We should've been able to explain what was going on before any new mods were appointed. The lack of transparency was a mistake. I don't think it would've been too much to ask to give us a chance to respond before the accusations and conspiracy theories started, though.

That being said, [[/u/kemistreekat]] will be staying on as a mod and I am very disappointed in how she's been treated so far. She has plenty of experience as a moderator and has done nothing but express a desire to help out and /become part of the community/, and certain people have done their best to try to kill that desire. I ask that you give her a chance.

As I understand it, [[/u/CatholicGuy]]'s main objective was simply to make sure the various subs he founded had sufficient mod personnel and resources. The previous round of mod appointments was done not by [[/u/CatholicGuy]] but by a former mod who decided to look for more active people to appoint before he resigned. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] couldn't be expected to know about that or that people might expect the same in the future. Though, as I said, he's acknowledged his mistake in how he went about it here.

I understand that some people think that mods should be drawn from the community, and I may appoint one or two more. If you'd like to be considered please post here with why, what you think you'd bring to the mod team and any specific ideas you have for improving the sub.

Being part of the HP network does not mean that things are suddenly going to change drastically. The sky is not falling, folks.


** Seems to me the crux of the issue is that mods of the sub should be knowledgeable in subject of the sub. That's not to say [[/u/kemistreekat]] won't be a great mod, but it's never fun to have someone that's a mod who has barely stepped foot inside the sub.

It is a hired gun come in to mod a sub in which the community has never seen [[/u/kemistreekat]]. It was extremely short sighted not to see the community would be upset about it.

Then again, I think [[/u/CatholicGuy]] might have thought that the sub, not being as active as others, would not care if a new mod was introduced.

[[/r/hpfanfiction]] isn't a particularly busy sub, but I do think there's certain people around that contribute a lot. Does that necessarily mean they'll make a good mod? Not necessarily.

Point being - this being a sub as small as it is, the few users who regularly post here are pretty passionate about it. There's hardly even any need for a mod in terms of restricting content. If anything, more should be done to encourage discussions and debate.

My recommendations, not that anyone should take heed of them, would be:

1. Just give ownership to [[/u/denarii]].

2. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] should just let it go as there isn't any point to hold ownership of it.

3. Let [[/u/kemistreekat]] stay on and take one more from the community and I think you have a good balance in someone experienced modding subs and someone who is actually part of the community, so they can better create more content.

I'm probably one of the people that complained the most. I've also tried to welcome her to a new community, joked with her, pm'd her and made fic requests and I actually think she'd probably be a really good mod at the end of the day.

That all being said I won't apologise for thinking it's ridiculous that if we're getting a new mod that it should be someone from inside the community and I resent being accused of "accusations and conspiracy theories". Frankly I don't think there were any and as for not giving you long enough to respond what did you expect? There wasn't even an announcement for the new mod, how long should we have waited before letting you know we weren't happy?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Where? Cause it sure as shit wasn't to anyone in the community he wants to be in charge of. Honestly he should be the one making this announcement rather than putting it on you.

Well no really he should be stepping down and letting you be the top mod since he's not actually active here.

I actually wouldn't mind being a mod if I thought we needed any more but it doesn't seem like we do. From what [[/u/catholicguy]] said in the other thread he appointed the new mod because she asked to be. Not because of any real need for one.

As for ideas for improving the sub you could probably just flick though the meta tag and see the numerous ones that the community has suggested in the past while and run with that.

There isn't an overlap with anything other than religion as there is nothing else which dictates values and justifies peoples views.

** We hardly need any mods at all here, and CatholicGuy has done fuck all in this community in quite a while. There's a certain point in abandoning a subreddit to its community that you no longer are it's master, and Catholic is way beyond that. Furthermore for him to go and add someone who not only knows nothing about the subreddit community but also knows nothing about the subject it covers, that is complete and utter bullshit.

What's the angle here, that's what I don't get. Not only were the mods doing fine as it was, if they were not there are more than enough active people here who are willing to help out. So what purpose does it serve to bring in someone else? A violent take over? Someone paid to promote/remove specific things? You shouldn't just arbitrarily decide to screw around with an established functional community that way. The only result is people leaving.

And frankly, deleting the other thread is bullshit too and only makes it look like you're hiding what was said and by whom on both sides of the issue. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3i96gk/ukemistreekat_is_a_new_moderator/][Link]].

The only purpose "streamlining" moderation between all the most popular and active HP subs would be to unilaterally ban a specific subset of content or user without others noticing. This sub and the HP network is simply not big enough to have to deal with this kind of bullshit, nor will it recover from a resulting fracture.

As I made clear in the other thread, I do not personally have an objection to you being a mod here. You seem competent, interested in HP, and friendly.

But I think it's a little disingenuous (hopefully unintentionally) to present the objection to your modship this way. The reason that people are objecting was stated pretty plainly, and it is:

1. That there was no transparency. It sounds like the mod team is now aware that the community wants more transparency, and is willing to make this a priority going forward. Fantastic!

2. That you were not an active member of this community in the past, and that in making you a mod, [[/u/CatholicGuy]] may have looked over some longstanding members who have contributed a lot to this community. Some felt this was unfair, or had their feelings hurt. I don't think there's really anything you can do about this, except try to be understanding that, ultimately, this isn't about you.

If it is really true that this experience has soured you on this community, and you are no longer interested in being a member of it, then that is a shame.

** For what it's worth, the whole hiring of the new mod was handled badly, but on the flipside, she seems quite nice and a decent person. I've not encountered her as a mod before, but I'm sure that if she was hired and is /still/ a moderator then she must be good at her job. So I'm fine with that.

Secondly; I think you all (yes, all of you) responded to this very professionally and it's nice that you're taking the community's concerns into account with regards to future mod hirings.

Best of luck with everything in the future!

Forgive me, but you were the one who created an entirely new subreddit for HPfanfiction. It's exactly that kind of action which really splinters a community, moreso than mods being hired under the table. I say that not to provoke an emotive response from you, but because I know from experience that this is the case. I've seen subs splinter and fragment into smaller ones. It fracturing the community on big ones (like [[/r/poetry]] and [[/r/poetry_critics]]) and on smaller ones like the RP subs I frequent/mod.

Miscommunication or a mistake by people like the mods can be amended by a statement from them either collectively or individually where they apologise to the community. That is all. All of this has happened here. But it's people in the community who cause the drama in their reaction to the initial offence and by how they handle the apology.

#+begin_quote
  I really love this sub, and I don't want it to deteriorate.
#+end_quote

Creating another subreddit may cause exactly that. Because it starts a wave of new subs, people discontent with how things are done, either on this sub or on your one. Till eventually you end up with about 5 or 6 subs catering to the same community with similar content, just different modstaff.

Please understand I'm not intentionally trying to cause drama here, I just feel that this needs to be said.

***** Why do you think there needs to be another [[/r/HPfanfiction]] sub? In what way could you sub be considered anything other than a competitor, given that you've suggested that your sub will contain a higher quality of fanfiction? It's hard to argue that it's purely to keep a "backup", since there are many many ways to hold onto the content/past posts in a sub, and creating a new sub isn't really one of them. You're not going to be preserving posts, you're going to be encouraging people to post new ones.

I also don't understand how you can act as though you don't want to splinter the community after creating an alternative sub and putting it in your flair. And /regardless of whether it's justified or not,/ creating an alternative community does inherently split the existing community and hurt the existing sub.

You cannot have your cake and eat it too. Either admit that you want people to migrate or commit to this subreddit. And honestly, I'm not sure how willing the mods are going to be to consider your application. How do they know that you won't jump ship the moment they vote against one of your suggestions?

** Hey all!

I'd like to apologise for the tone of my comments in the other thread. As an outsider myself, I would have left alone and looked at it more objectively, but I didn't. What I saw was the majority (or more likely vocal minority) piling on [[/u/kemistreekat]] and rushed to defend her without properly looking at the situation and calming down a bit. I have to say that as a first impression to the sub is not a good one and I agree wholeheartedly with [[/u/denarii]] regarding the behaviour of those people.

I won't, however, apologise for my content of what I said - regardless of her being as much as an outsider to this sub and fanfiction as I am, I think she'll do well. I can't say anything towards her work in [[/r/Slytherin]], but she's an excellent mod over in [[/r/harrypotter]] and I hope she'll carry her great work over here too - bear in mind that moderation is fairly similar regardless of the sub. From what I gather from the other thread, she's been removing spam, approving posts, and other things that don't need a knowledge of fanfiction to accomplish.

*To reiterate - I'm sorry for my tone, not what I said. I won't say anything more of the matter - of the many comments I got yesterday, only one was written on what I percieved to be a calm tone. And I'd rather not deal with the alternative.*

It bothers me that at any point someone who has no involvement in the community had the ability to add another person who has no involvement in the community, without so much as an announcement. And still with the shit-storm I'm stirring up he still has yet to comment on it, thus continuing to leave open the question of whether it is a nefarious act or just an ignorant one. Either way he should not be the one in charge of those decisions and frankly denarii going along with it is worse because he knows how long the line of people competent enough to moderate was. All it would have taken was a little communication and instead catholic just buggers off to who knows where, and denarii continues on business as usual.

I do hope that the mods see this reaction for what it really is: an expression of the members' interest in and passion for this community. That can only be a plus. Who wants a community full of people that couldn't care less about it?

** The other post you made about new mod applications and as deleted or something, so I'll post it here and PM you as well.

--------------

Hello,

I'm applying to be a mod to help the community in any way possible and to make the sub more transparent, so it can foster all the usual, fun content without any drama.

I believe I can bring a voice to the community as well as help the subreddit become an even better place to have discussions and feature content. I will be happy to help limit the amount of spam in the community as well as help implement the ideas stated in the next paragraph. I'm also really productive and detail-oriented and have quite a bit of free time on my hands. I also have some modding experience in other subreddits.

I have some ideas for the subreddit:\\
* *Wiki*: This idea had come up before but hadn't really worked out. I want to implement the wiki and curate the content on the sub. I believe I can do this if we gather a dedicated team, we can make lists of good content by category, pairing, etc. for the community to enjoy.\\
* *Author Panel:* I think we could have monthly or weekly panels with fanfic authors (AMA-like but regarding the author's stories and writing in general).\\
* *Writing Tips:* I think we could post writing tips for readers wanting to get into writing or for writers trying to get better.\\
* *Writing Prompts:* like challenges for the community (think of the Severitus challenge).\\
* *Guides:* Guides for writing and beginner readers of fanfiction. I remember when I started reading fanfiction around 5 years ago, and I was so confused on how to get to the good content.

I hope you find these ideas creative and something we can implement.

--------------

And a note regarding the recent moderation "scandal":

I did not post the question on an effort to defy the mods or anything. I was doing the survey and came across a new mod, and I was quite puzzled. I'm quite thorough in everything I do, so I looked into it some more. But I don't totally regret inciting the discussion because many good points came up.

But some hate came out as well, on [[/u/kamistreekat]], [[/u/CatholicGuy]] and on [[/u/denarii]]. I did not like this or condone it at all. [[/u/kamistreekat]] and [[/u/denarii]] did not do anything wrong, and it would be great to serve as mods along you both!

What I'm trying to say is, please view as any other candidate and be fair in my review.

Thanks.
