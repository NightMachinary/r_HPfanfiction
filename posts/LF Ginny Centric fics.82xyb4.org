Not actually that big of a Ginny fan, but I think she deserves a bit of love after trolling through a whole bunch of Ginny-bashing fics.

I've read The Changeling, which was a fantastic read. Any pairing works, femslash or het or no pairing at all. I would prefer it to be less focused on romance, but I'm not being picky here because I'm aware Ginny centric fics are kind of a rarity in itself.

Any recs would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance, guys! :)

EDIT: Whoa, lots of material to work through here. Thanks so much for the recs all :D

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** I love The Changeling! It really expands the outlook of Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11695139/1/Gelassenheit][Gelassenheit]] by HauntedCinders is pretty decent from I remember. It's a MCU crossover though. Ginny start off working for SHIELD as a sort of manger for the Avengers Facility. Eventually, she was trained to be an agent. A fascinating read with excellent story telling.

** Knives - linkao3(982121) - is one of my favorites. Ginny attempts to take revenge on Lucius for the diary incident, but it all goes horribly wrong. There's this twisted dependence on both Lucius and Harry that is fascinating.

Secrets - linkao3(882572) - CoS from Ginny's PoV, from the same author as above. Has an interesting re-imagining of Herbology. Warning for realistic children that aren't particularly likeable.

Ginny Weasley and the War for Hogwarts - linkffn(6514733) - Of the many attempted Hogwarts-during-DH stories, this has most innovative elements. So much that the author decided midway that he couldn't stick to canon and that the story was now AU. Not all the plot elements works - there's a vaguely gary stu-ish OC character, for one - but this is an interesting mix of ideas that is consistently engaging.

Slow Night Falling - linkffn(4773795) - Devastatingly emotional tale. There's a wonderfully tremulous undercurrent of emotion throughout, and it works very well for showcasing the confusing nature of the post war world.

Your losses or your arrears - linkffn(7921612) - Delightful slice of life plus mystery story. Ginny takes up investigative journalism along with Hermione.

The One You Never Knew - linkffn(7930712) - A lot of the story is one long intense action scene, with bonus character development. A coming of age, of sorts. linkffn(7930712)

  Who you are, whom you love, and where your loyalties lie - Ginny Weasley had never thought all of that could change as a result of a single night. Her postponed wedding to Harry following a Death Eater prison break was supposed to be a mere set back to the life she'd always dreamed of. But driven by anger and pride, she makes a fateful decision that will upend her entire life.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

  If this were a detective story, Ginny would write it up with the title "The Adventure of the Quidditch Player". Harry says that's a stupidly generic title for a detective story.

**** Thanks! This looks fun.

So The fic I'm sending in return is a short Ginny / Tom Riddle, but it's probably one of my favorite fanfics ever. It's a non-magic AU, which I didn't think I'd like, but the characterization of Ginny dealing with being the middle child is great, and I loved watching this stilted relationship. The fic is "Taste of Sulfur" by Arcacia. I hope you read and enjoy!
