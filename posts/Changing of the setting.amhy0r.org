Is there a fic with a changed setting? I'm looking for less of a 'crossover' vibe, more of the 'if HP took place in the world of..." kind of thing.

Also interested in tweaks, darker settings, and magic reworks.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]: If Harry Potter took part in the world of James Bond and Hogwarts were a school for spies. Complete, covers the full seven years. A little darker as well - the trio racks up quite the body count.

I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy", which is a fusion of Buffy and Harry Potter, set before the canon TV series.

  In the summer following her 4th year at Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is visited by a great-uncle she hasn't met before and learns that the world is older than she thought - and that wizards are not the only ones fighting the forces of Darkness.

** Well there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader][What Wicked Warthings]] which has a lot of setting elments of RWBY incorperated.

Also there's Linkffn(The Last Avatar by The Sorting Cat) which has Hogwarts be a bending school in Avatar's world.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]
