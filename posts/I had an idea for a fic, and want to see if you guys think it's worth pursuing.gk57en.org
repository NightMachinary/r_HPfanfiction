*** Well, without an actual war out there, Dumbledore being alive, getting their NEWTS and completing their studies to maybe have an actual future could be a good enough reason, no?

If Death Eaters aren't running Hogwarts, it's just Ministry "oversight", people wouldn't think about leaving for the same reasons they wouldn't in OotP.

Also, most of the main cast would be 16 for most of it if it's set during canon HBP.

Harry could not leave in OotP. HBP would be doable, but pretty difficult. But after HBP? Harry would be 17, Sirius is still alive and ID's are not hard to forge with magic.

***** Well, sure he could, I just don't see why any of them would want to? It isn't actually normal to not finish the only education you'd have that'd give you a chance at a career and all that rot...

******* I thought the premise was the majority not believing that Voldemort is back, which would require him staying in the shadows and not openly doing much.

The main cast we're concerned with chose not to flee even after the ministry was fully taken over and Dumbledore was dead, so I don't think they would; and while Dumbledore is alive, I don't think he or the order would let the people still at Hogwarts be a part of Order operations as they were in OotP, as one of the order's main goals at a time a war isn't active would be to protect the younger generation.

With Dumbledore alive and already planning to train Harry and take him Horcrux hunting etc as in HBP, I don't think Harry and co would have any further motivation to quit school, especially Hermione Granger being who she is.

I just don't see why them staying at school at 16 is even a question that needs to be explained, it never was in HBP itself.

**** Isn't putting the age of adulthood at 18 just lazy writing, though? The point of divergence is supposed to be the death of Bellatrix in Azkaban and nowhere do I see in the post the word 'AU'. The writer should find a way for the main cast to stay at Hogwarts (maybe they have to do something and it can only be done at Hogwarts with Dumbledore) or they'll have to deal with the fact Harry, Ron and Hermione will most likely want to quit Hogwarts once Harry is major.

** I don't think it would make a good Hogwarts fic. With tight security, the Malfoy plot is done, not that it would come to be. And whatever dark forces make an appearance would be pretty minor and disorganised.

What you describe would work as a more general divergence with the story starting after graduation as it gives everyone time to organise forces. You'd have two dark groups terrorising the country and an almost fascist ministry. That would be a pretty interesting base for a post-Hogwarts (but not post-Voldemort) fic. Diagon was a ghost town in HBP. Now imagine trying to find jobs in that environment. Fudge would still be in office, trying to fuck with Harry&co. And Dumbledore could die to the Horcrux before Harry graduates, making room for lawlessness. Hunting Horcruxes would be a lot more difficult if you have to maintain a public appearance.

Also, a minor nitpick. It would be better if Bellatrix went down very early due to a lucky hit (eg one of the shelves collapses and a big splinter goes through an atery or something like that). That way, the Death Eaters would be suddenly very disorganised and the whole thing falling apart quickly would be more believable.

** I think it's interesting, but if you're really set on the Hogwarts parts, you need to try and make them somehow different from OotP. I'd advise against getting stuck in OotP on steroids
