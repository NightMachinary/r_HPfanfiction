Hi, looking for fics where Harry (or whatever main character) is incredibly powerful, to the point of being able to basically beat Voldy whenever he wants, but the story isn't actually about conflict all that much.

Bonus points if it's not a crack fic.

Preferably Harry is either; a kid, and the story is about the kids having fun with magic and being friends, OR Harry is an adult, and the story is about him raising kids, or teaching kids.

I'm sure there are other setups for a story like this, but the above are the obvious ones.

Examples would be That Universe Over There, or The Ghost of Privet Drive (kinda).

#+begin_quote
  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles.

** Potter Club: linkffn(11987060)

Harry is a time-traveler, and as such has seventh-year knowledge in an 11-year-old body. The fic focuses on him making friends, pulling impressive-but-harmless practical jokes, and heading off Voldemort's return as entirely as possible.

  Seven years is a long time. Especially when you have to do it twice. You know what you have to do and you think you know how you'll do it, so what can you do in the meantime? Live up your family legacy of course. It's time for a changing of the guard; the Marauders time is over, now it's time for Potter Club to step up

*** Was scrolling this thread thinking "if no one mentions this I'm gonna add it". This version of Harry is practically invincible, but the fic and most of the people around him are more concerned about making sure everyone are welcomed and accommodated. His networks of friends are really OP as well, the kind of "we'd just roll over the Wizarding Europe before lunch" OP in another fic, but here they just walk around having fun and ensure everyone are having a good time.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
