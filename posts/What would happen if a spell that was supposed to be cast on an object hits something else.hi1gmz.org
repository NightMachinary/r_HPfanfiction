I've been thinking about the magic in Harry Potter and I'm curious as to what would happen if a spell that was cast on an object hits an something other than the intended target? I'm not entirely sure if this is a fanon thing but in many fics, the Killing curse, and to some extent other spells too, blow up the object it was cast on like how blocking the killing curse with some inanimate object and then banishing it's splinters at the opponent is a common duelling tactic in many fics.

Would a levitation charm that was intended to be cast on a book work if it misses and hits a feather? Would stunners and disarming spells do something if it misses the target and hits the wall or will it just fizzle out? Similarly, will spells designed to be cast on humans, like healing spells, work on animals?


** Most curses, jinxes and hexes would still have their normal effect. Hermione teeth did grow in GoF even though she wasn't the target. Fred lost in ear in DH even though Snape was targeting a Death Eater's hand. The Killing Curse should also work (you need some intent to cast it, but once the light leave the wand, it will kill anyone it touches).

From what we saw in canon, the healing spells need to be targeted toward an injury, so it should not be possible to "miss" it.\\
You don't target Harry with an "/Episkey/", you target the gash on Harry's arm. If he also has an injury on say his feet, you need to cast the spell a second time to deal with it. No idea if the spell (or any healing spell for that matter) work differently with animals.

Focused spells like the attraction and the levitation charm should also not be possible to miss. The caster need to focus on the item he wants to affect so it's not like he could levitate a book rather than a feather, and since it's not a "light beam" kind of spell, the aiming is secondary.

** Magic is about intent soo...maybe? The healing spells working on animals is probably possible except for a few specialized ones due to the difference in anatomy. In linkao3(Protection: The Sword and the Shield) it's a very minor plot point that dodging spells is highly difficult due to the intent behind the spells hitting them meaning that you have to wait until the last second to dodge. But this seems to be a good plot point. Like if Luna only knew animal healing spells and one of her friends are hurt she might not be able to heal them. Idk, but this sounds like a good idea.

  Lily Potter's sacrifice provided the shield but that was only part of the ritual. James Potter's sacrifice provided the sword. A knowledgeable super powered Potter heir enters the wizarding world and will shake it to its foundations. HARRY/HAREM & RON/HAREM & NEVILLE/HAREM

** The thing with blocking AK I think came from the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel in OotP - Dumbledore animated something that jumped in front and exploded iirc.

Any time magic is shown interacting with the world it does so physically so a miscast would still have /some/ effect at least, and probably something close to its original intent.

Healing spells would depend largely on what they actually do, while a levitation spell would probably be the same regardless of its target.
