** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. In its second year, recently returned to weekly updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826][An Unfound Door]] - Very talented, yet very flawed Harry spends most of his time away from his classmates. Hidden in secret rooms he spends his time learning, experimenting and making drugs. Infrequent updates.

He grew up with James.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

Grew up with his parents.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. On hiatus.

It's only later revealed who Harry grew up with.

** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph14) is a heavy AU that has him raised by Lily, after James dies at war.

linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) has him raised in a Muggle institution that (accidentally) ends up specialising in Muggleborns whose parents can't handle the Accidental Magic.

linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) has Harry raised by The Order in exile in France.

There's also the Grey Maiden series, where he is raised in North America by a Ravenclaw OC who is Lily's friend from Hogwarts. You'll have to google around for the title.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

**** Regrettably, they don't. All of them have more than adequate grammar, spelling, and dialogue, and general language use. They are well-written. This is regrettable, because if they were written poorly, they wouldn't be nearly as popular.

Now, when it comes to characterisation, plotting, and themes, all three have rather severe problems, enough that I anti-rec them whenever they come up.

***** Other stuff aside, the pacing is very important part of good writing, and both fics are paced really badly. Especially HPMoR, you could cut it down to the third of its current length without losing any actual content.

****** I consider pacing on a higher level than that, just below plotting.

On point, yes and no. I've concluded that Harry Crow is paced well for what it's supposed to be: feel-good pablum where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average. The pacing is actually a feature, not a bug: you can keep reading and reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

HPMoR feels like the author shoved every idea he had for showing off how clever he is into the fic. What We're Fighting For, I don't remember the quality of pacing, but that's because I found plot and characterisation too distasteful to even pay attention to pacing.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
