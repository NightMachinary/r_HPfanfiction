While I'm really impressed by all the really long and intricate fic in this fandom, it's a busy time of year and getting sucked into a multi-part epic is not really an option :/ I'd love some recs for gen fics or series that are shorter than 30 000 words total so that I can actually get some work done!


** I'll leave one of my recent favourites here - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]] by dirgewithoutmusic, a beautiful Raising Harry fic where Petunia lets Harry into her heart, but isn't OOC at all. About 3.5 k words long

** Short stories are the best! If you look through my recommendation history, most of them are on the shorter end. Try these:

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315682][Serenity Hill]] - Charlie's dragontaming years, framed by a story from his childhood.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] - the next generation Weasley family slice of life, though the good and bad

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322079][A Lightness]] - Lavender Brown, through her Hogwarts years.
