Most marriage law fics just use the law as an excuse to hook Hermione up with their chosen pureblood and/or Death Eater, usually with some sort of justification involving strengthening bloodlines. The entire thing tends to come off as very dystopian and pureblood elitist, even when the story takes place after Voldemort is defeated. And the rest usually make it an explicit attempt on the part of a still corrupt and/or racist government to control Harry, Hermione, or whoever else the protagonist is.

In this case, the Ministry is actually well-intentioned. They realize that the recent wars have decimated their population, and it will take too long to recover without help. So their solution is to force or heavily incentivize witches and wizards to marry muggles instead of each other. That would essentially double the number of magical families each generation and save the magical population. And you still get all the genetic diversity/strengthened bloodline benefits that marriage law fics love.

And as a bonus, this will also curb a lot of the racism that caused the last two wars. It's a lot harder to look down on muggleborns when one of your parents is a muggle and you know that you'll marry a muggle someday. And everyone would have to at least learn enough about the muggle world to date muggles. Sure, there will probably still be plenty of classism from the rich and "noble" families, but it's at least a step in the right direction.

By my math, this law would end with every muggle in Britain married to a witch or wizard within about 14 generations. And while that is a long way off, I imagine that the Statute of Secrecy would become obsolete much sooner than that.

And if you're still not sold on the idea, imagine someone like Pansy or Daphne desperate to marry Dudley because "at least he already knows about magic so I won't have to pretend to be a muggle."


** Draco felt a feeling of immense dread desceding upon him. He might have been a proper wizard, a former deatheater, a man who once upon have looked the Dark Lord in the eye and helped his evil plans.

Yet the task before him seemed even more insurmountable than figuring out how to make the backdoor to Hogwarts work for the Deatheaters. Claustrophoby threatened to encompass him at any second, his ears long deafned by the overwhelming noise, the stench of shapeless mass of bodies swirling behind cloying his nostrils. He briefly considered admitting to posession of dark artifacts, if only to escape to Azkaban, the place now seeming a favourable, quiet choice.

Yet he could not, for the fate of his family, a burden of countless past generations, was resting on his shoulders.

He looked at a glass before him, dark liquid swirling in indescernible patterns. His resolve steeled, he downed in in one go, unflinchingly.

"/Alright, might as well get to it"/ he thought, turning to the girl that stood beside him.

His resolve steeled, he asked the dreaded question: "Would... would you care for a dance, miss?"

**** // Reporting for duty! XD //

Say what you will about Draco Malfoy, but he was certainly not bad looking. Silky hair, aristocratic features, body lean from playing Quiddich - it was quite enough to get him a dance.

One dance turned into ten, and before he knew it he was already set to meet the girl for a date.

Dates, too, multiplied as if by magic, and before long they were meeting regularly, and Draco was no longer forcing himself to play a role, no longer suffering through a duty. he was actually enjoying himself for once.

It was certainly a change from the post-Voldemort society. Even after his family being declared innocent (mostly) people still looked at them with suspicion. It was one of the reasons he was even going through with this, to begin with. While he had more than enough funds to pay a bounty and thus a right to make his own matchmaking choices, a Malfoy doing so would be subject to more scurtiny. Too much.

There was nothing like that amongst muggles. There, he was a good looking man with an exotic name and an endearing lack of knowledge of technology. He knew a bit, but not enough to have to feign interest when a conversation partner descended into a more deeply muggle topic. Good looking, great dancer, excellent listener... It was actually a wonder it took him a while to start enjoying his trips to muggle pubs and dance clubs.

That led him to the current situation, meeting his girlfriend's friends at her house. Not quite as stressful as meeting the parents would be, he reasoned, but he was still quite out of his depth.

He steeled himself, took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

***** During writing the first part i've thought of naming the girl Kasey as homage to one of my favourite fics "What's her name in Hufflepuff", but it didn't fit the flow of dialogue so i've scrapped it. I'd say we can get some more mileage out Srebryakov... that is, Victoria Silver for localisation purposes.

***

At first, Draco was apprehensive of meeting his girlfriend's frieds. He was sure that finding one likeable muggle didn't show the full picture - after all, he reasoned, could you imagine somoene's idea about purebloods be shaped by likes of Goyle?

After a round of introductions, gifting everyone a beer from a crate he brought (Malfoy's own brewery - he refused to drink the piss most of muggle bars sold as 'beer') he gained some insight as to the purpose of this meeting.

"So, Draco", Victoria asked, "Have you ever heard of RPGs? You know, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, that sort of stuff?"

"Not really, no", he answered. He might have lived in dungeons for the most of his schoolyears, and was, after a fashion, named after dragons, but he was pretty sure that wasn't a thing to bring up at the moment. "What're those about?"

"Oh, you're going to love it", Victoria smiled, "We were going to have our monthly session today, i've figured i should introduce you to it sooner rather than later, especially since you seemed to like talking about fantasy stuff"

Draco nodded. He recalled having some rather interesting discussions about the things his girlfriend referred to as 'fantasy'. He found that muggle fascination with all thigs magic a tad humorous and abusrd at first, but he'd soon realised that it made sense. Magic was, after all, great, so it shouldn't be surprising that those without magical ability were longing for it.

"Alright", he agreed.

"Awesome! Well, i guess you can look through the rulebooks and see a bit of us playing, and then, if you like it, you could maybe join us?" Victoria asked, passing him some slightly worn out booklet.

"Sure", Draco acquiesced, accepting the papers. He glanced through the pages, trying to parse some of the rules while the others started setting up for the game. Some of the things seemed a tad absurd ("/Wizards limited to cast only a few spells a day?!", "Elves?!!!"),/ but he figured it made sense to make the game enjoyable for those that didn't choose a magical character.

Soon, he was drawn to observe and listen as a tale of an epic adventure unfolded beofre his eyes. The group of friends, acting as their choosen adventurers, adventuring through forests and caves, battling mystical monsters. It was hypnotysing, and slightly surreal, to see people he once thought to be no better than animals behaving just like any group of friends, cheerful and chatty and happy, imagining themselves to be something fantastical.

He sat, engrossed in the session, eventually joining alongside current gamemaster to lead the adventure along, throwing in a few ideas from the wizarding world here and there ("Plants that scream so loud they kill anyone when pulled out of the ground? Wicked!"). Eventually, the meeting wound down and he left alongisde Victoria to see her to her Tube line.

"So, Draco", Victoria asked as they approached the station, "Did you like meeting my friends?"

"Actually, yes. It was quite... interesting. And fun. And maybe enlightening?" He anwsered.

Victoria lauhged; "Ah, i know we're somewhat nerdy, but i'm glad you've enjoyed it. Would you like to join us on our future sessions?"

"Certainly", Draco said, "It seemed fun. Altough, i kind of liked helping the gamemaster, do you think your friends would agree to play a campaing if i came up with one?", he asked with a small amount of wariness.

"Oh, no dobut, as long as the story is good. Maybe show it to me beforehand so we can see if everything works well?", she asked.

"Fine by me. So, i guess i see you tomorrow?"

"Oh, yes. Same place as the last time, at 5?"

"Of course. See you!"

"See you too!", Victoria replied, and planted a kiss on his lips before entering the Tube station.

Draco lifted his hand to his lips, a tingle of something new emotion running through his body.

"/Screw the dark lord, and all those pureblood morons",/ he thought. "/That, that right there? That was some real magic"./

Will he tell Victoria that magic exists by telling her that everything from the campaign was real? Will he gloat to Harry that his girlfriend is a better hero because she defeated Voldemort by campaign/year five?

***** You could have the process for obtaining a marriage license involve a check for love potions and other mind magics.

Any story where a small number of people have a disproportionate amount of power can easily turn to dystopia. And unfortunately, the Harry Potter world is basically built on that concept. So any fic, especially the ones that don't just ignore the muggle world, could easy turn or be seen as potentially dystopic. But fortunately, most fics are happy to ignore or erase issues like that when they get in the way of a good story, and that's what I'm hoping to see here.

****** The problem I have here is that you're expecting pureblood supremacists to just set aside their prejudices to marry a muggle immediately following a war fought because of those prejudices. This is not unlike telling southern white men that they have to marry black women during Reconstruction. Some may learn better. More will find a way to take it, or get around the law in some way, and then you've given a group of abusers a set of perfect targets.

Prejudice and hate cannot be legislated away. It took 100 years for the most basic civil rights to be granted to Black men and women after the American Civil War, and we're still nowhere near true equality 50 years later. I recognize what you're trying to do, but the concept is horrifying to me.

***** There's a fic that's no longer up that talked about this and it doesn't even have to be awful people to become an awful circumstance. Most wizarding homes don't seem to have basic functionality usable by someone without magic (lights, appliances running on electricity, locks on doors). So, that really easily becomes them being prisoners in their homes. Additionally, if they are likely to result in wizarding children who often manifest ability as toddlers/young children, you have less power, especially if children see one parent using magic and the other one not. Also, what incentive do non-magical folk have to enter into these marriages? The normal method is that if you don't comply you get kicked out of the wizarding world, so like...what kind of force are you using to get muggles to opt in to this?

*** Because everything we see in canon says that squibs are very uncommon. In fact, magic seems to stick in families so well that having even one magical parent gives you a a very good chance to have magic. There is no reason to think that the child of a magical and a muggle is likely to be a squib, unless you want to argue that the racist Death Eater propaganda was right.

I am sure that a few squibs will pop up every generation, but I worked under the assumption that the number of muggleborns popping up every generation would counteract that. And the numbers are all rough enough that you would have to have a ridiculous percentage of kids being squibs or muggleborns to throw the estimates off by more than a few generations.

But if you're interested, the actual math looked like this:

1) Ignore everything Rowling has said about numbers, because she is very bad at math.

2) Assume that the population of magical Britain is somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000. That matches with most of the reasonable estimates I've seen, though it might be a bit on the high side.

3) According to the numbers I found, about 20% of Britain is under 18. If the ratios are the same in the magical world, that's about 2000 to 3000 kids who are almost definitely not married yet. There are also going to be plenty of older people who are not married yet, and plenty of people who choose not to marry at all, though the culture we see in magical Britain seems likely to encourage people to marry and have kids. Altogether, I estimated that the first generation following the marriage law would be about 4000 people.

4) Assume a birth rate of about 2. Britain's current birth rate is about 1.7, but I figure that an active repopulation effort would encourage people to have more kids. And it gives us a nice, round number to work with. Note that this number accounts for people who choose not to get married or to not have kids.

5) Math happens. That's 4000 muggles marrying magicals in the first generation, who have 8000 kids, who marry 8000 more muggles, and so on. [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4000*2%5E%28x-1%29+%3D+.3*56000000][This hits my rough estimate of the current marriable population of Britain in just over 13 generations]]. [[https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_2002_world_population_to_2300.pdf][And current projections say the population of the UK is probably going to stay pretty flat through 2300]], so that number is still a good target.

6) Other people look at my math and tell me why I'm wrong, because I'm probably not great at statistics.

I'll also note here that obviously the law would have to be repealed before it reached the point where every muggle in Britain was marrying a magical. Honestly, it could be repealed after two or three generations. But I'm hoping that people would just get used to it and forget that things weren't always that way before they remember to repeal it. I'm also not sure at what point the Statute of Secrecy becomes obsolete. My numbers are just how many muggles are marrying magicals each generation. Realistically, their immediate family members would probably become aware of magic, which boosts the numbers. And surely there is some critical mass at which it becomes all but impossible to hide magic.

**** Squibs are uncommon when both parents are magical. You're talking about mixed marriages here, which we can expect to produce different results. We don't have that many examples of mixed marriages. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][Lockhart]] was the only magical child in his family. He had two squib sisters. There's also Lupin, an only child, which doesn't tell us much.

We don't know that magic is inherited in some straightforward Mendelian way, but there are no real examples of a trait just spreading through a population (unless some selection pressure is spurring evolution) in the way you describe.

***** I am inclined to ignore Pottermore whenever possible.

Snape, Seamus, possibly Dean, and of course Voldemort are also examples. Obviously there's some confirmation bias involved, since squibs would be unlikely to show up at Hogwarts.

But I think the best piece of evidence is the Creevey brothers. Muggleborns are rare enough that the chances of two of them being in the same family are nearly impossible, unless there's some strong genetic component involved. Or Mrs. Creevey was having an affair with a wizard, but that's still a point in my favor.

The selection pressure is that magic is awesome, and everyone who knows about magic will want their kids to have magic. I imagine that squibs would probably be treated as muggles for the purposes of this law. And those squibs would probably be seen as ideal spouses for many witches and wizards, because they already know about magic, and (if you are right about mixed marriages), their kids are probably more likely to be born with magic. And the squibs would probably be doing their best to hook up with witches and wizards to keep magic in their lives.

So the magical population and the percentage of the total population that is part of the magical world will grow slower than I predicted, but it will still grow. And more importantly, almost no one is going to want to leave. Squibs will stay in the magical world, marry magicals, and have magical kids. Same with siblings of muggleborns and even the families of muggles who marry magicals. Pretty soon they start hanging out in Diagon Alley in their obviously muggle clothes to try to catch someone's eye. Then they get a job there or move into Hogsmeade to spend more time in the magical world. Then some stores start opening up to cater to the muggles and squibs because there are enough of them there to support it. And then oops, we've accidentally created an integrated society.

So maybe my math is wrong, and maybe some of my assumptions are flawed, but I think that the end goal I see is still possible, even if my timeline is off. Besides, it's all up to the author anyway.

Wizarding families also tend to go out of their way to sweep squib family members under the rug. Even Ron mentioned that his mom has an accountant cousin or something that they don't talk to.

****** The Creevey brothers are muggleborns, and so don't tell us anything about the children of mixed marriages.

If there is a genetic component involved in magical inheritance (and we can't assume that, since it's not like magic follows scientific laws in general) I would assume magic acts like other genetically inherited traits like eye color. A couple with brown eyes can have two kids with blue eyes. That doesn't mean that the blue-eyed trait is taking over the population. Without selection pressure, ratios of various traits will stay about the same, or sometimes drift randomly.

If you're saying there's selection pressure for magical ability, that's another argument entirely. If a trait has an evolutionary advantage, it will spread in the population, no marriage law necessary. In canon, magical ability seems to confer a evolutionary disadvantage, considering how few children magical families tend to have, and how many characters die without reproducing at all.

******* My point with the Creeveys is that magic at least follows similar patterns to genetics. Something about the Creevey parents made them very likely to have magical kids. Just like something about every magical couple makes them very likely to have magical kids.

I'm pretty sure that natural selection and the like start to disappear once you have intelligent beings mucking about with things. Magic is definitely an evolutionary advantage. Even if you never cast a spell, it seems to provide increased resilience and lifespan. The problems came from societal pressures, wars, and isolation from the rest of the world.

******** If you're going to assume that magic is genetically inherited like other traits, you need to understand how other traits are genetically inherited. Please read about Mendelian genetics. Make sure you understand [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square][Punnet squares]].

This Mendelian model is too simple to adequately explain the inheritance of many real traits, and also can't account for both muggleborns and squibs. But at least it demonstrates how in every generation, if there isn't any selection pressure, there are the same genes in the same ratios. You don't have one trait taking over a population just because it's cool.

Natural selection still works, there are just different selection pressures. Now, being too stupid to know how birth control works gives an evolutionary advantage. I assume having access to magical birth control would be an evolutionary disadvantage, no matter how much of a personal advantage it is.

********* Yes, I know how Punnett squares work, and also that they are an oversimplification.

I also now completely understand why some people complain about people attacking prompts for no reason. Your "insights" have added nothing except "this wouldn't work because I don't want it to." But anyone who wanted to write a story based on it easily could say that it works without violating canon.

If you want to argue that the Death Eaters were right and muggles and mudbloods need to be kept away from the perfect pureblood genepool, please go do it somewhere else.

********** You're not acting like you know how Punnet squares work.

A prompt is one thing. A calculation is another. Your calculation is based on some false premises.

I don't know where you got this perfect pureblood gene pool idea. I just said, and the Punnet squares say, that genes for magic (if there are any) will stay at a constant level in the population whether there's a marriage law or not, unless there's some selection pressure on them.

Edited to add: Would an example help? Let's make a simplified model of how magical inheritance might work: It's controlled by just one gene, the M gene. M is dominant, and gives magical ability. m is recessive, and gives no magical ability.

One pureblood MM wizard moves to a town of just muggles, and marries a muggle, mm. They have two kids, both Mm, both magical. So, in one generation, the magical population doubled. Happy?

Next generation, those Mm kids marry mm muggles. Each couple has two kids: one magical Mm, one squib mm. This generation still just has two magical people in it.

Next generation, those magical kids both marry muggles and have two kids, again one magical Mm, one squib mm. There are still just two magical people in this generation.

The magical population might increase or decrease a bit due to genetic drift, but it will tend to stay about the same unless there's some selection pressure on it.

** I don't think this would work very well. Not the intentions but in actuality it would be damn near impossible for a lot of wizards to maintain a relationship with a muggle long enough to get married.
