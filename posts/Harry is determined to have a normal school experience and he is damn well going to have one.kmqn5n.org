Looking for fic recommendations where Harry *adamantly refuses* to be dragged into insane plots and instead focuses on having a normal school year.

- Quirrel going after the Philosopher's stone? Who cares, what is the answer to this charms question?

- Hearing weird sounds coming from the walls and now there's some writing in blood near a petrified cat? I'd rather turn this hedgehog into a pincushion.

- My name popped up from the Goblet of Fire? Not interested in the tournament. No, not going to attend. No, screw magical contracts. I didn't sign anything, I'm not part of a contract.

So basically other people, hopefully adults, have to actually get off their asses and fix the problems in Hogwarts because Harry's not available.

  In a world in which Harry's spoiled brat of a brother is thought to be the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry feels no obligation to be heroic. Crackfic. Oneshot. Parody of Wrong Boy-Who-Lived fics.

** I can't remember the name exactly, but think there is a fic called Harry Potter & The Year Of Settling In where Harry, Hermione and Ron just ignore everything to have a normal school year.

Oh yeah no, definitely not the one I was thinking of - seemed to have mixed up the titles (though kinda feel like this title would have fit perfectly).

The one I was talking about was this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/29/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] - though keep in mind, haven't read this yet, merely subscribed and wait for it to finish.
