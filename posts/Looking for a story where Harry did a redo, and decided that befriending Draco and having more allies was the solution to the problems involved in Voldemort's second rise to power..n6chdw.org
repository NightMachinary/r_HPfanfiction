I've been trying to locate a story I read a long time ago, but sifting through tags and keywords isn't working. The basic premise is that Harry travels back in time before the end of the books: I believe it was after he died in the forest, though I could be wrong. He ends up back at the Dursleys before Hagrid appears, and decides that his biggest problem was that he didn't have enough friends and that too many people were railroaded into having to pick a side. Or to put it another way, most of the people who followed Voldemort in the school did so because they had no other options. It was Death Eaters or bust.

To that end, Harry goes out of his way to befriend Draco, and manages to balance being part of Draco's group while still keeping Hermione and Ron. I'm /pretty/ sure he still got himself sorted into Gryffindor, but it could have been a Slytherin Harry story. I actually don't recall. What matters is that he reaches out to other houses and cultivates relationships with as many people as possible. If it was a Slytherin Harry, it was a Slytherin Harry that was still friends with Ron and Hermione.

As a direct consequence of befriending Draco in Diagon, Narcissa takes a liking to him, and Harry gets Christmas presents and invitations to visit the Malfoys. Narcissa's attitude towards Harry causes Lucius to mellow from openly antagonistic to aloof and neutral.

I don't recall Dumbledore being particularly evil or manipulative. However, Snape was quite a bit softer, again with the implication that it's because Harry befriended Draco, his godson.

The story was abandoned, as most are, but before it was, it had made it through to around third year or so. The biggest stand-out scene that I remember, and what the story managed to cover before it stopped, is that because Harry was more social and had more friends, he received invitations to many different Christmas parties from the purebloods. Even though the various families do not get along, they still make it a point to stagger the timing of their parties across several days, so that all of their acquaintances and friends can make it to the parties they wish to attend without offending anyone. Harry makes the decision to attend all of them, which has Narcissa throw a fit, because while it's fairly normal to attend the parties thrown by the Diggories and the Longbottoms, some of the families, like the Notts and the Lestranges, are so dark and have such a bad reputation that even the Malfoys don't typically attend those parties. So for Harry to attend those parties, and by extension bring Draco along with him, compels her to drag Snape into things, and get him to chaperone the boys to keep them safe.

Additionally, Snape actually warns Harry against being friends with children from the Nott, Lestrange, and Rosier families, because "you are the Boy-Who-Lived, and one day they will have to declare a side. They will not side with Dumbledore." Harry defends his choices by saying that he's not asking Neville, Theodore, or Draco to side with Dumbledore. He's asking them to side with himself. He's giving them a third option.

Those two features, the Christmas parties that concerned Narcissa and Harry advertising himself as a third choice in the conflict between Dumbledore and Voldemort, are what really stood out strongly in the story. However, after sifting through several hundred stories involving time travel and Draco Malfoy, I've found nothing but a disturbing amount of slash. Apparently "Harry befriends Draco" isn't really a recognized sub-genre. I have also checked time travel Harry groups and political Harry groups, and still couldn't find what I was looking for.

In addition, I think. I /think/. That the plot of second year had Draco being the one who got the diary, and Narcissa tore stripes out of Lucius over it when everything fell out. And the reason Draco wrote in it was because he was jealous that Harry wasn't willing to put their own friendship first over people like Neville and Ron (Draco, Ron, and everybody else did NOT become friends with each other immediately, and Harry was pretty much the sole element holding all of them together). But even though I'm pretty sure that happened in this story, I'm not as absolutely certain of it as I am the parties and the declaring himself as a third option choice for people who feel they have no other choice. It could be from somewhere else, but I don't think it is.

That event is also part of what forces Lucius and Narcissa away from Voldemort's side of the fence, because Draco nearly died because of the diary. However, since the story ended before Voldemort was resurrected, we never really got to see any of the big fallout.

Does anyone have any guesses for what this fic was?

Or, for that matter, suggestions for stories with a political Harry or a Harry who tries to have lots of friends?

*** It's definitely not Nightmares of Future's Past. While I don't think the fic I'm remembering is an outright Severitus fic, it definitely had a more useful and less openly antagonistic Snape. Though I appreciate you posting it, because I didn't know it had been rehosted elsewhere. We lost Nightmares, Birth of A Magus, and a lot of other old stories.

It's definitely not Travel Secrets either, because Harry was actually friends with Ron and Hermione. He made it a point to have as many friends as possible and to not alienate anyone if he could at all avoid it.

What is Right seems extremely similar, but I don't think it's the same story. I'm quite certain this story was not completed and was not divided up into parts, either. It had around seventeen or eighteen chapters. I flipped through both parts, and didn't see the Christmas parties. And this Harry is much more damaged. In the story I read, he was a bit like the Harry from Oh God Not Again, though perhaps less flippant. He was self-assured, not a broken down wreck.

Thanks for posting What is Right, though. I will read that one.

  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

** Not really what you asked for, but the "Do it all over again" series contains many of the things you mentioned. And all books are finished!

After the war Draco sends a letter to his 11 year old self, instructing him to befriend Harry. Through his friendship with Harry many other Slytherins become friends with the other houses too and have a way out.

Snape is still the same though, as is Dracos father.

It is marked as slash, but Draco only realises in book 4 that he is in love with Harry - and Harry realises that in book 6. But even after that it's more background of the story, because they have bigger problems.

  All he wanted was a way out. A way to do it all over again, and to erase his mistakes. He stared at the crackling blue flames so hard they imprinted in his vision.   At age eleven, Draco receives a letter from the future, which will make him change the path he has set out upon and lead him into a life he'd never dared to imagine.
