I'm not really sure this is the best avenue to find a Beta but I'm getting a few chapters into a fic and I need a second pair of eyes.

If you know a better way to find someone, please let me know.

Cheers,

Storm


** I'm interested. What's your story about?

*** I've typed four different answers to this question and I can't figure out how to describe it.

Okay, the short version is a former US Marine has an accident on a cruise ship during a storm and dies. He wakes up as Harry in the shack where Hagrid finds him and the Dursleys. Over the first few years he does his best to learn but is not a SuperSmart!Harry or SuperStrong!Harry until way later (like 5th or 6th year). He has quite a bit of knowledge about the books and plays with the timeline a little bit (I'll explain more about that if you agree) but doesn't completely throw everything out the window. When the war happens, he uses his military background to prepare the DA, however, I'm also going to have Voldemort's people more capable as enemy combatants as well. I'm not trying to turn this thing into "Platoon" or "Saving Private Ryan" but I think a more tactical war would make for a very interesting deviation from the standards we usually see in fanfics.

In addition to all of that, he's not in the HP books world. He's actually in a fanfiction. He has to navigate Ancient and Noble Houses, attempted Harem's (This will be SFW, I'm not writing smut........ yet.....) comically overbearing Weasley mothers, etc.

Here is a link to the story: linkffn(12753515).

  After a panicked rescue, a man wakes up in a familiar shack. He thinks he's gonna be stuck in a book series, but, its a whole lot worse. - So this is my first HP fanfic This will kind of be a self insert, however, I am going to make it more humorous than serious. PARTS OF THIS STORY WILL BE COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE BOOKS BECAUSE ROWLING IS A BETTER WRITER THAN ME! I OWN NOTHING!

**** I doubt that any former Marine would be comfortable with the idea of child soldiers unless you go with Audie Murphy as the dimension traveller. Teaching the DA how to defend themselves yes, but turning them into a fighting force? Why not simply travel to Eastern Europe after the Warsaw Pact collapsed, organise a few weapons and then use them together with the Invisibility cloak to clean house? Not traceable with magic and this plan does not rely on using 14-16-year-old children in combat situations.

***** Of course kids shouldn't be in war. But it's a fanfic about a world with magic. I'm not going for realistic. The world itself isn't realistic.

** Firstly tell us what your story is about. If its something like Draco/Hermione, Slash, or Harem that's something a beta may have an issue with.

Secondly what are the things you want in a beta? Someone to give feedback on plot arcs? Characterization? Or just someone to proofread for spelling and grammar purposes?

*** All of the above, really. I'm really looking for someone to make sure I don't go crazy on some things and keep me on track. I have a tendency of running things to to the ground. Also, I sometimes gloss over certain things and don't flesh them out as well as I could so having someone to point things like that out would really help the story.

Also, having someone to bounce ideas off of makes me a better writer.

** Shayalonnie maintains a list of available beta readers for HP stories. You might have luck there.
