Like the title says, looking for a fic where Harry gets sent into the SW verse and ends up saving Mara Jade from the Emperor and Darth Vader and they end up going around the galaxy doing stuff and things. That's all I can remember.


** I'm fairly certain that is linkffn(Lord of Light by Darth Marrs) or whatever that third harem story is called.
