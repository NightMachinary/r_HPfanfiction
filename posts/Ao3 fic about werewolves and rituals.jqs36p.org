:END:
Hello ya'll. I remember reading a really good Harry Potter fic on Ao3 and it had harry, remus, and fenrir in it, but i forgot how they were tied into each other. There was a lot of explanation of magic in this fic and I believe Wiccan rituals as well(not 100% about this part). I also remember the author made it known that she was a high priestess who lived in Australia. I know this is a bit vague, but I can't remember more of the plot :/. Any help would be appreciated. Stay safe during COVID-19.
