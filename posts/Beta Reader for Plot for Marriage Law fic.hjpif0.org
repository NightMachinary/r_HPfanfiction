Hi all!. I have a 50k, 14 chapter fic about a Postwar marriage law that is in need of help. It's my second ever fic and it's dramione with several other main characters. My problem is, I honestly started writing without outlining more than a generic plot. I've been developing alot of character, but now the plot has run away with me and I need help narrowing it and making sure it makes sense. There's a goblet of unity, an old death eater project about researching magical purity instead of blood purity, magical rings that connect the pairings, and more. I need someone who is willing to tackle all of this as well as being interested in multi-level fics like this. I hope this is a good explanation and someone wants to tackle this? I would be so so grateful.
