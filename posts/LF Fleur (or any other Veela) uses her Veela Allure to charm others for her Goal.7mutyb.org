:END:
Fleur with her alluring Magic is like Poison Ivy from Batman. So i would like to read stuff like that. Any examples are: "The Masterbedroom of Delacour Manour" and "The French Affair". Fleur can either be the femme fatale antagonist or being on the "good" side, but following he rown interests. I know there are other fics, where Fleur might use her magic on Harry or other characters, but all of what i read has played in Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament Year. I would like post Hogwarts stories.

I found this thread, i will post it here to make this request based on it. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/46dfi5/request_manipulativeevil_fleurveela_fics/]]


** Not Fleur, but Gabrielle used Veela allure in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(5904185;10595005), to get her way.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
