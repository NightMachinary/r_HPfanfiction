I remember a fic, that Harry was engaged to Amelia Bones and Narcissa. Harry ends up kicking Sirius in the balls.

  A cracky oneshot of considerable length, that takes place during the fourth year. It's crazy, wacky, full of plot holes, fixes for plot holes, tons of lemons, angst, everything. It's a fun read, so don't expect anything too serious.
