My oc is going to call out Snape for abusing Neville then refuse detention entirely... what should the consequences be? I know she sends a letter to Neville's gran about it getting her support but what else? I have an eventual long term plan of her telling the paper about Snapes abuse and poor teaching but what about this short term moment... any advise?

Ps she's a muggle born that realizes that Snapes actions are wrong unlike everyone else she isn't complacent and accepting of it ...


** If you want go down the standard Snape bashing route, you can simply have Snape mald and assign her some ridiculous detention which will make the colleagues he has been working for almost a decade finally see how awful of a teacher he truly is.

or if you want to spice it up, you can have Snape not hold the Idiot Ball for the sake of the plot, canon already has done it a lot. I've read one fic, where Hermione goes on a simillar crusade against Snape and Snape responds by changing his methods superficially. He has an important mission and he is not going to let a child derail the plans he has made in case of voldemort's return.

Based on canon, I don't expect Augusta to give a shit about this. Nor would I expect a newspaper(daily prophet?) to care about an incompetent teacher at hogwarts. There is no shortage of incompetent teachers at Hogwarts.

*** First off thank you for replying I appreciate it. I think they would have a problem with it though because he's abusing students specifically a powerful pure blood family. I think of people knew about it in mass they will have a huge issue with it.

I am not bashing the character just making a point of my character being brave enough to stand up for other people. And show her intolerance of injustice

**** Well, it all boils down to what your OC's role in the HP world is.

If she wants to turn Hogwarts into a better educational institute, you can go ahead and dispense with Snape. But imo, you should not let that be a one-off thing. Have her constantly strive to make Hogwarts better with study groups, special interest clubs and whatnot.

But if her quest for justice expands outside of Hogwarts, to a broader Wizarding Briton, then a conflict with Snape might make her life harder after 1995.

***** She is going to do all that, starting with befriending and helping Neville and later making study groups and clubs. She is going to make many things better, it;s her point so to speak

** Please remember that Hogwarts does not work by muggle rules. Honestly, anything you want as a writer can happen, ranging from the detention being overturned to expulsion of your SI.

What do you want to happen? That's what will happen.

** If you want to yell about injustice, Neville ain't exactly the most suffering student. He gets a "You dunderhead you thought you could (insert mechanical mistake which leads to the malfunction of potion), Potter! you thought you would look good by letting him get hurt!."

Neville is called an idiot and is sent with another student to the hospital wing. Being called stupid is not an injustice, it's mild cruelty. If your character is concerned for Neville she'd be better off volunteering to be the student to bring him to the hospital wing than trying to get back at Snape. Neville was not punished for his mistakes beyond some cruel words being thrown his way.

The question is how does she /defend/ Longbottom. Does she do anything to earn herself detention? What is the punishment being issued for? How does she react to this /injustice/? If her response is to insult Snape and call him petty and mean, then it would be no surprise that she got a detention. You can't just refuse detention, and "I yelled at him for being mean to another student." isn't going to cut it to get out of the detention.

Now for the bigger questions, why should anyone care about what she says? She's just a /muggle-born/ after all, how does she get people to listen to her? For what reasons does no one else see the horrible abuse? There are more than one muggle-borns, why are they as "blind" as the rest of the Wizarding World. It's all well and good to be brave and to shout about injustice, but not many people are going to listen to a /child/ cry about how their teacher is mean, how is this SI supposed to break past that image?

And where did you get the idea that Snape is a bad teacher? Being mean doesn't preclude you from being able to teach people things, it's a big fanon trope that Snape is this awful teacher, but it's completely unsubstantiated. He successfully has a class go through their NEWTs with a number getting Outstandings. So what is the problem with his teaching?

Augusta Longbottom in the canon is a rather /invested/ parental figure, one who refuses Neville his own wand, and allows for him to be dropped out of windows. I rather think she'll consider it character building to have some cruel words thrown your way.

*** Couple of things, not a self insert. And he is a crappy teacher, All he does is writing on the board and insult the students... Being a teacher is not just teaching but also creating environment with your students can learn. He fails at that.

He tried to poison nevilles toad,Never tried to help him in any capacity or prevent any damage done by other people.

My character will not allow and will stand up For Neville because frankly nobody else does. My character does not like injustice nor does she like or tolerates abuse. She will stand up to him my goal is to figure out how that reacts to everything

**** Sorry for assuming the character was an SI, you haven't objected to the assessment previously so I just assumed you were fine with the description.

You forget where he assigns and grades essays requires book reading and considering he opened his first class with a lecture, and then proceeds to lecture in the third year while being a substitute, lectures. The majority of every class isn't shown and we don't assume the McGonagall doesn't teach things other than practical exercises. We know for a fact his students learned because his students pass their exams.

You have the power of knowing what Snape has done throughout the books, but you have to restrict yourself to using the first year /only/. Particularly that first potions lesson. A lesson where a cauldron exploded because a student couldn't follow a recipe. The student wasn't punished for his mistake in /any/ way, he was called an idiot for blowing up a cauldron and sent to get medical attention. The only thing Snape could have even gotten called out on was what he did in regards to Harry. So again what can she bring to people's attention that wouldn't get laughed out of the room.

Because if she goes in with what actually happened in that lesson she's going to get a "Young lady, potions is a dangerous class and Mr. Longbottom had just blown up his cauldron. Severus was just on edge, I'll talk to him about how he was treating Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom. Now run along."

***** You make a really good point. That being said it's not gonna stop there because he does stuff like that through every single year so I'm going to base it on his personality not him randomly taking points off or physically assaulting the students are giving the slither in points or breathing properly. I'm just gonna show him basically being a bully and being a dick. He is a terrible teacher and that he doesn't really help the students and he doesn't support his students like a teacher should. She is going to be very frustrated with the lack of response and find a way to deal with it probably by prank Ing him with the twins or outright getting rid of him through proof of memories and interviews for other students

** Depends. Half the shit snape punishes students for could be challenged and overturned in any school I've been to. I have, in fact, personally refused detention for some things and had that decision reinforced, and the detentions overturned
