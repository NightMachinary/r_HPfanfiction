:END:
Hello! I've searched on ffnet far and wide and yet I have not found this fanfiction. I've read it years ago. I remember that Harry and Draco were suddenly transported back in time. They appeared in the forest, for some reason Draco was holding Gryffindor's sword. Rowena found them and by the looks and because Harry spoke parseltongue she assumed they were Slytherin and Gryffindor. Please, I beg you, I have to find this fanfiction!

** Sorry, I don't know that story but there is a work called Ouroboros [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13403866/1/Ouroboros][here]] that's about Harry being reincarnated as Salazar and Neville as Godric.
