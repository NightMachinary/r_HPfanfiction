Whether it be just Occlumency or Legilimency, or both of them. I've read a few fanfics where the mind arts play a pretty big role, and I've found them to be very interesting to read.

I'd rather no bashing fics, but failing that I'll settle for fics that keep bashing to a minimum.

If there is romance then I'd also rather there be no slash too please.


** Try Faery Heroes by Silently Watches Harry is very good with the mind arts and uses them against those who wronged him. It's a time travel fic with a Lunar Harmony as the ship.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I would love to know one, too. One where stuff is explained and so on.

So far I only read stuff where Harry looks into a book.... pause... and 1 week later he is an accomplished Occlumens.\\
2 weeks later he is a Legilimence.\\
3 weeks later he can use telepathy.\\
4 weeks later he can warp reality with his mind.

Jokes aside, most fiction I read so far had Harry learn/master the Mind Arts, probably the most difficult after stuff with souls, etc., in a matter of weeks.

I can recommend this one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]]\\
But it is sadly unfinished, but at 200k words written.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

**** It's got amazing writing and turns many of the established bad tropes on their head. Harry is powerful but he's really realistically confident and vulnerable in ways that you don't really find in a powerful Harry.

I know the author's other fic is a manipulative Dumbledore, peggy sue tropefest but that's not at all what I got from this fic. It has snarky Slytherins, but in a pretty different way than any of the big WBWL fics.

The end and the beginning - Not a /huge/ part of the story, but he and Hermione are very good at it and employ it against snape

The well groomed mind - Harry isn't amazing about it but him learning occulmency and putting together his mind is a huge part of the story

Taking Control - Harry learning occulmency and teaching it to Ginny is a reasonably large plot point.
