"Ron? What are you doing?" Hermione asked.\\
"Googling," said Ron.\\
"What are you even Goo- MERLIN!"\\
"Hermione!" Ron said, hiding the screen.\\
Hermione stared at the barely hidden screen with wide eyes, her mouth moving soundlessly for a few moments, alternately going quite pale and blushing. She tilted her head... "How is he even... NO! Ron! You're too young to be looking at those sites. /I'm/ too young to be looking at those sites!"\\
"MR. WEASLEY!" the professor shouted from behind them both, causing both Hermione and Ron to jump, startled.\\
The youngest Weasley son went as red as his hair as he frantically attempted to close the window while covering the screen so Hermione couldn't see more, finally accidentally sending the screen crashing to the floor. "Oops."

I'm not so sure about this. I was a weird fucking kid that, after deciding that whatever answer my parents gave me to a question wasn't good/complete enough, would wander over to the bookshelf and start reading the damn encyclopedia. Which seems like something Hermione would do too.

...And I latched onto internet searches just fine when the internet became a thing >.>

Yeah, I've seen several crackfics where they have "Wizard-Net", but it's always just regular internet that 'runs on magic' and it's all handwaved in a sentence or two so the author can get to the jokes. Sometimes it's even connected to the Muggle internet.

I wonder what a realistic wizard internet would look like... I'm thinking they'd probably use mirrors as the screens, and they'd just make them touchscreens instead of messing about with peripherals. (Assuming the developers were competent and didn't think live mice and door keys stuck to planks were crucial somehow.)

But the internet itself would probably stay very, very basic for a long time. More like a public bulletin board than a proper internet. I'm not even sure if they'd have an equivalent to Wikipedia or private chat rooms, at least early on.

Edit: Typo.
