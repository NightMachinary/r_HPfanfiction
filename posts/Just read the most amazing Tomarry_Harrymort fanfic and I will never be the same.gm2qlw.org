“This is real” by Insidious1604

“Voldemort goes to Hogwarts in disguise, planning to get in the Savior's good graces and learn Order of the Phoenix secrets. He wasn't planning on falling in love in the process.”

Amazing, utterly brilliant and I don't think I can get over it. It struck me really deep and I'm not sure why but I love it.

It's a oneshot-turned-twoshot (first chapter is Tom's point of view, second is Harry's), the writing style is beautiful and I don't think I could've fangirled more if I had tried.

I love the whole Voldemort-turned-Tom Riddle trope and the way Insidious1604 writes how he falls in love is adorable (he doesn't even realize it until he gets pushed - hem, hem, shoved - in the right direction by Pansy and the rest of the Slytherins).

Harry was in denial for like half the fanfic, (and he doubts his mental state along the way) but he is so adorable - they both are! His friends are funny matchmakers and it's just really great.

Now I'm rambling and I've had to rewrite this at least 3 times because I keep giving the whole thing away, but please read it if you like Tomarry because honestly it's so good and I feel like I need to share it with the world.

** You want more goodness?these are semi long though

Linkffn(you get what you give) fem!harry and tom are the cutest frikin couple ever, sadly unfinished and maybe abandoned or on hiatus, totally worth it though.

Linkffn(again and again) great literal world building, harry/voldemort

Linkao3(the historical importance of runic war warding in the british isles) i hope it links this, this too, is abandoned or on hiatus, but is equally as great as the first link I put, also fem!harry. First link actually has a refernce to this story :)

Also, THANK YOU FOR DA FIC
