:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! Does anyone know if the fic "The Maurader's Companion" is uploaded somewhere? I think it originally was posted on ff.net by mibamonster(?) and it was available at fictionhunt for some time but I'm not able to find it anywhere now. It used to be my fave fanfic and I really want to reread it, so if anyone knows where or if I can find it, that would be much appreciated! The story was Lily and the Marauders finding a book that contained loads of different fanfics about them in it, as well as a chapter from Deathly Hallows and parts of a rewritten My Immortal. If I'm not wrong it also had a Jily storyline that developed throughout. Thanks!
