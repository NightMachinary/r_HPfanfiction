#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/seventymilestobabylon/pseuds/seventymilestobabylon][seventymilestobabylon]]) is dark in the dealing with the aftermath of war and atrocities committed by trusted people sense (so more ethically dark than violent) and it has a pretty soft ending.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Oceanbreeze7/pseuds/Oceanbreeze7][Oceanbreeze7]]) still has three chapters left, but it's looking like it might get a positive ending? There's been a lot of character growth so it's a real possibility. Deals with some really dark stuff, so definitely check the tags. Also updates pretty regularly so it should be done soon.
