** I just took a look at past discussions regarding flair, and the recommended uses for Suggestion and Promotion are all over the place!

This is what makes sense to me personally:

- Self-Promotion: authors promoting their own fics
- Recommendation: readers promoting fics they enjoyed
- Request: readers looking for fic recommendations
- Fic Search (or something like that): readers asking for help in tracking down/identifying a specific fic
- Prompts: prompts, fic ideas, etc.
- Meta: subreddit-related topics
- Discussion: self-explanatory
- Misc: everything else

I don't see much point in differentiating between self-promotion and general fic recommendations, but I imagine it must have been implemented for a reason.

*** I think separating out recommendations and self-promotions is a great idea. I think that self-promotion should have more of a "looking for CC/advice/feedback" connotation, rather than a "look at this cool thing I enjoyed" connotation. Although then there's the awkward gray area of when someone wants to promote their own fic, but isn't looking for feedback.

*** I think the idea is great! Does anybody use the suggestion flair for actual suggestions, like a "this sub should have x" kind of thing? Or would that always be meta?

I'm trying to think of a situation in which suggestion might still be used even if we did have a prompts flair.

***** Would it be useful to have a [critiques] flair or something along those lines? Promotions seems like a weird flair for that.

*** I don't think flair is really meant to be used in that way. A quick glance at the title should be all you need to see what kind of story the OP is looking for. If the title is vague, that's the fault of the OP, not the flair.

Rather, I agree with [[/u/anathea]] that distinct flairs for "recommend me some fics that fit this description" versus "help me find this one specific story that I read one time" would be useful. I think "Request" works fine for the former, and the latter could be something along the lines of "Fic Search," "Fic Identification," or "Looking For..."

*** What about general request vs. looking for a specific story? I'm not sure how the flair would be worded, but those seem like two reasonably separate things.
