  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

*** You are going somewhere and you know it's possible you will be captured and maybe even tortured for information. The knowledge is too valuable and the enemy must never learn it so you take the "counter potion". If they give you veritaserum you instantly die.

***** Well almost. It will protect you against the truth potion but not any other things like spells or physical damage. I don't know the story he is talking about so this might not be true.
