So I've already read a few like this (most recently “the debt of time”) and I was wondering if there are any long fanfics where Hermione is brought back to the mauraders era as James Potter's sister? I have no ship preference. Thanks a ton!

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU. Nominated for Best James Potter and Best Peter Pettigrew in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  Hermione Granger is not who she always thought she was. Kidnapped as a young child and thrust forward in time, she grew up as a muggleborn. Now an enemy becomes her savior and she is sent back to make things right. Who can she trust? Can she fix everything before it's too late?

  "In the last twenty four hours, Draco Malfoy's life was flipped upside down. Not only was everything he'd ever known gone, but now the only person he had to rely on, hated him with every fibre in her being. Draco Malfoy was stuck in the past with none other than Hermione Jean Granger." Dramione. Non-canon. (Remione included.)
