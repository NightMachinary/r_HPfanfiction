With [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis]["Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis"]] finished, I started a new story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle]["The Granger Principle"]]. It's an AU told from Ron's POV.

** Neat. I'll have to get through your Atlantis story first though. Any chance of a Harry centric fic in the future, just to finish the trifecta?

#+begin_quote
  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
