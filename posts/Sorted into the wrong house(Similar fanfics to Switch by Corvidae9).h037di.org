I am re-reading Corvidae9's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071][/Switch/]], and while I'm enjoying it, I'm aware that it's incomplete, and hoping that someone has something that takes a similar tone.

Frankly it's rather refreshing to read a fanfic where you can indeed say that Dumbledore is being manipulative, but it is to general positive effect, not to mention no real bashing to speak of.


** This one is also incomplete but matches your request description.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.
