Most independent harry are just fics where harry is really whiny. I mean he bitches how difficult his life is all the time.

And they have some of the worst dialogue. Like Harry getting angry that someone calls him harry and not potter.

"Only my friends can call me harry, call me lord Potter."

Like wtf talks like that?

Now when a story has Indiharry in its summary i just stop reading. Does anyone else have problem with a indiharry that is just a whining harry?


** I mostly agree with you. Despite being a trope with such interesting potential, Indy!Harry is really, really easy to do badly. Shopping scene, Goblins, Lord Stompy McBigStaff of all teh things inheritance, verbal smackdown the lifelong politicians and manipulators, etc. It's not absolutely an indicator of poor quality, but there's enough correlation there to make a link.

I'm with Rowan on the dialogue though. Frankly, Harry being locked in a cupboard for eleven years and intermittently being chased by hoodlums and frying-pan wielding housewives is probably the only reason every book in canon wasn't as whiny as book five was. Plus, sometimes the crappy dialogue in Indy!Harry fics is kinda funny - Cadmean Victory's ever-quotable 'I do not forgive. I do not forget.' is a perfect example of emo-turned-comedy. I'll give you that him not doing anything about it in an Indy!Fic is irritating, but otherwise I'd say that he's probably got a right to at least a little whiny bitchery. For dealing with Snape's bullshit, if nothing else. I've certainly whiny-bitched over my teachers being unpleasant bastards before, as have friends and acquaintances.

*** Yeah, I tend to click away from a fic once I see the Overly-Helpful Goblins, the Twenty Inheritance Pileup, and/or the Obligatory Shopping Spree (now with 200% more super-helpful non-canonical magical items!).

**** Totes. I really want to see a deconstruction of those tropes where the Goblins try to help and violate a contract and cause way more problems, the Inheritance pile-up comes with some ridiculous clauses like having to lead local Morris Dancing rituals on High Holidays and every cow on the manor having to be a particular colour, and anyone who's played D&D or seen Critical Role knows how fucked up a shopping spree can get. On top of all that, Harry has to take My Fair Lady-esque lessons on how to behave as a Lord (Lessons given by Hermione desperately reading from books and Ron laughing uproariously throughout) so he doesn't lose his magic or let all the property go to Malfoy instead or something.

**** Oh right, I also forgot about the Removal of Magical Bindings Unlocking Tons of Power and Special Abilities, not to mention the oddly-common Time-Compression Chamber Training...

**** No idea. I just found the idea of a fifteen-ish year old boy yelling that at his bullying schoolmates to be a tad funny. It's just so utterly incongruous with the situation, like someone quoting Batman's views on vigilantism after you bury a beloved pet.

** No, because Harry's life was fairly difficult?

Dead parents, his Defense Teachers all tried to kill him at least once (ironically with Snape as the exception) on top of Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the shadows and dealing with a fair bit of bullying and drama at school.

On top of integrating into a completely different world/culture and learning a variety of new skills that his life often depended on. Harry's life was not easy, he kinda had a right to complain.

Though I've not come across many where it crosses the line into whining. And I like the idea of him using Lord [WHATEVER THE STORY GIVES HIM] as a way of getting back at people who should have been there for him but weren't.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
