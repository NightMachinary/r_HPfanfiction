As in, not the greatest Seer since Cassandra, or secretly right about everything ever, and so on. I want a story where Luna is her canon self: a bright but damaged girl. It turns my stomach a little that so many fanfic authors strive to make her "likeable" or "badass" by handwaving away her disability.

Don't particularly care if there's romance involved or not, but bonus if her partner recognizes and deals with the fact that she's, well, not entirely okay.

Wait, hold on, what? You're calling for a Luna that's "in-character", and you think that she has a canon disability or permanent mental damages? She experiences grief because of her mother's death and is upset about being isolated at school - and part of her character is that she's a conspiracy theorist and an oddball who doesn't try to fit in - but let's not diagnose fictional characters here and then pretend it's canon.

*** She, quite literally, sees things that aren't there.

What I mean by this being a [mental] disability is that, as per canon, those things are actually not there.

What you get in many fanfics on the other hand is that she is right about their existence, one way or the other, or just faking it as part of her mysterious plans to trick people into underestimating her.

I think that her claiming to see things is not necessarily a psychosis or delusion which seems to be what you're looking for.

I appreciate when an author writes in that she's making them up for whatever reason. Whether as a prank or as a coping method.

I remember reading a story where she went with it because her father was the one that had the delusions after his wife died and if she didn't it was distressing to him.

Also if it's well written I enjoy an author that makes them real somehow. I believe my favorite was an author who made her able to see auras surrounding a person and the swirls and eddies in that aura were what she claimed were nargles.

And this is precisely the attitude I'm talking about. That her character is only /good/ or /better/ if it's not a disability but rather a badass magical quirk. What exactly is it that makes you averse to the idea that nargles are delusions and not swirls in people's auras?

****** I'm not averse to the idea if it's well written, but a well written delusional Luna who is also a supporting character is not something I've ever seen.

If they are delusions then she cannot be relied upon for anything serious. I would not in real life ever put something vital in the hands of someone who has been proven to be mentally ill to the point of delusion. In fact I have made the choice to take my life out of the hands of a paranoid schizophrenic parent because I could not trust the decisions made.

I've seen and enjoyed many well written stories where Luna was damaged by witnessing the death of her mother. Where creating fantastic creatures was a coping method for being intuitive and just being able to read people (not overly badass.)

Also most delusional mental issues do not emerge until late adolescence to young adulthood almost certainly never at 15 let alone 11 or earlier.

I'm averse because it doesn't write in a realistic manner it breaks my suspension of disbelief, and to be quite frank it doesn't make sense trauma doesn't cause delusions to form. Not in that manner at least.

Edit: two more points, JKR in an interview stated that Luna never discovered them and then came to accept they may have never been real. Not a part of Canon in the sense that it happened in the books. (I actually had to go and research this a bit to ensure that I hadn't missed something.) I don't typically take interviews like that to be part of Canon just because they aren't part of the series.

Also in OotP during the battle at the DoM Luna is serious, there's no dreamy or vacant expression on her. If it were a mental disability the stress would make it worse not better. The conclusion that can be drawn there is it's not real.

I would like to second this with more enthusiasm than reddit allows, but I can't so you'll just have to live with only getting my one upvote. I love some of the stuff that comes out of her additional commentary... but if it wasn't IN ONE OF THE BOOKS, I'm not going to be bothered if I go different direction on something. People seem to get *REALLY* worked up about that for reasons I don't really understand.

Example: If she wanted James Potter's father to be named Fleamont she should have referenced him in one of the books. I don't particularly care one way or the other, but I see comments (and not just here in this sub) that seem mortally offended when they see something published recently still has Charlus listed in that role despite the fact that for the longest time that was a perfectly reasonable inference, and still is if you only look at the books themselves.

I don't care if Dumbledore is gay or straight. I'll take it as a canonically Gray area because the author stated it, but I don't see it as influencing the story overly much. Is it a possible reference as to why you choose to write something a certain way? Absolutely. Is it gospel? No.

Besides admitting that they aren't real doesn't mean Luna is mentally ill, I would argue the opposite actually.

Yet another example of the attitude I'm trying to escape. [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17199051][3.06 to 3.48 percent]] of the adult population (of the US) suffers from some form of pathological psychosis. I find it more than a little worrying that you think one in thirty adults cannot be trusted with anything ever.

Also it's amazing that you jump from psychosis straight to paranoid schizophrenia. This whole thing smacks of people having little experience if any with psychiatry.

******** That's a fair point, I may wind up probably checking some of these out myself, as I said this is not something I'm averse to when it's written well, but finding it written well is not something I've ever seen.

If someone regularly sees things that do not exist, would you trust them in a life and death situation? I never said I wouldn't trust someone with a psychosis with anything ever. I said anything serious. That is a difference. Maybe not one that is crystal clear, but I have trusted things to people with mental issues both major and minor, would I put my life in their hands? No. Would I trust them to do something like helping with a project or doing a job? Most likely, unless they've proven themselves incapable.

I jumped straight to paranoid schizophrenia because that's what I have personal experience with and is one of the most common mental disorders that causes delusions and hallucinations. As I said, my mother is paranoid schizophrenic and I have witnessed the effects first hand. She slammed herself into a wall and yelled that she was being abused when my stepfather took what little savings they had to pay the mortgage. She saw him taking all the money they had and interpreted it as herself being attacked and her children being stolen from her so she reacted in a way that she thought would keep him from taking custody.

Psychosis in children is fairly well documented, but very little of the applicable symptoms would pertain to luna with the exception of her hallucinations and possibly delusions of persecution or paranoia. (see the many varied conspiracy theories like the rotfang conspiracy.) although those seem more applicable to her father than Luna herself.

Define neurotypical? Am I mentally healthy? Yes, although I wouldn't say my mind is perfect. I have cyclomanic tendencies and have struggled with depression off and on during some points of my life including a suicide attempt at a young age as well as anger issues that I have worked hard to control. I have never met someone without some form of mental issue. My fiancee has PTSD and probably bipolar, my best friend is the epitome of narcissistic personality disorder I don't know anyone I would consider neurotypical it doesn't exist. What is the average person? Show me one person who defines that average and isn't "atypical" in some way. You can't. The average is a blend of all points on the table. And there is no one who can fit inside that center point perfectly.

So snorkacks don't exist, and Luna admits they're not real. She never saw them, in fact her father and her would go searching for them. That just leads me to believe that they were her father's delusions and hallucinations. Which fits rather nicely and I've seen that written quite well actually.  Show me one creature that Luna has been shown to have seen, but has been proven nonexistent and I will concede this whole thing.

The whole fragile eggs thing? Nothing that has been damaged is as strong as something that is whole or that has been damaged and then made while again. I'm not saying that the mentally ill cannot handle stressors, but stress has a profound effect on mental health causing mental illness to emerge or making it worse. PTSD especially, which would be the most likely result of Luna watching her mother die. However, PTSD would not cause unrelated hallucinations it would be a related hallucination not invisible creatures. And would be triggered by similar situations. The mentally ill especially those that are so mentally ill as to be considered having a disability then they cannot be considered able to do everything that a mentally healthy person can. If mentally ill people are not vulnerable to stressful situations like a battle why doesn't the military allow them to join? Why is PTSD a reason to be discharged without negative repercussions whether from battle or anything else? Do you know how many people are in BMT for the Air Force (one of the easiest in America) and they crack under the stress? I do, personally. I've watched it happen I've been put in the position of a entry controller who's real primary job is suicide watch... Do NOT tell me that stress will not turn a person with mild mental issues into a mess on their ceiling for their family to find and that's just the stress of high school and getting into college.

**** I don't remember it ever being established that she *actually* sees anything. She's not 'on screen' very much so it's hard to say for sure obviously, but I feel like saying she's making it up is as 'canonically' valid as it is to say that she actually sees them. I personally feel like what [[/u/Iocabus]] mentioned about her believing in these things because her father, who lost it when her mom died, told her they were real. What 8(9?) year old knows better than to continue listening to a parent who's stories shift from Bears and Dragons to Nargles and Heliotropes? It's not like her 'real' world was any more sensible given the creatures that DO exist in the Potterverse.

Granted, I think the (only?) reason you're getting a lot of responses that are arguing the point instead of giving recommendations is that you come across (intentionally or otherwise) as implying that it's /wrong/ to see her as anything other than a girl with delusions/hallucinations.

** Good luck. First off in finding a fic with a well done Luna, there are only a few of them. Then also for finding your specific definition of a well done Luna.

Them main problem with searching for specific types of Luna like this is how little she was really a part of cannon. We know she is odd, and we know she is smart/insightful. And we know she was raised by her very odd father after she saw her mother die.

There's not much else, since she is very much a supporting character. So every author does whatever they want with her, and what they want tends to not be what you are describing

** I like this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles]]

there is a sequel as well.

Darth Marrs did a SW/HP cross with Ben Skywalker and Luna becoming a couple. It's very dark but well done. The Boy Who Fell is as close to the title as I can guess.
