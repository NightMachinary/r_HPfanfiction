I have an idea for a fic that starts in 1996, about a world war which starts due to the Army of True Humanity, a eugenicist-totalitarian organization, starting a military campaign to unify and purify humanity. They attack wizards as well as muggles, as their ranks include both sub-races. The war causes the United Nations and the International Confederation of Wizards to unify themselves into the UN-ICW alliance, an emergency Military government. The ATH wants to eliminate all humans and non-Human beings who do not meet their idea of 'perfect'. This is in contrast to Voldemort, who only(And I say that in a relative sense) wants pure-blood Wizards to enslave muggles and muggleborns. The Death Eaters and Order are drafted(Read: Forced at gun and wand point) into the UN-ICW Alliance Military. The war lasts for 25 years, and by the time it ends, the worlds population has been reduced from around 9 billion wizards, muggles, and non-humans, to only 1 billion beings.

My question, however, is why has a fic like this not been written? I would have thought every idea has been tried in the realm of HP fanfiction.


** Because wizards look down on Muggles and Muggles are generally unaware of magic. Unless it's an AU where Muggles know about magic but ignore it or lampshade it (like in Buffy S7 when some band member said "I hate playing vampire towns.")

*** To add on, it also doesn't make sense, without reducing the stakes and importance of Voldemort, that the ICW can force Voldemort into doing something he doesn't want to do. Wizards seem fairly international; the Statute of Secrecy is international law; Cauldron-Bottom thickness is regulated internationally. Yet the ICW was not capable of dealing with Voldemort or Grindelwald. For the ICW to have the power to defeat Voldemort is already implausible, to say the least of the power disparity needed to force Voldemort to work with muggles, which Voldemort literally needs to despise to maintain the ideology on which his power is based upon.

A change to reduce Voldemort's power means that the story doesn't feel like Harry Potter. It feels like an original story with some names from HP stuck in to get readership. That, of course, doesn't even touch upon guns.

A fic like this also hasn't been written because it's an incredibly specific prompt. I mean, what are the chances another author comes up with all of this on their own?

**** Well, think of it this way: We don't know /what/ the ICW thought of Voldemort. They may have thought that this was a threat they couldn't handle, or it could have been a case of 'Oh, look at those backward Brits at it again'. Also, Voldie was for the most part a domestic issue. Not an international one.

Also, this is one case where Voldemort himself is at risk. The ATH views those with any kind of disability as degenerate. For instance, they view most Purebloods as being inferior, because of the interbreeding in their culture. Voldemort has a disability. He cannot feel love, something the ATH's Interrogators managed to retrieve from Dumbledore's mind.

The whole point of the story is to explore what happens when people who despise each other have to work together or perish.

***** First, I'd note that backwards magical Britain is pure fanon and not supported by canon.

Secondly, I'd note that Voldemort tied Dumbledore who was using the elder wand and had Fawkes help him. Dumbledore beat Grindelwald who was using the elder wand. Thus Voldemort > Grindelwald in terms of magical skill and we know magical skill matters a lot in terms of geopolitics (Dumbledore's positions and influence).

Thirdly, I'd note that it is specifically stated in Deathly Hallows that Grindelwald never invaded Britain because of Dumbledore. Grindelwald chose the path of avoiding Dumbledore. Voldemort, conversely, chose the harder path of taking over Britain and fighting Dumbledore on his home territory (Hogwarts, order, and influence over the ministry).

Sure, Voldemort might have been a domestic issue (though I'd note that it's probably international given how fantastic beasts and the books show the level of international cooperation), but Voldemort had the potential to be an even greater international issue than Grindelwald. Voldemort took over Britain which Grindelwald could have never done. Therefore, it follows that Voldemort can take over Europe which Grindelwald did.

****** That depends on your logic for having them drafted. Is it that in your setting pretty much most other wizards (except the Ministry) are broadly incompetent outside of every day minor magics? Which, to be fair, is inferred in canon.

If thats the case, then who would they be commanding?

Consider that the wizarding population, in canon, is tiny. 20,000 or so seems to be a best guestimate from the evidence in canon. If between the Order, the DMLE (and other appropriately skilled Ministry wizards), and the Death Eaters, you have around 600 wizards (which I think it probably a fair estimate) - thats 3% of the British wizarding population being drafted into the army.

If you drafted 3% of the US population in an army it would be nearly 10 million strong. Just to give you a visual of the impact that this drafting would have on society...consider that.

And you're talking about drafting many of the most magically skilled individuals - you could literally be bringing about a long term downskilling of magical society with this army draft.

So yeah, just a couple of things to consider.

******* My logic is this. The Alliance /needs/ wizards who are skilled in combat, both to train and to fight. So, they draft Voldemort, who soon realizes that he has two options: Work with the enemy, or wind up in an ATH Euthanization Camp. He chooses the former.

The problem is this: This story is supposed to be part fantasy and part sci-fi. The ATH has a field around Earth which prevents any wizards from using spells frequently, unless they are 'innoculated' by their magitech scientists. So, the Wizards have to learn Muggle warfare in addition to their magical combat knowledge.

Perhaps they should go to bootcamp, to learn how to work with muggles. It has been demonstrated that interacting with those you are bigoted against, peacefully that is, lessens that bigotry.

Russia declares war on Europe, steamrolling through parts of it due to having magic on their side. Eventually the rest of the wizards realise they need to reveal themselves if they want to have a chance of averting global nuclear apocalypse and stopping the Russian wizards from taking over the muggle world.

Because of that the principle job of 95%+ of wizards would simply be to protect non magical troops and installations from enemy wizards. The remaining few percent would be the ones trying to work past those defences, infiltrate behind enemy lines, and cause mayhem and damage to infrastructure and men.

I've seen killing curses get blocked by a wall that a bullet would cut through like a hot knife through butter. Also, bullets can't be dodge. Remember, the ATH are at the peak of human ability, thanks to eugenics. Their senses are the maximum possible for a human being. They would dodge a killing curse with barely any effort.

So, I see the wizards becoming a sort of special forces division. Sort of like the Navy SEALS or the SAS. Armed with both muggle and wizard knowledge.

************** You can argue wizard vs muggle till the end of days and not get a definitive answer. However the killing curse is one of the least efficient ways to neutralise someone magically.

Levitate heavy rocks high above the opposing army and release them. Transfigure blades of grass into razor blades. Conjure poisonous cobras and spiders to go into their camp at night. Transfigure things into highly explosive substances and detonate them. Magical poisons seem to be exceptionally powerful, so use invisibility spells to add them to the enemy water or food supply. We know a bubble head charm traps air near the head, alter it slightly to prevent new air getting in, watch people suffocate. Transfigure their guns slightly so that they don't work. Transfigure the ground their sleeping on into water, then transfigure it back. Unleash fiendfyre into the enemy camp.

A basic shield charm can stop a bullet - which is to say there's no reason in canon to think that it can't. So rifles aren't that big a threat if the wizard knows you're pointing a gun at him, they're still vulnerable to a sniper or other hidden threat - unless they have a shield charm embedded in an item of clothing like we know is possible in canon.

Also, you would need to show exactly /how/ such an organisation a) came to be, b) took control of enough countries to grow powerful enough to fund and field their operations and c) is un-nukeable.

Such an organisation would need the support of the people to actually wage war. How exactly did they get people to follow them? Especially in a post-Hitler world like ours where everyone is trigger-happy with anything remotely approaching Hilter-like qualities. Not to mention that in order for the war to start around 1996 the organisation would have to have been building power for at least a few years. Probably well before the USSR's collapse and in the middle of the extreme tensions present in the cold war. How? How did they get so much support during that whole mess?

*** If you're wondering how anyone would get people to follow such an organization, the easy answer would be fear. If you can make enough people all afraid of the same thing, they'll agree to practically anything to protect themselves from the threat. It's hard to deny the unifying power of fear.

Before long, the masses are clamoring for a solution. They're screaming 'Save us! Save us from this terror!' in the streets, begging for leadership. All it takes is one person to stand up and say that they have the answers. Entire nations have been manipulated by fear, we know this from first-hand experience in world history, in Europe especially.

If you have to lie to people and then take the mask off when it's too late, you do. It's easy to manipulate the mob, there are whole sections of the library devoted to the topic.

*** There is an organisation of very rich people with connections all over the planet. No base of operation. No place to nuke. But several labs well hidden away both physically and magically. Scientists working for them developed a virus, by magical and normal means, that only kills people with the genetics they consider impure.

They started the spread by releasing patient zero in Wuhan, China. Soon after that the world went into lockdown. At first it was thought to be just a normal disease but more and more evidence came up that is was designed. Now the best of both the magical and non-magical world have to work together to find a cure/vaccination, search and destroy all the labs, recover the research, bring the ones responsible to justice.

Or something like that ...

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I actually came across a fic like this. The queen had royal wizards of her own. This came about as a result of a signed contact several centuries ago. Wizards retained there power through the queen. During a trial at the Wizingmot (Sp?) Harry brought the queen. Many wizards lost there powers as a result of betrayal to the crown.

I believe I have the fanfic faved on fanfiction.com. I'll look for it for you if you would like.

Oh I also have Harry Potter/Avenger crossover fics faved that have a similar premise. Not a worldwide alliance but small time.

Ok yeah I haven't seen a fic where Death Eaters and the Order are drafted into an army

It's not quite what you described, but it's a fic about muggles and magicals fighting together against a Voldemort at full power. Though, each chapter is mainly just one big fight scene.

  We've been fighting this war for a long time. Muggles, they call us. They struck first. England fell. Then France. Spain. Italy. It took us ten years of tactical withdrawals and air strikes to stop their advance. Now it was our turn to push back.

They've had a eugenics program going for decades, and have created a race of 'superhumans', men and women who are at the peak of physical perfection, and have no mental deficiencies. That might sound utopian, but their means are dystopian. The Pure-Blood Wizards alone are considered 'degenerate', due to the amount of incest going on in their culture.

What if because of this, the world turns into one of those video game worlds where magic is commonplace and there are quests, guilds, nobles, bards, warriors, mages, etc. And what if Harry Potter and Voldemort were reincarnated into this work after dying in the war. Fucking awesome. I'm gonna work on this eventually.
