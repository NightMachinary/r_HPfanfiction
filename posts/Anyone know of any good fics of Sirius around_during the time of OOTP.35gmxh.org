Most of the fics I've found that star Sirius as the main character are set during the Marauders time but I'm looking for OOTP time-frame. Thanks in advance. :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7475914/1/All-Will-Be-In-Order][All Will Be In Order]] is set during the summer before OotP. There's a sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9291744/1/Kaleidoscope-I-Colours][Kaleidoscope (I): Colours]], which is set during OotP, but it's more about Remus and Tonks.

*** I just want to thank you for linking this, I stumbled across this page looking for a story involving the adults of HP.

Last night I read my first bit of fan fiction and I really enjoyed it and tonight I'm going to start on Kaleidoscope.
