*** I can think of a number of motivations that a fanfic author might use:

1. She is offered lots obscure books in return for betraying Harry. Points for irony if she is "viscerally slaughtered" because one of the books is cursed.

2. Manipulative!Dumbledore orders her to betray Harry, and she can't Disobey Authority. Independent!Gray!LordOfEverything!Harry defeats their plans, viscerally slaughtering everyone who stands in his way for extra Edginess.

3. She falls madly in love with Draco, and tries to endear herself to him and the Dark Lord by betraying Harry. As a result, the Death Eaters win, but her reward is to be viscerally slaughtered like the Mudblood that she is.

4. She betrays the whole of humanity in the cause of House-Elf liberation. The newly free House-Elves turn on her and viscerally slaughter her.

5. She finds out that she is Voldemort's and Bellatrix's daughter, so her beliefs, morals, and loyalty do a 180 and she betrays Harry & Co.. Harry & Co. win anyway, and she is viscerally slaughtered in process.

6. Conversely, she is Voldemort's and Bellatrix's loyal daughter, but falls in love with Harry and switches sides; her actions lead to Voldemort's defeat, but not before she is viscerally slaughtered for her treachery. (OP didn't say traitor to /whom/.)

Notice that I didn't say a /good/ fanfic author...

**** This here is what I was thinking of when I saw the Hermione wrongly accused thread.

Three is what I would enjoy most. Hermione thinking Draco's in love with her THEN BAM Visceral Slaughter, Draco was a racist allllll along. Draco stabs her with a knife because she's a filthy mudblood not worth of a noble death caused by magic. As she dies she realises how she was wrong and nothing but a mudblood who doesn't know her place.

Number four would be fantastic as well. Hermione up on her high horse thinking she's oh so clever and moral, only to be brought down and viscerally slaughtered by the elves.

Number five is what I had in mind mixed with number three. She turns to the dark side to be with Draco only to find out Draco was only messing with her abandons her then Harry viscerally slaughters her for killing Ron or Sirius.

Harry wasn't hunted at the time. Not actively. He was safe as much as everyone else was when Ron left him. Ron wanted to come back immediately, but couldn't, because Harry moved away. Shit happens.

That's why Ron stood up against Sirius, he was injured and cornered. Any time he's not in such a directly stressful situation his inner jerk comes out. He is a bully and the only real reason I can see for Harry not to stand up to him when he bullies others (but especially Hermione, who is his only other real friend) is that because he never had friends before Hogwarts and is afraid of losing his first one. I think this also gives Ron further protection to bully people as other students are less likely to pick on him because of his association with the BWL.

Ron NEVER suffers real consequences for his jerkish behavior in the entire series. Not when he insults Hermione for actually trying to learn in a school, harasses her to do his work for him, starts fights, abandons his best friend, bullies people, or can't manage basic table manners. The only time consequences beyond him getting yelled at by Hermione seem like a possibility, Harry protects him.

I can easily see Ron betray his 'friends' for whatever negative emotion happens to dominate his mind that day. Why? Because he doesn't act like friends towards them, only around them.

Funny thing about Ron bashing though: the vast majority of fics that are accused of Ron bashing have Ron acting no worse than in canon, he's just presented with consequences for being a prat.

Offtopic: The only way I can think of the canon pairing with Hermione as realistic is by a similar rationale as with Harry. She is lonely throughout her early childhood, finally some boys stand up for her and are her friends, even if one of them is never nice to her (at all). For years that freckled carrot keeps bringing down her sense of self worth with constant emotional abuse and she grows dependent on him.

I don't even know where to start with this one. There's so much fanon and flanderization in your comment that I don't think it merits discussion. But here's a few things to think about in your spare time: Has Harry or Hermione suffered consequences for their jerkish, bullying behaviour? has Ron really "harassed Hermione to do his homework", or was it Hermione who pestered him and Harry about homework? has Hermione not insulted and bullied Ron multiple times?

If you seriously think Ron would betray Harry then, I'm sorry, you've completely misunderstood the character. Here's a hint: Rowling based Hermione on herself, and Ron on her best friend. Do you really think Rowling created Ron as a character who would betray his friends? sure, you might not like his behaviour, but it doesn't mean his evil or a traitor. Your hate seriously clouds your judgement. And I say this as someone who doesn't particularly likes Ron himself.

************ I fail to see how telling him to do his homework is pestering him. He needs guidance because he's clearly incapable of functioning by himself. When he becomes a prefect he uses it to confiscate things he wants for himself from younger children. When Harry gets dropped into a tournament that might kill him, Ron turns against him because he wants the attention (and money) himself.

These are the day-to-day aspects of Ron that anyone who defends him just dismisses as irrelevant. Ron is a prat 99% of the time but he has an occasional good moment and somehow that's supposed to make everything alright.

I think Rowling seriously messed up his character in multiple ways. I think he was supposed to be the grounding force in the trio, but instead he's just dead weight. His comedic relief is pretty much always at the expense of others and the epilogue itself shows that at the age of 37 he still hasn't grown up enough to earn the things he wants (a drivers license) or respect Hermione enough not to lie to her to her face.

As to I really believe he would betray his friends: Yes, if he thought it would get him a lot of money and glory, in a second. I've thought so since GoF and there's been little to change my mind. I actually expected it in DH when he came back, I was convinced he was going to turn them in when I first read the book.

************* That pestering is patronizing and bordering on bullying. She's not his mother, yet she constantly scolds him. If he had done the same to her, you'd call it bullying.

Those are not examples of things he does daily, but things he does very rarely - maybe once or twice in the series. He is also not a prat 99% of the times - this is once again fanon and flanderization making you forget all the good things he does, about some I elaborated in earlier posts.

Ron is a very flawed character, yes. But to say he's a potential traitor is simply wrong. It's the kind of childish black and white thinking that some students in Hogwarts use to justify thinking that all Slytherins are evil Death Eaters. Completely demonizing and one sided. I get that you had interpreted him as a traitor, but that interpenetration is objectively wrong. It's one of those things which, if you'd ask Rowling about, she'd laugh in your face. In other words, you fail at character analysis.

I have politely refused to eat with people because of their table manners. It's with people that I don't want to distance myself from despite that, that I point out that what they're doing is disgusting. Doing that is not bullying, it's helping someone. The same with Ron's other issues.

As to what Rowling would say, I don't care. I loved Hermione as a child but the HP series is terrible in too many ways to count. It trivializes the effects of child abuse and neglect, it has internal inconsistencies and about a dozen deus ex machina. The reason I got into fanfiction was because I disliked what had happened to my childhood heroine as well as so many other things that I found were quite horrible when looking back at it as an adult.

Note that like many girls I imagined being Hermione, an ordinary girl that suddenly discovered there was magic and that she could do it. She acted throughout the first few books in a way I could see myself do without fail. Well, except for the cat that is, I've never liked cats as being near them hampers my ability to breathe (unpleasant allergy).

If you don't care about what Rowling says or about canon in general, then please don't engage in discussion concerning canon. To remind you, this discussion is whether canon!Ron has motives to betray Harry, and the same for Hermione. We're not talking about what you think should have happened or your dislike towards characters.

I would just like to add one thing to the discussions in general, though I know it goes nowhere: Hermione literally betrayed Harry in PoA. She did it for him, but she betrayed his trust and everything their friendship was based on. Ron had rows with Harry and would sometimes leave him (like in pretty much any friendship), but he never betrayed Harry to authority or anyone else. Not saying that this is a motive for Hermione to betray Harry to Voldemort/Dumbledore/Whatever, but canonically, she's the one who actually betrayed him, and that fact is often forgotten.

**************** I do care about canon, but mostly only the first three books and to a lesser extent the fourth and fifth. I also specified other things than duties regarding things to scold for.

Regarding the broom in POA: She did not betray him. She went against his wishes after becoming convinced the boys wouldn't listen to her (although I /do/ think she should have tried to plead her case with them a bit more before going to McGonagall, that is only on principle as I don't think it would have mattered). If she would have just let him go outside and fly a thing she thought could very well kill him that would have been a betrayal. Just because the boys were too stupid to realize that doesn't make it a betrayal.

I once told a former (schizophrenic) friend of mine's psychiatrist that he had stopped taking his meds, which got him sectioned. He broke off contact calling me a 'treacherous Klingon'. A month or two later he thanked me and didn't see that as a betrayal anymore.

Breaking someone's trust can be done out of loyalty, especially when they aren't thinking clearly (which the boys weren't because of their excitement).

The writer can write coherently and seems to have some idea where the fic is going. After a decade and a half on the run, Hermione travels back in time to try to fix her mistake, only to discover that Harry is pretty high on the psychopathy scale, and that is an interesting twist. On the other hand, lots of characters are pretty OOC (including the Order of the Phoenix, which apparently believes that turning Harry down for a date merits murdering her parents and trying to murder her), Harry doesn't talk his age, and it's kind of creepy that time-traveled Hermione still wants to get together with Harry. (IMO, the fic would have been better if Hermione had given up on the 'ship and focused on keeping the somewhat psychopathic Harry from permanently damaging himself or anyone else while trying to get the prophecy fulfilled and Voldemort defeated.)
