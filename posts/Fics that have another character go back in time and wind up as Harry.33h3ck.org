I remember there being a fic where Harry and Hermione go back to just before first year, but their minds swap bodies (whoops!) and they have to adapt. Is there anything else like this, with the time traveller landing in the wrong person? Or where a NonBWL Harry winds up in a world like canon?


** Commenting as I'd like to see this too.

*** I'm picturing an early scene where the newly arrived 'harry' is baffled by the tiny room they're trapped in. Finally magicking their way out of the cupboard they see themselves in a mirror and begin cursing up a storm.

** Could you link that Harry and Hermione fic? I've never heard of it and it sounds very interesting.

**** This is a twist on the common do-over fic that I haven't seen before. Thanks for sharing the link.
