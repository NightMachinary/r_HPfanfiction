I get that Crouch was overzealous and it seemed super obvious he was guilty but surely that's just more reason to put him on trial, preferably a super public one. You've captured Voldemort's right hand, the man who personally betrayed the country's greatest heroes, what greater piece of publicity/propaganda is there for the Ministry than to expose all his crimes and be seen putting him in Azkaban for life.

The way it was done really makes it seem like the Ministry or Crouch in particular had something to hide related to Sirius but as far as I can tell they didn't.


** JK Rowling frequently uses the wizarding world to comment upon real world issues, the most obvious being the analogy between anti-Muggleborn prejudice and antisemitism in Germany prior to and during WWII.

Another analogy she likes to make is to use the Ministry of Magic to highlight the failings of the British state. During the Troubles, the British government adopted the policy of arresting suspected members of the IRA (and a small number of loyalists) and holding them without trial; almost 2,000 individuals were arrested and imprisoned for 4 years without a trial, until the policy was ended in 1975.

Barty Crouch Sr's approach to justice and the Ministry's increasingly hardline methods in dealing with Death Eaters is intended as commentary upon the same actions taken by Muggle Britain during the same period in Northern Ireland.

It's clear that there was some kind of proceedings where the decision was made to hold Sirius - Dumbledore refers to giving evidence to the Ministry. But these proceedings were clearly held in Sirius' absence and appear to be largely summary in nature, without Sirius having the opportunity to raise a defence.

*** My question was less how could it happen and more why did it, though admittedly I didn't express that clearly at all. Just seems like the Ministry could get a lot out of putting him on trial in public. The case against him seems rock solid since they have him seemingly confessing as well as things like Dumbledore thinking he was the secret keeper.

But as I think about it deeper there is a few pretty big reasons, like being worried about the Blacks backing Sirius up or holes being opened up in the case in public where it would be harder to cover up.

**** I think they just wanted it over and done with, quickly. Sirius was mostly sentenced for the muggles iirc, not the secret keeper business itself. That would've just been used to show that he had been Voldemort's man. He also thought that Peter was dead, and was pretty broken since it was his idea, so it's likely he didn't protest his innocence at all. Given what others knew of his nature, history, and family, it must have all lined up

Suspects can't be relied upon to speak the truth, or for any information due to occlumency. Karkaroff was able to divulge a lot, but since Sirius was not really a DE, he couldn't give any information that would've made him useful. I'm not sure if verisaterum can be countered, but given how many real death eaters got away with the impirius excuse, I think it can be countered.

** Trials require evidence, motive, etc. Considering how just about all of the Death Eaters went on to get off scot-free, perhaps Crouch simply thought he was doing the right thing by ignoring basic human rights and throwing Sirius into prison.

I mean, I can't see how this is all that hard to believe, given that the United States has been locking people up for decades without trial since 9/11. You know why there's almost no detainees left at Guantanomo? It's because the vast majority of them were innocent; villagers in Afghanistan would turn in their neighbors because they stole a goat or something else inconsequential. Just point at people and tell the Americans 'they're terrorists!' and - simple as that - they'd get thrown in prison with no charges for years on end.

It's what makes Sirius' false imprisonment so offensive; that thing happens all the time in the real world, and no one bats an eye. It's a shame that of the hundreds of millions of people that read Harry Potter, so few were willing to take the lessons to heart.

*** All very true. I admit i made the post fairly spare of the moment, without thinking it completely through.

There's also the fact that beside the fact that a trial might expose the holes in the case that he must know existed it might have caused the remaining Blacks to rally their influence and resources behind Sirius if they thought he had turned to their way or thinking.

We've been doing that basically forever. Remember Korematsu v. United States, the SCOTUS decision okay-ing internment camps for Japanese Americans in WWII? Or go further back - /Abraham Lincoln/ suspended habeas corpus, so they could arrest and indefinitely hold suspected rebels without the need for trials. It's not something that started with George Bush, is what I'm saying.

** You could read way too far into cannon and say everyone is stupid but I'm pretty sure they were in the middle of a terrorist war and Sirius was in an impossibly guilty position. Everyone thought he was the secret keeper, it looked like he killed everyone (pettigrews to, the dead people) so yeah, I imagine at that point why would they give him a trial. It's pretty obvious hes guilty as fuck and given they're in a war they just chucked him in jail. Yeah, they probably could have given him a trial but if you think about it - hed probably have gone to jail either way.

** What would be interesting is if a fanfic author DID give him a trial, but be found guilty anyway. Sirius would profess his, accidental, internal, guilt. The animagus stuff would come out, but he would have difficulty proving it since none of Sirius, James, or Peter were registered and veritaserum is inadmissible. The only defense on that note would be that Peter sliced his finger off and vanished. But, speaking as someone who had a pet mouse who lost some digits to infection, it would be gnarly to prove.

*** Yeah I think it's entirely possible, even likely, that he would be found guilty. Even in a fair trial there's a lot of evidence that points toward him, I think the deciding factor would be if he could bring himself to defend himself.

He might feel so guilty about James and Lily that he deliberately tries to get himself convicted as penance. Wanting to bring Peter to justice might be enough to change his mind but who knows.

** One aspect I rarely see brought up in regards to this is that in the immediate aftermath there are still plenty of Death Eaters at large... both the die-hards (like Bellatrix who would soon attack the Longbottoms) but also the ones like Lucius that were busy coming up with excuses.

A big public trial of the right hand man, possibly even the Dark Lord's heir, would basically be inviting an attack to free him and possibly overthrow the Ministry all at once if they did it right away. Best to toss him into Azkaban till it was safer... and to be fair if Sirius was who everyone thought he was nobody would be complaining about him being kept there until a trial could be scheduled.

Then the Longbottom attack trial happens, Crouch is disgraced by his son, and the Ministry starts reorganizing into it's post-war status of denial and accepting +bribes+ donations from the wealthy old-money Slytherins who were of course completely innocent of all wrong doing. Some of whom likely are 99% sure Sirius wasn't the traitor (between his own rank and his ties to the Black family, Lucius likely would know about it if Sirius had really turned) and might quietly suggest that a trial is a waste of time at this point.

*** Another possibility is after Crouch is disgraced what happens if Sirius is found innocent in the trial? To my knowledge no DE pointed out Sirius was a Death Eater. Should be be found innocent then it brings up how many more innocent people were convicted or imprisoned by the ministry. If I'm not mistaken (could be fannon) wasn't it a feather in Fudges cap that he was one of the first on scene? I could see himself marketing himself as one of the few who helped catch Black. There's no politician that would want something like that taken away from him especially if he's minister years later.

** Real Reason: J.K. Rowlings needed it to happen for thematic reasons.

Better and more researched answer that is disturbing as hell.

- 1: 1692 Statute of Secrecy is formally invoked.

- 2: 1692 British Bill of Rights was signed.

- 3: Both would have been talked about before they were enacted, neither formed from a vacuum.

- 4: The the 1692 Bill of Rights worked in tandem with the 1679 Habeas Corpus. Which required a court to ensure a prisoner was being legally held.

- 5: British nobility gave in to these only due to the effects of the British Revolution.

- 6: Magicals would have been upper tier citizens simply due to having significantly easier lives due to magic. They were able to protect themselves and as such could care less about muggle politics.

- 7: When the Statute of Secrecy was invoked Magical Britian left those new and dangerous muggle ideas of the Hebeas Corpus and Bill of Rights far behind.

- 8: So they did not in fact have to make sure Sirius was in fact guilty, after all how could an Auror be wrong/.

Summary, the magical world never adopted modern society rights and were well within their permit to just not give a fuck if he was guilty or not.

** In the Harry Potter Homecoming series, Dumbledore explains that since Sirius /was/ the secret keeper, he was guilty. Having a trial would have resulted in him getting kissed by a dementor immediately. Dumbledore then states he thought sending Sirius to Azkaban would at least prevent his death. I think both cannon and a lot of fanfic Dumbledores are described as overly sentimental or otherwise too soft to do what actually needs done.

** I've seen at least one fic that ran with the idea that part of the reason Crouch Senior had Sirius imprisoned without trial was that with Sirius imprisoned, Crouch had a claim on the House of Black through his mother. Of course, that plan went out the window with Barty Junior's Azkaban sentence.

There's also at least one fic where Sirius' imprisonment without trial was orchestrated by the Malfoy family to try to secure Draco's eventual inheritance of the House of Black.

If we have no evidence either way, then I would say it's more likely that he was Chief Warlock than not. Given that he was around 100 years old in 1981 and his big achievement of defeating Grindelwalt was 35ish years prior.

****** Interesting that shifts probabilities quite a bit to be a bit against Dumbledore being Chief Warlock, but I am not sure it precludes it. After the war I expect there were many trials and I doubt every Wizengomet member would want to attend every one.

I can't remember if Dumbledore was still Chief Warlock during Harry's underage magic trial, but if he was then that proves that the Chief Warlock isn't required to preside over every trial.
