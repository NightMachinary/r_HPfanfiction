I'm kinda getting tired of Dark!Harry fics and now I just want a fic where Harry is very wholesome to almost every character he meets.

Harry's scar gives off a dark aura that attracts dark creatures like Werewolves, Vampires, and Lucifer, who help raise him.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

**** The updated date would have you assume so, but the author said it wasn't. But the author has also stated, very boldly, that every time someone asks if it is abandoned, she'll not work on it some more. Which just screams "It's abandoned but I'm too prideful to say so".

So yes, it's abandoned. Which sucks, because I really liked that story when they were actually working on it.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** There's also Enter the Dragon, on the Questionable Questing forums. Being a dragon, Harry matures a bit more slowly than humans, so he's a cheerful, boisterous, friendly eleven-year-old who can also eat railway cars in his native form and tank killing curses. He's overpowered to the point of sometimes being ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun - and he's living in a harsh world, where even his ludicrous levels of brute strength can't solve problems like magic-assisted human trafficking.

** Oh, man, I swear to God that I read a fic like that ages ago. I don't really remember any details, except some loose points. For example, apparently McGonagall didn't approve of the Dursleys from the beginning, and took Harry with her, so now baby Harry lived in the castle. This leads to several interactions between Harry and the staff and students throughout the years. Older students take care of Harry when the staff if busy with classes. At some point, Harry sits in the Slytherin table, and this leads to an unlikely friendship with one of them. I can't remember who, I only remember that he was one of the bad guys in canon (could have been Warrington?). Thanks to this, he eventually develops a decent personality and when he graduates he works for the Ministry, I think, not sure if as an auror or something.

I tried to find the fic in my favorites list, but I can't find anything that resembles that. I hate when that happens. If anyone knows what story I'm talking about, please tell me so I can archive it properly this time.

EDIT: Aw, crap, it just dawned on me that it could have been one of those long-ass Tumblr posts reposted on Facebook, in which case it's gone forever. FML.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]

Beyond the basic premise (Harry is a dragon) this version of him is a lot more practical and less sassy. One of my favourite moments went something like this (I'd Cory and paste but my browser won't let me):

Draco: Enjoy Hogwarts while you can, Potter. My father's coming and he'll have you and all the other animals thrown out of this school!

Harry: {thinks} Thank you, Draco!

Draco: Excuse me?

Harry: Well, you couldn't have just come here to warn me, because you're a Slytherin and that would be a Gryffindor thing to do. But if you came here to /gloat/, and just happened to let slip what your father's up to? That would be a very sneaky and very Slytherin way to tip me off. So thank you!

Draco: I - you - um . . .

And the fic is just full of moments like that. This is a version of Harry who initially thinks that being asked to do garden work by Petunia is a reward for good behaviour because it means he gets to eat the delicious clippings. (Again, dragon.)

EDIT: Just looked down and it's already been mentioned. Still well worth a look!

** THIS ONE: Unfortunately it's not finished linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild)

It's super crack, but Harry is basically this innocent child raised by faeries. He gets everyone to get along with his fairy magic

Edit: you can easily ignore the slash in this one but I think the author is going for a same age relationship between young tom riddle and harry which only began with a gentle friendship since harry is only eleven. super worth the read.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

I would preface that the story itself is dark, and he's suffering from lots of unaddressed trauma and fights a lot with people like Snape. But on the whole, ultimately, he's pretty pacifist & cares about people's lives (unlike dark!Harry)

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel free to check it out. No hard feelings if it's not your cup of tea. :)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.
