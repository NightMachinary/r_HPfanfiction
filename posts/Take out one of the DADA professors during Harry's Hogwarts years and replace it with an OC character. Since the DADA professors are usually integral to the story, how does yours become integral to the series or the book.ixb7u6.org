#+TITLE: Take out one of the DADA professors during Harry's Hogwarts years and replace it with an OC character. Since the DADA professors are usually integral to the story, how does yours become integral to the series or the book?

** Depends which year.

Quirrel and Umbridge replacements would probbaly need to be central if you're loosly tying to the book plots.

Lockhart, Lupin, "Moody", Snape, and Carrow could all be replaced with minor characters. Snape would need to stay on as Potions or some other role though.

**** I almost put him there, but aside from the twist at the end, he didn't do much aside from general advice and help. All you really need is another way for Harry to get his name put in.

** Quirrel : nothing changes, except /everything changes/. Since there is no Quirrel to try and steal the Philosopher's Stone, there is no troll. No troll, no Hermione in the trio - no Hermione in the Trio, massive fuckery among the years. Ron and Harry have difficulties following classes without her helping them do their homework, etc.

To be honest, I think Harry would die in Fourth Year, and only because, y'know, Tournament.

​

Lockhart : They'd be learning usefull things, so. BUT

- No dueling club = no revelations about Harry's Parseltongue

- No Harry's Parseltongue = not understanding what is the monster of the Chamber of Secrets - or at least it'd be way harder, and they may not make it in time.

Ergo, Ginny dies.

​

I'd do more but I'm sleepy :/
