Well I was reading a fanfic about how the wizarding world destroyed the muggle world, and that got me thinking. If the prime minister knows about the wizarding world then shouldnt other world leaders? If so then wouldnt they have started working together to make plans, gathering info, making a secret army, sending spies in, etc just in case fhe wizarding world should turn against them. Perhaps they'd even try to gather magical objects or tame magical creatures, wtc to better prepare themselves.

I just cant see the world leaders learning about magic and then deciding not to do anything about it

  At this, Fudge had actually laughed. “My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?” Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?

We do see it in the books. There's the barrier of a world leader wanting against being declared incompetent due to insanity.

And of course, the barrier to the idea of creating spies are that wizards literally control the muggles. Wizards know muggle world leaders intimately, and rearrange their schedules at a whim (see the phone call earlier in the scene) or worse. Do we really see Durmstrang, a school that doesn't admit muggleborns, in a country where the muggle world leader doesn't have his mind controlled?

And when your topmost leader is being surveilled, it's kind of hard to set up a secret program. Kingsley was flawlessly inserted in the Prime Minister's office at a whim and the minister of magic gives orders to the Prime Minister. Imagine a situation like this in the actual world. We'd call Britain a puppet state.

Add in muggle-repelling charms, confundment, and obliviation it becomes impossible. And magical objects and creatures tend to interact with magical beings in different ways. Boggarts, for example.

And what is this secret army going to do? The muggle model of energy states the energy involved in the conjuration of water is on par with a nuke. Magic is conceptual in HP and overrides the mundane. Bullets and shrapnel are going to collide harmlessly with shield charms.

*** Now I'm thinking about the possibility of the Wizarding World being the shadowy puppetmasters of the Muggle one in a way that would make the Illuminati look like a knitting circle.

*** I suppose your right. I guess that ive gotten tired of reading fanfics where the muggles dont put up any fight whatsoever, even to the point of not even trying in some.

**** They can try, sure, but they're not getting very far without several well informed muggleborns on their side.

***** Thats true. Im sure theres a few muggleborns who might want to help out the muggle governments, but i doubt they'd be enough of them to make any real difference.

******* Oh muggles would absolutely turn on them, but I feel like a good few would be so focused on defeating purists they'd leave themselves vulnerable to the muggles.

**** Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they'd try. But it'd probably go something like this:

The Prime Minister looked wildly around his office and pulled the director of MI6 with him as he ran to a conference room. The director's aide followed.

"Listen, magic is real. There's a hidden country inside our country and they've been smuggling in dragons and wiping the minds of our citizens for hundreds of years," the Prime Minister said, gesticulating ardently to support his point.

"Sir, are you feeling alright? Would you like me to contact your doctor?" the director inquired, looking concerned.

"You don't believe me do you. Don't you get it? That's how they work. They don't need to wipe everyone's mind because of this!" the Prime Minister said, growing louder and louder.

"Sir, we never had this meeting. I recommend that you contact your doctor immediately," the director replied heading towards the door. The aide followed but tripped and dropped the briefcase, papers flying loose as it opened.

"Go ahead sir, I'll pick these up," the aide said. The director nodded and left through the open door.

The Prime Minister breathed wildly. Why couldn't the director understand?

"Minister?" came a voice behind the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister turned and gasped. The aide was standing there with a stick that looked similar to Fudge's wand.

"Like we said Minister, we only reveal ourselves to a muggle country's highest leader. Unfortunately, that's no longer you. /Confundo!/"

The next day the Prime Minister resigned, citing undue stress and mental health reasons.

*** Even worse if even 1 witch or wizard survived this holocaust that is the end of the muggles and they will never get them all at once.\\
The only thing that could work in relation to this would be biological weapons, I've read a fic like this before.\\
However, this has no guarantee of success and had associated risks (mutations, etc.).\\
Mages are used to living in hiding and if(when) someone survives who only knows a little about the Muggle world he can do all kinds of acts of sabotage as revenge (Imperius ftw). The cooperation between all nations necessary that would be needed would never workout.

**** I don't think biological weapons work either. Magic in HP cures mundane illnesses just fine, even ones muggles can't cure. It's explicitly stated that only magical illnesses threaten wizards. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2n8vm/healing_in_harry_potter/]].

**** I agree that the muggles dont really stand a chance of winning. I suppose i just dislike the fact that muggles typically dont put up any fight, and when they do its the bare minimum.

I know that at first nothing/bare minimum is to be expected, after all as far as the average person os concerned magic doesn't exist. Youd think eventually theyd figure it out and put up a fight no matter how useless it would be. Take out some wizarding communities before the end, etc.

The only exception to this would be if the wizards were ro go about it all stealthy like. Making sure the populace/governments had no idea until the end. (Ex: Storys where Voldemort wins and goes to war against the muggles in a not so stealthy way)

  Harry felt sure that they were probably missing at least some of the incidents: between that and the fact that they'd been driving out muggleborns and squibs for decades, there was almost certainly a quiet little office in Whitehall somewhere keeping as much track as they could and drawing up plans. HM Government being what it was, they probably had a quiet little office somewhere for everything.

  ...

  That “quiet little office in London somewhere” pretty much has to exist, for the reasons Harry enumerates, and would have learned to keep themselves very quiet to avoid the obliviators. That they'd have a plan for war against the magicals necessarily follows, and it'd not be entirely secret either. Military planning for everything is a time-honoured tradition, even if only as a punishment or training exercise for junior officers. A useful one, as coming up with a plan for bizarre situations trains up the capability for out-of-the-box thinking. Which is why most militaries have a plan for zombie uprisings, alien invasions, and similarly unlikely eventualities.

Muggle Wank and Muggle Hate are both time-honored traditions in fanfics. Both sides have some good points, and both sides get very tiresome once you've read it a few times.

*** You know i never thought about the muggleborn/squibs that are driven out of the wizarding world, im sure some of them (mostly the muggleborns) decided to use thier magic to help the muggle governments behind the magical governments back. After all muggleborns would have lived as muggles for a good portion of their childhood, not to mention thier friends and family. Most Squibs who helped would probably decide to because of spite

And your right lol it can be a bit tiresome sometimes
