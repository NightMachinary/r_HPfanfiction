I'm not super picky, I would like the story to be Wolfstar (eventual and established relationship are both good!) but otherwise any story where Remus and Sirius act as Harry's fathers is good! I'm not sure how many fics like that exist, but I figured here would be as good a place to ask as any! Thanks!


** The linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series has Sirius as Harry's godfather and Remus registered with the Ministry (through Marauder tampering) as his god/mother/. There's no slash, though.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkffn(12924292) A Second Chance.

A crazy long-fic (231 chapters and counting) that's basically Remus/Sirius Being Surrogate Parents: The Fanfic at least as far as I've gotten into it. Not Wolfstar, but they are practically joined at the hip.

Fair warning, I'm 50 chapters in and Harry's still 4 years away from Hogwarts age. The fic keeps the slice-of-life, pre-Hogwarts part going for /long/.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

*** I started that one, but the characterisation seemed a little off. Also, not keen on the "secret Black family magic" trope.

Maybe it improves, though; I only read a half dozen chapters or so.
