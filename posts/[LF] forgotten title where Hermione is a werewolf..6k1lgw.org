Well, it is hermione centric to be sure. Maybe around 2012ish? I'm not sure on this.


** Well, in "Contemplations of Birth" Hermione turns in to a werewolf at the end, because Remus is her biological father. It's from '05 and good for its genre.

** Lily's Horcrux is the only one that I've read, but it's not Hermione-centric.
