I unironically love a lot of indie!Harry fics, but only found like, one or two stories where Ron and Hermione are included in that group. Most of the time Ron is a replacement or second Malfoy, and Hermione is the love interest. Are there any fics where the Trio as a whole work together and establish their own side in the war? Hell, I wouldn't even mind Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. I think a story where Ron distances himself from evil!Weasleys and protects Harry from them would be really interesting, actually.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** I tried reading this. Felt like too much to be a bit like a recounting of WW2 events, but in a Magical world! I felt like I was reading "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" but without the emotional attachment of the War to actually feel any emotions wrt it. Not for me, unfortunately ☹️
