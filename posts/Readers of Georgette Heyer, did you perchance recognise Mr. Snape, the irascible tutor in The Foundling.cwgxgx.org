** JKR took a lot of overarching themes - and names - from other authors. It's not exactly a novel idea.

(Pun intended.)

*** That is so very true. I read a truly disgusting amount and have always been vastly diverted whenever I've found similarities in characters or language or themes between authors.

It's just that I must've read both Heyer's books and the Harry Potter series a thousand times since coming across them in my childhood, and yet, when I was rereading The Foundling today I came across Mr. Snape, who is a curmudgeonly character and takes great delight in getting his adventuresome young charge in trouble, that it was an Aha! moment I had to share.

**** I've had that happen a lot with British novels, particularly for the names. JKR also drew a lot of character inspiration from the /Worst Witch/ series.
