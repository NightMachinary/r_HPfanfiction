** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) and it's sequels have a smart and powerful fem Harry, but she hides it since she doesn't want to attract attention to herself (because she's masquerading as her cousin).

I am utterly I'm love with this series.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

Emily is very average in terms of skills and abilities. She still does (and will do) some pretty amazing things, but this is more due to luck and happenstance versus anything else.
