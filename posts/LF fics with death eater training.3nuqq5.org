I would like for them to be arguably good fics, but it doesn't have to be about any certain character, pairing, era, etc. I'm pretty much open to all ships, AU or non cannon, whatever. Looking for stuff that has extensive DE training, with a strong focus on character development growth and exploration :)


** It's an old story, but Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] and sequel has Harry joining the Death Eaters. At one point, his romantic interest in the story (Cho) is captured and he tortures and disfigures her body. Good times.

** Nope, never seen that sorry. Wish I had, it sounds interesting. You'd think that Voldemort would train them up, teach them new, arcane magic, etc. Does it talk about DE training anywhere in Canon?

*** I think in canon Snape was taught how to fly by Voldemort.

**** True. But that is pretty minimal as far as training goes.

****** Yep! You bet! We are talking about /training/ for the /Death Eaters/. That means instructing the DE /as a whole/ or at least a core group in order to improve their ability and give them an edge. It might mean teaching the use of offensive/defensive spells as part of a team. Whatever it could look like, /training/ does not look like teaching *1* follower (the one who is a double spy) just *1* cool trick. Wizards can already have broomsticks and apparition, they are not lacking means of mobility or evasion. Besides, do we know for sure that Voldemort taught it to Snape? If there's no direct quote, well we know Snape is a sneaky guy, maybe he stole the info, or maybe he discovered it and taught it to Voldemort....

** What exactly do you mean by "death eater training"? because this can go a couple different ways-- Voldemort training his Death Eaters, or more like Snape-related stuff, i.e. spy training, training other characters to be spies, etc.
