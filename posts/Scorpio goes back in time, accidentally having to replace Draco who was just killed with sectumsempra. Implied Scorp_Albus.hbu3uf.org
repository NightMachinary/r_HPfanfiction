Edit to add : I mean Albus Potter Edit:Solved!


** I remember reading this and feeling morbid. Scorpius resenting his father for being distant and then realizing after time-travel that it was himself... There was a sense of helplessness to it. I don't remember the fic name though.

I wish ao3 History had a search option... I was first excited when I found ao3 had a list of read fics unlike ffn. Sadly, I have hundreds of pages there and not enough patience to wade through it. :(
