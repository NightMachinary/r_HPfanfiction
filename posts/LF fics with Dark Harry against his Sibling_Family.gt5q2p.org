I been having this itch to read a fic where Voldemort dies on the night he tries to kill Harry. When Harry grows he becomes the next Dark Lord or takes Voldemort's place with the Death Eaters. Voldemort is dead, no Horcruxes, he was claimed by Death. It results in him fighting against the Light Side or his family.

It does not really matter how it got to that point. It could be a generic reason like WBWL/Neglect or he is simply dark by nature or nurture. The main thing is that Harry becomes a Dark Lord that people FEAR to even think about. He could be a warlord that attacks random places like a terrorist, corrupts the people in charge, or acts like the boogeyman, no one sees him until he allows them.

Please no fics with the Lord-Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryfindor-Azkaban trope. Harems are welcome so as long they do not include every single witch he lays his eyes on. AUs, time travel, alternate dimension, and crossover are welcome. No slash or Harry/Ginny please. (If this offends anyone, it is not my intention).

Overall, I want to read a Dark Harry that takes being Dark seriously. He does not walk like a Malfoy, he does not believe the world owes him for his past, and he definitely does not announce his advantages or secrets to others. He can be charismatic, he can be shy. He can be very social or reserved. He has a vendetta with his family/Light Side or he sees them as obstacles.

Thank you


** i really want to see this.
