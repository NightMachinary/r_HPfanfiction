Just because Petunia and Lily's names are based on flowers, doesn't mean that Harry or Dudley's would be if they were girls.

I'm also not the hugest fan of the name Harriet for Harry, just seems like there wasn't that much thought on it.

Note no offense to anyone with the name Harriet, it's a nice name, but kind of seems like not much thought for a female Harry.

On the topic of flower names, what one(s) are your favorite? As a bonus question/discussion?

For flower names I think my favorite is Jasmine Potter, it has a nice ring to it imo, Primrose sounds like someone would name a Pureblood child, Rose is weird after reading the epilogue for the Harry Potter series. Naming her Lily after her mom always weirds me out. Though Harry naming his kid Lily weirded me out too. (Same with James and Albus tbh, the whole naming sequence with the epilogue weirded me out tbh). The other flower names like Daisy or such doesn't really fit for female Harry (for me, personally, anyway).

What's your favorite non flower name and non Harriet name that you've come across for female Harry? As another question?


** My favourite name would be Holly as it is a flower name, was a popular common name in the 1980s and connection to the Holly wand. It is also close enough to Harry so everyone can easily guess it is a femharry.

** I hate the name Harriet, too. Really hate it. Can't explain it, though. Maybe it's because I associate it with old ladies.

Of the flower names I've seen, I like Jasmine and Violet. If I ever write one myself it'll be Laura/Laurel/Lauren.

I think the only non-flower, non-Harriet name I've come across has been Taure's Victoria/Alexandra Potter. While I personally think J/L would give their daughter a flower name, those two names are far more enjoyable to read than Harriet, Holly, Heather, Ivy, Iris... Both fit a Girl-Who-Lived better, too.

** I think they usually do Harriet so they can get around the nickname issue and just continue saying Harry in the story. Heather is a pretty good name if you're trying to keep the flower restriction and an H restriction.

I still prefer Harriet (even though I think it's terrible) than Morgana La Fey Potter Black Lestrange, Etc.

If I ever do a female Harry story I would probably either pick Heather Lily Potter or just substitute Heather for another girl name I like.

** For me, a gender-swapped name has gotta start with the same letter and should look and sound similar. Also shouldn't be the same as another character (/eyeballs "Hannah Potter"/). This isn't "what would Lily name her daughter" it's "how can Rook keep the new name straight". So no offense to the many wonderful stories that are out there, but I can't read a fem!Harry named Iris or Vicky or Rose. My brain just doesn't connect the renamed character to the original.

So, using my personal and semi-arbitrary rules, Harriet is an excellent name for a female Harry. So are Holly and Harley. And IMO her middle name should always be Lily, to parallel the canon middle name of James.

** I kind of get where you're coming from, but I have the opposite opinion.

I mean, you want a female!Harry to be her own character rather than inheriting male!Harry's elements, but what is lazy to you is keeping to character for me. If I'm reading female!Harry, I want female!Harry, not a random ass OC put in Harry's situation. Sure, the name is ultimately a very minor part of the character, but it sure as fuck helps making her a plausible Harry rather than an OC. Especially in a setting like HP where every other name is a hint about the character. Flower names are a plausible association to the Evans women, and Harriet is just Harry for girls, so they're alright. A typically brit middle class name would be alright too, as that's a name I could see JKR choosing for a female!Harry, but when I start seeing stuffy names like Victoria or Alexandra my brain goes to Hadrian and Harold Potter instead. That said, as I'm not a brit myself, this goes off my perception of british names rather than the reality of british names, so there might be whole classrooms of little Victorias and Alexandras and I'd be none the wiser.

Also, although I think Harriet an acceptable name for Harry form a setting and characterization point of view, I do find it a rather ugly sounding name so I'd rather not read fics using it. Especially if it's just an excuse for author to shorten it to Harry or (it hurts even to write) 'Harri'.

** I've actually not read too many fem!Harry fics, and the majority of those I have followed the naming convention you so disliked. The “Harriet” version is obviously just the female form for the name Harry, and when every named canon female member of the Evans family line has been named after flowers, it's not difficult for one to think that it would extend to Harry and Dudley, were they female.

Frankly, I've never been overly bothered by it.

Has that been confirmed as canon? I do not read up on pottermore, and frankly have a hard time considering certain things after the books to be canon.

And, even if it had been canon, Petunia and Lily don't seem like the traditional sort, and would likely name daughters what they wanted.

**** I think people like thinking of the Evans having a naming convention with flowers because the Blacks have one with stars. So it seems consistent with the way JK Rowling sets her series. Especially because nobody can tell us the contrary, since the Evans women we know follow the trend. It's Devil's proof. You don't have the evidence it doesn't exist so it can be said it exists.

Edit: but, yeah, you can just argue that Petunia and Lily's parents love gardening. So there is no "traditional" naming convention whatsoever.

The Black family come from a magical Pureblood family though, that just so happens to be stuck up.

The Weasley's don't have a naming tradition, their names seem to be whatever they think of.

The Evans parents are Muggles, they'd have no real reason to do a tradition with the naming.

****** For the Weasleys, I think people want to find a pattern too, actually. You can read theories about all their names having a link to Medieval history: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_family]]

I'm not saying it's right or wrong, about the naming convention. I actually tends to think it's more a meta theory than something holding true in-universe (since, as you say, why would a normal Muggle family have a naming convention?). But I actually believe that JK Rowling tends to organize the names thematically. So I understand why fanfic authors want to reproduce that.

I like flower names for fem!Harry, whether it's Holly or Jasmine (never seen the others), because I feel like the authors try to construct a real character based on the trope fem!Harry while making an effort to integrate it in the HP series' way of writing. But I also like original names since they usually try to offer a new approach of the character. But it does feel more "OC" than fem!Harry, for me. And for those reasons, I do understand the aversion for "Harriet", albeit it never stops me to try reading the fic either way.

There is nothing to think about. There is no specific reason from cannon to pick a certain name over a different one. The author can make up a reason for the fic, but in the end the name that gets picked is the name that the author like the most.

Imo it's just personal preference.
