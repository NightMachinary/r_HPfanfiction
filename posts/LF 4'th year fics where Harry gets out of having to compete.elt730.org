Any fics where Harry/someone else points out that harry isn't bound by the Goblet and doesn't have to compete for whatever reason (can't accidentally enter a contract, cant bind someone else to a contract, the one putting the scrap of paper in is bound. Etc etc) any fic is welcome :) Super bonuspoints for ultra-rare good!Dumbledore (Dumbledore is Harrys magical guardian and doesnt "allow" Harry to compete perhaps?)


** I've been reading this really great story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time and changing the timeline... he prevents Harry from having to compete in the TWT.

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]], instead of having his name in the Goblet of Fire, he's sent as an exchange student to Durmstrang. This is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]].

**** Oh good! Glad I could help! The Goblet of Fire is my least favorite of the books and mostly because of the game and Harry being forced to participate... and also the implausibility of the plan to trap Harry by getting him to win the tournament. Why not just make his toothbrush a port key and have done with it?

  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.

It's a SeerLuna, BadDumbles Fic. McGonnagal gets pointed out that she sucks at her job.

At least there are adults that aren't incompetent.
