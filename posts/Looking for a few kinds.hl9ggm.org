Okay so, cheeky/sassy/sarcastic Harry, I prefer ones where he's younger, like first or second year. I've read a few but I'd like to read some more üòÖüôè

Next, I don't know if I exactly ‚Äòlike' them? But ones where Harry self harms. I wouldn't say I like them but I do read them (I've only ever read one shots of those though)

I do like ones where Harry's angry, preferably while he's in Hogwarts and his anger is directed at one, a few, or most of the professors (mainly Snape and Dumbledore) I wanna read a bunch of those if there is any üòÇ

So yeah, if you know any like that, the links would be appreciated üòãüòãüåü


** Sassy Harry (he's 15)

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]
