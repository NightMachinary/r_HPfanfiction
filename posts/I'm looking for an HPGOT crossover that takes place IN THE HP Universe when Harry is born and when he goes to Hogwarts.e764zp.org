Are there any? I really have gotten frustrated looking for this story because I don't understand why no one writes a story like this. If someone knows a story that fits my premise please link it below. Thank you. Harry meets the Starks at Hogwarts. Everything is good until Joffrey decides to have Ned Stark burned alive when he finds out he's a bastard right before Harry goes looking for the stone.

This story has Cornelius Fudge trying to calm everything down but at no avail when Umbridge advises Joffrey to burn Ned alive. In a result, Robb declares war on Joffrey, Stannis declares war on Joffrey and Renly, Renly declares war on Stannis and Joffrey, and Balon declares war on the North. The events of the books of HP still happen, but the war of the five wizard kings take place in the COS and the PAO. The Red Wedding still happens and after it, the Northern Lords come to Hogwarts and crown Jon Snow as the new King in the North. Jon assembles an army of magical wildlings from Greenland, they get ambushed by the Nigth King. Jon, Arya, Remus, and Sirius get out. And with Arya, Jon retakes Winterfell with his father (who in this story is Sirius Black). The last part I remember it was at was their plan to trap Harry in the Goblet of Fire and Voldemort sending Malfoy to go negotiate with the White Walkers.

If this story is not there anymore than this sucks because I've looked everywhere for it. If I mistake it for a story that has never been written, I hope someone writes a story like this. Jon and Dany being one of the two romantic relationships, the other being Harry and Daphne.

Just adjust them accordingly.

Edit:

I don't understand a word you're saying below the title btw. None of it makes sense, and I speak English.

That still doesn't explain why foreign Wizards would be involved in another nation's afair. And where the hell would Westeros even fit on Earth? The War of the Five King's won't make sense without lands and peasants. Wizards don't need peasants, and the only thing they have to lord over their fellows is their blood status. So why the hell would they be fighting a war over who gets to rule the kingdoms when they can effectively rule their own fiefs without a sovereign?

** I give up. Here are some fics I know about though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/66011][The Moment You Doubt Whether You Can Fly]]

Part 3 is Sansa centric. Sansa Stark/Willas Tyrell is the ship featured. A group called the Dragonborn replace the Death Eaters in this universe.

Also, here's the tidbit that mentions Dany:

/How many people in this hall have met the man who calls himself the Dragonlord, Sansa wonders? How many people have - or had - grandparents who were Aerys' friends at school, how many have parents or older siblings who were friends with Aerys' sons?/

/Sansa was friends with Aerys' daughter, kind of. Daenerys was in Charms Club, and now she's in the Auror's office, training under Cersei Lannister. They say Cersei only takes the best, and that she's mad as a bag of cats, but by all reports Daenerys is more than capable of keeping up with her./

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18867052/chapters/44780755][The Girl With The Dragon Eggs]]

Arya and Dany centric. Arya Stark/Daenerys Targaryen is the ship featured. Yes, this is actually a thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19975825/chapters/47289151][The Wolf of Another Time]]

Arya centric. Arya Stark/Gendry Water and Arya Stark/Daenerys Targaryen are the ships featured.

I don't know why Arya is popular in the HP AUs on ao3.

** Okay... back with another update on my hunt.

Usually it's ao3 or forums that welcome fanfics that have the more creative, out there, kinda fics, but it appears that FFN's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter_and_A-song-of-Ice-and-Fire_Crossovers/224/4254/][Harry Potter + A Song of Ice and Fire]] has got some in itself too.

Here's some more interesting stuff I found. It's not what you wanted, but it's an interesting read and not at all long.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12646365/1/Dragonkin-Abroad][Dragonkin Abroad]]

Ginny centric two-shot. Ginny is /'killed'/ by the Middle Kingdom(a secret hidden magic Kingdom somewhere in China)'s version of the Great Wall of China. She ends up in Essos.

As to why she was there in the first place... Ginny decided to be an explorer, inspired by Luna's Magizoologist expeditions. Along the way she gains a Dragon animagus form during her stint at the Romanian Dragonreserve.

I love Luna's carefree reaction...

/Half-way around the world, Luna Lovegood groaned in exasperation as one line of the future snapped indelibly into the present and then strolled flashily by into the past./

/Who died from running into a wall? An idiot, that's who. Well, at least her childhood friend wasn't really dead./

/She got up to write a note to Harry that Ginny had declined his invitation firmly, very firmly. Maybe she should start researching dimension travel just in case some of her friends decided to follow their wayward redhead?/

/It could be fun./

/She hummed, cheerfully imagining the chaos that could, might, may happen./

Ginny's musing was equally amusing...

/Then she snickered. All those bets about her brothers leaving the country to get away from their mother...they couldn't compare to leaving behind an entire planet./

I also found another /'Dragonkin AU'/ by InkyStake.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12784378/1/Owlsrest][Owlsrest]]

This one's more darker in tone.

Edit:

...but I love the character interactions. Especially Charlie's and Dany's.

Daenerys trying firewhisky was entertaining...

/"Why is it called firewhisky?" she asked as Ginny rolled a few barrels out of the Owlsrest cellars./

/Charlie laughed. "Oi, Ginny. Remember that bet?"/

/Ginny grimaced but nodded reluctantly. Their distilled firewhisky wasn't like Ogden's but it was approaching it. Fleur, as the best of them in potions, actually managed to approximate the recipe, though she grumbled about overly-paranoid alchemists./

/Charlie pulled out two cups and filled them from the barrel. "Bottoms up, little sis."/

/They drank in one gulp. Charlie grinned at the warmth coursing through his stomach and with the ease of long practice, blew out a cloud of steam towards the sky. Ginny was coughing tiny slivers of flame and gouts of smoke, to her chagrin. She never did take to spirits./

/He turned to Daenerys' raised brows. "That's why it's called firewhisky."/

/He offered her a cup. She looked at it skeptically but took it./

/"Your Grace," warned the large bear of a man who was her knight apparently. But Daenerys knocked back the cup fearlessly. She gasped./

/Charlie laughed. "Just let it out."/

/She coughed, though a bit less than Ginny. The flames and smoke dissipated. Charlie refilled her cup. "It's really meant to be sipped."/

/She glared at his cheerful explanation. "I do not think I will ever be used to the taste."/

/"Yeah, it's a bit strong. It's the warmth that's important."/

/"Not even," she muttered. He patted her shoulder with a grin. She sipped and grimaced./

Them feeding the dragons was interesting as well...

/"Why do you feed them blood and drink?"/

/Charlie smiled at the young woman who was coaxing the pale dragon to drink from the bowl of blood. "It's a precaution, mainly. Dragons are predators and carnivores, it's just their nature. Getting them addicted to the alcohol and animal blood means there is less chance that they would eat humans when they grow big enough. Well, unless you drench someone in wine and blood."/

/Dany's eyes widened. She had not thought of that. "I am their mother. Surely they would obey me?"/

/"And when you aren't there?" Charlie handed her another bowl. "They will need to hunt, and you will not always be there to stop them when they get hungry enough. Admittedly, this is not a foolproof solution but it significantly lessens the risk that they would eat innocents."/

/Dany was quiet for a time. "Thank you," she said at last. "I would not chain my children for fear of what they would do."/

/"Dragons can't be tamed," he agreed. "But a dragon that can control his passions is the more dangerous dragon."/

/She blinked at him, then nodded, conveying a certain respect. "I will keep it in mind."/

Not exact, but it does feature an ASOIAF character in the HP universe. Jon Snow and Harry Potter vs the worlds.

In part one Jon helps Harry with Voldemort, and in part two, given the pattern that's being established, Harry helps Jon with the Knight King.

Part two is this one...
