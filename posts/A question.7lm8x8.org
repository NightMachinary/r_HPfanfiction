Where exactly did "so mote it be" come from, and how has it become so ingrained in fanfiction? It's one thing that I hate most about fanfiction and as soon as one pops up, the fic is instantly on probabation for me, any more and I give up on the fic.

So why exactly do people love it so much?


** I'm no expert, but from what I understand the phrase itself comes from certain oaths in the Free Mason fraternity/society. I think it also was used during the tv show Charmed (even less sure on this), which got appropriated into Harry Potter fanfiction as part of magical oaths, something which we know exists in HP but we know very little of.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley][Aleister Crowley]] used it in his magickal writings occasionally, so it's possible that some fic writers are taking their inspiration from there. If the story you're reading has some sort of occult spin to it, chances are there's some Crowleyan influence in there.

*** *Aleister Crowley*

Aleister Crowley (; born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 -- 1 December 1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.

Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism.

*** So people will write a character taking a vow (usually Harry in demanding fealty from X character or Harry making sure everyone that can hear him know he under no certain terms entered his name in the goblet) and at the end of The never clever vow they'll cap it off with so mote it be so everyone knows it's srs bzns.

***** It's super ridiculous. Some fics even take it so far as to be when you so mote it be, if you're lying your magic will disappear/kill you/EXPLOSION!/ insert some horrible fate here.

It's just...it's bad.

******* Well it's used mostly in bad fics where lots of other bad tropes are rampant.

And maybe I should stop here and rescind the bad epitaph and use something else.

Harry being a protagonist that has things happen around him and to him while he rarely becomes effective until the plot demands him to can drive certain readers to spare.

So when they go to ‘fix' everything in their own they make Harry a ‘Man of Action' that Rights all wrongs and takes action! So mote gets to be this awesome thing that shows Harry either gets a new ally of sorts or proves once and for all he's not a liar.

******** It's not just bad fics that it pops up in, I was reading this really good fic the other day (I honestly couldn't tell you the name of it, I've been on a bit of a fanfic binge this past week), everything was fine, good writing, characterization, and above all a good plot, and then out of nowhere there it was, so mote it be.

********* It's the air of finality to it.

I've been on record saying I don't mind expanding upon what JKR established as fact in her world.

And it makes sense right? Ending a vow or some other magically charged oath with a universally ‘known' phrase.

It just reads dumb.
