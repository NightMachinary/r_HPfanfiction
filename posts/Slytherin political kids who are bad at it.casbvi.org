Hi! After all the ridiculous 11 year olds are good at politics stories, I'm looking for something that subverts this somewhat. The kids think they're good at politics and try, but they actually kind of suck at it. Because they're children. Certain adults come in who actually are good because they have the experience, and acknowledge this. I was inspired by a post several years ago, asking for stories about kids being kids in all their terrible glory. I ended up finding Faith and the Devil by Lapsed Pacifist on there, so thanks!


** I've also looked for fics like this, and the closest thing I can think of is one I ended up writing. It starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) and has Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin. There is an emphasis on politics via the adult characters, and some of the children's schemes include using a prank spell to get Draco Malfoy to stop leaving his socks all over the floor.

I'm currently writing the fourth volume in the series, and have written a little over 200k words in the series so far.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

** Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting deals with this for a bit. Social order in Slytherin basically breaks down after some failed power plays without the inherited political landscape keeping feuds in check. It's just on the sweet spot between crack fic and massive AU so I'm not sure if it's quite what you're looking for. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a laugh.
