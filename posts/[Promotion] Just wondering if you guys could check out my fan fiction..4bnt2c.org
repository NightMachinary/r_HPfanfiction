** A few initial thoughts...

1. I'm not sure why you've put so many spaces in the dialogue. There doesn't need to be a space between the quote and the quotation marks, i.e, " Yes." Should be "Yes." (Plus, I actually much prefer single quotation marks like this: 'yes.', but that's a matter of preference.

2. Present tense is /really/ hard to pull off and rarely works. If I were you I would stick to past tense. You have a lot of "I do this. I do that. We do this." and it's all very unnecessary.

3. You have a lot of spelling and grammar errors. A beta will be a big help.

4. You're dealing with a highly sensitive topic that needs to be done very carefully. This isn't a criticism, it's simply a word of caution. Please be very careful about how you write about this.

** - In titles, all words other than definite articles are capitalised, other than when they are either the first or last words. I'd suggest /Thinner Is the Winner/.

- 'i' should be 'I.'

- For every change in speaker in a conversation, create a new paragraph to help the reader understand who is talking.

- I'd highly recommend reviewing [[https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/punctuation-in-direct-speech][conventions for punctuating dialogue.]]

- Names of potions and classes are capitalised in the HP universe. 'swelling solution' should be 'Swelling Solution.' 'muggle studies' should be 'Muggle Studies.'

- Your and you're are frequently confused homophones. 'Your' is the possessive and 'you're' is an abbreviation for 'you are.'

- Proper names are capitalised. 'granger' should be 'Granger.'

I've never seen a story that focuses on Body Dysmorphic Disorder, so cheers on finding something new in fanfiction. That's not easy to do. I think with a bit of work, your story holds promise. Good luck in writing!

**** I wish I had time, but unfortunately I have to decline. I'd recommend using the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=202][ff.net beta page]]. I've found my betas through there and they're all quite good.
