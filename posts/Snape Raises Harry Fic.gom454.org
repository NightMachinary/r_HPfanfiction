:END:
Hey peeps,

I'm looking for a story where Snape takes harry and raises him in another country. He goes to a magical school and has a pet tiger. Pretty sure it's time travel as he gets dobby to give Sirius food everyday.

Anyone?


** linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan) is what I think you're looking for.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
