** Why would they team up? Grindelwald believed in wizard supremacy over Muggles. Voldemort was either a non-ideological wannabe dictator, or believed in pureblood supremacy.

In any case, I've had this plot bunny for years, where instead of killing Voldemort, the goodguys end up portkeying him into Numengard, where he is stuck sharing a cell with Grindelwald, who's mellowed out through the years, so the hypothetical fic (/Tom and Gellert: Cellmates/) would play a tense, shrill Tom, always plotting an escape, off a mellow, philosophical Gellert, who just wants to have a pleasant prison sentence, which annoys Tom to no end.

*Voldemort:* Foolish mudblood! I have made myself impervious to any and all of your pathetic bullets! Muhahahahaha ---

*Hermione:* Hasta la vista, Voldie! /[fires a portkey bullet at */Voldemort*/]/

*Voldemort:* --- hahahaha... /[looks around]/ Curses! Where am I?!

*Grindelwald:* Hey, fella. What're you in here for?

*Voldemort:* Gellert Grindelwald? But he's in...

*Grindelwald:* Hey, relax, fella. It ain't bad. Gets a bit dull after a while, but, well, even a life sentence is not forever, you know...

*Voldemort:* ...

/[Later...]/

*Grindelwald:* It ain't all bad, here. I've even got a still going. Not the best bathtub gin, but I'm working on it. Want a taste?

*Voldemort:* I gave up my ability to be intoxicated for an immunity to mind-altering Potions twenty years ago.

*Grindelwald:* Bummer, man. Wouldn't drink the stuff for the taste, that's for sure...

/[Even later...]/

/Grindelwald:/ When I was your age, Tom, I looked into the whole immortality thing, too, and you know what I discovered? The harder you try to become immortal, the more people will be trying to kill you, that's what. I remember, old Nicholas was telling Albus and me, that for ever year of life they got out of that stone, he and Perenelle, they had to spend half of it guarding the Stone and reinforcing the protections, and another third fighting off assassins. They never did figure out if it was worth it.

/[Even later...]/

*Voldemort:* But surely you still have followers on the outside who could help us escape!

*Grindelwald:* I've got some fans, sure. Sometimes, they sneak me weed. You can have some next time they do.

*Voldemort:* Intoxication immunity.

*Grindelwald:* Oh, right. Sorry, man.

*** I don't really remember hearing much about Grindlewald. I've only seen a couple fics with Grindlewald in them beyond just a mention. One had him really-really-dark-lord type (eating their hearts etc), another had him wizards are better than muggles, and others had it similar to Voldemorts beliefs.

Nice idea.

** Writing a Voldemort who'd be willing to 'team up' with anyone, thereby admitting he has an equal, would totally change his character. He'd prob have to be weaker, so order might not need any more power
