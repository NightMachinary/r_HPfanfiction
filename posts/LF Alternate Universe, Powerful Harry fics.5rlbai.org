I love fanfics where Harry goes to an alternate dimension or back or forward in time, etc. with prior knowledge.

Where he's knowledgeable, experienced, powerful, etc.

Heck he doesn't need to be that powerful but I would like if he had prior knowledge.

Fics that I've read that are what I'm looking for are "C'est La Vie" "Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and "The Long Journey Home".

Genderbending if fine if Harry is a girl.

No harems! No slash. Bashing is okay as long as the story itself is well-written and doesn't devolve into crack.

Experienced, knowledgeable Harry!

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** My litmus test for 'Powerful' Harry is how stacks up in single combat vs Voldemort:

"A Black Comedy", linkffn(3401052): He and Sirius forced Voldemort into retreat in single combat.

"Children's Crusade", linkffn(6989327): Hermione from an alternate dimension requested their assistance.

"Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855): He and Bellatrix fucked around with Voldemort in 2nd half of the story.

"Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday", linkffn(2477819): Scarily overpowered Harry.

"Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): The 4 of them kicked asses in the new dimension and then took care of Voldemort in the old one, but they were severely damaged people.

** The Lone Traveler series started by The Professional and then continued by Dunuelos is a very long one where due to a botched ritual Harry goes from AU to AU to fix things, like Quantum Leap. Harry is already pretty powerful and he just gets more powerful as time goes by. There's crossovers with multiple ficdoms, some are quite unusual for the HPverse like The West Wing.
