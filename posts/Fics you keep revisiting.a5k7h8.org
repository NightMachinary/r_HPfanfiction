In my case, it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long journey home]]. The writing style jumps very hard off the page in a way that is profoundly meaningful. For an unfinished fic, it feels like such a rich work. Every six months or so, I come back and re-read it and it never lets me down. I dream of the day Rakeesh somehow decides to come back to the story and continue it. Given its structure, it need not have a real ending, but further chapters will only make it better.

â€‹

Are there other stories you come back to and why?

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9426206/1/One-Step-Left][One Step Left]] saved on my phone. It's a monser, over a 100 chapters, and I absolutely love rereading the carnage in Saint Mungo's and the way Hermione is slowly growing more twisted and dark because she's using the Elder Wand. Although I originally started reading it because of Hermione/Narcissa, their on again off again relationship is kind of off putting (after multiple rereads), even if the reasons are well established for it. I grow more and more fond of Fleur's arc as Fury with every reread. And oh yeah. The whole goblin rebellion thing.

They are short, dense works that absolutely wreck me in vastly different ways. Cauterize, in particular, is one of the few fics out there that is so good and so pure that it has graduated to inviolate headcanon.

For example, I can imagine: her being marched into the throne room in King's Lansing whereupon Joffrey demands she swear fealty after watching him torment Sansa; her telling him no; him having the goldcloaks manhandle her; and her briefly losing her shit.

** Definitely linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). I never get tired of watching Harry gradually heal from the trauma of the original timeline as he builds up his friendships on firmer foundations than before.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

*** I'm always impressed by how well the quality of HPMoR stacks up against others, but I don't actually reread the whole thing very often. It's just so long...

I do read bits of it periodically. Like Battle Magic class, or SPHEW.
