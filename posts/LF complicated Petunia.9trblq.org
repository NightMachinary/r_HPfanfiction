She lost her family, was informed of her Sister's death by the way of an abandoned baby , and lives in a dysfunctional household. I would love to read fics where she becomes a better person despite all of that. or maybe not better, but more interesting than in canon .

(my first post on reddit; hope it adheres to the format)


** Fics with good Petunia:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): This is a bigger AU in which she was a squib and worked for Gringotts as a tomb-raiding archeologist (like Lara Croft or Indiana Jones). Its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), has just been published.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry was blinded by Voldemort's killing curse, and Petunia didn't develop her antagonism toward him as in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8864658/1/By-Baker-Street-Station-I-Sat-Down-and-Wept][By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept]], linkffn(8864658): She actually turned out to be a witch later, and Dudley was also magical.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

**** I liked Baker Street, but the double Severitus seemed shoe-horned in and ridiculous and didn't even make sense. The author clearly loves Snape, but it would have been more realistic to have him slowly develop a relationship with Petunia

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10952250][We Would All Be Happier]] linkao3(10952250) may not be what you're looking for as it only covers a few days after Harry is left with the Dursleys, but it is, if not quite sympathetic, at least understanding towards Petunia.

** Third Sister by PrettyPrettyShiny is interesting. It's a fem Harry that goes back in time, and you kind of sympathize with Petunia as Lily is shown to be pretty oblivious to being the favored child, etc.
