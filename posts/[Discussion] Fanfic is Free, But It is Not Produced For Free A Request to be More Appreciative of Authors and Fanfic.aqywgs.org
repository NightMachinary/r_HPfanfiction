I recently came upon a [[http://kedreeva.tumblr.com/post/180692392748/when-i-say-fanfiction-is-free-part-of-what-im][post]] about the "free" nature of fanfic that i do think should be shared here.

From the post:

#+begin_quote
  When I say “Fanfiction is free” part of what I'm saying is yes, you did not pay for the thing.

  But I saw a comment from someone that made me realize the rest of the intention behind these words is being lost.

  *Fanfiction is provided for free, but it is not produced for free.*

  Authors pay their effort, including physical and emotional and mental. Authors pay their time, in planning the story (mental time) and writing the story (physical time). Sometimes it's less than an hour for something quick and dirty, like askbox prompts. Sometimes it's years of their lives in epic fic hundreds of thousands of words long. Authors pay additional time to alpha read their own stories, trying to make sure that they're free of SPAG errors and make sense and sound good. Beta readers pay their time and effort alongside the authors for editing the stories. Authors pay for posting their stories with all of the anxieties that come from allowing their work - which to this point they have invested all of the above - into the public eye because while it has certainly cost them a good amount to produce the story, fandom history has proved that many other people out there enjoy fanfiction, and authors believe that at least someone else will enjoy their story, too.

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is that it costs the writers a lot of something in order to produce it. A lot has already been paid into a piece of fanfiction by the time it is available for readers to read. The expense of fanfiction creation is, by and large, resting squarely atop the shoulders of writers.

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is that readers don't have to pay the cost of creating fanfiction.

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is that readers don't have to pay in anything - not time, not money, not effort, not anything - in order for fanfiction to be created. It's a donation. It's a gift. It's available for you to take or leave, at the expense of someone else.

  Writers have, for a very long time, requested donations of one thing as remuneration for everything they put into making fanfiction: comments. Authors have asked, in so many different iterations: “If you have consumed what I have labored and invested in to create and if you have found any enjoyment in it, please tell me, so that I can recharge enough to do this again.” Some of them may recharge on critical comments, but most of us don't because we've already paid everything we want to pay to create the story.

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” isn't just that it doesn't cost you any money. I am saying “Please respect the time and effort you didn't have to pay into creating this thing you enjoyed, by respecting the individual creator's requests.”

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is “be kind to authors, they have paid a lot for this gift they're sharing with all of us, and they deserve to feel like it was worth it.”

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is “please don't charge authors more time and emotional effort than what they've already provided you at no absolute cost.”

  I'm not saying any of this to argue. It's a fact that authors pay into providing fanfiction. They do it for fun. They do it out of love. They do it because they enjoy writing. No one is making them do it. No one is paying them to start or finish the story. That doesn't mean it's not WORK. And the only return they get on what they put into the story is the kindness of strangers that invest a little bit back by leaving a nice comment. That is why they stay, that is why they do it again, that is why we have fanfiction.

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is “please don't be the one charging authors so much more that they leave.”

  What I am saying when I say “fanfiction is free” is “please keep it that way.”
#+end_quote

I do think as the community with the largest amount of fanfics and the most active discussions, we could stand to be more appreciative of the authors who want to share their work and love of the source subject with us. That as the post stated, readers themselves should be aware that there are costs in fanfic, even if none of it is monetary. Anton Ego's quote at the end of Ratatouille rings true for me here whenever we go extremely negative on certain types of fanon.

#+begin_quote
  In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.
#+end_quote

So do please err on the side of kindness when discussing fanfics and always remember that there is a back button


** To be honest, I love this sub, but it has made me almost afraid to write fanfiction. Watching the way some people tear apart authors and pick apart their stories is unnerving. I've been able to make a mental list of “what not to do” in a story and I know that you can't please everyone, but sometimes it just feels impossible.

*** There are definitely people here that have made me feel miserable about my writing before, but then I remind myself I'm not writing for them. There are also people here that have been overwhelmingly supportive and helpful. It can be really tough, especially when you have really enjoyed writing something and someone is rude and unhelpful about it. I recently had that with one of my humour fics on this sub and it came at a really personal time for me so I got a bit teary but resisted commenting.

But, I've now figured out which people give helpful (even if critical) feedback, and which people I'm just never ever going to please ever. That helps more than you would expect.

** We as a community should be more interactive and engaging with creators, because this sub only exists BECAUSE of our creators, good or bad and everything in between. We should give them a reason to stay and keep producing nice things for us to read. Complaining is okay, but it's better to be mindful about asking WHY we don't like something instead of just accepting that we don't like it. Include some element of constructivity in our reasoning.

Further suggestions:

- Encourage authors, instead of downvoting people who ask for advice on their fics, or self-promote their work here. I see that happen all the time here, and I don't understand why. This is the HPfanfic sub, they are discussing HPfanfic. It's not off-topic, therefore downvoting is going against the Reddit standard of conduct.

- Read fics and engage with the authors. If there's a fic you liked enough to recommend, and you recommended it to another user here, why not copy and paste your rec to the fic's Review submission form on FFN.net or Ao3? Maybe the author would like to hear that people liked their work. When I see people discussing an ongoing fic that is actively being updated, that's the kind of thing that authors would probably like to see, and maybe would have a response to. But of course they never see it because it's a random reddit thread posted at 4AM in their timezone.

- Take steps in writing the content we want to see. Instead of complaining about horrible harem fics and how they never work, why not write a fic where this is explored in a realistic way? Instead of asking for ridiculously specific prompts in a thread, why not take 20 minutes to write a small snippet to post along with the idea?

I remember I had a lovely PM conversation (read: not particularly lovely at all) with a reader absolutely hyperventilating over the fact that I hadn't made Harry as strong a wizard as Dumbledore in a crossover fic I wrote, because Harry is obviously as strong as Dumbledore in canon. I tried pointing out that, A.) Making Harry an uber-strong wizard in this fic would actually undermine the integrity of the story I was trying to tell, and B.) Harry is /nowhere/ near as good at magic as Dumbledore in canon, but I eventually gave up because the guy just wouldn't budge on his completely unsupported headcanon and just kept making weird, nonsensical and snarky jabs about my "lack of creativity."

***** Mine was a dispute over how much the time-turner would have aged Hermione. For simplicity's sake, I went with one (1) full year, making her biologically 18 as of the 19th of September 1996. This was important to me because there are grown-up (read: sexy times) scenes in the story that involve her and an older character, and even though the age of majority in HP is 17, I wasn't comfortable with her being under 18 in this scenario. The person first tried to tell me to just change her age to 17.5 and when I explained why I wanted her 18, they had the gall to tell me to just start the story 6 months later. I'd written up to almost Christmas! AND I had used Christmas as a significant date. I refused and explained that I was too far in to do that and they immediately back-pedalled. This wasn't in PMs, though. This was in the comments section. Ended up deleting all but their initial comment and my main response comment.

** As a writer, I cannot agree with this post more. I love writing, I do. I do it for me. But I also do it for everyone else. I do it because I want to share this crazy story in my head - the one I live in all the time - because I want it to live in the world so other people can see it. And all I want... is, perhaps, some acknowledgment that I'm not out there doing it alone. A comment. It means the world. Leave one. :)

Even if it's something small, for a writer to know that someone is reading and/or enjoying their work is enough to make their day. It's all we want. It's true.

And constructive criticism, by the way, is just fine. Welcome even. At least that's my take on it.

** A whole lot of pretty words, that can be summed up much easier as "Be a little bit more respectful to people who you interact with, even if they are just some online persona". Or more succinctly put as "Don't be an asshole".

​

Readers shouldn't get all angry and pissed because a story is going a different way then they wanted, or because their waifu is being sidelined in favor of the authors waifu, or whatever. Though I think that simply stating your disappointment/preference is fine as long as you maintain rule number 1. IE: Don't be an asshole. Same goes, if the author is writing one type of story, don't jump in with "strong suggestions" that are completely out of left field. (I'm looking at all those reviews/comments that keep suggesting girls to add to the harem, and how it would TOTALLY make sense... for a work that didn't, doesn't, and never even hinted at a harem.)

​

It goes both ways though. While authors are investing time and creative energy into a work of passion, it's not like readers aren't investing anything into the story. Time to read it, emotional attachment to the characters, etc. There is a certain amount that the readers ARE owed, not so much in "creative decisions" or anything dumb like that, but in communication and loyalty. You know, stuff like "Try to finish the story that a lot of people are enjoying", or "Let people know if you decide to abandon it rather then just disappearing", and maybe, just maybe "Try to avoid promising to post the next chapter by the end of the day, and then never posting anything ever again.".

​

I think that sometimes people are just looking for an excuse as to why they want to rewrite or delay the next chapter, or quit the story, etc.

Hm. No, I have had these things happen more than once, as shameful to admit. I back everything up on my USB, EHD, SSD, and on the cloud. One time, all of them messed up. The cloud did not update, my EHD just failed to load for a solid week, my PC rolled back due to a windows update, and I lost my USB.

Another time, I legit just deleted my entire folder after cutting it from my USB. I then deleted it, thinking it was the old one. Another few days of writing lost.

Happens, to be honest. Nothing is truly infallible.

On a side note, in the span of a year, I have lost six USBs.

** I need to do better at this for sure, because it's sooooooo easy and tempting to snark.

Also, I am writing a story that has elements that have been picked on in just the past couple of days on here. Obviously they weren't targeting me since I haven't put anything online yet. But still, it is a little discouraging and I imagine it hurts a lot more if it's your actual work being criticized.

THAT SAID, authors, PLEASE learn that you can NEVER please everybody. My family member is a prolific novelist, and she gets goodreads reviews all the time about "I liked the story, but it was too scary for me." Same book, someone else's review: "the tension felt thin and it wasn't scary at all." "I wish there had been more romance between the leads." Same book: "I can't believe the author forced the main characters to get together. Feels artificial and I would have preferred no romance." "Book ended abruptly." "it dragged on and on" etc. etc. and these are award-winning, acclaimed books, people. You cannot please everyone. Just remember how much everyone whined about the "classics" we were assigned to read in school. Just cause you are getting criticism doesn't mean you didn't create a great artwork.

** I have this problem myself. Especially when I story seems to start off well and takes a dive for no apparent reason. I manage to reign it in sometimes, but there have been a handful of times where I got super triggered and left a mean review.

There are general standards I think should usually be criticized (poor spelling and grammar, excessive details, etc.) but I try (emphasis on try) to mix in some positive stuff if the issues were minor. Writing fanfic myself I know it's easy for people to forget there's a person behind the text and on the grand scheme of things it's rarely sensible to go ape on someone.

Another commenter complained that readers use their time to read so they can criticize too. Issues here. The time difference is rarely even comparable. I've written 10K chapters of stories that people read through in 5 or 10 minutes, yet it took me weeks to write. If someone goes in super hard core and calls it a waste of time (true or not) it's simply a fact that they hardly lost any time at all in reading it, whereas I've spent many hours planning, drafting, writing and correcting it. The cost to them is the time it takes to cook some eggs, but to me it was far more. Some proportion is called for in most cases.

*** Exactly this. I started planning and writing a fanfic around December 2013, I've completely scrapped and started over 3 times already when I had around 20 chapters done, both times that averaged about 5k words per chapter. On my third attempt, I'm currently at ch19 and it finally still feels right. I chose not to upload it until I got it finished just because it takes so long and I kept going back and forth. But even when I'm not writing, I'd sometimes just think of something for the story or play out different scenarios that I might want to add to the story. It's not at all comparable to the time it takes to read and think about someone else's fic.

** I'm gonna also wing it and say that there is also unequal treatment between fan artists and fanfiction writers in general. To a lot of fans who consume both fanart and fanfic, it appears that they treat the former as a privilege and the latter as an entitlement. While I acknowledge that both mediums require a huge amount of expertise and effort, fans respect artists that can draw their fav characters well while treating fanfics and writers as a natural byproduct of fandom. And I think that's unfair because these are both 2 valid forms of art and they both deserve equal support. Eespecially with fanfic where the writer is working for free (+ all the reasons stated above) and not asking fans to pay for the release of their next chapter. I just feel like we deserve a little more love and respect. I apologise if this all sounds a little rant-y, but I need to get this off my chest.

** Truth. We had one review who said because it's not what they would do in a situation, the character (which we largely created) was being OOC and just being used as a plot device. Not exactly a confidence booster. Still bugs me months later.

** Being an author myself, I understand just how much constructive feedback is appreciated. Which is why I always try to be respectful and constructive when giving feedback.

I normally don't criticize fanfiction authors for the direction that they take their stories (mainly, my comments are on the execution of the fic itself). Oftentimes I find the direction they're taking the story to be a fascinating one that I'd like to see more of, and it honestly boggles my mind whenever I see a reviewer try to force the author to go a certain direction with their fic.

That being said, I do have a pet peeve when it comes to bad grammar in fics. Like, I can forgive the occasional typo and whatnot, that happens to all of us. But if you're slaughtering the English language, getting called out on it by reviewers, and you refuse to improve your grammar, do not expect me to give you any feedback at all since you're clearly not listening to your audience when they're making valid points. I'll just close the tab and move on to the next fic.

** It takes a great deal of time and commitment to write a fic: even more to finish one. I've seen entitled writers on these forums (/I only got ten reviews on my last chapter, doesn't anyone love me any more?/) but I've seen a lot more entitled readers /(I'm so tired of this trope and that trope and why do writers abandon fics and why aren't they more imaginative and why don't they try harder and gimme what I want, gimme gimme, gimme . . ./ ).

Like (I guess) most fanfiction writers, I wrote for myself the stories I couldn't find anywhere else, but I posted them because . . . I was proud of what I'd done: I wanted to share it: I thought other people would like it too? All those things, I suppose. It does feel rotten when nobody else loves your babies the way you do, but that's the nature of the beast.

** I think the issue as redditors have mentioned is that some readers are entitled and self-absorbed.

They read one fic they love/hate and then go on to judge every other fic by the same standard.

For others, some themes in a fic can be disturbing, disagree with a person's strongly held beliefs. It should be case of attacking the idea but instead readers attack the author.

In my own experience, fanfics are an escape from reality, I don't appreciate Fics that remind me of the grim reality.

Like the fact that if you're handsome you can get anyway with anything.

Cue Draco redemption fics, cue young good Tom Riddle or Bellatrix Lestrange or good death eaters.

People always look for someone else to lay their problems on.

Cue manipulative Dumbledore.

Its concepts like that which get under my skin.

As a result, I have started saving fics to read offline. It prevents me from flaming.

** Authors are spending their time to write stories.

But readers are spending their time to read those stories. And they have a right to leave a feedback about the product they payed with their time for.

All sides are even in this game.

[Edit]: I'm not surprised for being downvoted. It just proves that this subreddit is all about self-centric authors who expect only praises regardless of their stories quality.

*** As an author and reader, I wouldn't say, ‘all sides are even in this game.' I can read 100k words in a few hours, but my story is 100k words and it has taken a few DAYS worth of work, and that's only talking about the time I actually spend writing and editing. I have spent over two years working on this piece. I've had my ups and downs, mental health issues, work issues, family issues, and yet I continue writing because I want to finish this story. I want my readers to have the story and the ending they deserve and I want to see this thing completed the way it deserves to be completed. So no, I don't think the time and effort here is equal on the part of the readers and the writers. The writers put a whole lot of effort into one chapter for you to spend maybe half an hour reading it.

I read HP fanfic and write for a very different fandom myself. It takes me months to write 50K words with research, rereading what I've written so far, consulting the crazy amount of notes and the outline I've made (and possibly alter that again), etc. But it takes me two weeks to read 1M words. If I read a 50K story, I'm done in a day or two and I move on, but that author spent much more time on it than I would need to read epic long fics (or greater). Writing simply takes /a lot/ more time to do. And at least I personally find that reading is less "active" than writing. It's not as tiresome for my mind.

Yes, readers invest their time, but nobody makes you read that particular story. Yes, authors choose to write, nobody makes them, but they also choose to be vulnerable and allow everyone access to their work. Yes, you're allowed an opinion, but your experience with the story is likely much more fleeting than the amount of time and effort the author spent on it. Both are needed for the fanfic community. Writers want people to read it and readers want people to write it. However the least a reader can do to encourage an author and possibly improve their writing is to give it a minute's pause and consider what they write under someone's story.

*** I agree. Leaving feedback, negative or positive, so long as it is constructive, should never be considered a bad thing. To say otherwise is tantamount to suggesting that you're not allowed an opinion.

I think OP, though, is more referring to making personal gibes or making light of an author's effort.

Comments like that. Sure, it's "feedback" and it's obviously indicative that you didn't like the story. No argument could made, however, that your feedback is constructive. It doesn't particularly /help/ the author and it's needlessly hurtful to someone who, presumably, worked very hard on a story.

Though, please do not assume that I think that's what /you/ were implying, either. I'm just trying to make the OP more clear.

It's worth noting, also, that not all stories are written equally. A lot of people literally create shitpost stories, of which they shouldn't expect anything more than shitpost feedback. But I don't think /anyone/ here is talking about those kinds of stories.

*** and i think most fanfiction is written for the author more than the reader (at least to a greater degree than normal books). partially because published fiction can expect readers, and fanfiction can't --- there aren't great ways to self-promote, and there is no way to be sure anyone will click on your story.

** Meh. This post is going to be unpopular I'm sure.

As a middling quality fanfic writer, I'd say I've received way more as a writer from the practice of writing and posting fanfiction than I gave. Without fanfiction, my thirty or so original fiction stories I've written and published in various venues have been read by, I don't know, maybe twenty thousand people? I've two novels that will never be published, destined for an eternity on the "We almost picked this up, but opted for the other story" soft-letdown list.

In contrast, my most popular fanfiction story (among least impressive things I've written) has a million hits. The feedback I've received from readers for my fanfiction has, in the aggregate, been far more valuable to honing my craft than any MFA-esque, circle-jerk, butchering/critiquing of my prose by wannabe litfic "let me share my childhood trauma in twenty easy installments" word-barfers.

I suspect I'm not alone in this.

** While I agree that people need to be respectful, this does go both ways. Readers are investing hours into reading, in some cases, monolith sized stories, only to see the author will "be back next week. I swear this time!!!1111!1!"

If fanfic authors run out of ideas, or just wants to stop writing, they need to just come out and say it. Instead of just vanishing into the ether - while also demanding none of their stories are up for adoption.

I read through an abandoned story a few years ago, where the author complained that they lost their hard-drive and their story backups nearly every three published chapters. Eventually, they just vanished, with the usual promise at the end of the last chapter that they were for sure back, and would be posting again by next week. (Like most unfinished stories, since this line is nearly the same across the 100k+ abandoned HP stories alone).

This is the 21st century. Cloud storage across just about every major tech company is free for ridiculous amounts of storage. Text files will practically guarantee said storage is nearly infinite.

I mean, good god. Plums(on FFnet), seems to have the inability to finish a single story(even though they're all massively popular), goes around complaining in review sections about people not finishing their stories.
