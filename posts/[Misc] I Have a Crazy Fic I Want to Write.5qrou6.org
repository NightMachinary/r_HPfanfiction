So I've recently started writing a story about Harry being plucked out of King's Cross Station by the Council of Dumbledores (Much like the Council of Reeds in Marvel Comics or the Council of Ricks from Rick and Morty).

I so far only have the introduction (about 2k words) down, but I want ideas for things that I could have happen in this story. It will probably read more like a collection of loosely connected one-shots, though I'm not sure yet.

The main antagonist is going to be a version of Harry that's killing alternate Harry's to absorb their powers and such, but in the process destabilizing the universes he is visiting, and ultimately leading to their destruction.

This is absolutely a crack!fic but I wanna have fun with it. I would love some input :)


** I would read this. If you want to write it as crack maybe consider adding a reference or the Ron=Dumbledore thing. Seems like something that would be a problem in that universe, Rons trying to enter the council.

*** Bahaha, I can see it in my head

No, listen, you have to let me in the council, I can help you!

Sorry, but like I keep telling you, there's no place in here for someone who's not an Albus Dumbledore.

That's what I'm trying to explain! I become Albus Dumbledore in the future, when I travel back to the past!

Young man, that's just beyond ridiculous.

Ridiculous? That Dumbledore over there is just a sloth with a beard!!

I don't see what point you're trying to make.

**** This is f***ing beautiful. I'll definitely have something like this crop up. I like the sloth too!

*** That would be good! So far they're just themed Dumbledores (and one Yoda), but I could easily implement that.

It could even be a rival faction. Or a splinter group of the Council. Or perhaps Different Harrys see Rons or Dumbledores. I like this.

*** I hadn't heard of that, but I looked it up and it seems like a killer movie. I'll have to watch it soon. Based on the summary I found, it's not that far off, really.

**** It is well worth the watch. I think it's a slight trope at this point but tropes aren't always bad. Take it have fun with it and if you need more Council inspiration check out the Captain Britain Corps my personal favourite ;).

*** Read it. Hate crack. Enjoyed this. Thoughts:

- Something about the writing before the WHOWHATWHEREHOW thing felt... flat for lack of a better word. Particularly the dialogue.

- Harry's high fuck density in one spot felt out of character, but this is crack, so meh?

- I liked Yodambledore, +but I wish you gave him more of the Yoda-syntax.+ EDIT: Blegh, thought AlbusFish's dialogue belonged to Yodambledore. My mistake, but the formatting of that bit contributed.

3-4/5.

**** Yeah I wasn't too interested in the part before he gets taken; I could go back and fix that up in a bit. This is also a rough draft of sorts.

The amount of fucks is certainly quite high, though I imagine Harry might swear in a similar situation. I'll spruce that part up too.

  Harry gets summoned by a trans-dimensional police force, known as the Council of Dumbledores. You thought one Dumbledore was hard to deal with; how about a thousand? No pairings.
