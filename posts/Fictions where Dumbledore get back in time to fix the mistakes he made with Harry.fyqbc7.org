I consider Dumbledore as a powerful wizard and a kind person. However, I think it is unquestionable that he made mistakes like leaving Harry with the Dursleys. In the time travel fictions I read Harry or Snape or Sirius did the time travel. Is there any complete fics where Dumbledore goes back in time to correct the mistakes he made? Thanks!


** There is that one where he is a great wizard his whole life, and a great person. He's a grandfather to Harry and the next 5 generations of Potters, and he defeats Dark wizards and doesn't meddle in peoples lives. Basically he's a really good guy.

Then he dies of old age and death gives him the option to go into another dimension and take the place of a 'meddling puppet master' dumbledore. (think the worst of Dumbledore bashing)

So he goes back in time in that one, and into another dimension as well.

I'll look through my fanfiction records to see if I can find what its called.

** Interesting, in all time-travel stories I have never read one where Dumbledore would travel.

** Why stop at fixing his mistakes with Harry? I want a Dumbledore who goes back even further, and deals with the Grindelwald war and Tom Riddle in one go.

** Well, the problem with this premise is that you get the problem of a benevolent, omnipotent god in miniature. If he retains his canon power, intelligence, and knowledge, then no physical, magical, or social difficulty can pose any sort of challenge toward fixing everything. If he's good, then he has no reason not to do it. You'd have to go geopolitical to make this interesting. And that is /hard/.
