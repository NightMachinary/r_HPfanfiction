Looking for a fanfic where harry travels back to the marauders era and there is a dueling tournament where the winner ends up versing Dumbledore and I can not find it for the life of me so if anyone knows what it is please let me know, I'm pretty sure that it is a Bellatrix/harry pairing but I'm not 100%sure

What did you mean by "versing"?

There's a Harry/Bella fic I that would fit except for the versing part. Harry didn't participate in the dueling iirc, he was preparing for an international dueling tournament instead.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** It might not be a Bella/harry fic but it's in that era, but the only part I remember is that there was a dueling tournament and Harry's first duel was against one of the Lestrange brothers(which he takes out quite easily), then the prize of winning the tournament is a duel against Dumbledore, then goes onto to describe an amazing duel.

It's not stepping back, I have read that and it's amazing but not The one
