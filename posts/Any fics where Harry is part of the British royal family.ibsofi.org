Not only is this hilarious, it also seems pretty in-character. (Do you think she'd also throw out the phrase "watery tart" or "moistened bint"?)

**** I think she's just too polite to call the Lady of the Lake that, and wouldn't blame her for delivering the sword, only the people's reactions to the sword.

  Objectively speaking, Hermione Granger knows Britain has a monarchy, just as she knows Prince Draco (the grandson of the King of England) is probably off somewhere living his royal life in total unrelation to hers. Seeing as she isn't delusional, she doesn't really expect to be his friend. She doesn't expect anything that comes after, either. Dramione, modern royalty AU. COMPLETE.

**** OK, I thought linkffn(Royal Ward by Catstaff) was bad, but this looks from description to be even worse. In “Royal Ward” Harry is not exactly Royal, just Sirius is dating Lady Di.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

  As Harry Potter arrives at Privet Drive a defeated man. Having just witnessed his Headmaster and Mentor die before his eyes, he is not prepared to be thrown into a whole other adventure: that of becoming HRH Prince Hadrian Windsor, second in line to the throne of Britain. But as he quickly finds out, looming upon the horizon, the threat of Voldemort's power continues to grow...
