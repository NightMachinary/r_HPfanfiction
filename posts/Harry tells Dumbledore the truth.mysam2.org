They kill the basilisk, but, because Harry has very little reason to connect the diary to current events, Ginny gets it back. With his basilisk dead and chamber no longer a secret, Tom Riddle makes sure Ginny's body lies somewhere else.

Edit to clear up confusion: Dumbledore and Harry meet about a month before he loses the diary in the book. So Harry and Dumbledore work out the Chamber/basilisk before Ginny steals the diary and even enters the chamber. Dumbledore keeps an eye out, but TMR lays low while Ginny continues to write in the diary.


** I mean... it sounds.... interesting?

But good lord, that version of Harry has to be a grade-A idiot to not see a connection. He literally wrote in the damn thing.

*** I meant in that he doesn't connect the diary to being largely responsible for opening the Chamber, which he canonically doesn't, so he doesn't mention it.

**** he did connect the diary was connected to Riddle and the reason he was still 'alive' and was able to use Ginny, which is why he destroyed it in canon.

***** No, Riddle explained that Ginny writing in the diary caused the Chamber to reopen, but that's beside the point. Harry has no inkling that the diary is responsible /before/ Ginny steals it back. When Harry loses the diary, his greatest concern is rehashing Hagrid's expulsion.

I assumed that meant it was taking place in the chamber of secrets after Harry saved Ginny from Riddle.

If it takes place before Ginny steals the diary back, how the hell did the basilisk get killed?

That's up to the writer, but...

Dumbledore canonically sees just about everything Harry sees, but has a better understanding, so, as I'm a characterization pushes the plot person, he should know the creature is a basilisk, about Myrtle, and have an idea as to where the CoS is.

With that in mind, he can simply have Harry speak to Myrtle while he's eavesdropping in a corner. Harry looks around the bathroom then off they go down the faucet.

** How does this work? How does he walk away with Ginny without destroying the diary? Remember riddle was becoming corporal. You saying Harry just grabs Ginny and tells Tom Riddle, who he knows is Voldemort, "peace out" and leaves?.

*** I assume this scenario takes place after Harry hears the murder-y voice and in Dumbledore's office he actually answers truthfully when the headmaster asks if he has anything to tell him. Like, maybe around Halloween, not the end of the year.

*** I edited the prompt to clear up confusion, but I'm saying Ginny steals the diary back after the basilisk is taken care of and continues to write in it like in canon. Because TMR knows Dumbledore is watching the CoS, Ginny dies somewhere else. Quietly in her dorm room, her bedroom, or even the Gaunt Shack.
