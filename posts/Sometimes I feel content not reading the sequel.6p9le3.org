I just finished reading linkffn(1557810) and I was quite happy with the story. I got to the end which was a bit weird I think but pleasing in its own way, and I assumed there would be a sequel (or multiple), which there was.

Then I realized I would much rather not read the sequels, because I was content with how it ended, and I just felt like the story had a great stopping point, even if there are definitely things left unresolved.

Have any of you ever felt this way with a story? I've never really felt this way: typically if I choose not to read a sequel, it's because I either disliked the original story, or got bored of it; neither is the case in this situation.


** Yes. There's this really great series that I've read by some British chick. I Absolutely loved it and I was fairly content with the ending and felt it was a good stopping point. However, she put out a sequel called "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" and I realised that I would much rather not read it once I saw reviews about how many terrible time travel tropes she stuffed in it. It absolutely was not because I disliked or got bored of the original series.

Of course I ended up reading it anyway.

It's cute that you think she wrote this.

**** Hey I purposely used those words to avoid saying she wrote it herself. But she approved and gave permission for the brand name to be used and it's now considered "the official eighth Harry Potter story" according to wikipedia.

** As a Jew, I feel this way about the new testament.

Just kidding though. I did feel this way about Backward with Purpose by Deadwoodpecker.

** Fanfic authors generally don't know how to create sequels. Usually, they don't understand the Segway, it doesn't feel like we just got done reading something and we're in a new story, it just feels like a continuation and leaving off in a different book.

*** Interesting, I generally have the opposite view as you.

I love it when sequels pick right off from the previous book. I don't like it when the sequel starts weeks/months later. That might just be a pet peeve of mine. The feeling of continuity is pretty important for me.

Relatedly, one thing I /really/ liked about this story is that I think every single chapter was an exact continuation of the previous chapter. That is personally so satisfying, because I often feel like authors use a chapter break as a lazy-person's way out of explaining some transition.

**** I often feel the same way and I think it might be because I don't actually want a sequel, I just want a continuation of the story. If i had my way, novels would probably be longer than they are now but that would make it pretty inconvenient to carry around. This is less of a problem when you're reading online of course.

There are few fanfics that I can think of which does the transition well. "Pureblood Pretense" is probably one of the best at providing this feeling of being part of the new story in a fresh environment

***** Hmm perhaps this gives us a way to reconcile my opinion with that of [[/u/DragonSinOWrath]]. I think you're right--the feeling I usually have is not one of "I want to read the sequel," but one of "I want this story to continue."

So I suppose if it were truly a /sequel/ and not just a continuation, it would be proper to give at least a small shift in--anything. Whether it's voice, time, POV, or whatever.

** Yep. I read a story that had a definitive beginning, middle, and end with an actually very original plot. The author put out a sequel, and while I was hesitant to read it, I did anyway. The sequel had a definitive beginning, middle, and end, much like the first, but with a weaker plot. To me, it didn't make any sense for this author to write a sequel, as the first ended happily and all plot points were tied down and finished. The sequel was unnecessary.

  This story is set between the 6th and 7th years of Harry's time at Hogwarts. The war is at full strength now and, hoping to turn the tide against Voldemort, Dumbledore has concocted a plan. OotP spoilers and some romance. Now completed!
