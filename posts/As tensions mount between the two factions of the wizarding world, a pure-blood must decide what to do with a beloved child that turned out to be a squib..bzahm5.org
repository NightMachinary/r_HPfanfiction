Depending on how much you love the brat, you can now:

-kill him and vanish the body

-keep him hidden in your property

-send him to the muggle world after an obliviation

-send him to the muggle world without an obliviation

******* I'm all heart.

That does make me wonder whether one might be able to make a heart monster if one collected enough muggle's hearts and fused them into a single being. That could be a fun side project.

Edit: Also if the brain transfer works we get to keep the child with the family without having to worry about hiding it.

********* And the muggle brain can go into a trolls' body, and then the troll brain can go into a hippogryphs' body, and then the hippogryph brain can go into a squib body, but now we've come full circle, and there's no more brains, and no more bodies.

This thread sounds like the basis of a very macabre childrens' song.

** This is what Swiss boarding schools were meant for; ship them off, avoid any shame, give them a first-rate education, and use your confundus powers to ensure that they get high up in the muggle world. Easy (this is what rich people with less than intelligent kids do, minus the confundus powers).
