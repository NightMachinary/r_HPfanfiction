  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

** Linkffn(3252882)

A Matter of Force is pure crack, starring a Self-Insert where the author, Harry's twin sister, indulges in his rockstar fantasies. So naturally, when Wyld Stallyn needs to, you know, know how to actually play their instruments to win Battle of the Bands, Rufus uses his time machine to spirit them to the SI for lessons. What does this have to do with Lily and James? Wyld Stallyns has a time machine and they owe Harry a favor.

I love how Lily and James are portrayed. They may be secondary characters, but they're actual characters--and more importantly, parents. It's weird, but to me, Lily and James seem in character, despite how little we actually know about them in the original books.

The time travel also adheres to J.K. Rowling's original (pre-/Cursed Child/) closed-loop rules. For example (& I can't say how much I love this callback to the movie), like Rufus's name. In /Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure/, Rufus never introduced himself. Instead "present" Bill & Ted learned it from "future" Bill & Ted, who then, after completing their adventure, travel back in time to hand off the time machine to "past" Bill & Ted, and introduce Rufus as "Rufus". This, amazingly, is worked into the fanfic.

Also, if you're a fan of /The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/, there's a running gag involving the usefulness of towels--and, with a hand-me-down wand, it's something Ron uses at every opportunity. He eventually grows into his own and gets over his jealousy of Harry's fame--namely by (if you'll recall Rowling's throwaway plot device of the summer trip to Egypt) becoming Indiana Jones. It escalates until Ron eventually saves the world--with towels! (Don't worry, he's still essentially Ron, just given a bigger stage.)

It also has the most original solution to Harry's horcrux. It's foreshadowed in their first night (?) at Hogwarts and, while as convoluted as Dumbledore's plan, instead of the Elder Wand, it involves Tenacious D and Wyld Stallyns. Naturally.

  Start with Harry Potter, change something, and Harry learns to rock. Irreverent, chaotic, and the more movies you've seen, the funnier you're likely to find it. Expect many cammeos.

** Does it have to be both of them? Because [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/][The Rune Stone Path]] kinda does that, but only with Lily. She comes back pretty late in the story, but has an important role thereafter.
