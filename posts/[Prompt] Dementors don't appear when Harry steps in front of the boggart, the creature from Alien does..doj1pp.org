Honestly I'm look for something that no one excepts, so like something from a horror movie, and instead of rational thought kids just go it to fight/flight/freeze mode.

**** Then you probably wouldn't like linkffn(That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots). I gotta check out annals of Arithmancy now.

edit: Harry's reaction does actually apply to what your looking for though.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
