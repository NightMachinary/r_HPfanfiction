fairly new at the whole harry/fleur thing and i'm trying to get into it, any recommendations besides When a veela cries(a great story that really got me into the pairing), the lie i've lived(the fic was ruined for me before i started reading) and Wastelands of time(Never a fan of timetravel fics). particularly romance heavy stories that are well written....if such a thing exist.


** So glad to find another H/F shipper lol. When a veela cries is def my fave one so far. I suggest Agents of Attor, tho it is a Harry/Fleur/Daphne. However, it is well written, imo.

If you want a really long H/F, tho it is abandoned, and the author does bash quite a bit, try His Angel. It is filled with angst and fluff, but it does center around H/F.

#+begin_quote
  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

**** Nope. It's quite cliche, but people look past that because it has frequent updates? Once it's finished, it should just fade away.

****** I'd agree. It does a lot of things okay, and even okay FF is good if its a particular pairing or genre that you enjoy. Most of its hype comes from the rapid updates though.

******** Yeah thats the point. However once the fic is completely that won't matter anymore and people will stop talking about it. Except for the ones who like that particular pairing or genre.

** Oh goodie! One of the things I can actually talk about

linkffn(11446957). A Cadmean Victory is a really good read. Harry and Fleur are given time to develop and still feel like they're in the beginning of a relationship and not instantly soul-mates. It's still getting updated as well!

linkffn(7402590). Deprived is one of the best and a personal favorite. It's heartbreaking that it stopped receiving updates, but is a damn good read.

linkffn(5199602). The Theif of Hogwarts. Just a fun read that dabbles in Harry/Fleur.

There are some other pretty good ones, but I'd have to recommend those. Letters is a pretty good one as well.

I can't recommend The Lie I've Lived. I've never been able to get through more than a chapter or two.

There's also tons of one-shots and smutfics if thats more your style. They're pretttttty good as well.

*** While I don't exactly think the lie I've lived is deserving of all the praise it gets, the first 2/3 chapters are absolutely awful. If you power through them, the writing style starts to get a little better

***** It really doesn't get better. If anything, it gets worse the father you get in, once the hat starts to become lackluster and you're actually able to focus on the content rather than get distracted by it.

****** Maybe, but I find the main reason people can't get into it at first is due to the obnoxious and immature writing style, such as one line paragraphs, excessive use of "i" when starting setences, and liberal use of exclamation marks, and these all (mostly) disappear after the first couple chapters
