I am looking for a fic I read a while ago which was an alternate universe, and had a slytherin Hermione, who was sort of like a pureblood princess

Thanks in advance

Edit: when I say alternate universe I mean a character has travelled to that universe from another

Harry knows regular Hermione but is shocked cause this one is slytherin and acting pureblood

**** The way I look at it, I don't enjoy a fic for its conclusion, I enjoy it for the experience of reading it. So, if a fic is worth reading, it's worth reading even if it's not complete; but if a fic is not worth reading, it doesn't matter whether it's complete, since I'll stop reading it before I get there.

***** I joke mostly. This is just one of the fics that I desperately wish would keep going.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** The Anti heroine on ao3 by cherise Carroll has a slytherin hermione and Harry. 3rd person POV, can be dark in some spots and has pairings of TMR/HP/HG. Very good story in my opinion and worth a read
