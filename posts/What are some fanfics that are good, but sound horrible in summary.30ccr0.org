I think the biggest example is Harry Potter and the Something Something which is literally canon-HP in a world of fanfic cliches that somehow work out.

A few others in mind are Prince of the Dark Kingdom (the closest thing to a believable Voldemort/Harry relationship, romantic or otherwise), and Harry Mewter/ Harry Potter and the Master's Ball (HP/Pokemon crossovers, imo both universes are very tricky to make crossovers for).


** I think, ironically, suggesting Prince of the Dark Kingdom is about a Voldemort/Harry relationship is a pretty bad summary of that fanfic.

It's a Voldemort-won fanfic if anything.

*** I guess so. The reason I said it that way is that they have a very deep mentor-relationship that might as well be having sex to the fangirls.

**** Not at all, Voldemort becomes after a while something of a mentor to Harry, but the world works on a principle where Voldemort and Dumbledore were both more morally gray, so its not exactly an 'evil wins' AU.

I'd strongly recommend it, its one of my fave AU re-imaginings and really well written. And there's no suggestion of slash between Harry and Voldemort, at least I never picked that up. Voldemort's just a bit of a control freak dictator, but it doesnt have a romantic element.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]] is probably the high water mark for the thread: a very nice HP/Deadliest Catch crossover.

Blu Taiger pulls off the idea of a HP/Calvin and Hobbes crossover in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] far better than expected.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] has Harry and Molly Weasley in a soul bond. It works, somehow.

** the Firebird trilogy.

"oh, it's Harry with a harem. Just your typical male fantasy sex story then?"

Nope, it is actually a ridiculously detailed AU with a complete plot and surprisingly good writing for the premise.

**** stated pedophile but all of it was "off-screen" also has MC recounting getting gang-raped allegorically(non graphic) at age of 5/6? also MC is serial-killer; and involved in dark/black magic. Quite interesting story if you can stomach grim/dark on the level that Pact by wildbow is.

despite what it sounds like their is so far only 1 sex scene and its consequential villina with MC and Victor Krum
