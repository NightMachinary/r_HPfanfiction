Essentially a reversal of the Half-Blood Prince scene to show why the original scene is bad writing. Better if it ends with a sob.


** Harry climbed into the common room. Ron and Hermione were having a blazing Row.

"I can't believe you would cavort with the enemy," yelled Ron.

He stormed past her to the staircase, paused, and turned around.

"AVIS! OPPUGNO!" Ron bellowed. The birds shot towards Hermione like golden bullets, pecking and scratching at every available bit of flesh.

"Ow! Stop, please!" Hermione yelled. She screamed in pain as Ron shot a look of vindictive fury and shot up the stairs. Harry thought he could hear a sob.

*** When you read this paragraph and go "Go Ron! GO!" is when you realize that fanfiction has forever broken you and you can't find faults with anything where Ron is treated as a good guy by the narration

It's so rare I'm often tempted to say "My Precious" whenever I see it

**** He's villified for some odd reason. I mean the 7th book he's wearing something of a similar to the thing that possessed his sister. Book 4 he was a dick though.

** Serious Version ( Also Not Quite Birds)

Harry Potter was not having a fun time.His two tablemates were also not having a fun time; Parvati was alternating between half hearted toe-tapping and a pleading look to any remotely attractive boy who walked past,her sister had gotten up,muttered something about her housemates ties being crooked and had not returned from the clump of Ravenclaws on the other side of the room . Ron was glaring with genuine anger at the dance floor where Hermione and Krum were entering their third slow dance of the evening.

As the couple swayed to the music,Hermione caught a look at Harry and Ron's postions and had given a smirk. Without warning,Ron had sprung to his feet and taken his wand out of his robes and pointed it at the couple " Volatis Luttum " he cried.

Hermione shrieked and Krum cried out as they both fell over,clutching their noses. Harry,Dean,Parvati and what seemed like every Dumrstang students ran over to the scene. Krum was hoisted to his feet by his schoolmates ( who had completely ignored Hermione's existence ) and Harry saw the effects of Ron's spell. Thick globs of snot were seemingly pouring out of the Seeker's nose before sprouting wings and taking flight.

Harry glanced down and saw the same thing was happening was happening to Hermione (who was crying). Ron was streaming towards the exit of the Great Hall. "WHERE DID YA THINK GINNY LEARNED THE BAT BOOGEY HEX ! SERVES YOU BOTH BLOODY RIGHT ! "

*** I think that ended up funnier than the first one. Starring a Ron who sounds like Dumbledore in the movies when he asks Harry whether he put this name in the goblet of fire. Which gives credence to the whole Dumbledore is a time traveling Ron.

** "Why the FUCK did you do that Ron !" screamed one Hermione Jean Granger as she batted at the robins that were attacking her (for once) styled hair.

"I didn't do it on purpose " huffed one Ronald Billius Weasley

"Yeah,you did" screamed Hermione

" I don't even have my wand,Padma can search me" Ron's date began to awkwardly pat him down before declaring he was clean.

"So,accidental,wandless and non-verbal magic" laughed Harry nervously." Hermione would be proud of herself if it was her in Ron's position " he looked around for support and found only a nervous grin from Parvati and a frankly confused look from Viktor Krum.

*** That was pretty funny. I'm surprised you didn't have him lighting Krum on fire too (not that Krum deserves it, he's actually pretty nice in canon) or yelling "Language".

Could you also do a serious one as well? Where Ron purposely attacks Hermione. I'd like to make a point from the previous thread about assault, and you write well.
