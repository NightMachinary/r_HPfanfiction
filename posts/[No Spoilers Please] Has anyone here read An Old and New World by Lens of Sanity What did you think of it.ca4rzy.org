I started reading it based off of the recommendation of the guy that posted the list of Harry/Fleur stories the other day. I'm on the eleventh chapter, though, and it seems pretty shit. He said it gets better as you read, but he also says A Cadmean Victory's a great story so I don't really trust his judgement. I wanted to know if other people think it's worth pushing through.


** It's definitely rough around the edges, but it's my favorite type of guilty pleasure (cracky over-the-top adventure with IDGAF-Harry) so I enjoyed it immensely. Not once I've felt bored when reading it, because there's all sorts of fantastic shit happening all the time.

I've only read the old version and not the rewrite.

** This is one of my favourites, and also one of the few fics in which the sheer insanity of the story was enough to outweigh my pet leave of poor (at times) punctuation and grammar. Never read a Cadmean Victory, so I have no say on that, but if you dislike it eleven chapters in, just drop it.

For god's sake, it's fanfiction; there's no need to force yourself to read stuff you don't like or stuff that doesn't suit your tastes.

That said, you might want to try Dark Lord's Equal for a similar but shorter experience of the same flavour.

** It's an old fic. I've personally reread some that I thought were great a decade ago, and now I just can't stomach.. Don't shit on the guy, once he reads more he will get utterly tired of certain things and come to hate what he once loved.

** It's a bit rough around the edges but I absolutely love it. It's super cracky and complete nonsense a lot of the time but it owns it, revelling in the ridiculousness.

** From what I can tell, it was one of Lens of Sanity's first fics, so yeah, the first lot of it is fucking rough. Ultimately one of my favourites though. I'd recommend reading Dark Lord's Equal to see what his writing in AONW is like later on.

** I started it, but I couldn't get past chapter 10ish I think? The idea seemed ok, but I couldn't stand Harry.

** I read upto chapter 11 and then .. no thanks I'm out. Harry was a little shit in that one.
