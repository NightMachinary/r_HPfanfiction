I know people like to think of Dumbledore as Manipulative, but taking the non-manipulative approach here, there's some kind of spell to direct the mail elsewhere. Maybe somewhere at the Ministry? I like to imagine hundreds of thousands of mail, going straight to the Ministry, and them having huge rooms filled to the brim of just fan mail, that Harry had received over the years.

Are there any stories that take a non-manipulative approach and just have fun with the idea, of Harry being overwhelmed by the fan mail? Maybe Ginny is horrified to realize that Harry will read some of her old letters. Ron laughs until he realizes that he had also sent Harry fan letters when he had been younger.


** I wouldn't be surprised if Ministry put some extra spell on Dursley residence to divert any mails from outsiders except Hogwart letters until he turns 11.

** I always imagined that Harry's whereabouts were a secret to most of the Wizarding World for extra-protection. That only helped to elevate even more his celebrity status since not only was a mystery how he vanquished the Dark Lord that night, but he also seemed to have vanished off of the face of the earth. There were occasional sightings of him in South England and when people talked about seeing him, they were taken as seriously as those that claim they saw Elvis or Tupac or Michael Jackson after their deaths.

** There are a couple fics where fan mail is handled. One that comes to mind Dumbledore had it stored in a room in the castle untouched. Harry and Hermione hire people to sort through it and respond. Another one that was similar but Harry responds to them personally and gets thanked by classmates for being nice to their younger siblings who sent mail. Oh, and one where Harry finds out about the mail block from Dumbledore and has it removed so he just starts getting mail. All of these were side plots though. Haven't found a fic focused on it.

Wish I could tell you the name of those but I can't remember which of the 200+ fics on my read list they were. Sorry. :(

** Somewhere, a clan of House Elves is wearing tunics stitched together from letters to Harry Potter...

** I've read a few in which Harry deals with backlogged mail, but the only story I can name offhand is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Irish Choice), in which Harry finds out shortly after arriving at Hogwarts that Dumbledore has had all his mail stored in an abandoned classroom, and finds letters from other schools among the mail.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.
