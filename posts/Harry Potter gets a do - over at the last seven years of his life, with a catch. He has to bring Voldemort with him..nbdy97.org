:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't seem to find it. Basically, Harry gets tricked into a fake trial moths after he defeated Voldemort because Dumbledore sent the ministry a letter about how voldemort can still come back as long as harry is alive because Harry's soul and Voldemort's horcrux mixed and fused together.

He gets thrown through the veil and finds out that he's the master of Death.

Harry takes Voldemort's horcruxes and has death fix it, where both Harry and Tom are sent back to Harry's first year. Harry becomes a slytherin and starts a study group to bring back old wizarding traditions.

There's more to the fic, but I lost it before I could finish reading it. It's on ao3 and a Harry Potter/ Tom Riddle slash fic.

  Harry is betrayed. Harry gets a second chance to do it all over again.There is just one catch. If Harry gets to keep his memories from his previous life, so does Voldemort.
