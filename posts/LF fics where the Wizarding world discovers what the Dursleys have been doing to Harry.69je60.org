I recently read a gender bender fic where Harry tells the Quibbler his life story. What are some more that have everyone discovering their abuse, and hopefully getting justice?


** Not entirely what you are looking for but still a fun (and quick read).

Basically Dumbledore vs Inland Revenue in a battle of memory charms and computer backups.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
