So I usually read ⚯͛ fanfiction on ff.net and ao3 for everything else cause it's so bloody hard to navigate the ⚯͛ fanfic section on ao3. So I'm hoping for recommendation for (in your opinion) the best fics on ao3. Has to be over 100k wording, preferably finished but if not it has to be updated regularly. I can deal with most pairings other than Severus/Harry, Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron, Hermione/Severus. Don't mind slash as long as it's not too graphic. My guilty pleasures are good Dursley's, manipulative dumbledore, Lord Potter/Black etc (without the harem part), Hermione and/or Harry time travel to marauder era, a Hermione being part of the Black family (either do to time travel or something else) non canon pairings, soulbonds or other bonds Weasley bashing (not the twins). To give you a reference; I love KeiraMarcos stories, ShayaLonnnie, maisey2k10

I'm not asking for a good story cause I know what at least one comment will say to my guilty pleasures in combination with the word “good”. I'm asking for your favorites, the ones you think are best :)

Thank you!


** I find it just the opposite, I can search AO3 easily and choose to rely on rec's for ffn.

Play with the search function, go to a fandom you like [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]] and start with the simple search on the right side. You can exclude many things. And start with sort by kudos, you'll get the stories that people have liked. Once you find a fic you like, check the authors page and see what the author has favorited.

I'm at work now, I'll see what I have bookmarked and post my favorites

*** The frustrating thing about AO3 search is there is no differentiation between a tagged character or pairing that is the focus of the fic vs. one that shows up in the background for a few scenes. This becomes a huge problem when searching for less popular characters who are commonly tagged in other fics.

A search for Fred Weasley centric stories will bring up all kinds of fics that have him tagged as a side character. At the same time I can't exactly exclude characters like Harry and Ginny from the search since they likely will be tagged in Fred centric fics as well.

The problem is just as bad for major characters like Ron or Luna who are usually present in many fics but are not the main character/focus of the fic themselves. AO3 is great for finding specific tropes though.

**** This! This is my problem with ao3... ff.net only has the option of tagging 4 people (I would love to exclude more than 2 though) but on ao3 they tag everyone, from the mailman to the person who delivered your baby. And the story tags are ridiculous too. ‘I'm tagging this as the best story I've written' ‘and every thing that they don't need to tag.

*** I know how to search ao3, done it for years. :) my problem with ⚯͛ is that it's chaotic and tagged with every unnecessary thing. Better to just ask people for favorites instead of wading through the headache that is ⚯͛ fics on ao3 :) other people have favorites that I wouldn't necessarily have stumbled over before :)

**** Oh, sorry, thanks for the clarification. Over tagging is a real problem on AO3. I love Keira also and haven't found anyone who writes those long epic stories like she does. Lady Ra has some good stuff, but her longer ones are SG-1 and multi-fandom type stories.

I have a couple HP stories on my kindle I really like and re-read periodically, I've not used the bot function before, so hope it works.

  Summary: 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?Pairings: HP/DM, HP/OMC, Severus/OMC, Remus/OMC/OFC, Remus/Sirius and others as the story progressesWarnings: Under 18 - Harry is still at school. AU, mentions of child abuse, Slash, Violence, Sexual Situations, powerful Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, there are chapters with vampire blood play, het, threesome, and third person remembering of non-con and murder of children. I will give warnings before those chapters so it can be skipped over if you want. Despite these warnings it really isn't a dark story, if you have questions feel free to contact me.

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.

** *The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles*

linkao3(14695419)

Miss Harriet Potter (and Lady Black after Sirius's death) finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the fate of war and magical Britain.

One of my favorite stories. I enjoyed reading about Voldemort who is at the same time possessive, narcissistic bastard and someone who has valid reasons to try his hand at conquering wizarding world. Dumbledore is manipulative, full of "for the greater good" attitude, but also believable as a character. I especially enjoyed few chapters detailing Snape's pov and his attempts to understand on-going changes to conflict (another well-written character).

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]]). The first book covers all 7 years of school, and the sequel is regularly updated. Features a really interesting Harry and Snape dynamic (not slash) and a cunning Draco. No pairing yet.

***** When? He's the same horrible POS he is in the books through book two. Draco is also worse. What could they possibly do to make up for their behavior? Can you share that, or are you just one of those do you think their actions are excused and that's why you like it?

I can't even like Harry that much since he excuses all the abuse Snape gives him just because Snape is good at potions. I'm up to chapter 22 at this point (I read fast), and I hate pretty much everyone in this story.

** Your best bet might be to search in bookmarks, rather than works - you can even specify only bookmarks with comments. Some comments are minimal and unhelpful, but some tell you exactly what you need to know.

Or check out the bookmarks of authors you enjoy. Oh, and if you like Keira, check out the collections from the challenges she runs: [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/RoughTradeNaNo13][Rough Trade]] and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/thequantumbang/profile][Quantum Bang]]. Both are multi-fandom, but have plenty of HP content.

Speaking of collections, people have also created rec collections if you want to look for those. Like [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/SweetSadisticSynsHarryPotterCollection]]. Those are usually bookmark collections though, so they aren't indicated on the actual story, you can't find them that way.
