*** Yup. Even without physical abuse (though I think there's enough subtext to show there was), he really should have become one. That is majorly emotional abuse and neglect.

**** I think the only reason for him not becoming a Obscurus is because Harry didn't know he had magic (Inworld; the real reason is that JKR hadn't invented them at that time).

For becoming an Obscurus he would have to surpress his magic - but he didn't even know it was magic - because the Dursleys hate magic so much they didn't tell him about it. In the end that probably saved him from that suffering.

***** I think having to suppress his 'freakishness' which he knew was different is enough. Magic is just a word. He still had power the Dursleys were making him ashamed of and wanted him to repress. It's that forced repression that makes an Obscurus, not the word 'magic'. :)

****** Harry never tried to suppress any "magic", or "freakishness" because, as far as he was concerned, it wasn't his fault. Strange thing happened around him, but he never thought he was the cause of these events, so he didn't have anything to supress.

****** But he doesn't repress it. Not totally. His magic saves him at a few points, where Vernon and Petunia get upset, yes, but he doesn't fully repress it. It just..... A good way to put it is that it's kinda like a protective entity

***** Others have already responded but it seems Harry doesn't ever acknowledge the reason for Dursleys hating him. Even after ten years he tells them about flying motorcycles. And he seems quite rebellious, being snarky, getting into fights with Dudley in front of Vernon and Petunia, and openly defies them when they try to prevent him from reading the admission letter. Also it's heavily hinted he goes behind their back and does a lot of shit while the Dursleys are away.

**** Any time something bad ought to happen to Harry and doesn't, we can always blame the sacrificial blood protection.

***** /laugh/ True enough, though I do admit I find that a little lazy, but at least it's an in-story explanation of sorts.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
