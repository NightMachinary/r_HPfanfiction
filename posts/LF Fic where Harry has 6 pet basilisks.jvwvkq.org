:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember it's on ao3 and starts shortly before Harry leaves after his second year. Harry explores the CoS before he has to go home and finds 6 eggs containing basilisks. Obviously he decides to take them and hatch them.

The fic also doesn't have any pairings iirc


** This isn't exactly what you asked for, but it also involves multiple basilisks: linkffn(11572455)

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
