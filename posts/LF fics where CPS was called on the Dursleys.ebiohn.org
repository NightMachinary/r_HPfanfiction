The neighbors/teachers/parents of Harry and Dudley's classmates call child protective services and Harry gets moved out. How long would it take for Dudley to mention in class that his freak cousin lives in the cupboard under the stairs? Neighbors regularly hearing Vernon or Petunia shouting about a freak and not asking questions. The difference in clothes, only Harry doing chores, that aren't always age appropriate. Marge's dog. No one magically sweeps it under the rug. I'd prefer if it wasn't at the "Vernon beat him with a belt every evening and broke all his bones" levels of awful, more Canon levels of bad.

I realize this isnt a discussion thread, but this has always bothered me. How was Harry living under the stairs not discovered at some point prior to Hogwarts? Like, I realize magicals could come in and memory charm folks, but even so... it seems like at some point SOMEONE would have heard something, thought it was strange, and done some further investigations, even if unofficial.

*** We're talking about the 1980s. Child Protection in that time was ... spotty at best.

The important thing to remember is that what the Dursleys do in the books is /not criminal/. At that point in time, the laws on child neglect and cruelty were most recently updated in the 1930s, and the laws on corporal punishment of children dated from the 19th century. So: no police, nothing you could bring before a criminal court.

There are civil proceedings for child protection, and you /might/ get some traction there. However, that presumes you can find a social worker who can deal with Harry at the hind end of a case-load of children turning up in A&E with broken bones and cigarette burns and similar. Said social worker is trying to do his or her job in a local government department that has been on the hind teat for funding since the year dot. Child abuse is, the prevailing political opinion goes, a problem of the underclass, not the kind of household where the main breadwinner is a company director who is also a member of a public school Old Boys' Club. Even if you get a social worker with the kind of class consciousness to get past /that/ they've got to get it through the Surrey County Council's legal department (they'll be the ones getting the court orders) and then the Family Division of the High Court.

All of the effort that goes into getting Harry's case over those hurdles? It's being taken away from protecting kids whose lives aren't so much Cinderella (like Harry) as they are straight-up horror movies.

It would take several high-profile child deaths and two changes of government to get poor Harry's plight within the art of the possible for child protection law.

***** Sources is a little tricky, since textbooks for the law and procedure as they stood at that date are now all out of print: much of what I know of the law is based on my memories of conversations with a family friend who practised childcare law and was on the guardian ad litem list for cases in the Lancashire County Council area in the mid-late 80s (he got me my first job as a legal clerk on the criminal side of his practise, as it happens). What I know of the social work side is from talking with old sweat social workers who'd been in the pre-Climbie system and the changes the ensuing public inquiries made.

As for orphans in the 80s, the system /then/ had been in place since the late 60s, when they started moving away from the use of institutions like orphanages. An orphan, if not taken in immediately by family, would be placed with family by local government (usually the county council) as a first resort, occasionally after a short stay with whoever's next on that authority's roster of emergency fosterers. If there are no family available or willing, then they find a foster home for long-term care either off their own roster or through one of the charitable organisations that run fostering agencies. Barnardo's was the big one back then. Ideally the orphan stays with that family until they're an adult, and if freed for adoption that's an option for the kid and his new family, subject to court oversight.

It seems to work OK: there was a guy in my class at high school who was part of a family that consisted entirely of fostered kids (to everyone's confusion when we found out because he and his as-it-turned-out foster sister actually looked related despite having nothing genetic to do with each other...) and when last I heard from him he was doing all right for himself. This was in the early 80s, so the fostering would have been done early-mid 70s as nobody that went to primary school with him knew about it until he mentioned it one day.

There /are/ still residential care homes for children, but they're for kids who can't be placed with foster homes for whatever reason, usually because of 'challenging behaviour issues' as it's euphemistically termed, and a number of /those/ are put in care by their own parents because they can't cope with said challenging behaviour.

****** Its been a while since I read it but I have severe problems with the fic itself, so here are a few.

1) All problems are solved by the ‘common sense' muggles leading to conflict that feels very forced or very pointless. Harry's adoptive parents are never wrong about anything, and as such the situations involving them never have any weight to them. Especially things like them just solving Neville's parents conditions being ‘silly wizards, not recognising Alzheimers'.

2) the premise of the story, Harry being a cat animagus, has very little plot relevance after using it as the setup to get Harry moving in with the Grangers. There are long periods of the story where Harry doesnt transform at all, as if the premise, an interesting one, was merely an excuse to have a difference premise (harry being raised by the grangers) which is comparatively much more common and boring

3) Harry isnt special enough. Ties into the above in that what makes Harry unique is almost never used by him, but ultimately Harry is basically the same person as Hermione, with only a few small differences between the two of them. Most of the dialogue involving either of them can be substituted for the other seamlessly.

4) In relation to above, the 4 Grangers all have the same voice on the page. When so much dialogue occurs between these characters, but the tone of the text, word choice, sentence structure ext is the same with each of them, the conversations feel like word buffing.

5) In addition to Harry not feeling special, none of the other major players feel as powerful. Dumbledore and Voldemort go from their own individual level to the point where both are getting help from their equals. The mexican helping Voldemort insulting ‘european' arithmancy is one such example that grinds my gears, as it lowers Voldemort from the status he should be as ‘big bad' to ‘arrogant European doing magic recklessly and wrong'. Whats more, ignoring what arithmancy is in canon and giving it the properties white squirrel does in this fic, arithmancy would be more akin to maths or physics than superstition, and nobody would say the law of gravity is different between europeans and latin americans.

6) Harry and Hermione becoming black belts is only used to make wizards and witches impressed with martial arts, and serves otherwise no purpose.

Overall, the story is readable, certainly competently written, but there are many problems with it that mean I've read it twice and given up around when the Australian is teaching wandless magic just out of boredom and frustration.

Not to mention Dumbledore himself saying that he knew what he was condemming Harry to in either OOTP, or HBP(can't remember which) just further proves that he could have done something(not did, but could, and maybe possibly did) to mess with the perception, or minds of the muggles there.

Personally I always like the theory that it was a mix of Dumbledore doing some things to keep Harry "safe," and the Horcrux also messing with how people perceive Harry. I mean it's not too much of a stretch to say that scar!Voldemort had some way to manipulate at the least how people view him as a Horcrux similar to the locket, and diary.
