** Lily and James were what 20? 21? When they died so they must have had Harry pretty young which most likely means he was an accident and even the best contraceptive fails sometimes so you can't really fault them there. Your argument of it being a bit selfish to bring a baby into the world during a war isn't exactly wrong but you've got to consider that Voldemort's war had been going on for eleven years when Lily and James died. As far as anyone knew the war would go on for a long time so life should carry on regardless.

** If you want to argue that way, the only children who come to Hogwarts between ~1980 and 1992 would be Muggleborns since no one should bring a child into a war (or only the death eaters since they were winning before Halloween 81). Likewise, no one would have had children between 1914 and 1918 as well as 1939(7 in China&Japan) and 1945.

And from a strictly objective view point everyone should have as many babies as possible to maximise the manpower available to your side in the future. There was a reason why the Nazis actively pushed for women to have many children and even created an award for "successful" mothers. And as the examples of France (after WWI) and Russia (after WWII) show, wars can be absolutely devastating on your demographic and take decades to recover, something you'll want to avoid by basically spamming babies.

** War tends to kick up in humans that need to procreate and find bonds. I mean, people still do this today. I knew several people who rushed their marriage through before a spouse was deployed.

For the marriage part of it--a lot of times it's about making sure the person you love will be taken care of in the event of the worst-case scenario. It looks a little different with both mother and father fighting, but that doesn't mean it isn't relevant. If you wait till the end of the war, and one of you doesn't make it out, then that person you intended to marry, to share your life with, the one who is left? They have /no legal claim on you/ /or what was yours/. If you both die, that's something else, but this is a reason to go ahead and make it legal during wartime.

As for having a baby? 1-Contraceptives fail. I doubt you can attribute the size of the wizarding population to internalized population control. 2-people make emotional decisions in crisis times. 3-again, the need to procreate, to leave something behind. 4-the refusal to put life on hold for a terrible event. Having a baby during a war could be seen as an act of defiance (I'm not advocating that it is, just that people could reasonably see it that way--especially if they're young and idealistic, both of which we know the Potters and Longbottoms /were/).

Also, remember, it takes 9 months to bake a baby. Harry was over a year old when his parents were killed. We don't know the exact timeline of when the war escalated, but who says that the war was really in swing when they got married/got pregnant? Two of my coworkers just had kids--both are second-time parents, and, if given a choice, /neither/ would have chosen to have a kid during a pandemic, but that bread was already baking.

Lupin/Tonks is a little less defensible from that dynamic, but I'd again, put that down to procreation instincts.

Does losing both parents under these circumstances suck? Yeah, 100%. But I think it's a little extreme to say that Harry or Neville or Teddy would /resent them/ for it. I mean, if they had been "responsible" by your definition, Harry, Neville, and Teddy would never have been born. You'd have to be in a pretty dark place to be so angry at your parents for dying that you actually wish you'd never been born (not saying it isn't possible to be in that place, just that it's not a place I see any of these three characters really being in). As for Harry hating them for leaving him with the Dursleys, by the third book, we know they would have never intended that. If he wants to be mad at anyone about that, it's Dumbledore.

** I truly doubt any of them did it on purpose, especially Remus.

  may I mention how damn stupid it is to hold a wedding in the middle of the war? If I were Voldemort I would put a powerful anti-apparation and anti-portkey ward around the place and cast a fiendfyre to burn all my opponents at one go.
#+end_quote

The Lupin wedding was small and quick. James and Lily's was probably just as small and I suspect the guest list included Dumbledore and his wand. Fleur and Bill benefited from Ministry spells until they didn't.

*** Remus is the only one who I can blame for his actions since he got married, never had a vasectomy and yet fled at the first sign of pregnancy. If you stick your cock in a woman, you have to be aware of the potential "consequences".

** It's a relatively small community. If only the Death Eaters had children in the 70s and early 80s, then there would have been a whole generation where they held complete sway, and the long-term effects of that wouldn't have been good.

** In the case of the Potters and the Longbottoms, the war had gone for more than a decade when they got Harry and Neville, and without the event of Halloween 1981, it was unlikely to end soon. People can't just stop living in the middle of a war, and if it was not for the prophecy, Harry and Neville would have been pretty safe and very low in Voldemort hit list.

In the case of the Lupins, Remus reactions and attempt to run away make it pretty safe that it was not planned. So whatever the wizard are using as a child control, it's not 100% safe.

Concerning the "war", despite being called as such, the "Blood War" can't be comparent to a conventional war like in the Muggle world. Wizards from both camp were not gathering together before fighting for a place.\\
During the Blood War, people could live almost normaly. The only difference was that you could go to work a day and learn about your colleague's death, just because he said the wrong thing to the wrong person.\\
People were afraid to talk because you could not know if your interlocutor was on Voldemort's side, or worse under the Imperius. And it's not like the Blood Purist were in any better situation, despite "winning" the war. The Ministry was not done yet and Crouch Sr gave almost full power to the Aurors. Someone judged "suspicious" could easily end up in Azkaban, or dead after trying to resist arrest.

In such a situation, a weeding was probably one of the safest place were one could be. Death Eaters like to attack people in their home where they were alone or with their family, but they didn't have the power to attack a big gathering where 40 or 50 wizards were present.\\
Not to mention that Voldemort officially claimed to fight for the Purebloods. Killing one family here and there is one thing, but wipe out an entire weeding, full of wizards from "Respectable" famillies may have been a lot harder to justify.

From what little we hear about the first war, it sounds like the end of the war was pretty close, with Voldemort on the brink of victory.

**** While that's true, that'd only really mean that the war would be over for the Death Eaters and other Voldemort supporters. Most of the rest of the population would have to deal with the regime change that would come with his victory, which would likely be no better than the war time conditions they already existed in.

** Idk, you're not wrong, but people having kids and getting married is so central to being alive I hate the idea of telling people they're wrong to do it when they think it's right.

It seems pretty nuts to have Bill and Fleur's wedding in the UK when presumably France isn't a war zone and Voldemort would have to risk getting another country involved against him to do the fiendfyre plan there.
