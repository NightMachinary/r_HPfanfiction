So We've probably all read the classic Slytherin!Harry - he is sorted there because of his TragicChildhood™, his SecretSlytherinCunning™, or the friend in his head. It's usually one of the three, anyway. He then goes on to become Rivals with Hermione, who is inevitably saved by Ron and his brother/Rival, who is the boy who lived /wink wink/. And then, the fic is abandoned.

So my request is this: All three of them go to Slytherin. Harry because of his TragicChildhood™ where he was ForcedToSteal™ and HadToFightToSurvive™, Hermione because of her ambition to change things for the better!, and Ron because of his ambition to set himself apart from his brothers, who already were and did everything that would gain recognition from his parents.

On it goes. All three struggle with their sorting a different way - Harry is mortified because Hagrid said all Slytherins are evil, does he have to be evil too? Ron is mortified because Oh Fuck, Slytherin, while Hermione is mortified because she knows exactly how Muggleborn are discriminated against (which was the reason for her sorting).

Now, instead of Harry becoming friends with three cardboard cutouts and a member of the Riddlejugend, the three still become a trio! Maybe Ron and Harry don't stay friends off the bat, since both are convinced the other is secretly evil, while Hermione's cry episode happens earlier than in canon, leading to her becoming slightly unapproachable but not needing to be rescued from the troll. Anyway, eventually Ron and Harry become friends again, maybe they both visit Hagrid and he doesn't seem mortified because they're secretly evil, and somehow get Hermione to join them as well.

And from then on, the story twists further. Does Sirius fall out of his Funk when he sees the news of Harry's sorting, as well as speculation, leading him to escape so he can "rescue" him? Does Voldemort become less homicidal towards Harry, taking the opportunity while being disguised as Quirrell to scout out his mind and convictions? Does this strange interest in the boy's mind lead him to be less hardlined in the mirror chamber, or does the mirror chamber happen at all?

** Harry Potter learns how to defend himself waaaay faster. He becomes more prudent, more cautious, because as far as he's concerned, everything wants him dead : Gryffindors because he "betrayed them", maybe Hufflepuffs because he's consorting with bad wizards, and Slytherins because he's Harry fucking Potter, hero of the Light, blablabla.

Meanwhile, Ron Weasley has to understands that /oh fuck he's a blood traitor surrounded by blood purists that wants his family dead/ and he kind of starts to study more - peer pressure, mostly, but also the drive to survive. He's at odds with many members of his family, mainly the twins, but his mother isn't a bitch™ and she tries to reassure him. At the same time, his father writes to him to tell him he's nonetheless proud of his son.

Hermione Granger struggle with her own ambitions and her will to survive. She has to learn how to read other peoples, to better manipulate them and to always be left to her own devices. She's got to defeat the entire house of Slytherin by her lonesome, knowing she has less knowledge, less money, and less political clout than many of her opponents.

Then, let's go further. Here comes Severus Snape, Master of Petty Bullying, who has to choose what to see between Potter and Slytherin. Of course, he is Severus Snape, so both the Gryffindors and the Slytherins are a bit weirded out by how Severus Snape seems to actively sabotage his own House just to be a bully to Harry Potter. Source : The fucking game where Snape is the only fucker to take points out of you for no reasons even through you're maybe a Slytherin.

Draco Malfoy won't be a daddy's boy long : he's going to have to face Harry Potter sooner than later, to assert his dominance. Of course the only thing he's got is his clout, so Harry Potter, without really wanting to, ridiculize him (because he's been training for this kind of events). The rivalry between the two intensifies.

​

But we can go even *further beyond* ! Hermione Granger starts to become friend with Harry and Ron by blackmailing them, and little by little a real frienship start to appear. I'm pretty sure Ron and Harry would rekindle their friendship quite soon after the Sorting, possibly after Harry decides to oppose Draco Malfoy.

The first year, nothing happens, really : since the duel between Draco and Harry isn't issued, they do not learn what is behind the locked door where Death awaits. But Quirrelmort can't take the stone out, and Dumbledore defeats them without having to save Harry.

Second year, having cultivated his cunning, he may promise Dobby he won't go to Hogwarts. So he's not locked in his room, and goes to Hogwarts like planned. He never meets the Weasleys for more than a minute, because they are late and he is not. The parents are happy he's such a good friend with their little Ronnie.

Draco Malfoy isn't suspected as the heir of Slytherin, because the Silver Trio could clearly see he was nothing but a pretty blonde face. At Lockhart's duel session, the same happens - except everyone is convinced he is the heir. Except the entire Slytherin House.

He is never hurt on a broom, because he didn't join the Quidditch team, for being a filthy Halfblood. Meanwhile, Ron Weasley starts a crusade to help his friend, and heralds Harry as "the true hair of Slytherin, aiming to find the false one who is giving him such a bad name". Slowly, with the help of Hermione, they win the students body little by little.

At the end of it all, Slytherin's monster is defeated - not by gryffindor's courage, but by Slytherin's cunning. The Silver Trio decides to hide in the bathroom once they find it is the entrance, and catch Ginny Weasley before she kidnaps herself. They identify the diary ad the cause, and brings it to Dumbledore. Afterwards, the Headmaster goes down in the chamber, and use one of Hagrid's new rooster.

Third Year is Black's year, and /nothing happens/. Because with all the changes in the timeline, all the differences in personality - the Weasley never goes to see their brother Bill (or Charlie I don't remember). So, Black never escape Azkaban. He later died, without anybody knowing the truth about him.

Having to always prove how they are "worthy of Slytherin House", Ron and Harry takes better electives : no Divination, but instead Ancient Runes. Ron has stolen Bill's notes, and he, Harry and Hermione goes through them to ace every tests.

Hermione never has a Time Turner - she isn't the perfect muggleborn gryffindor in this timeline, but the ruthless paria of Slytherin, member of the ruthless Silver Trio, who are always fighting for the control of the Dungeons against the Purebloods bigots. She never has a break down, but still beats up Draco Malfoy, because he deserves it.

And sadly, Harry never learns the Patronus.

But a new Gryffindor hero emerges : Neville Longbottom, tired of being the lame pudgy boy everyone believe he is, starts to improve himself, and challenges Slytherin whenever he can. As he does this, the Golden Trio is born : Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, and Neville Longbottom. As the year progresses, they starts fights with the Silver Trio, to prove that they are, indeed, evil, and does not deserve to be hailed as heroes or whatever.

The year ends with a bigger rivalry between the Houses, and even within, people are not really okay with the trios taking leaderships.

Fourth Year is a blast. Having never lost Scabbers, /nothing happens for our heroes/. And sadly, while the tournament was made safer, calamity striked, and Hogwarts champion Cedric Diggory lost his legs to an acromentula. Except it's the wizarding world, and so he regrew them. All in all, nothing happened, and Durmstrang won.

​

It is harder to imagine what could happen next without writing it down : does Crouch Junior locates Voldemort ? The ministry never really tries to fight against Dumbledore, since there's nothing to fight. Dumbledore has more time to asks Fudge to put more defenses, "in case another Voldemort comes to challenge Britain". Does Fudge see this as an attack, or will he accept the advice and be seen as the minister who saved Britain from Voldemort's second coming ?

So many questions, and the answer to one of them is : No, even in this world, Harry Potter doesn't marry Hermione Granger.

**** We can imagine she heard them plotting something to try and punish Malfoy, and she forced them to let her help or she would tell a teacher everything. Harry and Ron would be forced to stay with her, and little by little they'd become friends without even meaning to. At the end they would stay together because it just fits.
