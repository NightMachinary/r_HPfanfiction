Sorry for the rather vague title; these two events are the two main things I can recall about this fic. I've read it quite a long time ago and I have no idea what the title was or even what was the main plot about.

- The context of "challenging the storm" was as follows: near Flamel's residence there was a very persistent storm over the sea, which Nicolas believed to be a magical phenomenon of some unknown origin. Being annoyed by the fact that he couldn't understand its true nature, he walked up to a nearby cliff and started sending spells at the heart of this storm. Simultaneously he was throwing an epic tantrum about who he is ("I am Nicolas Flamel! I was Emrys Ambrosius!") and how the storm cannot /possibly hope/ to hide its true purpose from him. (I can't recall whether this event was actually significant to the plot or not.)

- The AD vs NF duel took place immediately after that scene; it was a friendly duel, not a serious one. Flamel knew some sort of a secret (related to Harry Potter, I think?) which he refused to tell Albus, his long time friend and former apprentice. Due to the latter's persistence in trying to talk Nicolas into spilling the beans, Flamel suggested a friendly duel to resolve the matter; if Albus wins, he learns the secret - if he loses, he stops bothering Nicolas about it. The duel itself lasted for quite a while and ended in Dumbledore collapsing out of exhaustion.

- Flamel was by far older than 600 years. He was originally Merlin (or "Emrys Ambrosius", as he preferred to be called). He had changed his name many times through the ages before finally sticking with "Nicolas Flamel".

- Both Nicolas and Perenelle (his wife) were quite sexual creatures - I recall one of them saying that sex doesn't start to be boring even after many centuries of living. At some point in the story they decided to go on a vacation (to Majorca, I think?), which they quite /vividly/ planned to be one great orgy.

** I've definitely read the doc you are talking about. I don't know what it is, but if I remember correctly there is also something about Harry being connected to some kind of symbol being studied in the DoM, and also seeing some kind of fountain with that symbol in dreams or something? Not sure whether there is a romantic interest or not, but if there is I would put money on it being either Hermione, Fleur or Daphne. Hope some of this might help you find it.

*** Yep, this is the fic I thought about.

It's quite strange I didn't remember it was a fem!Harry fic. Also, I remembered it to be much better written than it actually is.

Oh well. Still - thanks!
