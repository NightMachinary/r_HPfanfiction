I read short one-shot about this, but it was on sugar quill. Does anyone know of more such short one-shots?

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** These are a dime a dozen. when I used to browse fics on ff.net everyday, I would see maybe 1 a week.

Try searching mungos on fanfiction.net with remus as a character and possibly even limit the word count.

I don't remember any specific ones since I mostly read long fics but they're def out there.

  “I said I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage.” “What did he say?” asked George. “Said he'd give me another bite if I didn't shut up,” said Mr Weasley sadly. (Order of the Phoenix, p. 432)
