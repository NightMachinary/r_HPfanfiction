Everyone knows the often linked story now of linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE) as well as favorites like linkffn(The Thief of Hogwarts by bluminous8) and limkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne)

I am looking for stories that take a similar approach where Harry due to the War, Dumbledore, or the Potters never being rich in the first place puts Harry in a position to make as much money as he can as quick as he can. You can even give me storys that go the "Thief" route where Harry has a fortune but prefers making his own money.

It can be either legal or illegal like SPOILER [[/spoiler][Harry being a Dope Mule]] in Stealing Witches

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
