** Honor Thy Blood has that, but the romance definitely comes second to the main plot. From what I remember, Harry and Daphne don't interact until about halfway through the book. It's a great read overall. Highly recommend it Linkffn(12155794)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

One of my favourites simply because it's different. It's by far the most realistic story I've seen written for this pairing, and is actually written from Daphne's POV. (Which is extremely well done btw) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/10/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]]

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
