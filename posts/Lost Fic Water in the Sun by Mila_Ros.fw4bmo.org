Hello! This is a post to see if anyone has a saved copy of the fic 'Water in the Sun' by Mila_Ros. I just lost my copy when my eReader failed and I love that particular fic so much I thought I'd try and ask around here! Please let me know! üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è It was a Harry Potter crossover with The Hobbit and the pairing Bilbo/Thorin that was a WIP from around 2015, if that helps!
