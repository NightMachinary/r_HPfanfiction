I've been looking for so long, but whenever I try to find a fanfic where Harry has a family, it's always with Ginny. Not that I have anything wrong with Ginny, but I'd just like something different.


** I'm not sure if he has a family in this, or is just married to Daphne. linkffn(11185533) But its a sweet little one-shot anyway.

Also he eventually has one in this story, though its more of an epilogue thing: [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/rac/a/1/The+Rebel+And+The+Chosen/chelseyb/38]]

I can't really help with longer Slice-of-Life type of fics, as I don't read them or seek them out.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child][Beltane Child]], linkffn(9415372), has Harry/Daphne raising a family together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), has quite a bit of family drama. In fact, the first chapter depicted Harry's daughter disagreeing with him about his policies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483), is the abandoned sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. Harry and Bellatrix had a triplet, and they would play an important role in this story.

** linkffn(4703843) is an HHr story and has them adopt several children. It's pretty much pure fluff and imo has one of the best depiction of children.

** There are a gazillion ones where he is paired with Hermione, so many of those must have children...not that I read them though.

Among the others, off the top of my head,

Beltane Child

The Rise of the Wizards
