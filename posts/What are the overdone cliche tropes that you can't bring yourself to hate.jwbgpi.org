For me, it's basically all of the cliche troped I've heard of: Slytherin Harry, Lord Potter-Black, ridiculously powerful Harry, Slytherin politics.

I can't tell you how many hours I've spent googling and reading these types of fics.


** Time Travel. I love Time Travel Fix-Its, no matter how cliche they can be. I just wish there were more with the Coastalfirebird challenge rather than all the Reptilia ones, as I'm all kinds of over Fanon!Hermione.

Powerful!Harry Crossovers. These rarely complete, which sadden me, but I like it when an author does well integrating two settings well.

Gamer!Harry. I've a soft spot for Gamer fanfic, regardless of how silly it can be. Sadly, again, most never complete.

Political!Harry. Yeah, the only time lordships are mentioned are with the Black family. All we know from Rowling is the Potters were very wealthy. I like politicking. Doesn't need "Nobility", seats on the Wizengamot are fine.

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.

**** I never really got why the fans hate the Hufflepuffs for turning on Harry in second and fourth year. While, sure, we know Harry was a victim, from an outsider's perspective he seems quite shady. In second year he spoke to a snake in a language that could not be understood by anyone else and is constantly associated with dark wizards. In fourth year, Harry doesn't defend himself publicly so from the rest of the school's perspective, he circumvented the rules because of his love for attention and tried to steal one of the few things that Hufflepuff had going for them. We can be sympathetic to Harry because we know the whole story, but if we were Hogwarts students, we would probably go along with the rest.

If Voldemort could have not made it in Slytherin because of his half-blood origins, the next house for him, I think, should have been Hufflepuff. There he could have still gathered a group of people by claiming that current wizarding laws are unfair towards those that the system considers lesser beings (including Muggle-borns).

** I like stories with well-written magical creatures. linkffn(12603861) as an example. Personally I'd love to see a Hedwig is the master of death, and she's reincarnating over an over again, with cannon being her first life.

(Over time, she starts to retain magical power and be born as larger animals like a gryphon. Imagine a fic where Hedwig swoops down on privet drive in all her apex-predator glory, picks up Harry, and takes him away to a warded island somewhere sunny, with a few of the people he'd know later in life for company. Harry and a friend or two arrive for diagon shopping on time even though no owl ever found him on the back of snowy gryphon with black markings/stripes/spots. Draco throws a tantrum because he wants one too.)

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** Slytherin Harry is my go to type of HP fanfic.

I actually quite like shopping/christmas and birthday present montages. Presuming of course that the items get used for something in the future, rather then never be talked about again.

I like political fanfics too. You know, like Harry Potter, Heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Potter, etc.

If done tastefully, I also like hidden heritage fanfics. Ones where Lily comes from a squibbed out magical line. In particular I like how it was done in The Prince of Slytherin, and Perfectly Normal.

In this story Lily descended from a squib member of the Parkinson family. This gives Harry an in with Pansy Parkinson, which in turn gets him an in with the other Slytherins. If I recall correctly it also made Lily a half-blood rather then a muggleborn, which got Harry more respect from blood purist families.

**** Sovran's Meaning of One ([[https://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11833]]) is one of the first and one of the best, though sadly Sovran only ever went up to the end of Year 2. A fan-sequel is apparently in the works.

If You Can Help Her (linkffn(2788096)) does have a Bad Poetry Warning (which, to be fair, is in-character from the person who gave us "eyes as green as a fresh pickled toad") but is otherwise a good story about Harry and Ginny soul-bonding.

Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond is sadly abandoned but it's freaking /hilarious/ and features the best paperwork-dodging Dumbledore in all of fanfiction. linkffn(9818387)

Bonds of Time: A time-travel story in which future!Harry and Ginny travel back in time together by accident, and gain a soul bond in the same incident that sends them back. linkffn(8076284)

The Promise series, beginning with "It's OK to not be OK": linkffn(9104885) Picks up after Prisoner of Azkaban, Professor McGonagall takes Harry away from the Dursleys. The soul-bond stuff comes a little later.

EDIT: Ever Love is another soulbond, this one starts during Christmas of fifth year. linkffn(13241721)

  Harry decides to help Ginny recover from her experience in the Chamber of Secrets, causing a special bond to form between them. Rating is for violence in the later chapters. A French translation called Si tu peux l'aider is being written by Sined

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  It all started because a certain redheaded mother wanted her redheaded daughter to wear a dress for Christmas Eve. That dress opened a certain pair of green eyes to that she had always hoped for. With a little help along the way, maybe they can survive the coming storm.

** Redeemed Draco Malfoy. It's so boring when he's evil cause I expect, it's interesting the way people redeem him

Magically powerful Harry Potter, it's pretty realistic considering canon

Draco who's actually friends with his Slytherin classmates.
