in the story harry use combination of his metamorph powers and time turner to become diffrent ppl and do many classess at once, some of them were girls.


** I remember this one. Pretty sure it's a one-shot chapter in a collection of one-shots. Where Harry becomes so immersed in multiple personalities that his different forms interacting with each other don't cause any timeline issues. I'll try to find it but I don't know if I will be able to.
