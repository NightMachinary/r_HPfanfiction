It's everywhere, and I am /sick/ of it being at the end of promise, vow, or even a bloody /sentence./


** I believe it's also in a lot of wicca belief systems as a way of sealing a vow. Nit my strong suit but I think a lot of writers believe it want tonget wizarding culture as wiccan or pagan in some way

** It is used by the Freemasons who many see as an odd and secretive bunch. Odd and secretive kinda sums up a lot of the wizarding world. I think there are also some conspiracy theories that they somehow control the world which might also fit.

*** My partners dad is a Freemason and he says he's never said "so mote it be" or heard it said in his life. He says maybe the Masons in the States say it, but not in the English lodges (which are the original ones).

I have heard it said by followers of Wicca though, and a lot of the fics that use it also have the purebloods celebrating Beltane and Yule and Imbolc, so I've always assumed it's used to make them look like they're following "proper witchcraft."

** so mote it be is typically used irl by people who identify as witches there's different versions of it across cultures but it's basically made it's way to mainstream writers (if i had to guess via tik tok no hate i love that app) who probably don't realize that...well...depending on how they're using it in their fic it's probably not appropriate. It's like ending something with "Amen" or that one thing they say in Handmaid's Tale.

*** i had to just come back to this and add another comment and i just read a fic where "so more it be" is said and i think i wanted to throw something because........it was at the end of a speech and i'm like most speeches in HP just ended in "dig in" or "hear hear" or something else....."normal" reading it like that felt so strange and out of place....

** The thing that confuses me most about 'So mote it be' is that 'mote' (currently) means a tiny particle or piece of something - like a 'dust mote'.

So, really, it'd be far more appropriate for House Elves to end all their meetings with it, since it'd technically be translatable as 'so dusty it be'. :D

** Well answer me this, when doing something important like a vow or oath, what would you end it with? I always see â€˜so mote it be' like someone talking into a walkie talkie and saying â€˜over' to signify they are done speaking. A vow or oath needs something like that imo because how would the magic know the person speaking the vow is done? In some ways â€˜so mote it be' could be considered an ending spell, that closes up important bits of magic.

*** "This, I swear"

"As I decree, so should it be"

"May Magic shine upon this decree"

There's a thousand original ways to create an important-looking ending to an oath. In fact, it'd be way better if every family had their own, unique end oath, proving to the world their ancestry and the marks they left upon the world.

Also, you don't /need/ it, you just want it because it sounds kewl.

**** Well, I do like the last option you gave. But the families all having different ends doesn't seem all that plausible to me due to the fact that would be like having multiple ways to do the same spell, and many times wizards (in my opinion anyway) are lazy to a degree. Also, the public would then need their own ending as well. Lastly, any author trying to remember who has what endings would probably end up switching them around at some point. ðŸ˜‚

***** If you're afraid of forgetting just do a spritesheet, I mean my own fic has like a thousand docs just to track the skills, relationships, etc of the main character so at this point if you don't have docs for your complex personal stuff it's a nightmare to remember

Also, it would prove how ancient and unique they are, and wizards in the past certainly were not lazy (read : the statute of secrecy was done in one day and covered the entire fucking world) so they would still maybe create their own contract ending just to prove how much better they were at making shit up.

Also the last one I gave was so over the top only Malfoy would use it lmao. That or the Prime Time Blacks

****** Well your first one sounds like you are getting ready as a witness for court, the second one just sounds arrogant (which for purebloods would fit i guess) and the third one seems like asking Magic (a sentient force of nature like Death) to approve of/judge it. That's kinda why I like the third one lol.

Also, I'm saying wizards in general are lazy, but there are always exceptions. I guess I see them as lazy due to the fact that from the appearance that wizard society is somewhat stagnant. I have not read the books in awhile (and Cursed Child not at all), but I can't remember there being much in the way of new innovations being mentioned. I could definitely be wrong on that, and wizards can get there butts in gear if need be, but their longer lives probably don't help things. After all, many older people seem to get stuck in their ways. ðŸ˜‚

******* If you wanna talk about the books to explain why wizards are lazy, then don't say Magic is Sentient. For that matter, Death isn't a sentient aspect of nature either. That's all fanon.

Also, the only guys we see creating a business do just that : innovations upon innovations. I think they were kinda important characters, their names were... Wesbesy? You know, the twins?

Anyway, you have to remember that the story of HP not only happens in the 90s, but in a society far removed from everyone else. They have their own culture, their own history, and are in no way comparable to muggles, because they have a different type of energy that they call, you know, */magic/*. Of course they won't evolve the same way as muggles, and if they did it would be lazy writing at its finest.

******** Okay the only part of what you said that I feel I need to comment on is the first paragraph of your most recent comment, the rest I agree with. I'm a bit confused, and believe you are misunderstanding or mixing up what I was saying. My first and second paragraph in my last comment were almost completely separate things. I spoke of my thoughts on your ideas for ending vows in the first, and the wizards being lazy in my second. I never said Magic was sentient, I said your third example of a vow ending sounded like it would be good to use if the story had Magic being sentient. Maybe I didn't word it well, but I do know that canon doesn't have Magic as a sentient force. I just happen to like when Magic is a bit intelligent, even if it is not up to human intelligence. Just imagining someone trying to force their magic to do their bidding and having Magic retaliate in some way due to rule breaking makes me laugh.
