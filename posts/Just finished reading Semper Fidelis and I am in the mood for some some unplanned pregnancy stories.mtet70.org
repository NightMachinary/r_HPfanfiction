So I just read linkffn(Semper Fidelis by Untold Harmony) which is Harry Potter/Hermione Granger story where she gets pregnant while they were on the run and she leaves the wizarding world after the battle of Hogwarts when she finds out she is pregnant. (Bit of a spoiler. Sorry ¯_(ツ)_/¯)

Now I am I the mood for this particular trope and would love some recommendations. Brownie points for stories where it's not just an excuse to force some rare pairs or death eaters together though I won't mind those stories either.


** If you don't mind a bit of Veela absurdity, there's linkao3(What You Don't Know by zerodawn22), in which Hermione forgets that Veela Are Magic and wrongly assumes that since she and Fleur have the same organs and produce the same type of gametes, she can't possibly get Fleur pregnant.

  Everyone has a weird gap in their knowledge. Unfortunately for her, Hermione's coincides with a mistake that could have huge consequences. She's known as the Brightest Witch of Her Age, but there are some things she has just never come across. Try explaining that to an enraged Veela... Fleurmione. Femslash. Post-War.

** If you are open for non Harmony stories I have one where my oc is in a fake relationship with Barty Crouch jr and Bellatrix, who is convincing the pure blood DE members to get pregnant by Voldy like she is talks to Barty saying her niece should be there to show her loyalty especially as his chosen Queen of the DE and sleep with Voldy. Barty however says that oc is already heavily pregnant with his child and when he finally tells oc she has to take up a prior offer from Newt Scamander to be surrogate to a magical creature that is on the cusp or extinction to play heavily pregnant for her pretend fiancé to save face and both of their lives to not be found in a lie.

  The summer after his godfather's death was the worst in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark. Based on 'The Unknown Light' by Someryn with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath. No slash. Ginny is not raped.
