I'm going to be honest the main reason I read fanfiction is for the SMUT. I like a solid 70% plot 30% SMUT ratio would be my perfect balance. Obviously with any fanfiction it needs to be well written but other than that I'm all for it.

I recently got into writing some fanfiction and my heart wants it to be smutty, but I'm worried it'll put off a large majority of possible readers.

So I ask you all, what's your opinion on SMUT?

** Time and place.

To expand on that, well done smut in a story doesn't feel jarring or as though it was added as an afterthought, or for the sake of it. It also needs to cross the line into erotica occasionally so that you cansee the relationships develop. Rather than what many stories that try to have more story end up doing, which is serving up a story where the phrase "Do you want some Plot with your Porn" shows how true it is. To that end I don't think there's a perfect ratio of smut to story. Just like in real life there's no perfect amount of sex. Sometimes it's all the time, othertimes it's the touches, looks, and caresses that matter.

Obviously, if you're writing Erotica, rather than having it be a natural consequese of a relationship, tag it as such and fire away with both barrels.

** I have no problems with some smut in stories, but prefer for it to be fairly light, and not extend all the way into erotica.

If the story can stand on its own without the smut, and still be a good story, then I do not view it as a downside, and you can put in lemon warnings for people who don't like the smut scenes. 30% might be a bit high for most people to skip scenes. With that said, there are some popular stories out there that are mostly smut, and use the storyline to set up the situations for those scenes.

At the end of the day, if you are enjoying writing, it will show through the story and writing you produce, and is more important that being too concerned with "Will audience X like this aspect of the story". I have seen many authors who get fed up with what they are writing, and the quality drops, not because they're not working on the writing, but because they're no longer enjoying it, and that changes how it's written and how it flows. This also happens with individual chapters within a story sometimes. If an author has to write things they don't enjoy writing you can see good stories end up with chapters that almost feel like someone else wrote them, because they deal with concepts that the author does not feel comfortable writing about.

Write the story you wish to write, If you are unsure if you want to include the smut or not, maybe give it a try writing it both with and without, and compare the stories to see what you think. If you like both, then you can always present both to the world, with different ratings. I have seen a few stories on Ao3 do this to great success.

TL;DR: Write for enjoyment, not a specific audience.

** Plot-focused fics with smut are fine. Plotless fics that run on porn logic are also fine. Just make sure you tag and summarize your fic so that it's clear to the reader what they're getting into from the beginning. I remember reading a fic that mentioned "mature content" or somesuch in its description, which turned out to be a polite euphemism for "everyone has lots of sex and discretion is for nerds." Which, again, that sort of fic is fine, but warn a reader first, otherwise it can be incredibly jarring.

** Smut is something you read when you're in a specific mood. I can't imagine reading as much as I do with 30% of it being smut. What kind of state of mind would one have to be in to read hours of smut every day.

Anyway, I would say I (intentionally) read close to zero fanfiction shut. If I'm going to read erotica, I usually stick to published novels or occasionally literotica (.com). It's really quite difficult for me to sexualize the characters from Harry Potter (although some other fandoms are easier), and beyond that, fanfiction tends to average a lower quality, (than published novels) and there isn't much more vapid than low quality smut..

To some extent I think it's too much of a cliche that fanfiction is about smut. Most of the people I've told (including my wife) assume people read fanfiction for the smut, and it would be hard to dissuade them if that notion if it were true eh? To each their own, though.

Regarding your writing: tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of people read and write steamy novels/fanfiction every day, so it's not weird. Just do your thing

** It makes me rather uncomfortable, personally. I don't mind it /too/ much so long as it's clearly marked so I can skip it easily.

** I prefer it personally!

If the writer is good I think it can to the relationship dynamics of the characters and their chsracterization. Like everyone has a personality in bed so it's another layer of the character we can see and what the encounter is like can speak a lot to their relationship (do they seem interested in the other person pleasure or self centered? Do they seem really comfortable with each other or distant/hesitant? Explicit consent or mildly dubious? Etc)

But only if it's well written in that it feels realistic (I'm experienced enough to know when something doesn't work like how they are describing it), fits with their characterization, and adds to the plot line (it being described as very gentle and loving can show how they have gotten past a fight or something for example).

That being said I also only read long M rated stories with romance plots/subplots that take place post hogwarts or during year 8. I haven't come across them but I would be weirded if explicit romances like that took place during 3rd year. Yikes. That being said, again I don't really come across this but if they were year 5-6 and the scenes come off as unrealistic for kids that are 15-16 I'm also weirded out. By unrealistic I mean like over the top sex god or heavy bdsm.

I think it's just important to label it clearly so ppl no if they getting PWP or plot driven story that includes explicit scenes.

** I'm fairly partial to some well written smut. Not something I read most of the time but when the mood strikes me I enjoy it quite a bit.

** Good in small doses, with a few exceptions, like /Vanteeria Domestica/ by andrea_readwolf. In that story, the smut is pretty well-done and makes sense for the story, unlike the majority of other stories that have smut in nearly every single chapter.

** In longer, story-driven fics it isn't a deal breaker for me, but I'm not horribly interested either. It can totally work to deepen the plot and give a real intimate connection between two characters; it can be used as a point for characters to open up about sexual liberation, and abuse. It can be a fantastic story telling technique. But once we've hit more than a two or three scenes in one fic, I start skimming them for plot crumbs or skipping them. Like don't get me wrong, smut can be hot, but if I'm in the mood to read, it's mostly just boring, especially if it isn't advancing the plot. I have no real problem with smut one shots.

** I'm not much for "the entire story exists purely to be smutty" type fics.

I can appreciate a well-written sex-scene if it's the other way around, though - if the sex scenes are really there to drive a larger overall story and there's a reason to not just do the literary version of a Discretion Shot (undergarment hits floor, cut to some-amount-of-time later or to a different perspective). It's not very common that way though, at least not in fanfiction-land.

** I prefer to always have some romance in the fics I read and I enjoy smut in small amounts in most stories. When I'm reading stuff its for the story not smut usually, on the other hand when I'm really in the mood for smut I won't give a shit about the story and just read pure smut.
