Stories where a character is in a bad mood, maybe feeling neglected or frustrated and loses their temper to go an angry rant. If they are a little mean and offensive but they need to let off a little steam that's cool. I'd like it if they're not entirely fair because they've lost control of their emotions but maybe they get some people to think. Think Harry ranting to his friends at the beginning of book 5 though it doesn't need to be Harry doing the ranting. Thanks!


** Find any fic labelled "Independent!Harry" or "Grey!Harry" or something similar, nine times out of ten they'll contain at least one angry rant. :)

** Well, the obvious rec here is linkffn(angry harry and the seven by sinyk)

I did like the point about being forced to attend a celebration of the murder of his parents. That seemed valid.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

  After dying at the hands of Voldemort, Harry receives two tempting offers from a surprising source, offers which will change everything about his own life and the lives of those around him. He readily agrees, but the ramifications of the decision he made rear their heads in multiple unexpected ways as time goes on. Time travel, Good Dumbledore, RW/MW bashing. Fully edited
