the first fic is where Harry either finds or buys a snake that's actually Salazar stuck or cursed into snake formand one of the pairing is Sirius/Salazar and the time is just a little pre hogwarts

the next fic is one where Harry is the master of death and returns to first year where he accidentally runs into th troll during All Hallows eve feast and panics and forgets his spells and YEETS the troll into the wall

if anyone has any clue if these fic are still up or taken down can you please let me know and if anyone has any good HP slash fic, female harry fic, of HP/LL fics let me know

ps. NOOOO!!!!!! HP/SS or HP/LM


** I mean you can do slash, fem!Harry and Harry/Luna all in one with the Black Princess series, very dark though.

First is linkffn(Princess of the Blacks).

Don't know the others you're looking for though.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
