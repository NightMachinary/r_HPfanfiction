  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

The first two stories are complete, the third and final didn't get finished, and I think there are an additional few chapters or so on the authors blog that didn't make it to FFN. It was winding down though, so you're not left completely hanging.

**** The premise of the fic was very unique and seriously well written. Long story short: Harry falls into a magical mirror. To him it seems like nothing happened and he lives his life. To everyone else he was sucked in and then spat back out. So this Harry that was spat back out has lived another ~20 years in an alternate universe but is now trapped in his "former" 15 year old body.

It was so amazing and guh. It still makes me sad it's incomplete. It got /maybe/ halfway through and then just stopped. So there's no ending to a fantastic story.

Warning: it is Snarry but if you're OK reading an incomplete fic I'd still recommend it even if you're not into slash. Just skim over those bits. The overall story is 100% worth it. Just be prepared for a crushing sense of incompleteness at the end.

I would also submit linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee), both amazing completed fics, for which a third installment was never made. Also by enembee, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee), although it's only missing an epilogue.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time by joe6991), sequel to the infinitely weird and outlandish linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991), is also incomplete, though I count this as not so much of a bummer since I haven't actually read either of them, though I've heard good things about Wastelands and I liked the first couple chapters.

Very interesting. I looked that up and apparently he's also writing "The Luminaries" which is a rewrite of By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song, plus book three? All very exciting. My guess would be that he's taking the published author approach of writing the entire story before publishing it, which is fair since he IS a published author.
