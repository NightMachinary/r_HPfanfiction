... and I will write it.

No bamboozle, I'm just bored and have recently freed up some time in my schedule. As far as fics go, I'm almost done with a three-shot crossover, and I'm not feeling it with other ones that I have lined up, so I want to write something else. Something so full of cliches that it would be a challenge to make it readable let alone serious. Heck, I'll even write something with romance in it if I have to.

Crossovers are fine. I don't care if I'm unfamiliar with whatever you're suggesting. If I am, it's bound to make for some weird interpretations of unfamiliar fandoms on my part.

Whatever bad idea that people here like the most (via no. of upvotes), I will write.

Feel free to add further suggestions to ideas that you like; I'll take them under consideration too.

(My only caveat is that I will not write an illegal pairing. So if anyone requests a pairing with an age gap -- for ex. Hermione/Snape or Harry/Voldemort or whatever else gives me the creeps -- Hogwarts is going to turn into a university or there'll be time travel involved or something.)

*Edited to add:* Suggestions will be considered closed by the end of next Saturday.

*Edit 2:* Welp, it's that next Saturday at the time of this edit and it looks like I have a fic to start planning. Thanks, everyone!

But if you want a specific idea...hmm...okay, how about:

Harry obtains all three Deathly Hallows, which removes the bit of Voldemort from his scar, boosts his magic enough that he can wandlessly do stuff at will, gives him three magical animagus forms (Nundu, Basilisk, and Lunar Phoenix), and makes him tall, and sexy, and immortal.

These new powers come with a cost, however; 5 minutes after disintobliterozapping Voldemort and all of his Death Eaters into tiny pieces, this new Harry is overcome with an urge to find a mate for the rest of eternity; using his newfound gift of prophecy, he determines that his destiny is to be with none other than Gaia, the goddess of the earth.

Harry casts himself backwards through time to seek out Gaia and propose to her, but the goddess has a trial for Harry first; to prove himself worthy of her, he must travel back and forth through time to accomplish 7 tasks;

- Capture the escaped great wolf Fenrir,
- Steal the crown of the First Goblin King Regna,
- Bankrupt Septimus the Lucky Bastard in a gamble,
- Satiate each and every last member of the 1000-member-strong Elysia clan of Veela,
- Build the Lord of the Vampires a new castle on the dark side of the moon,
- Gain the sworn fealty of the King of Dragons,
- And beat Donald Trump at election.

**** Mm-hmm. The best part is that in the grand old tradition of bad fanfiction, it doesn't have anything to do with the Harry Potter world except for some Veela and the main character's name.

By the way, you don't have to use Gaia; any god or goddess will do, so long as it's someone immortal and powerful Harry is doing the tasks for.

****** A story concept, so powerful that it interferes with the author's attempts to write it, having its own will and deciding alone what will happen to its characters.

~writes that idea down~

That'd be interesting, actually; have a couple of writers work together, one playing the part of the author, the other acting as the 'fic' trying to write itself. Voldemort surviving diabolus ex machina after diabolus ex machina as he inexorably marches towards creating a greek tragedy.

** Difficult. I would say the typical Indy!Harry approach with some Dark Lord Potter overtones, but you have to follow a rule.

In the third conversation between Harry and another character, he must kill the character before the scene is over. No killing anyone before, and no sparing them from their fate.

*** Murderous Indy!Harry, you say? Excellent, excellent.

If I end up writing this one, I think I might go the selective mute route for Harry, though. It might be a a one-shot otherwise.

**** Wel,l engaging in a passive conversation, like at the Great Hall table is fine, as well as the implied stuff of a teacher teaching a class. But if you want to have Harry be called into Evil!Dumbledore's office to be offered lemon drops, or Harry run and bribe the Goblins into doing his work and giving him stuff, you are going to have to off them, resulting in funny situations (goblin war anybody), or you wont be able to rely so heavily on that stuff, and be forced to explore other characters.

  "Harry, my boy," began Dumbledore, "did you ever hear the tragedy of Lord Grindelwald The Dark?"

  Harry seemed to hear ominous music coming from the direction of all those silvery instruments on the shelves, but ignored it. Who was he to question Dumbledore's taste in mood music? He pushed his glasses up his nose and said, "No, Headmaster."

  The old wizard leant back against his chair, the firelight reflecting off his spectacles until the glare hid his eyes. "I thought not. It's not a story that Light Wizards would tell you ..."

It might be worth writing that fic just for the memes alone.

*** Hmm...I think I've actually seen this somewhere before...it was a story where Harry was framed for bloodily murdering Hermione (really a homunculus), Dumbledore was secretly a chessmaster who arranged the story of Tom Riddle and Harry Potter and stuff for his own benefit (or was it amusement) and banished Harry and Tom to a private island until he needed them 'back alive/out of Azkaban' for his plans. And then he got run over by a muggle bus while crossing the street.

** Whoo boy, I'm probably going to have to downvote myself because I don't want to see this monstrosity, but lets put together harem + teenage pregnancy + super-pureblood-surpremacy-england + 'power of wuv' harry:

- Harry decides in order to stop Voldemort he has to eliminate his power base, so he gets all the pure-blood girls in his age group (I donno +- 1 year?) pregnant. (Ron-tension/bashing, given, you know, his sister)
- Harry gets a firm talking to by a disapproving McGonagall about the fallout, the unfairness of it all, and how he shouldn't use others for his own gain.
- Harry is rebellious teenager, decides to correct the problem by using magic to get all the pureblood boys in his age group pregnant.
- Harry gets firm talking to by unapproving dumbledore, who talks about the greater good, destiny, dark vs light, and makes a snark remark how Harry 'missed one of the purebloods'
- Harry corrects his mistake by turning himself into a girl and Granger into a boy and getting pregnant
- (...?)
- The power of wuv was the power that the dark lord knows not and somehow spawning this massive brood results in the fall of the dark lord.

... ... ... And then some sort of really sinister 'it was the dog all along' twist. (Maybe It was all a plot by Granger to end the pureblood supremacy problem in England by making it so all the houses are too closely related so they have to branch out to muggleborn? I donno. Something corney for the end)

Yeaaaaaa. Pretty sure this should never see the light of day

**** We obviously don't have enough chiche's. Lets shove marriage contracts in there somewhere...

Hmm. How about Harry using his right as father to arrange contracts for all his spawn in a way that is meant to end the conflict. Of course that means trapping the Slythern kids into unbreakable barbaric marriage arrangements with muggles, where if they break it off, or if the muggle dies in any way or ends up in an abusive relationship or whatever, they permanently lose their magic.

Or maybe have the fact the kids have the same parents as a tool to move contracts from one family to the next, breaking up the prearranged plans. or something.

Uhh, I generally don't read marriage contract fics, so i don't know what sort of bad cliche's they have. But i'm sure you can work them in. Find a way to make fun of all the Harry/other contract fics :P
