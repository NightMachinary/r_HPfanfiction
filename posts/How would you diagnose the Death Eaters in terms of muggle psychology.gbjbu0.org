Hello, I'm really curious if there is anybody who can properly diagnose the ‘dark' purebloods?

Perhaps they have a superiority complex (since they are always putting down muggle-borns and thinking of themselves as better?)


** I don't think they can be diagnosed as a group. Maybe certain isolated individuals can have some complex or disorder associated with them but I think it's less a psychological problem they have and more the fact that sometimes people just suck. Some are opportunists, some are sadists, some are probably frightened and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect themselves or their families. That doesn't mean they need a diagnosis. I think that would take away from their unique motivations.

** Aside from Voldemort, Bellatrix, and Crouch, it's less a matter of individual mental illness and more one of the greater context of the impact of dehumanization and mob dynamics. People will commit atrocities in a group that they would never dream of individually. It's more a sociological phenomenon than a psychological one.

*** There's definitely some individual mental health illnesses there - probably along the psychopathy/personality disorder lines - but otherwise this is basically the answer: Group Think in the DEs and Dehumanisation of the Muggles/Muggleborns. Though I would also argue that mob dynamics is strongly psychological - I spent enough of my psychology degree studying it. :D

If you want an example of that sort of thing happening in real life, look up things like the Stanford Prison Experiment or the Milgram Shock Experiment (and the subsequent experiments building on their findings - particularly those looking at clothing and masks). Both were completely real experiments (that somehow passed an ethics board) where perfectly typical people, as 'normal' as society could deem them, did utterly terrible things to others simply due to conformity of authority and groupthink, and/or dehumanisation of an 'other'. Then there's the Asch Line Experiment, also looking at conformity. People will go against their own perceptions of reality quite often simply to be part of the group.

If you're interested in the psychology of this, OP ( [[/u/888athenablack888][u/888athenablack888]] ), then I'd recommend looking into things along this line of dehumanisation and conformity instead. The DEs were heavily based on the Nazis and this is essentially how they got normal people to turn on whomever their regime wanted, which is also what motivated most of those experiments I mentioned in the last paragraph. The common explanation given in the post-War trials by Nazi soldiers was "I was just following orders" and psychology wanted to find out what was up with that. Really interesting stuff, despite being completely fridge-horror terrifying if you look too deeply.

***** Sure, happy to help. Might as well get some use out of my psychology degree. :)

If you have any more questions about this, feel free to reply here or message me. There's a lot of research been done on this sort of thing and I'm happy to share.

Oh, and about the cult stuff other people talk about in this sub, that's a bit more sociology than psychology, but there's still some in there. Basic gist of that stuff is that the already adrift or struggling are really easy to radicalise or bind into an extremist group (even celebrities - Tom Cruise in Scientology and Allison Mack in that weird sex cult I forget the name of) like the Death Eaters. If you've ever read Delenda Est and saw it talked about disenfranchised Pureblood youths being converted by Voldemort and the pre-DEs (Knights of Walpurgis, IIRC), that's very reflective of how it really happens. It's also why Bellatrix is so easy to make sympathetic - she's so brokenly loyal now that it seems very, very likely that she was one of the previously struggling ones looking for answers or meaning and support and found it in the DEs. That's mostly sociology though - try look at studies of the Moonies in Korea or any of the generic end-of-days cults in America (Heaven's Gate, for instance) and you'll see a lot of how that predation happens with their recruitment.

****** Thanks a ton again, I'll definitely check it out. It sounds really +cruel+ -I mean cool.

Curious, but do you think that the Death Eaters (the more extremists ones) can be termed as either sociopathic or psychopathic (I have very little knowledge on either of the two terms. Most of it streams from Criminal Minds) and do they technically count as Serial Killers? ‘Cause I read like a page on Wikipedia and was left so utterly confused.

P.S: All these questions are for this ff that my friend and I are thinking of writing, so please don't mistake me for a serial-killer.

P.P.S: And this isn't about the subject, but I was wondering how does it feel to be a psychologist? (Question from somebody who is thinking of it as career).

P.P.P.S: If I wasn't so broke, I'd give you an award for your answer...

******* Unfortunately, when it comes to studying people, cool and cruel often interweave. It's terrifyingly fascinating, how many ways there are to be cruel to one another, psychologically speaking.

Apologies for the delay in response. Life, y'know?

And diagnostically, there's no actual separate term 'sociopathic' or 'psychopathic' anymore. They're just colloquial terms for sub-categories of things like Antisocial Personality Disorder or Dissocial Personality Disorder - Personality Disorders being a relatively broad term for things that relate to how you interact with other people and manage your own feelings in social contexts. Otherwise, it's often used wrongly, even by psychological professionals themselves. Some diagnosticians use them interchangeably, some believe there are differences, others agree that there are differences, but disagree on what those differences are. As in most fields examining people, there's a lot of dispute in psychology. :)

The most accurate general definitions I can give for the more academic usages of the terms though are that psychopaths tend to lack all remorse or empathy (they have no 'conscience' to guide them) and tend to manipulate the people around them while sociopaths tend towards simply anti-social or anti-norm behaviours - psychopaths manipulate, while sociopaths deviate, basically. There's no intrinsic violence though - they're not deterministic in that fashion, just contributing factors (they can make it more likely, but it's not absolutely certainly going to happen). If I were restricted to those two terms only, I'd say the DEs would likely be a mix, with more leaning toward psychopathy than sociopathy, but we get so little information on most of the DEs apart from Bellatrix and Lucius and Snappy, so it's hard to really say for sure. Diagnostics is more of an art than a science.

Also yeah, no wonder at that. When it comes to academic stuff, Wikipedia is a reference, not a teaching tool. It's written for people who already know something about the subject. I treat it like a way to remind myself of things without having to go digging through textbooks. I recommend you find a cheap introductory textbook that covers the topic, or look up more 'magazine' articles online like the links below - they're often designed to help laymen digest the relatively complex topics they talk about, so it can be a helpful start to give you the building blocks to go understand the technical terms on wikipedia and such.

I'm not a criminologist, so I'm not really qualified to give an absolute answer - I'm more clinical than forensic - but I believe the definition of a serial killer is just someone who kills 3+ people over a long-ish period of time. The gratification they get from that is more an associated point than a strict criteria for labelling someone that. But given that most people don't take pleasure in murder and torture, I could argue that a lot of Death Eaters would qualify for that as well. Bellatrix certainly seems somewhat over-enthused about torture and murder, for one, but I could also argue that it's more about the dehumanisation aspects. Can hardly take 'pleasure in the murder of people' if you don't see the people you're murdering as people, y'know? That's just my best guess though, I'd recommend finding a criminologist or abnormal psychologist to get a more evidence-backed answer (there are groups like that on reddit, actually).

At the moment, I'm in training to be one, not actually working as one, but here in England, getting the Ph.D qualification you need to be a Clinical Psychologist (mental health treatment specialising psychologist, basically) requires work experience, which I'm currently working on getting. It's stressful, hard-work, I won't deny that. But if you find a good place to work, a place that supports and nurtures you through the tough times, it can be incredibly rewarding.

And heh. No mistaking here. As a handsome jerk on TV once said, "There are two kinds of people who sit around all day thinking about killing people... mystery writers and serial killers. I'm the kind that pays better.” :D

And no need for awards. Always happy to talk about psychology stuff - sharing your passions is its own reward and all that. :)

** I think it's hard to generalise. I mean how would you diagnose ppl who are for example members of the KKK or who are in a cult? I think it's had to define and you'd have to look at every person individually. Bellatrix for example is all kinds of crazy and I think everyone who was in Azkaban experiences some kind of repercassions
