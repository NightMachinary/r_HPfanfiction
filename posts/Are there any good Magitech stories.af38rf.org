Something like the ever hated "Disillusion, by Hermione Granger" but longer and in more detail? Or with muggles slowly but surely replicating and using magic (possibly becoming a futurefic?). Suggestions?


** linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione building a magical railgun in her parent's basement, inventing spells that fire lasers at her opponents, doing very interesting things with alchemy and chemistry, creating magical nanobot swarms, and finding ways for muggles to use magic.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage]]

Might qualify. Harry adopted by Tony Stark. If I remember correctly, this was written before any of the current Avengers Universe stories and is oriented around the comic books.

** linkffn(How Can I Weaponize This?) does magitech really well. It's really casually written but I feel like it gives it a charm that no other fic has. The final battle is also rediculously good in my opinion.

*** I made it about 4 paragraphs. I think I see what they're trying to do, but it's not working for me. The attempted writing style just comes across as confusing and broken (and maybe somewhat lazy) to me.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
