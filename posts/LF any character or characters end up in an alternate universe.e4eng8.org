As it says, ANY stories where a character or multiple end up going to an alternate universe. The AU could be a small change, or it could be a major change, or anywhere from between.

Please have the characters be as in character as possible (the ones who end up traveling to an alternate universe, that is).

Can be from ANY era, the Marauders, Golden Trio, Next Gen, or any other era.

Would rather not have Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's, well as long as it's just from the Alternate universe, that's fine.

As I said, Harry can be the main character, it can be someone else or anything. Though I'd appreciate if it wasn't an OC.

These are different then time travel, since it's a completely different universe, with any change that could happen.

If anyone would like to write any, let me know, and I can give prompts or any further ideas that I like.


** I'm currently writing "The Granger Principle", which should fit your request.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  The only way to be certain you can defeat ultimate evil is when you've already done it before.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
