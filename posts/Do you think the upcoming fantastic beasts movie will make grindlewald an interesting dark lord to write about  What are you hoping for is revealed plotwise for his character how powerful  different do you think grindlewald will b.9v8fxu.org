Title


** I hope Grindelwald's ideology and movement are given more exposition. We don't get that much info on Voldemort's rise, other than 'He was scared of death, and believed in blood purity'. Very one dimensional.

Hope Grindelwald at least breaks into the second dimension.

**** Same. I hate how the verse tends to portray characters as flat out good or evil with sudden transformations between the two states.

There should be reasoning for why Grindelwald thinks as he does. Everyone loves a relatable villain.

**** My headcanon for Grindelwald is that he had some ties to the Baltic Nobility and tried to use the power vacuum created by Brest Litowsk to claim his "Birthright" and was denied when Versailles revoked that Treaty. Resentful of Britain and France, he made common cause with the Nazis. He supplied them with stuff like Veritasserum in exchange for things like V1/2, which he modified to home in on magic (some of the "misses" actually hit hidden magical houses). At the same time he used the Eastern Front to rid "his lands" of the Soviets.

Throw in some love triangle where Dumbledore wanted Grindelwald, who merely toyed with his feelings while having a secret relationship with Arianna. Dumbledore finds out, is hurt and confronts Grindelwald and the rest is history.

In my opinion, a noble with some legitimacy and huge territorial/power ambitions who has no qualms about pacts with the devil and grudges for days makes a better story than Evil McEvil and his evil followers.

***** See, implying he was only toying with Albus makes him kind of flat to me. Like, oh, he's evil, therefore completely incapable of love.

I want a steamy summer fling with genuine feelings all around, for maximum drama when it all falls apart epically. Neither of them will ever love again.

The rest of the stuff sounds good, though. If they don't go with it, you should write the fic. ;b

****** He had feelings, just for a different Dumbledore. He blames Albus for the death if his "true love" and since the British public sided with Dumbledore in the aftermath and offered no help for his "righteous" cause, they became his enemy. That's why he chose to chuck a few magic homing missiles from the continent, that's why he chose to side first with the central powers and later with the Axis.

** I'm actually kind of sad it's coming out and a canon is being developed for him. Though some people don't like it, I love reading interpretations of the blank page characters. When done well, they allow for some extremely creative writing both character wise and plot wise. Once the canon is developed, I've noticed people tend to write towards that rather than just using it as a base and it can make it harder to find unique stories. Maybe that's just me though.

** I'm looking forward to seeing it, but I kind of wish Colin Farrell was in it again. He was a BAMF in the first movie.
