Looking for a fic where Harry is so incredibly powerful, he could be considered a god. Like, cheering charm will rip your face off powerful.


** Linkffn(Worthy of Magic)

I love this story. Fuckin' psycho super Harry is wonderful. Literally a transfiguration god. "Hurr durr lets see all of England turn into a desert and see who will survive"

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

** linkffn (10311215 )

an old favourite of mine, though maybe not quite what you were looking for since most of it is told via Riddle's POV. But powerwise Harry certainly qualifies, IIRC he [[/spoiler][built a civilization on Mars in a moment and basically force-stopped WWII by disabling all tanks and heavy weapons]]

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, slash

** Core Threads gets there, and so does DOOM Day as well. I never finished Core Threads due to losing interest. That isn't a comment on the quality of the story so much as it is that I'm mildly ADD. DOOM Day is a very long run Groundhog Day story. The version that's available on FFN has some scenes censored for content. What's posted there ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, and allegedly is continued elsewhere though I've never been able to find it.
