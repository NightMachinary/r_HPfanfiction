Not too bothered about the plot as long as the writing is good. I want something that really focuses on the details of their family life and domesticity. I'd love it if their financial troubles are also highlighted somewhat in the story, though it doesn't have to be the main focus. Don't really care about pairings, just no slash. Any bashing is okay as long as it's not too OTT or badly written.


** I've recently started reading linkffn(Percy take the wheel) which is an AU but very very good so far. Not sure if it quite fits, but it's certainly about Weasleys.

*** Thank you for this! I was hoping to read something a little more uplifting and reflective of their characters in the books (which is difficult with both Molly and Arthur not present in the story) but I'll definitely try it!

**** It's a very, very entertaining read. I've read a lot of fan-fiction over the years and this is a standout.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
