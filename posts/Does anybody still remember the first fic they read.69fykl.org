** I know I was about 11, and I'd lost my copy of OoTP, so was googling to try and find it online. I came across some weird fic on a website I haven't seen again since, all I can remember from it is Draco turning up at Harry's house before 5th year and them acting as best of friends.

I imagine it was a sequel fic, but it sure did confuse me for a while.

A lot of the early fics I read a few years later when I started reading fics on purpose were quite bad though, I found my old ff.net account and the favourites are /dreadful/, Lord Potter-Black-Sideous-Holmes-Nartu-Gallifrey-Slytherin types. But in a way that led me to finding the good fics, and DLP's reccommended ones.

  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."

** Very clearly, actually. It was a Harry/Draco fic, Irresistible Poison by Rhysenn. I remember staying up literally all night to keep reading it on the family desktop. I didn't want my mom to know I had never gone to bed because I'd get in trouble, so I didn't tell her and then had to stay awake all day while we ran errands. I remember being pretty loopy.

Harry/Draco is still my OTP so I think it made a pretty big impression. I go back to reread it every few years.

While recovering in the Hospital Wing, their parents are called and Hermione realizes that the Helion wands have found their masters.

Long story short, the Helion wands were a project that Ollivander and Gorogovitch had worked on together--attempted to recreate the Elder Wand.

Also, their DADA professor was a vampire.

** I think the first one I read was [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate by padfoot4ever]] on harrypotterfanfiction.com only about two years ago. It was pretty good if I remember, then again, I used to like the whole Lord-Potter-Black-I have more names than the entire population of the British Isles put together and enough money that I can destabilize the entire global economy in both the muggle and magical worlds, so that should give a fair warning. It was actually one of the only nextgen fics that I've read and the only fic that paired Rose and Scorpius. There was one other that I remember where it was Dramione(one of the few I think to have enjoyed) and she was potion high on love potion or something and she and Malfoy fuck in one of the spare classrooms or something and it actually had a plot, can't remember the name though.

** My first fics were all Buffy. First Harry Potter fic was most likely Thinking in Little Green Boxes, or this one crappy Buffy crossover that is highly rated on TTH, or the first couple of chapters of My Immortal.

  Lelouch had been quite happy with his life. Sure they were living in obscurity, but he and Nunnally were safe. All of that changes however, when his identity is revealed and Lelouch is forced back into the fold of the Imperial family.

** My first fic I ever read was HPMOR. I remember it alright. It caught me with its first chapters, because they were a fun thought experiment, but eventually its got a bit stale.

The next one was "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" which opened the whole fanfiction thing up for me.

  Harry has a great memory, photographic even. He remembers everything even the day he was born. Every sight, sound, smell or touch he remembers with crystal clarity and he has power from the moment he is born. And whats up with Hedwig? All chapters edited for spelling, grammar, and some content. You may want to re-read it. Currently on Hold - I will resume it eventually

** Not the first I ever read but the earliest I remember was about White lighters at Hogwarts, which was a Charmed x HP crossover. Other is some story where Harry was the leader of the Privet Drive orphans and he loved Tootsie Rolls. He also had a childhood love interest in this one. I don't have links, unfortunately.

  This story will be a series of unrelated chapters. All will be based on different moments in the JKR books where Harry and Ginny could have gotten together before they did in the Canon Story. Though the first is in the CoS they will be posted at random.

** I lived in a really small town back when OotP came out and couldn't wait until the next time I would get to go to the nearest city to get my copy so I went to Kazaa to try and find a copy. The story was about how the Potter family had saved a bunch of Phoenix back in the day and for that reason each member of the family is granted a one time wish to brig someone back to life. Harry wants to use it to bring back his mom and I don't remember too much about the story. The only other thing was that I was on a Neopets message board right after finishing it and someone mentioned who died in the real 5th book. I was totally confused as Sirius was alive and well in my version and that is when I learned about the horrible world that is fanfiction.
