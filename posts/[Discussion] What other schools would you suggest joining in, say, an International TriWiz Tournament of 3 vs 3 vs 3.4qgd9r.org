** When were the participants chosen? What countries were powerful or notable at that time? Who was doing the choosing?

For instance, let's say the Tournament was established around 1275 in the Islamic world, and al Madrasat as Sihr Dimashq (the School of Magic of Damascus) did the choosing. They'd probably consider schools from Isfahan, Fes, Cairo, Mogadishu, and Byzantium. Possibly Harar in Ethiopia.

Further afield, they might consider India. India is big. Like you could fit the entire population of Europe in it and still have room for North America. And I don't know it well enough to say much intelligent about where you might find schools, but I can mention Sind, Vijayanagar, and Bengal as nations that existed around the right time.

** Rowlings eleven major schools aren't all idenitifed yet, and the coverage isn't evenly-distributed in the least. What we have collected from the wikia:

- Hogwarts - Scotland [English]
- Beauxbatons - southern France [French]
- Durmstrang - Sweden? Finland? (off the Baltic sea, regardless)
- Ilvermorny - Mount Greylock, western Mass, covering U.S. and Canada at least [English]
- Mahoutokoro - Iwo Jima?, Japan [Japanese]
- Castelobruxo - Brazilian Amazon [Portuguese?]
- Koldovstoretz - Russia [Russian]
- Uagadou - Uganda, though I could've sworn it was supposed to be Burkina Faso, where the city of Ouagadougou is the capital

The article on that last one starts with this most telling phrase: "Although Africa has a number of smaller wizarding schools..."

So we can skip worrying about the last, unnamed schools that supposedly cover education for all of Central and East Asia, despite the claim that Uagadou is the largest of the eleven schools.

**** I think if you start with the assumption that not all young witches and wizards attend schools, it's a bit easier to accept that some places really might be devoid or nigh-devoid of schools and knowledge around those parts is simply passed from one wizard/witch to another.

That said, the only reason to make this assumption is that without it and with there only being so many magical schools the numbers don't really check up. So you can either assume that most younglings indeed are home-schooled and schools are for the elite (and/or the rich/influential/important families), or you can accept that Madame Rowling botched the numbers and make it AU with your own schools.

So the question is, do you want to go AU and want /ideas for schools/, or do you want to somehow fit it in with 9 schools even though that's almost all of them and there's no way they'd try to make it be 9 (but then again, yay for AU there too)?

** Is Durmstrang Russian or German/Austrian? I was never clear on that.

Japan-Korea-India, maybe. I doubt Japan and China would work together after WW2, even magically, with the way Japan invaded them. This leaving aside whatever cultural differences China might have in teaching its magic users.

Africa would probably be South Africa-Egypt-some-other-african-country. Ethiopia? Nigeria? Madagascar? I don't know. Wherever that African school is in the mountains.

For the far West, I'd go with North and South America combining in a US-Canada-Brazil group. I'm discounting Mexico because a fic I read gave me a new headcanon about Mexico being generally uninhabitable for magicals because of the Aztechs and their human sacrifice fuckery making a mess of the leylines in the area.

I doubt there would be a group from the Middle East, because I don't even want to know how Sharia law would affect magical society in places like Iraq and Iran. Maybe Israel-Turkey-Afghanistan? All of my international political/religious knowledge comes third-hand from Reddit, so I'm just making WAGs here.

Oceania might have one. Australia-Philippines-Indonesia.

EDIT: Of course, google says Egypt is under Sharia law too, and they're probably more likely to identify culturally more than geographically, so who the fuck knows with that entire region.

**** I always thought it to originally be a school for people of Scania (the one place that had actually been called “Scandinavia” before 17th century), then once the trade routes became common also for the folk of Nordic regions, and later also Slavs, with Germans joining in after half of Germany had been given to the Soviet block.

Considering that we know Durmstrang Institute is Scandinavian and that the Scania region is mostly flat but does have some mountainous regions (making it rather easy to easily hide a mountainous bit), I think it a fair guess even though it is just a guess.

By region, you have sub-saharan Africa, West Africa, the Horn, and North Africa.

North Africa is more of the core Islamic World, so it would probably go together as one, and I'd nominate Cairo or Fes for schools. The Horn includes Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea; I'd nominate the province of Mogadishu for the location of the school. West Africa is big and historically pretty wealthy (there are tales of a king from West Africa, I forget the name of the empire, who took a trip to Egypt and brought so much gold to buy souvenirs that he caused a brief bout of hyperinflation). Sub-Saharan Africa is like the Kongo, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe -- I'd guess that Zimbabwe would host the school, though the Kongo is also a possibility.

That's...not how you divide Africa

Sub-Saharan is everything that's not MENA - i.e. West, Central, East and Southern - and by itself isn't an actual region. North Africa, of course, is MENA. I've never heard of the Horn being used as a standard geopolitical region, especially since it has like one real country ^{^{plus}} ^{^{Somalia}} ^{^{Djibouti}} ^{^{and}} ^{^{Eritrea}}
