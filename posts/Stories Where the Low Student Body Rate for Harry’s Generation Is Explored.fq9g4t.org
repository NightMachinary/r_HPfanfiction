Not sure if the title describes what I want completely. I'm just wondering if there are any fics where Harry's generation has the lowest student body rate in generations as a main focal point. After all, while JK Rowling did say a thousand or so students attended Hogwarts, I'm sure this number was significantly depleted for Harry's generation due to the war with Grindelwald, the first war with Voldemort, the dragon pox outbreaks, etc., etc.


** I remember hearing about a story where Harry was truly the Boy Who Lived because Voldemort had killed every other child his age.

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope? No romance

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

But I've seen this done in fics that focus on pureblood customs/traditionalist!Harry fics usually in the fandom of Harry/Daphne and Harry/Susan

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
