** Not exactly it. Similar, but Harry is a 'Golem' created by the Potters instead: linkffn(4641394)

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** There's another one I read a long time ago where Lily actually uses Regulus Black, and his wife and daughter to create 'golems'. It's probably one of my favorite stories that I can't find anymore.

*** I don't think that's correct. Artificial just means basically not natural, created.

** Oh shoot this seems like a super interesting idea. I've always been intrigued by Harry joining Voldemort or having a very deep connection to Voldemort (deeper than cannon).
