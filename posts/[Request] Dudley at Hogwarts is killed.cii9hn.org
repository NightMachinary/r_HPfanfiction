** Well, you could try the Dangerverse stories. It's a minor part of the story, but trom what I remember of them, Dudley ended up going to Hogwarts and was killed in the end.

Since the Dangerverse consists of several stories and I'm not sure which one has Dudley dying, I'll just link you to the author's FFN profile:
