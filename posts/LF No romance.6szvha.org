** Short mistery fic. No romance (some might say it implies Harmony but I disagree they're only close friends). Linkffn(6243892)

** You are just desperate to read some gen with action? Okay...

linkffn(10610076; 10132530; 3995826; 3804374; 5554780; 7683642; 844334; 12388283)

'Time to put your galleons...' - i would be surprised if someone hasn't read it yet... Timetravel, MoD!Harry (already lived several lives before that one) this time is born as an older brother for Sirius and Regulus. I like this fic.

'His mother's love' - there's no much action as I remember but still worth reading

'The Hidden Hero' - amazing fic, you'll love it. There is a romance only in the last chapters but it's not that big part of the text so have no fear. There's also a what-if fic for this fic ('The Trusted Hero'), link can be found in the author's profile.

'Trip to the past' - in 1 September 2017 (book's epilogue) Harry is accidentally sent back in time into his eleven-years-old body (and there's no way back). Really like that fic, don't remember any romance and you'll like action in it.

'Poison Pen' - everybody must have already read that... Before his 5th year Harry is fed up with anti-propoganda against him so after failure with sending letter to 'Prophet' he begins to write letters to 'Quibbler' and then he gets his personal column there... Uh, I'm a terrible at summaries just read it if you haven't. As I remember there was no much action in it but still interesting.

'Recollect the future' - timetravel again (i'm a fan of them). After their deaths Snape (via Nagini) and Harry (via Avada in the forest) find themselves in the Forbidden Forest. During Harry's 1st year. Gen, some adventure, destroying horcruxes together - i don't know about you but I like that.

'Amulet of time' series. Before their 5th year Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione are sent back to the Founders' time. In 2nd fic they're in Grindelwald's time helping with the war. In 3rd fic they are in the marauder's time. In 4th fic they finally get home and deal with Voldemort. 5th fic (they and a few others get to the time even before founders) is abandoned long ago but these 4 fics are still worth reading. Actually I skipped 1st and 2nd fics as I wanted to read about marauder's time... And there's a romance (HG and RH - canon) but it's skipable. But there are a lot of adventures, gen and you shall like it.

'Many deaths' - actually i haven't finished reading it but it's very good.

It's 6 am now and I want to sleep, maybe I'll add some more later.

  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.
