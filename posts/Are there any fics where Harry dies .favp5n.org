I am looking for fics where Harry finishes the job but he ends up dying. No time travel, no mod, no soul wandering, no ghost,simple normal death.

I read one where Ron and Hermione finish the job, it was good too.

*** I am looking for it. I'll post it when I find it. SPOILER.

It was something along the lines of Harry dying, Voldemort taking over. Years go by Ron and Hermione are living separate lives from each other. One day Hermione asks to meet Ron and restart their mission. It is in the end of fic they realise why it was important for Harry to die . If someone knows that fic . You can post that.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

This sort of thing usually breaks my immersion severely. Like, alright, I get that it's the premise, but these people can literally vanish small animals. They can regrow bones and organs and skin and limbs.

Like, a trip to St Mungos to get a healer to vanish the cancer and he's fine.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.

******* Yeah, there was a separate epilogue that differs from the original ending. I think it's called A Taste of Ismenian Waters. I think people didn't like the original ending too much and the author decided to write that epilogue. It should be in the author's page [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] page.

Edit: apparently that one was the original epilogue before the author decided to write the actual ending the fic got. Sorry for the confusion, I read that a while ago, and my memory is a bit foggy.

A Taste Of Ismenian Water is just the epilogue that was already written before the author decided they liked it better open ended, and cut it off at the last chapter then posted the epilogue separately.

I'm a Greek myth nerd, though, so I /really/ like the titles. The epilogue's is quite clever.
