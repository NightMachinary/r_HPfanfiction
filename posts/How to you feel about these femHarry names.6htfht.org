** Wasn't there just a post that asked this?

Iris is something that would definitely fit. It's not only a flower, but it's also a much more common name than the other two.

***** What an asshole. Yennefer is a cool name. The only reason I'd advise against it is the connection to The Witcher.

But then again, this being fanfiction... who cares? If you want your fem!Harry's name to be Yennefer, you go for it.

And then send the guy who pm'd you a link to your story.

***** Yennefer is odd but not bad by any means. Most people who would like it are probably witcher fans, though. Otherwise I would do the more common Jennifer, but that wouldn't really fit a fem!Harry.

Evelyn is ok, but I don't like Athena. Always seems a bit arrogant, naming your kid after a god.

I personally prefer the names Hyacinth and Terra (Terra Potter. Earth Shaper. HahahahaI'llstopnow). Iris is another favorite, and I'm planning to use Daphne as a nickname for Daffodil in another fic.

Lotsa flowers out there, OP, go look 'em up.

** My take:

Iris is good, since it fits with the Evans family naming theme of flowers. It's a bit obscure, but still good. The symbolism is good, too.

Athena is a pureblood wizard name, and not one the Potter family would have used either. It's a good name for the setting, but not for that character. (Since Harry isn't very wise or a paragon of civilized-ness.) It would be an interesting alternate name for Hermoine.

Evelyn is an interesting choice, but doesn't really fit with her parent's naming conventions. Plus the symbolism is... odd for Harry (but good for a fem!Ron, actually)

** Gonna be a lot of opinions on this topic, but here's my two cents:

- "Harry" was chosen in part because it is a very normal and average name. A lot of canon focuses on how normal Harry is, honestly. Athena does not fit this trend.

- A sizeable part of fanon has decided that female Potters (fem!Harry or sisters or daughters) should continue the Evans family tradition of flower names. (Given that we only have two data points, it's a bit presumptuous to assume that this is a tradition, but this /is/ fanon...)

- Another part of fanon has decided that fem!Harry's name should be something that can be shortened to "Harry" as a nickname. I'm actually not personally a fan of this one, mostly because I think calling a woman "Harry" is odd.

Obviously, you're not going to be able to please both of the last two groups, but I personally fall into the normal flower name group.

**** Iris does have the advantage of multiple meanings- the flower, part of the eye, Greek/Roman goddess of the rainbow (one of the few with the same name in both pantheons). To maintain the association, you might give her violet-blue eyes.

***** I think I'll go with Iris then. I actually already made her eyes violet because I think it looks nice, so perhaps Iris really would work best. Plus, she's gay and ya know, rainbows and all that.

*** On a random note, not like you can't give someone pretty much any nickname that you want (for as long as it's not so bad that they tell you to go die in a fire, that is), and even nicknames that are based on names can get really ... stretchy, yes. As such, while it is not something you would normally call a girl, I can see /someone/, not everyone but at least someone, randomly deciding to do it.

Though, of course, for many people writing stories where characters have nicknames is too much of a hassle because sometimes the readers have problems with following the connections between characters and nicknames.

** Two sides. You can either go with the Evans naming scheme, using flower-names, or you can use the Potter"-wifes" naming scheme which seems to be using rare and obscure names.

From the three, just by sound, I like Athena best. Athena as a mythological character is pretty interesting, and given her status as a warrior god with morals and ethics, rather than Ares, I think it would fit somewhat.

Iris would fit just because of the naming scheme, really. I'm not a big fan of Evelyn.

Names I like that are named in the Potter family history: Iolanthe (Link to the Peverell family), Euphemia (wife of Fleamont Potter).

Names that I like in general: Virgo, Freya, Imogen, Aria, Makena, Niobe, Gabriella, Damaris, Farah, Skadi, Laufey, Ambeth.

#+end_quote

Uhh AFAIK we don't actually know any female Potter names that are canon. Euphemia married into the family and even Fleamont Potter was named like that because his own mother was the last of the Fleamont family or something. The only other names we know his James grandfather (Henry) and Hardwin (who married the Peverell girl).

** I'm not a fan of Yennifer, but I could see a wizarding couple naming their kid that. It wouldn't stop me from reading a fic, but I'd probably roll my eyes at it until I saw an author's note about it being the name of a character they like in a video game. Then I'd roll my eyes, go okay, not feel the need to roll them again, and get back to enjoying the story.

The only name that has ever so completely turned me off a fic that I couldn't get past the summary because of said name was Harribelle.

*** Yeah, I liked the name Yennefer from the Witcher books. Which is why I first chose it. I'm still going to include in my authors notes that one can always download a fic and then replace the name with whatever they use. I know I've done that before.

** "Iris" could work, since it ties into the "flower name" theme from Lily and Petunia... but it's a little peculiar.

"Harry" is a very common name, and I don't think a Fem!Harry would have an uncommon or "special" name. I always cringe a little when I read Fem!Harrys named things like "Amaryllis" or "Monique" or, yes, "Athena." I don't think Lily Potter would have given her daughter a name like that.
