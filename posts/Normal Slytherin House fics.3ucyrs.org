I'm looking for a few fics that feature Slytherin House... But, I don't want anything that has 12 year olds acting like they are polyjuiced 90 year old Dukes transported from the 16th century. I'd prefer OC/post-war fics... But anything that isn't stuffy and formal would be appreciated.

  My take on the Slytherin!Harry genre. What if Harry's less-than-happy childhood had left him more jaded than canon? No pairings, and you won't find any eleven year olds talking as if they were at a Renaissance fair here either.

** I'll add mine, it's an OC but I try to keep things fairly realistic and true to the books, so no lords or titles. The kids also act age-appropriately, or I try to.

  Sophie Potter is the younger sister of the infamous Harry Potter. Her life at Hogwarts should be set, but things take an unexpected turn when she is sorted into Slytherin. Being green is never easy, especially when those cunning folk will befriend you just as fast as they would cut your throat.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.
