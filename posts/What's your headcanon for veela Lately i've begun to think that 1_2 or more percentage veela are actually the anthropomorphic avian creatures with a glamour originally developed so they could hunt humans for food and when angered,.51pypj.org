#+TITLE: What's your headcanon for veela? Lately i've begun to think that 1/2 or more percentage veela are actually the anthropomorphic avian creatures with a glamour originally developed so they could hunt humans for food and when angered, they can't maintain the glamour anymore.

Not sure about those with lesser percentages but thinking it'd be a coin flip with their being avian or humanoid appearance, whether their glamour works or not, and whether or not they could throw fire.

My thoughts on this came about because i was debating whether or not to have Fleur be a model---or was approached to be one---in the muggle world and if she was a glamoured anthropomorphic avian, would the cameras see through them?

Also, how many of you imagined Fleur sitting on an egg instead of in vivo maturation?


** I would classify Veela as "half-breeds" like centaurs: part human, part not. I would not support the idea that the human form is just an illusion. Even if it was an illusion, I have no idea why a Muggle camera would be able to see through it.

Veela have three attributes, so far as we can tell:

1. The ability to enchant men/those attracted to women via singing and dancing. This enchantment makes the victims lose all sense.

2. Supernatural good looks. This appears to be a separate power to the singing and dancing: consider how Harry fell victim to the Veela's song, but was completely unaffected by the Veela they walked past in the camp. It wasn't just a change in degree, with the Veela having less compulsive power when they weren't singing and dancing. Rather, when they sang Harry was completely enthralled, whereas when he walked past them he felt absolutely nothing. This indicates to me that there's no compulsive element to a Veela's good looks, no "allure". If there was, you'd think Harry would have felt it like he did in the stadium. Rather, Veela are simply more beautiful than we Muggles can imagine. (Even in the Muggle world some people with poor self-control or bad manners or a job in the construction industry will blurt out stupid shit to attractive women who walk by. Imagine how that would be magnified for a woman who was supernaturally attractive. No allure or aura or anything like that is necessary to explain it.)

3. The ability to transform into bird-like creatures which can throw fireballs.

As for Fleur, she appears to be a mostly human witch who just so happens to have a bit of Veela in her ancestry. There's no evidence she identifies as a Veela or has inherited powers 1 or 3.

Personally I imagine that Fleur would be insulted if you referred to her as a Veela. She's a skilled witch, and Veela by contrast seem to occupy a low position within the wizarding world, somewhere between animals and humans, given that they were the mascots of the Bulgarian Quidditch Team, comparable with Leprechauns. The idea that she should be considered more Veela than witch belittles her significantly, I think. It implies that for all her magical skill, that tiny part of her that results from her Veela ancestry negates it.

*** Because in the majority of fics that deal with the statute of secrecy, glamours affect only human senses and a security camera or a droid as in star wars crossovers would see the actual person, not the charm's proscribed elements. I imagine it as a reactive mind control charm, not a proactive face adjustment.

The idea came to mind because of how tired I actually am seeing the above thought without any reason why explained, it's just statedcas a fact or it's why harry gets tripped up. It's kind of like a scene from a book I once read that i don't remember the name of, in it an alien species saw in black and white so their camouflage was adequate to them. Until some of their species evolved to see colour and they were describing how the camouflage they used was actually wildly ineffective because the colours their camo were made of was so different than the areas they used it. The camouflage of the veela is adequate until humanity evolves past wetware and start seeing via hardware.

1. 2: I always wrote off Harry's resistance as part of the same reason he could fight the imperius AND his just beginning the hormonal storm of puberty instead of being in the midst of it. He's only just started to notice girls aren't just boys with long hair in the series if I recall correctly.

But really, this is just headcanon that will violently change as soon as i read a good fic that counters it. But only after i decide on my usages for darkness!harry story since fleur/harry hatefucking is fairly important.

** I don't think their looks are illusions. I think that is in fact how they look when not enraged. The avian form is a body-transfiguration that comes with the ability to throw fireballs and fly. They are, basically, the land form of Sirens. Their song and dance enthralls. The difference from Sirens, in my head, is that Veela latch onto powerful humans to produce offspring that may or may not be completely Veela.

In case of Fleur, I never envisioned her as anything but a witch with Veela ancestry (even though I do enjoy the things authors do with that fact). That means that like Hagrid inherited some giant attributes, Fleur still has some of her Veela blood visible - literally in her case. Yes, cameras would catch her good looks because at this point it isn't more than a mite of Veela beauty.

And I have never envisioned her sitting on an egg, even though the imagery is fun. Poor Bill and his nesting mother Veela.

** My headcanon is that you either have Veela abilities, or you don't. None of that in-between nonsense like only being able to transform and throw fireballs if you're really /really/ mad. So Fleur would have none of those capabilities, since she's only 1/4, and you can easily explain all the canon happenings around her by just having her be exceptionally attractive.
