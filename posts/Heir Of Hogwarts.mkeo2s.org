:END:
I read this fic sometime between 2015 and 2017, and it had 230k+ words when I read it, and at least 40 chapters, but I'm fairly sure it had a lot more, I think the first chapter was posted before 2012, it was on FFN. Most, if not all of the fic, was from Harry's POV. Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Ron, found out something that lead to them not trusting Dumbledore. I think Hermione was somehow related to Rowena, and Neville to Helga, but they came to the conclusion that if Salazar had a secret room, then so did the rest of the founders, and you could only access them if you where an heir, they found Rowena's secret room, which was a huge library, and did a lot of research in it. Eventually, at some point, they decided that Dumbledore needed to be away from Hogwarts, and the only way for that to happen was if Â¾ of the founders heirs had control of Hogwarts.

If I remember anything more I'll edit this.
