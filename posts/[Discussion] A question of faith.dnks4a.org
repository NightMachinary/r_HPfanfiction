Let's talk about religion in the wizarding world.

On one hand, magic can be used to explain a lot (not all, but a lot) of things that get explained as miracles. Walking on water, rapid healing of seemingly serious injuries...most of the examples I can think of are Christian, as that's the one I've been exposed to most, but I'm sure examples exist that would shake other faiths. When *literally everyone* can do miraculous things eight times a day, who needs God?

On the other hand, between Dementors, Horcruxes, ghosts and all the other things the magical world has, wizards have indisputable and absolute *proof* that

- souls are real, and everyone has one. Dementors are eating something when they kiss you.

- committing certain acts is a genuine danger for the integrity of your soul. Horcruxes, yo.

So in some ways, they have proof in ways that devout Muggles sometimes wish was possible, but will never get in this life.

So...how does this shape religious belief among wizards?

Do they trend more religious than Muggle Britain? Less? The same?

If some ARE religious, how might this be *different* to the way Muggles are religious?

- Is a magical Mass still in Latin, since the wizarding world split off and hid when church Latin was very much still the norm?

- Does a devout magical Jew study additional material in the Talmud, with rules about how magic can be used (or cannot be used) on Shabbos?

Are there any characters you think either *definitely are* religious, or *definitely are not*?


** I think Abrahamic religions make most sense for wizards.

The worship of Pagan Gods usually had some purpose in mind that a wizard could easily achieve with magic, like there is no reason to pray for success in something when magic already guarantees it.

With Abrahamic religions the promised reward lie in the afterlife, which wizards know nothing about beyond its existence, they are also as religions go much more well suited for international communities rather than pagan gods which were often bound locally.

And I doubt atheism would really be a thing among wizards since they still have a lot of questions about the universe like where everything comes from or what happens after Death, while at the same time they know that the supernatural is absolutely real and that muggle science is wrong, so they have lots of religions which offer a variety of (potential)answers to these questions.

I don't believe everyone is very devout though, I just think that while they would in general believe in god, they would only really practice religion when its convenient and probably have some interpretation of holy books that are somewhat less strict.

*** I would argue that a belief in nature deities is a lot more logical for wizards than the belief in Abrahamic religions. Because the messiah figure or prophets are not really above wizards when it comes to miracles. Lazarus might be the only one not recreatable, other than that it is either basic Hogwarts stuff (eg water to wine) or things which are similar to existing magic, such as temporarily returning from the dead (resurrection stone) or healing illnesses. Hell, half of Jesus miracles can be recreated with dark magic and the other half is basic.

**** People dont believe in religions because of miracles, they believe in religions because they agree in their teachings and want what the religion promises them. And nature deities simply dont offer the things that would be most desirable for wizards, most of them barely touch upon things like the afterlife, and if they do its often either a very negative prospect for the majority of people or something very abstracts like reincarnation, promising eternal happiness in heaven for all true worshipers is a much more attractive option.

And even if you just talk about miracles the biggest difference those seems to have comparison to what a wizard could do, is scale. Sure a wizards could probably conjure some annoying creatures, but it would take a wizards at least as skilled as Dumbledore with the Elder Wand to imitate things like the plagues of Egypt and things like the splitting of the ocean would still be beyond them.

***** Frogs falling from the skies, firstborns dying and swarms of locusts can be easily done with today's biological weapon divisions, nevermind someone with magic. Also, you don't need to be able to do everything, you need to know that it's possible to achieve. Most people can't run a marathon in under 2 hours 10, but since it has been done by a guy recently, we know that it's not a divine sign.

From a magical point of view, most prophets would be seen as little more than Muggle baiting wizards.

****** Sure they could, but a single wizard would struggle a lot with those things, except for resurrection, range seems to be by far the most limiting part of magic, so a prophet achieving all of that with magic could be considered extremely unlikely.

And just because something is theoretically possible doesn't mean people wouldn't attribute it to the divine, take Alexander III of Macedon for example, his skill in warfare was so great that people believed him to be the son of Zeus, even though everything he did was humanly possible.

Like sure you probably get a few people claiming that the prophets were just magic users (which in real life did happen), but it shouldn't really affect the belief in general.

The thing is, we don't have magic. So if someone comes along and says that X is a wizard, that means very little. But if someone tells you that X is a FELLOW wizard, well, while his deeds might be impressive, they don't come across as divine anymore.

******** We have magicians, fortune tellers, and faith healers though, as in people who are able to convince others that they have special powers, most of their methods dont even require modern technology, you could probably make a case and say that this or that prophet was just a extremely intelligent fraud faking all his miracles with methods we know would theoretically work, but that doesn't really stop people from believing in it. Like have you ever tried to talk to someone who believes in stuff like homeopathy.

But again, miracles dont really play much part in convincing people to follow a religion, the teachings of the religions themselves do.

** First let me refer to the older discussion on this topic and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b2b2qj/probably_gonna_catch_some_hate_for_this_religion/eirp9cl/][my contribution]] to it (since then I have found also an excellent stories linkffn(12738075) and linkao3(5537045)).

Second, specifically to your questions:

- I can imagine that with literal witch-hunts at least on its face promulgated by the Church (there is a lot of historical material showing that it was more complicated than that), there was at least in that time (before The International Statute of Secrecy) significant clash with the Christianity.
- However, I believe, that since that, at least because of the influence of Muggleborns and other contacts with the Muggle world, there were some improvements, and that there are now some families of wizards which are traditionally Christian (or of some other religions, but in Britain we are talking probably primarily about Christianity; although, I guess there were less problems with religion in nations which never had witch-hunts --- Patils could be non-problematic Hindus, I guess).
- On average I would think they are roughly as religious as the Muggle population, except there is less pressure to be a member of any church, so there are less Christmas-only Christians (like I would suppose, for example, Dursleys were).
- Mass in Latin is an interesting idea; what was the language of the Mass of the Anglican church in the time of the Statute?
- I am absolutely 100% certain that if there are two Jewish wizards they argue wildly about the rules for Shabbos (BTW, see linkffn(3388041) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/636071]]). Yes, it is my firm head-canon that Grangers are completely secular Jewish family originally called Faktors (which is roughly the German translation of a granger) who emigrated to England from the Czechoslovakia before The Second World War. Comparing to that series, I believe they were completely secularized (as most Jews in the Central Europe were), but that is the only explanation why super-bookish girl in the country with the established church did not know where does “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” come from.
- I don't think any of the main characters are practicing religious people (because somebody would have to mention something). So, either they keep it really private (e.g., linkffn(6494461)), or it is somebody quite distant to the Trio. I quite agree with the general fandom expectations on Cedric Diggory being a Christian, Anthony Goldstein being a Jew, and perhaps Patils being Hindus. My personal feeling is that from teachers the only seriously religious person is Professor Flitwick (that choir sings during the services; sermons of The Fat Friar are incredibly dull and boring, but he is an excellent pastor in the one-on-one dialogues having hundreds years of experience), and yes, I thought that Professor McGonagall was a Presbyterian (somehow in the style of Helen Burns from “Jane Eyre”) even before JKR wrote that she was a daughter of the Muggle Presbyterian pastor. I liked as an idea of linkao3(7292632), Snape being a Roman-Catholic and dealing with his issues in the confessional.
- Yes, I agree with many stories, that the anti-Muggle fanaticism of Death Easters prevents them from being religious in any mainstream religion, and they may try (rather unsuccessfully) practice some pre-Christian religions.

*** I don't know the answer to the Anglican question. It was probably English, but that still raises a similar question of how services have changed over time. If Cedric's a solid Anglican, did he learn his habits from a 1662 Book of Common Prayer? Modern Anglicans don't generally use one that old, it's been revised repeatedly since then.

Since the Statute of Secrecy applied worldwide, we know it applied across nominally Catholic societies. Even in Britain, there was a sizeable Catholic minority, so the Latin thing might well have come up.

**** Certainly, and Catholics being persecuted in the Muggle England may be a way more acceptable to wizards (more than the official state Church of England actually; that's an interesting idea). Also, some families (I have heard that the name Weasley is of the Irish origin) may be from Ireland or at least Ulster and so they would be even more probably Catholic.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** Probably a belief in natural deities rather than an Abrahamic god. It would make sense if they honoured a magical groove (if naturally occurring) or other places with magic manifesting. Magic is the essence of life, so there could be sacred places where it is left untouched. This would be an individual faith, with some holidays were groups gather (maybe for rituals). Maybe even the common pagan tropes like dancing naked and the like.

Or a pantheon where they worship something akin to half-gods; powerful wizards and witches, maybe not even entirely human, of times long gone who created/shaped the world with their magic, possibly reaching some kind of ascension upon their death where they became one with magic. Some kind of origin myth which explains where magic came from. This one would be more akin to the faiths of antiquity, which had a clear organisation with temples and dedicated followers, but did not control everyday life as much as later religions.

There might be a few cultural leftovers from Christianity, but as you pointed out, I can't see wizards and witches follow a faith whose miracles are stuff all children learn. So no mass or sacraments.

*** To build on this, there might be an aspect of Ancestor Worship within Wizarding society, or at least within Wizarding Britain as can be inferred from canon (for example, Amos Diggory's exclamation of "Merlin's beard!" upon meeting Harry for the first time, another being the near deification of the Founders of Hogwarts).

** I wouldn't say that the wizarding culture is that drastically different from the muggle one as they're not completely isolated, there's a constant influx of muggleborns. I could see Malfoy esque old pureblood families following old pagan religions mostly just so that they can be more different from muggle trash.

Atheism might also be quite popular, as biblical miracles aren't that impressive when you can do the same with a simple spell, and religious rituals could just be remnants of early attempts at casting magic by appealing to spirits.

I'm not sure if wizards have definite proof of an afterlife. The Veil is one way, so nobody knows if there's anything but nothingness on the other side. The Resurrection Stone is mostly myth and when we see it in action the spirits it creates don't seem to be very in character, which makes it quite likely that they're fake illusions based on the user's expectations with the goal of drawing the user to suicide. Horcruxes somehow prevent the soul from disappearing, but give no indication of if there's another place for souls to go or if they just vanish. I'm sure Dumbledore believed in afterlife and in the Stone really communicating with it, and Voldemort probably did not believe in a pleasant afterlife.
