****** If you read the sidebar (read the damn sidebar), it talks about the fanfiction bot. To link a fic, all you need to do is put in a comment with linkffn (title) with no space between the paranthesis and linkffn. In this case, it would be linkffn(hogwarts love story).

It can be made to be more accurate in case of a duplicate title by adding the author's username, so it would be linkffn (title by author), once again without the space between the linkffn and parenthesis.

EDIT: In this comment, the bot decided to go with a different Hogwarts Love Story, so I would recommend that you use the bot form with your FFN username. It's actually rather convenient this was the case, as examples go.

Harry was on his knees laughing about something Sirius or Ron said. Do you think that's realistic? Just an example. Other things was just ... It's really simple writing. When cleaned up for grammar and spelling, it'll hold up as nothing amazing. Just properly put together sentences, and questionable dialogue. It takes more than that to tell a story.

********************** Characterization is horrible. Why the fuck does Harry know about Muhammad Ali? Do you think the Dursleys let him watch TV? How does he know about Moran and Troy? That's something someone growing up with Quidditch might know or like. Harry likes Quidditch because he's good at it but nowhere in the books does it show that he follows or even supports a Quidditch team the way Ron does.

Characterization is subjective though. I like reading manipulative Dumbledore because that's believable to me and it's not for others.

Your main problem is that you don't know how to tell a story or write a story or even come across as literate. You would fail any literacy test outside of Ireland I expect. I know you said you have a language disability so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that. Story wise though there is NOTHING in the chapter that is remotely good at all. Not Sirius, Harry, or Ron, or even Mr Weasley.

** I never read only the one chapter of something unless I'm desperate to read something new, but from looking at the summary and title, I've got some concerns. Lack of capitalization in the summary and title is a bad sign, and won't endear it to most readers. I did a quick look through it with good ol' ctrl-f, and out of 96 usages, Harry is only capitalized 27 times (28.125%). Unless you are using the verb harry a hell of a lot, that's also a bad sign for long term quality.
