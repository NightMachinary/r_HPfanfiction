Any fics where occlumency is well developed and/or heavily used, and/or is an important part of the plot? Mindscapes etc are welcome. Linkffn (core threads) is a good example, same as linkffn (the python defence) though in the last one snape does try to teach him, but Harry does it on his own.


** In linkffn(7512124) Harry learns Occlumency from a REAL master. Uses it to defeat Voldemort. Featuring mindscapes, mental projections and a really lewd bird.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
