Like the title says I'm interested in stories where Harry receives proper training as a wizard from a young age. Where he knows what being a Lord means, where he actually uses his funds and influence properly, where he isn't easily manipulated by the likes of Skeeter etc.

I don't have a specific setting in mind and I also don't really care who trains him exactly. maybe Dumbledore decides to give him a more hands-on approach, maybe Sirius was never jailed and has taken his position as godfather or he gets adopted by one of the countless other families... That's all the same.

Just a few rules:

- I prefer fics that are complete, or if they are ongoing get updated regularly (at least once a month)

- No Yaoi whatsoever.

- I'm also not interested in a Dark!Harry fic. "Grey" is acceptable but he should very much not be evil.

Does anyone know any good fics like that?


** The classic story of this type is onoM's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]]; though it's fairly long (150k words), I believe it's abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is 16 years old. He already defeated Voldemort, with the help of his Godfather Sirius Black. Now he is in for the biggest challenge of his life: attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
#+end_quote

Incidentally, onoM's story was based on an old, abandoned story by Jeconais called [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Aftermath/Aftermath/][Aftermath]].

#+begin_quote
  What if Sirius Black had raised Harry to be a warrior. What if he defeated Voldemort, and then had to face a bigger challenge. Going to Hogwarts for the first time. An attempt at a complete AU, but abandoned when I realised that the characters weren't that good, and that I had no real point to the story.
#+end_quote

One that's updating very regularly (multiple times a week, typically--I think the story was pre-written before posting) is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] by MarauderLover7.

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
#+end_quote

SerpentSannin's old story [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=47][Knowledge is Power]] probably also counts. Harry was raised a wizard to be pretty much the textbook Jerk Ass Sue. Neville as Boy Who Lived, abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry, in this story, is two years older than he is in canon. Nobody else's age is different, as far as I know, except for Harry being born two years earlier than normal.
#+end_quote

I wrote a novel-length, complted story where Dumbledore acted after the second prophecy and took Harry into an apprenticeship. It's not quite what the OP requested, but I could link to it if anyone cares.

*** I'm really glad there are several other stories posted in this thread that seem interesting. I just finished what there is of Innocent and am really bummed that there's not yet more. This is definitely going to be put on my "check daily" list haha.

*** They look promising but it's the whole "abandoned" thing that irks me. Nothing worse than getting into a good story only for it to suddenly and abruptly stop.

**** Fair enough.

I'll think on this a bit, as I'm sure I can come up with more stories that are completed. (It's a pretty common theme, after all.)

Edit: Here are a few from [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Stuff-Edited-by-Perspicacity/93584/][my C2]]:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale][Grimm: A Fairy's Tail]] by Krahae. 100k words, complete. Harry raised from childhood to be an Unseelie prince. Has an awesome Flitwick.

#+begin_quote
  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] by Kwan Li. Harry raised by his mother and (sort of) father.

#+begin_quote
  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle][Growing Up Kneezle]] by Manatocfox. Harry grows up knowing his heritage in the magical world--albeit as a kneezle animagus.

#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] (and sequels) by Shezza. Harry learns of the magical world when he becomes host to a fallen angel.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys don't want their freak of a nephew in their home, so Vernon takes Harry directly from number 4's doorstep to Gringotts. What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts.
