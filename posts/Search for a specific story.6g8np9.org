Hey guys ! I've got a question which is killing me : some time ago, I read a fanfiction which shipped Hermione Granger and Severus Snape. It played after the war, Hermione experiences some kind of PTSD cause she killed in the Final Battle accidentally Arthur Weasley. Ron gets crucio'd, ends in Saint Mungo ( Can't use his legs for some years) and is incredibly angry with Hermione. Hermine returns to Hogwarts, falls in love with Severus, Ron finds out, becomes jealous and wants to poison Severus, he almost succeeds. Problem is, I can't absolutely recall the name of the story. I've spent hours searching it, without luck. Any chance one of you knows this story too ? By the way, I thought it a great story which I can only recommend. Love, Helena

** Can I ask what the appeal is? It... seems to be full of holes that would annoy me to no end.
