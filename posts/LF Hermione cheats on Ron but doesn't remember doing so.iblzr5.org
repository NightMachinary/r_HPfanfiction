:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read a fic a while back, it was unfinished at the time. In the fic, Ron caught Hermione cheating on him, they had broken up, and he, Harry and Ginny were giving her the cold shoulder. The problem is, Hermione has no memory of any of this and essentially has a months-long gap in her memory. Harry and Ron think that she Obliviated herself because she felt guilty, but as the story went on it was clear something else had gone on when Hermione "cheated"... but I don't remember if the fic ever got to the point of explaining exactly what had happened.

Any ideas which fic this is?

*** Haha, sadly it's still unfinished, although from my brief skim over the latest chapter it sounds like it's mostly resolved. I don't remember exactly what happened, I think it was related to polyjuice? I'm a little less than halfway through my reread and so far there's still no solid answers to what has happened, so I'll have to report back later.

**** In the wizarding world there are so many ways to commit the perfect crime without leaving any evidence.
