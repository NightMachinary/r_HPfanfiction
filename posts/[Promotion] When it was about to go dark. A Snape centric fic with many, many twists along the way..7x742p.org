Hello there! This is my fanfic (the link is posted at the end), called- When it was about to go dark. It is a part of series called- When Gray met black. This is a Snape centric fic, where he is paired with an oc character. It is an au which starts from the summer before the fifth year...

1. This story has the involvement of Severus' daughters and the plot of how they came to be would be explained bit by bit in the story.

2. This contains some really unique pairings, like Dramoine (I love this pairing!), Daphne Greengrass x Ginny Weasley... There would also be some new ideas put into this... Atleast, I think that the idea that I have is new...

3. Sirius lives... I've always wanted him to... Not everyone dies in this...

4. It is an AU and some characters might feel a bit ooc, but I feel that is how they would react...

Constructive criticism is highly appreciated.... I'd love to know the mistakes I made so that I can improve....

Please, I need to know what your thoughts are, Readers!

** Looks good enough but I find Daphne/Ginny a bit odd but that's my opinion of course.
