There was a Dark Lord Potter sort of story I read a while back, where Harry "took over" Hogwarts as a Dark Lord to keep it open, and "bonded" with the school or some such. He also helped make Malfoy Minister of Magic.

It was somewhat like Sum of Their parts, which is one of my favorite fanfics. I can't find it anywhere! Any help would be appreciated! :)


** I'm pretty sure you're thinking of the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/37557][Charming Universe!]]

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/641996][Charming When He Needs to Be]] is probably the one-shot you're talking about but there are other three stories in the series!
