I mean yeah, she was friends with Snape, but do you really think that she was a pure teacher's pet who didn't know how to have any fun what so ever and was only interested in following the rules and earning good grades?

I know we don't know all that much about Lily, but we also don't know that she was that way!

What brought this on? Me reading fanfictions that start shortly before Lily and James died and it almost always is Lily who tries to stop either James or Sirius from having a little fun (sure she might be concerned for little Harry, but it kind of is too much IMHO!)

So, there you go :) - the FLOOR IS YOURS GENTLEMEN and LADIES :)


** Well she did chew out James when he was being a shit to a friend of hers. Granted this makes me like her a lot more, but she definitely will tell you when you have crossed a line. It's a imho unwarranted crossover with those henpecked husband tropes. And generally in those stories James is acting like he never grew up in sixth year when we know canonically he did.

*** It could also be due to the fact that she was prefect + head girl. We could be coloured by our experiences at our own school, but general stereotypes tell us that students who hold these sorts of roles at school are generally less "fun loving" than other students and we could be projecting these stereotypes on her.

It doesn't help that Percy is the only other "main" character with lots of screen time that was also prefect and head boy.

** What do we know about her, well we know that she was not a fan of James's fun. Now James' fun straddled/played hopscotch along the line of fun and bullying. Now if it was fun for James and the spectators then Lily stopping it is anti-fun regardless of how much it sucked to be the victim.

A far more annoying case could be made that we know Lily was an intelligent muggleborn. Who else do we know who is an intelligent muggleborn? Therefore Lily and Hermione are the same person. The lack of information about Lily as a person means people have filled in the blanks with what is available. James, we meet his friends. For Lily, we get Petunia, Snape and Slughorn none of who are particularly helpful.

She was one of Slughorn's all time favourites. Assuming that requires more than just academic brilliance then she would have been a teacher's pet. Enough so she stood out from all of the other clever ones. I think Flitwick was fond of her too.

People who like Snape often dislike James. James therefore becomes worse and so the idea that James never grew up spread even though we know that the only reason little Harry exists is because James grew up. That means there are more occasions when Lily has to step in.

** Yeah people just seem to base her on Hermione. I'm currently writing her and trying to remember that Slughorn said she was cheeky - trying to give her Harry's sass and dry humour while James has more goofy, immature humour. I think people struggle to understand the different types of humour and just broadly put people into categories of funny and not funny - then if they think of a funny line they automatically give it to fred/George or James.

Edit: this has also inspired me to flip the trope on it's head a little. When it comes to the point in the story when Harry gets his toy broomstick, I think I'll have James racing after him as the over protective, paranoid parent while Lily laughs and finds it funny as per the photo in DH. What do you guys think?

*** That makes complete sense to me. After all, someone had to have taken the photo, right?

And I feel like a parent wouldn't take a photo like that if they were freaking out.

** I agree that she would have to be at least somewhat "fun" (if not quite as much fun as James). She would have to have a sense of humor to be attracted to someone like James. If she found him obnoxious rather than funny, their relationship wouldn't last more than two seconds. She appears to have been popular and well-liked, and you don't become popular and well-liked if you don't have a sense of humor. Slughorn also described her as charming and "cheeky."

Unfortunately, the books put Lily on a pedestal, and fanfiction sort of makes this worse.

We're well aware of James' flaws, but we don't really get that kind of depth for Lily. Snape's memories give us more information, but she's still sort of this perfect moral figure. Even if you can forgive JKR for not fully fleshing out a character who died before the story began, some writers do more to reinforce the idealized version of Lily than to complicate it.

Sirius states that James "grew up" and /then/ Lily came around to him. I think some people reverse those two events, and present Lily as the person who basically nagged James into being a grown up.

I think of Lily as someone who's fun and likable at the best of times, but more emotional and neurotic than James.

** I'd honestly say it's more due to projection than anything else. The sense that Lily didn't enjoy James' sense of humor when young, but they grew to a happy medium by the time they were 20, makes more sense. However, many authors (many of whom are teens or young adults) will project what they know of parents or shoehorn them into easy tropes. This is why you get a mix of stories, many where Lily is a perfect loving mother with basically no flaws and quite a few where Lily hates fun. Most good stories avoid these simplifications.

** i think it's based mostly on lily being characterised as the one that has to browbeat james into maturing, which takes its basis from their canon scene and from what jkr's said directly

*** Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that she would disapprove with fun, just that she would keep him in check. Considering that he could be a bully when he wanted, he definitely did need that.

But people will be people, and people will conflate statements.

*** I would guess that it isn't a serious story, is it?

But wow, a strip version of a game I've never heard of nor played before. I don't know if it takes imagination or being bored.

On a random note, since it seems like a weird crossover, is the story actually good or not really?

**** Actually, it is a pretty serious story.

On the plus side, the language is excellent.

On the minus side, it looks like it will never be complete.

On the plus side, the general idea is pretty cool.

On the minus side, it features the most ridiculously overpowered 12 year old Hermione I've ever seen.

On the plus side, the crossover elements are well thought-out, with elements taken from one canon used to explain things and events seen in another.

On the minus side, characters seem rather OOC, even when there's a good explanation for that.

You get the idea. :)

** I think it's reflex. What is Lily's role in the story? Being "the" mother, her sacrifice saved the world, blah blah blah.

I think everyone projects a bit (or a lot) of their own mother into Lily, given how readers tend to identify with the protagonist.

Was a typical reader's mother once a teenage girl? Surely. Does the reader know them in that way? No. What they know is being scolded for eating too many sweets, to remember to take a jacket (I'm 32 and mom still tells me to get a jacket whenever she sees me) and just generally a huge blob of nurturement, guilt, safety and emotional manipulation.

And that's why Lily is mostly written as a party pooper. Plus the canon hints.
