I came across a quote today, "Doing the wrong things for the right reasons.", and now I want a fic where Harry embodies that. I'm looking for fics where Harry consistently does the wrong thing, again and again and again, in order to protect those he cares about. He's evil, knows that he is evil, and is determined to focus his evil actions towards a good outcome. I would like fics where he is *alone* in this, unless he has someone as his own version of Bellatrix.

I've already read The Sum of Their Parts, and it's not quite what I'm looking for. That Harry fell into doing evil gradually, and could never truly be said to be an evil *person*, simply ruthless and driven. I'd like to see a story where Harry willingly fell onto a dark path and now feels he can't escape it or doesn't deserve to, but he can at least ensure others don't have to fall to his level.

Harry doesn't have to be the main pov, but I do prefer it if he is. No bashing, no colossal age-gap relationships, and no smut.

Thanks.


** I'm playing around with one of those right now. He's a right bastard who is incapable of truly empathizing with others. He is killing off Hogwarts students non-stop. He goes after blood purist not because it's right. He does it as they all owe him a debt paid with death for taking his parents from him. Eventually it keeps growing, as they draw in reinforcements of dark creatures he starts on genocide in retaliation.

It starts with him getting Petunia drunk and staging her suicide.

** Those are so often bad, but when they're good they're REALLY good. I'll see what I can find. Is abandoned OK, or complete only?

Meanwhile, here's linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) by Voice of the Nephilim. Might not be quite what you want and takes place over a short period of time, but it's well-written, it has a darker Harry, and he's very much alone.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

This fic has some of it. Harry is broken and honestly thinks he is bad but does and continues to do it anyway. The other charahters don't face much problem. It is Hermione's POV story. It has time travel and HHr and they don't get together till they are 21 on Hermione's insistence.

Give it a try.
