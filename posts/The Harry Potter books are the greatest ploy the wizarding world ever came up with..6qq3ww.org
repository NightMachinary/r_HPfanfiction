What would happen if the wizarding world just came out into the open without any warning? Nothing good to be sure, and they know it. Yet, they know that with the increase in muggle surveillance and availability of information it's only a matter of time.

So, what did they do? They already told us about their world. Almost ever muggle knows all about the wizarding world and its recent history thanks to what everyone ignorantly thinks are books of fiction. Really, they're all pretty much true, and now, when they do come out into the open, they will be welcomed like a well-loved fantasy come to life and embraced by a huge portion of the population without hesitation.

I'm pretty sure all the founders would have been proud of this particular plot, right?


** Yes, this is a viable theory. The Books were a MoM disinformation and PR campaign. Those involved also made billions off those gullible Muggles.

Although the outcome and several major events were not altered, the actual details of the War were however very different. The winners, as usual, painted themselves as absolutely righteous, while completely vilifying their enemies.

**** The 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul.

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books often fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. The Trio, almost or exceeding the political skills of Octavian (the most famous case of a trio of teenagers seizing power), eventually earned legitimacy by improving the lives of most wizards and witches in Britain.

****** 'Bad Dursleys' was just a ploy to drum up reader sympathy for the protagonist. It's an often used trope in children or YA literature, for example Cinderella, Snow White, and Huckleberry Finn.

In my current version of the 'real story', there was no Petunia Dursley, but a certain Violet Evans-Kirkland who tried hard to give her nephew a decent childhood. But raising a magical child was challenging and frustrating, she and her husband indeed lost temper a few times. After the Books were published, they were of course less than pleased with how their fictional counterparts were depicted. Fortunately, with the Billions they were making off the Muggles, a few million pounds compensation was enough to keep them silent.

** You could apply this same thought experiment to /Star Wars/, /Star Trek/, etc. if you wanted. Aliens are real; they're just waiting to reveal themselves until we've sufficiently absorbed enough sci-fi to be prepared for them.

If your theory is correct, I suspect the wizards / witches won't actually reveal themselves until the kids that grew up reading /HP/ have grown up and displaced the baby boomers as the dominant generation. I mean, the wizards aren't /stupid/. They saw the controversies, book burnings, etc. that happened when the series first came out. They want to wait until the "Harry=Satan" crowd has died out, so they can be sure that the majority of Muggles will welcome them.

** I had a plot idea about something like this.

Rob throws an SI to another version of earth. From a first person perspective he doesn't see much different so lives his life normally.

They have different movies and fiction. SI gets this idea to take what he knows is successful from his own world and release it on this one to rake in the cash.

Harry Potter book 1 gets him a visit from the local ministry where he finds out that he's a squib so he's technically allowed to know about magic. Since he didn't know and the local office is very reasonable they let him get away with it just this once.

SI decides to see if a squib can be a decent wizard without a wand and picks up potion making, runes, etc... and with various workarounds finds that you don't actually need a wand to do a lot of things.

**** That's where the "with various workarounds" comes from.

Maybe he comes across or invents a rune scheme that absorbs ambient magic and invents a ritual which forms a catalyst that can be affixed to the base of a wand. When combined with a potion that he also invents, a Mana Potion, it lets squibs actually cast spells with a wand. Each spell itself eats up some mana potion to make up for the magic that the squib lacks and a squib can still only cast ~10 or so per day or resting period. Call a squib wand a Magician's Rod or something.

Maybe he has a theory and manages to cultivate a new magical ingredient that can be used in potionmaking to remove the requirement of a wand. Every potion using it would have to be original since it would be the start of a new branch of potions. It would also be slightly controversial since there's nothing that would prevent a muggle from brewing these potions.

Maybe something else. Creativity is endless.

Think about it, in a world controlled by pureblood purists, they hatch a cunning plan to rid the world of muggles, who have been growing more and more of a problem with their rapid advancements in technology. So they hatch a cunning plan, and take us all when we are relaxed and excited about this world which was only our fantasy a few days prior.
