I've been looking for one SS/HG fanfic for a while but I cannot remember the name. I read it last year so the details are foggy. It's annoying that I can't find it.

I remember it was pretty lengthy and it was the author's take on the marriage law trope. What I can remember is that they spent a significant amount of time in grimmauld place on holidays and breaks and had a lot of sex there (everywhere tbh). Hermione was like Snape's - rather forced - partner in crime. Hermione is in her sixth year. I know that is basically every ss/hg but any help would be appreciated.

(It's not 'clash of the conjurers', 'bound to him' or 'pet project' but it's pretty similar)


** Could it be Care of Magical Creatures or Saving Your Life?

*** It is not Care of Magical Creatures, I've read that one. And it can't be Saving Your Life because I haven't read that one. I'm interested though. Who's the author and what is it about? Thank you for answering!!<3

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

** Pet Project is the one where her hair sparks blue

The rest of it is not Pet Project - there is no Marriage Law in it

*** Yeps, i've re-read Pet Project very recently. Thank you though!! <3 maybe I'll take out the blue sparks from the question, it is misleading(although I think the fic I'm looking for has the same thing, or similar)
