Pairings in the Summary is fine if the story is just romantic fluff, or clearly dedicated to just one pairing. It is not okay when the story tries to have any form of romantic drama, or doubt, or any form of suspense. Surely I'm not the only one who thinks this?


** Sometimes I do think that it's nice to have the pairing in the summary, especially when it's not clear at all in the story. Some people just aren't interested in certain pairings, for example I will not read Hermione/Severus because it just really grosses me out and it will immediately turn me away from a story, no matter how well written it is. I also won't read incest, either. So, if the pairing is quite integral I think it should be referenced. Also, if the pairing is referenced, they should note if it is a romance or a friendship/family fic. If someone just writes Fred/George pairing, then it sounds like an incest fic. But if they say that it's a friendship/angst fic, then it changes it completely and instead you find a beautiful fic of George mourning Fred (I found one once, I cried).

But, on sites like ff.net or aff.net, where you search fics and can select the pairing, then putting a pairing in the summary is a waste of characters. The site inputs that information below with chapters, words, etc. Already people are looking for a more specific fic, so it's unnecessary to write down the pairing in the summary.

If there's no pairing, then there is no pairing. They shouldn't have to reference that.

I think it's become like a "warning" for some people. Like "warning: contains violence", but instead it's "warning: contains Dumbledore/Dudley lovefest". Some people just don't care for certain pairings. Sometimes people need to be a little clear as to what their fic contains because it's not everyone's cup of tea. But, as I said, if the site already does that for you, then they shouldn't be putting their pairings in the summary.

That's just my opinion and I wholly respect OP's as well. I understand it can be annoying, but I also understand why some people put them in the summary. I guess I'm a little neutral in that I don't let it bother me too much. I always go by the summary anyway, and the first chapter, and the pairing usually comes last to me. If the first chapter sucks, I don't care if it's my favourite pairing or not, I won't continue.

So, in the end, sites should just ask authors to input their pairing like ff.net and that way they're not too in your face, you, the reader, can specify what you want to read, and you can still find fantastic fics without even selecting a pairing and just searching "All".

Sorry for the wall of text. I tend to write too much at times.

*** You raise good points. I think if it's slash or incest, there should be a warning saying that, but not who it is involved. As for disliked pairings, the only two I dislike are ones involving Snape or Draco, so I usually filter them out on fanfiction.net.

**** I think it's a terrible idea for pairings to not be in the summary at all. People should be able to search for or filter out pairings if they want. An option to disable display of pairings if you want a bit of mystery would be cool, though.

***** That's exactly what I mentioned in my above post. The site should provide pairing categories to be filled out when someone posts. They select the pairing and it automatically filters the pairing in the system once the fic is posted. This way, we won't have to waste good summary space writing down a pairing and it can be filtered for those who are particular about what they read. Sites like ff.net and aff.net are perfect examples of this and I think all general, non-specific fan-fiction sites should follow suit. It makes finding fics easier.

** Gotta disagree. While I agree that it can ruin suspense, I still look at it as required. There are some pairings I despise (anything with Snape, for instance), and some I genuinely want to read about. A Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks fic will get my attention far more than Harry/Ginny for instance.

Being told the pairings just makes it far easier to search out fics that I'd enjoy.

** I don't really mind them as much as I'd like to, since I know the pairing tag is just used to attract potential readers and detract flamers. Remember, ship war are prevalent in every fandoms. Back around 2003-2005, if a Hogwart era fic is unmarked H/Hr, the H/G or H/D shipper will completely tear the writer a new one. Heck, even if its marked, they'll still do it anyway. It got to the point where people were hacking and defacing websites and blogs. So now its mainly a relic of a past era, and just a general warning to the reader

** Nope, I agree. In fact, I personally dislike any kind of warning before the story about the pairings. I only put them at the beginning of mine because a couple of reviewers made an issue of it; apparantly people don't like "surprise" slash (but that's a different rant for a different day, and it really wasn't what I'd call a surprise anyway).

But this whole pairing warning things strikes me as very much a shipper thing. They want to know what they're getting beforehand so they don't have to read something that doesn't have the OTP. It really annoys me because I'm an open-minded multi-shipper who'll read just about anything if it's written well enough. I shouldn't have to ship a pairing before I read it because it's the author's job to write a relationship that is believable. Pairing warnings might make me go "Well that's an odd couple, I don't know if I want to read that" whereas if I only get a summary of the story I'm more likely to read it, and by the time I reach the romance I'm invested enough, and the story should build it up enough, that I just go, "Huh, odd pairing but I can see it working for this story" and carry on.

As you said, the only exceptions should be fluff (or smut) with established relationships because in those instances the reader is clearly expected to already be into the pairing.

Fact: HP isn't gay (and even if he was, he would definitely NEVER go for either Draco or Snape). So if your story is so far removed from canon that I will find stuff like that in it then I think it only fair that I get a fair warning so I can avoid bullshit like that.

**** Yeah, sure it's not like Harry spent an entire book obsessing over a boy. It's not like he repeatedly mentioned Sirius' attractiveness in 'Snape's Worst Memory'.

Oh, but wait, he only (outwardly) crushed on girls in the books, which of course showed absolutely every tiny little detail of his life, and he got married to a woman so /obviously/ that means he can only be straight. Not like bisexuality isn't a thing.

Fact: HP is a fictional character in a book series with no queer representation (and if you say Dumbledore I will reach through the internet and bitch slap you) and centuries of scholars have proven that literature is OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. So if I want to step away from the suffocatingly heteronormative society that I live in and interpret Harry as queer, then I bloody well will.

As for being removed from canon, the fic I mentioned involved Harry selling his soul to a demon at the age of seven, starting at Hogwarts a year late with only a handful of staff members and two students even knowing he was Harry Potter, and he was sorted into Slytherin. If someone can handle that much divergence from canon, which any sensible person is going to realise will create a Harry with significant personality difference, then they can suck it up that the main character falls in love with a boy.

***** I don't mind that slash exists because "to each their own." I treat it just like Hurt Comfort. I avoid because it's not my bag. I wish stories could be separated by slash and Het so people could find what their looking for easier.

The only pairing I cannot stand and get upset about is Cannon based (Volde killing Harry's parents) Harry being nice or hooking up with Voldemort. Just can't fathom tht

****** Agreed. For both sides, there are ships that is workable, and those that are completely stupid. For the het, Hr/Sirius, Hr/Regulus, Hr/Snape, Hr/Lupins, Hr/Lucius, etc... is 100% what the fuck? Also, anything with Voldemort, aside from maybe One Sided Bellatrix/Voldemort.

Ships like H/Hr, H/D, R/S, etc... are largely written back around the PoA to OOTP, so there are no clearly defined relationships and its up to the author's intepretation.

- H/Hr is because Hermione is the only female character Harry has any interaction with on a significant basis up until OOTP where Ginny went full 180 on her characterization.

- H/D is because Foe Yay, why not? kind of thing. And the shippers would like to interpret the bickering as UST, although I don't really agree with that.

- R/S and any other BoyxBoy (boy, not man here) ship largely comes from the whole boarding school, boys only dormitory thing. Plus, the Severus/Lily and Remus/Tonk ship hasn't been revealed yet, so there is space to interpret the relationships in the MWPP era.

He was obsessed, not by Draco, but by death eater activity in Hogwarts. And given several assassination attempts made during the year, he had very good reasons to be suspicious. Had he not seen Draco act all suspicious on the train he wouldn't have given a single fuck about him. And guess what: he was right, Draco was a death eater!

I'm not saying it doesn't make sense in context or that you can't write whatever you want. But I am saying that if your story features certain non-normative topics like slash, incest, rape, adultery, bashing, extreme gore and violence or other things of that nature you might want to give a heads up so people can either specifically look for those stories if they want or (like me) avoid them entirely.

You don't have to spoil the exact pairing per se if you're building it up as a surprise for the reader, just mention that "this story contains slash" is enough of a heads-up.

But it is non-normative!! Heterosexuality is the norm and everything else is, by definition, not the norm. That's how norms work.

If you're saying that gay people are distressing and triggering then yes I fucking well am. We are not blights upon society, we are not abnormal /things/ that should be hidden away from other people. When you say we're an extremely bad issue equivalent to RAPE and MURDER then you're saying we're not human and that is NOT fucking okay.

I will not discuss this further. It's my birthday and I should not have to spend it telling some wanker that who I am, and people like me, are just as fucking normal as heterosexual people.

Being the most common by a margin of 95% (if Wikipedia is to believed) is the same as being the default. It just is, there is not a single definition of statistics that would ignore such an overwhelmingly large percentage as anything but the standard behaviour of that group. So by definition, everything that falls outside this group is an outlier.

Now before you start on another overemotional and baseless rant: being an outlier simply means you aren't like the median of said group. This does not necessarily means it is "bad", just that it's different. For example: Einstein wasn't of "normal" intelligence either, but nobody claims this is a bad thing. Similarly being homosexual isn't the expected orientation for humans. Whether you think this is "good", "bad" or merely a curiosity to notice is entirely up to the individual.
