I'm curious because Hermione seems so easy to put together with anyone, male or female. The options are endless!


** I don't think that Hermione is "easy to put together with anyone," as you say. The opposite, actually. I feel that Hermione has a very grating personality actually, one that could easily come off as arrogant.

She is /very/ quick to criticise other's information if it's even the slightest bit wrong, Harry and Ron included. Take the "Wingardium Leviosa" lesson- Ron was seriously struggling, and so Hermione tried to help him. We (the readers) know that she was just trying to help, but Ron? He (understandably) misunderstood her intentions.

I don't have the book with me, but I remember her having a very "/Ahkshually/" way of trying to help.

Yes, that's only in the first book, and people change. But I don't recall Hermione actually changing in that respect. After the troll later that day, Harry and Ron very quickly befriended Hermione, and friends often ignore the parts of their friends they don't like in favor of the parts that they do.

Admittedly, I've gotten a bit off-topic here, so I'll try to get back on track. Maybe Ginny? They both seem to be good friends, and Ginny is supposedly an argumentative person (I can't remember if the text supports that- I believe that JKR had to clarify), and Hermione would most likely prefer someone who would be able to hold an argument with her that would require her to think.

*** I think this only holds true if you go out of your way to keep personalities canon. In fanfic, you have license to change anything you want, keeping in mind of course that going too far from canon just means you'll be writing original fiction in a Harry Potter skin. But a lot of fanfic--regardless of how good it is--does stray from canon in /plausible/ ways, imo, that could reasonably result in changes in personality that would, for example, make Hermione more compatible with a wider range of relationships.

** Luna. It wouldn't be a happy couple, but it would be fun to watch Luna slowly drive Hermione insane.

As an honest answer; I think Ron is the only one who can stand to be Hermione's significant other. Most characters find her nagging and argumentative nature difficult to bear. Ron seems to be the only one who responds positively to it.

**** From Angua's essay on the Sugar Quill:

#+begin_quote
  Ron, from early in Book One, is nettled and infuriated by Hermione's talkativeness and argumentativeness, and cannot resist responding to her verbal challenges, even at times when he is supposedly “not talking to her” (SS115/154, SS115/155, PA175/236, PA203/275). Harry can ignore or avoid Hermione to escape her arguments, but Ron consistently rises to her bait. In the classic comedic tradition, he finds the challenge irresistible, leading to Ron and Hermione -- as Harry puts it -- “always having a go at each other” (OP21/235). Being talkative himself, and from a large family of verbally aggressive people, Ron is not put off by Hermione's talking style the way Harry is. Like Hermione, Ron is surprised and offended in Book Five when Harry says their arguments are annoying (OP212/235). Like Hermione, Ron gets so wrapped up in their bickering that he becomes oblivious to their surroundings and Harry has to shush him (SS116/156 and 117/157, GF460/531) or he is surprised by a teacher (GF446/514). And, like Hermione, Ron can frequently be seen enjoying their contests of verbal one-upmanship. He has the quick wit and comic timing to match Hermione in her verbal aggressiveness, to tease her, to play Benedict to her Beatrice. Ron enjoys it, at least part of the time. Harry, obviously, doesn't.

** Hermione is rather difficult to match with anybody. Luna, Fleur and Tonks could work well, if you go with opposites attract and have Hermione be a little hormone driven. Once they get through the initial clash of thinking methods (alcohol can help there, or being forced to spend a lot of time together), they could get along nicely.

Alternatively, someone studious could work, let's say Padma Patil or Penelope Clearwater. Not nearly as much potential for sexual tensions, but at the same time a lot less complicated.

Luna becomes a little more grounded, Hermione a little less tight and they apply the scientific method to Luna's animals, going onto expeditions in the Forbidden Forest while dismissing the more nonsensical ones.

Hermione has a very grating personality, as someone else remarked, and I don't think it's easy coming up with a good match for her unless going with an opposites attract approach.
