  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** I can't remember the name and am trying to find it, but it was on AO3. Harry kills the Dursleys and makes it look like a Death Eater attack and flees to get away from the manipulative Order post Order of the Phoenix.
