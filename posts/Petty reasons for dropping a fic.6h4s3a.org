What are some minor things that make you drop a fic?

I'm not talking stuff like terrible summaries (child of magic named Aster, anyone?). I'm talking about stuff where everyone calls Hermione 'mione', or where backstory is given on Badass!Harry and in it Ron turned Death Eater and killed Hermione, and this information has nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the fic.

Personally I don't like fics that try to throw in Hermione as a friend for no reason. Harry runs away from the Durselys and vows to master his Magic? He stays with the Grangers. Becomes a Slytherin and is friends with Malfoy and the others? He purposely becomes friends with Hermione.

It's even worse if they throw in Ron bashing. I didn't much like Ron when I first started reading fanfiction, but after a certain point you get sick and tired of constant Ron bashing.


** 1. Hermione and Ron randomly abandoning Harry after fourth year because they don't believe Voldemort came back. WTF???

2. Sirius and/or Remus constantly calling Harry "pup" or "cub" or sickeningly cute nicknames. Ew.

3. Hermione is a goddess that can do no wrong ever, while Ron is Literally Hitler. I liked her in canon because she makes mistakes.

4. In bad Dark!Harry slash fics: Voldemort is redeemable despite killing Harry's parents, while Dumbledore is not because he sent Harry to the Dursleys. HAHAHA STOP BEING SO EDGY.

This could /totally/ be done right, though.

Think about it:

- Quirrell has Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head; but do Hermione and Ron ever see it first hand?
- Voldemort's "memory" is the heir of Slytherin and possessed Ginny. But do Hermione and Ron have any /real/ proof that Harry, the Parselmouth, wasn't using that as a cover?

It might actually be interesting to see someone take a breath and break down how ridiculous Harry's stories (albeit, the readers know they're true) sound and to decide he's actually a liar.

Not only could it be well done, but it would be interesting to see both Harry's and one of the Golden Trio's POVs for the aftermath.

**** You know what, it totally could. But the probably with writing an canon divergence is that it has to be consistent with canon up to that point. So if an author decided to tackle a full AU with skeptical characters and less-than-supportive friends, starting from Year 1 Day 1, it could be done realistically.

Most people just start from Year 5 and have the characters behave OOC... I can handle OOCness, but it has to be consistent within the universe the author has set up.

And Remus is a werewolf (yet managed to keep it secret from all his students except Hermione for almost a full year). /Why/ have them call Harry "pup" or "cub" every other sentence?

** Intrusive religion. When the entire Weasley family burst into prayer, that's so totally AU as to not only kill suspension of disbelief, but to nuke it from orbit.

#+begin_quote
  "I think we should pray for Neville and Dean and Seamus," Ron blurted. He looked around earnestly, trying to fight back the tremble in his voice, but he noticed that his hands were shaking slightly. He wondered if he'd ever be able to really play quidditch now. The healers said the cursed nerve damage was permanent."

  "Why don't you do it, Ron," dad said quietly, looking at his youngest son with pride.

  "For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen," Charlie said quietly. The rest of the family looked at him in shock. He shrugged. "Well, I guess I found more than dragons in Romania. They're a bit keener on church there than we are here. Not going to make a big deal about it, but I'll be praying for all of us a bit harder now."

There were a few other minor mistakes here and there that read as the author pulling information about Britain from wikipedia and sprinkling it throughout the story.

But I was trying to stick it out because the concept did interest me. Your petty reason for dropping it actually gave me a decently petty reason for doing the same!

Not necessarily. I was christened by my 100% atheist parents, mostly because that was how it was done back then. It was expected, I guess it is a cultural thing. Non-Christians get married in churches all the time.

** Yeah, I also greatly dislike when authors try to bend a story to fit in a canon character that would have /nothing/ to do with Harry, given any logical chain of events. Hermione is just the prime example as she seems to /always/ become friends with Harry.

I'm pretty fast to drop a fic if I so much glance at "magical exhaustion", "magical core" or similar shackles on the HP magic system. Its a dumb concept originating from Dungeon and Dragons that was originally a (necessary) gameplay mechanic, not a common trope in fantasy novels, believe it or not. Novels are not RPG games. Therefore, having a "Mana" system is unnecessary and dumb.

Oh, and here's another one: Summer at the fucking Grangers.

*Fuck the Grangers.*

I have yet to see a fic where the Grangers aren't these nerve-grating goody-two-shoes/stereotype parents/plot devices. Emma and Dan, the two dentists living in a neighbourhood, driving a car and living a life /that is just about that little.... that little but significant margin better than the Dursley's/. You know. Because we don't already know the Dursleys are horrible people. We also need to make them less good people by giving the better people more material wealth and specifically point that out - /BUT IT FEELS LIKE ITS MORE HOMEY!/. Oh, and Emma frowns seeing Harry's clothes. Poor boy. Lets go on a shopping trip - make that fashion bu-bu a bit better. You need to look good before you impregnate my daughter! After all, Emma /sees/ the sexual tension between her 15 year old daughter and the 14 year old poor poor Dragon-Slayer and Conqueror of Basilisks - because /fuck me/, of course Harry tells those stranger Grangers all about himself /on the first night/. But *RAWR*, I'm the father of Hermione and I'm gonna make you pay should you hurt her, you reality-distorting child-soldier. RAWR RAWR fathers are always so protective about their daughters and it is /natural law/ that they cannot help but try to antagonize and intimidate possible suitors. But yeah, sure, lets have you stay with us for the entire summer. "Hermione bought a new bikini." Emma said and winked and nudged. "I also bought the wedding dress. She'll be looking gorgeous in it!"

Just.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!

At any point after CoS any real intimidation would be probably met with a calm or angry (depending on Harry's mood) version of: "You're no basilisk you moron, go away"

Harry isn't even scared of Malfoy Sr. (who he believes to be a murderer), do you think he would care about threats from a dentist?

Ans yeah, magical exhaustion is dumb, especially if you don't define magic further. Maybe you have a real magical system worked out, I can live with that (even if I dislike it)!

*** I honestly believe that magical cores can work if the author actually puts time and effort into making them work. If it's left as some sloppily slapped together explanation, then it will often appear as generic, bland, or any other synonym for the word. It's up to the author to make a trope seem unique and fresh. Every fic or book will be littered with tropes, they just have to be redefined.

In the current fic I am writing, which I will not link as I don't want to self-promote as I feel bad about it, I have handled magic in a way that is rather unique, at least in my eyes.

Normal magic is almost limitless. It is depended on your emotion and your mental strength. If you have the will, power, and mindset to do it, you could levitate a house for hours before dropping it due to a lack of concentration -- not a depleted core, despite the fact it's written as the same thing. I have used the system and then worked around it in a manner that masks the intent. This stops wizards from becoming godlike and holds everyone to a different level.

However, magic itself, in my fic, has been expanded to a massive level, there's more than one branch. Each branch has its own rules, laws, and customs.

Death Magic, one of the more powerful branches, chips away at your life expectancy for each spell you cast. The Killing Curse is essentially Death Magic and those who cast it are slowly killing themselves. Necromancy, which requires the undead. Black Magic, which is the art of creating Horcruxes and other vile things. Vampiric Magic (a more powerful branch of necromancy). And many people systems.

I completely went off-topic... Oops.

** Half of the reasons in this thread aren't even petty! So mine:

1. Disclaimers that are more than one line long, or authors trying to be cute/funny in the disclaimer. Don't care how good the fic is; I'm gone. You don't even need disclaimers! But if you insist, can you just keep it short and get it over with?

2. Repeated info at the start of every chapter. Why do some authors put the pairing, rating, status, etc, at the start of every single chapter? Maybe this is a Livejournal thing, and it just gets copied over when fics get reposted? Whatever it is, it makes me crazy.

3. Fancy scene breaks. What's wrong with just a simple line of one or two repeated characters? Some people use, like, weird unicode symbols, entire words, strange patterns, etc. It's distracting; stop it!

4. Author's notes that are sometimes half the chapter. If you must include them, keep them to one or two lines at most. If you need to answer reviews or something, you can do that in your profile, on a forum, or...anywhere but in the author's notes, really.

Those are some extremely petty reasons for dropping a fic. And sometimes, if a fic is something I'm really, really loving, I'll download it and edit out the things I hate. But it needs to be really good for me to bother.

**** I don't mind that myself. I'd rather know that the author doesn't want feedback for some reason (doesn't care, is just writing for her own amusement, whatever) than go to the bother of giving unwanted feedback that the author doesn't care about. Writing for fun, and then sharing that just in case it amuses anyone else, is a perfectly OK thing to do. But I do like knowing up front that the author is writing what she likes, and if anyone else likes it too, that's just a bonus. It changes how I approach the story. Also, some of these stories can be really good! Authors who write to satisfy themselves exclusively often have the guts to do controversial things that authors who care deeply about reviews and feedback would never be able to try. Sure, sometimes these controversial things are awful failures, but sometimes they're really amazing successes, and sometimes the failures are extremely interesting. However it comes out, seeing strange and different things tried is always neat.

My most Petty reason however, emphasis on the petty is when the summary talks about the truth. Whenever AU is written we deviate from the truth that is supplied by canon. That's fine, I'm a big AU fan but to calling it the truth when the Weasley are only out to steal Harry's money all while Harry is really a centaur from Pluto who's real father was magic itself grates. I wouldn't want to read about space centaurs anyway but call it the truth and I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot barge pole.

In the way of dumb tropes, while I can even enjoy bashing fics if the author is just exaggerating bad qualities of a character to hyperbolic proportions, there are some characterizations I cannot take.

Good Voldemort and the Nibblers? no, just no.

Good Draco? Fuck no, the kid was a genuine sadist all his life and writing him as a good person makes my skin crawl just as much as redeeming him just due to him lacking the stones to back up his evil in canon did.

Good Snape I can find more tolerable if its well done, or if they just make him funny. I'm personally want a fic where Snape is made into a Krieger from Archer type character.

Manipulative Dumbledore is done to death, but I can still tolerate it. I cannot however tolerate Bond Villain Dumbledore. If he wanted to take over magical Britain, he could have done it decades ago. Writing him that way is and will always be stupid.

Aside from that, throwing in random, out of character nonsense to ruin the primary relationship will make me drop a fic (though Darth Mars has repeatedly waited until the final chapter to do so, and its kinda hard to drop then.)

** Okay, I'm a bit strange because I do like some crackfics and half the tropes you guys hate, so I'll just give what I can think of.

1) epilogues. I really hate them. "And then your heros grew old and died, the end" is shitty. Sure, close the story but leave a little room for imagination at least.

2) powerful!Harry still lives with the dursleys who hate him without him turning them into pureed meat. Move out? Sure. Feed them potions to make them like him? Why not. Imperious curse? Sure. Many ways to get around that.

3) a reasonably smart Harry still takes and stays in divination, despite it being entirely useless.

4) major characters dying by the troll or basilisk.

*** This one is hit or miss for me. In a cannon divergence where Harry was raised by loving guardians and isn't feeling the sting of not having parents as much, I can buy him not having his birth father as his protector. However, when his is randomly a dragon or some other nonsense for no good reason other than "omg he's so powerful" then it's probably a symptom of a lot of other things that are wrong and it's probably time to close the fic.

*** I don't mind if it isn't a stag, but if it's some bullshit like a Pheonix or a Thestral than I close. If you want to give someone a Pheonix or Thestral patronus, give it some background. Like, if Harry was trained by Dumbledore and always has pure intentions about things, I could see him having a Pheonix patronus. But he would also probably be an idiot.

nah, it doesn't. james was using scourgify to choke him, and that was a continuation of years of relentless bullying. this is also something that people continuously do- conflate james and the marauders. james is one person, the marauders are more than one people who singled out and bullied snape for years

******* Yeah, James and his friends were bullies. Yes, this factored heavily in Snape developing into such a horrible person.

However you can't just absolve Snape of all his ill deeds. As you grow up you have to deal with your own shit, no matter who shoveled it onto your plate. Snape being a violent ass as an adolescent? Totally the fault of his upbringing and bullies. Snape being an abusive teacher and ass as an adult? His fault for not dealing with all his issues, regardless of who treated him badly.
