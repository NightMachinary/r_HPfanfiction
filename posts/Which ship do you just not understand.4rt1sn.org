Honestly for me, Snape/Hermione. They have almost no positive interactions in the series, and it's pretty unambiguously statutory rape. Any other ships you guys(or girls) can just never wrap your head around?


** While I'm pretty vanilla in ships I like, there are very few I can't understand the appeal of. Voldemort is one, but then again I imagine there are some good Voldemort/Bella fics out there. I don't like student/teacher, but the appeal of those relationships is as old as time. I don't like Sirius/Remus, but, again, I see why people would want to pair them together. I don't get people that say they ship Harry/Daphne or Astoria though. I mean, just say you ship Harry/standoffish OC.

Also, I realized that most, if not all, major and supporting characters that survived was paired with someone. There are times I wish people could understand that some people are happy being alone, for once.

I wouldn't blame JK if even 19 years later, Hermione is still focused on her career. I see her as the 'married to her job' type of woman tbh.

*** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]]

I'm a BIG Snarry fan and this is pretty much my favorite Snarry fanfiction, and one of my favorite fanfictions ever.

It's incredibly in-character and follows ALL the books while using the most clever time-travel I've ever come across in the background to save Harry's life over and over and over - so we end up getting the BOOK canon while all the manipulation of events is featured in this fic.

However, the Snarry starts when the fic reaches book 5 and the story becomes incredibly sad, dark and angsty from then on rather than the hilarious, funny tale it was up to the end of year 4.

It's absolutely BRILLIANT and just so clever. The build up is realistic and touching and I've YET to come across another use of time travel as smartly written as this one, WHILE remaining in canon for the books (except of course, Snarry eventually happening!)

**** I agree, this is a fantastic fic. Really compulsive reading, brilliant handling of the time-travel concept, excellent, acerbic, bitterly funny Snape POV, seemingly effortless sense of humor, and so much skill evident in the way the fic gradually darkens and prepares readers for the truly poignant moments and the UST. This writer is amazing, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if she goes on to publish professionally. Or if she's already a published author in RL.

A couple of times I did want to grab a red pen and scribble "NOPE" alongside scenes that hit the wrong notes in an otherwise virtuoso performance, but they don't affect the Snarry content at all.

I'd give this one a chance even if you don't like Snarry, because it's just that good.

*** Seconding Rapture. What a beautiful fic. It's impossible for me to narrow down all my favorites to a single "best," but Rapture is definitely near the top.

** The ones I like are because I find the characters (or actors, I'll be honest) interesting. Which is why I enjoy Lucius, Snape, Remus, Sirius fics (various pairings)...because I love those actors and I just enjoy imagining why they were the way they were. Same why I like Luna in the stories...she was an interesting character. I also like Marauder fics for similar reasons. They aren't characters we got a ton of detail about from the books so I like reading stories authors come up with.

I generally don't like Ron/anyone because his character/actor just never did anything for me. Good character, but I personally don't need to delve more into it. I especially can't stand canon Ron/Hermione fics; he and Hermione were never right for each other IMO.

I also got enough of Harry from the books so I don't usually feel like reading him when I'm reading FF.

Draco is meh, don't mind him in fics but haven't read any with him as the main man. Voldemort wouldn't bother me but I don't like especially dark fics, and anything not dark feels too AU for me.

** For me it's Albus/Greater Good. And yes, I know that strictly speaking it is not a ship, but some writers do take it far enough that it technically can be treated as one.

** Anyone/Scorpius Malfoy. Just cause he is the only named child who isn't with the weasleys, doesn't mean he should be forced with the weasleys, especially since they haven't even interacted.

Mostly it is Rose/Scorpius and it is just idiotic because apparently she must beat him in tests cause of what her father said. (I haven't been following cursed child spoilers, for all I know there could be great character development there, but this has been going on before that, so my point stands)

**** There are a LOT of 'ships I like. Those ones, though, are all rather popular and I don't get them. Some are because the character is not really relationship material--Luna needs psychological help due to PTSD compounded by a father who has his own PTSD--while the other--Ron's--are just because I dislike the character. I don't like the canon romances because they don't work to me, partially because Ginny is the 'first girl wins' trope which has always bugged me and Ron/Hermione is... problematic, in that I've seen that exact same relationship end up with the woman with a broken occipital and brain damage.
