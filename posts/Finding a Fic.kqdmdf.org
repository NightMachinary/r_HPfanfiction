Hi guys!!,

I am looking for a fic where it is the summer after 4th year I believe, and when Harry comes to Grimmauld place, he is different, stronger more handsome, bitter. things like that. some where in that fic I believe that they ( all the children but Ron and Ginny) start smoking pipes. Hermione was I believe smoking a cherry tobacco.

​

Also I'm not sure if it was this fic or not but Hermione was well off in the muggle world and took all the boys (but Ron) shopping for new clothes, Sirius of course under a glamour. They also meet a friend at the top of a parking garage with a car.

​

I do hope someone can help me find these fics
