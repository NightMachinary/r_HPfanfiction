** This is neat.

I don't like 4. It could make sense, it could be developed and have a quality story behind it, whatever. I don't like it.

1 and 2 are both very plausible with how I view canon!HP, and I like 'em both. They've got potential, they're goin' places, kid.

3 seems to be emphatically /not/ HP magic. I mean, it kinda is, but it seems straight out of some other fiction or the premise for a crossover so hard that I don't like it as canon!HP. I wouldn't like a 3fic unless there was just as much new stuff in the other world as there is in HP to begin with.

this is my thinks.

*** ~shrugs~

The idea for number 3 came about after I read a thingy about how apparently according to JK Rowling, magic sort of 'overrides' local laws of physics whenever the two clash. I don't remember where that interview was from, mind...

What are your thoughts on how magic works? Judging by 1 and 2, I'm guessing you favor a 'magic originates from biological chemistry and can be explained by science' or something like that?

**** Ha! No. Magic is not something normal rules apply to, like physics or chemistry or biology. I mean, you can't have a goat and a moose breed a Mooat, but you can have a Hagrid that's half giant. Magic is it's own separate category like in 3, but lacking the whole "other universe it came from" business. I mean, trying to gauge how magical something is would be like trying to measure temperature with a ruler. Not the right units, and not even convertible without a lot of variable/uncertain associations.

*** #4 is the American Gods route. It could be done.

** i've read a fic about the fourth. the icw is infact an organisation that determines what new beliefs people have and create magical theory for it. and they hide the existence of the knowledge that believe is enough to make magic work; but in that it's more personal belief than anything else. voldemort is unbeatable because he believes he is.

*** Huh. That sounds a bit like how the Technocracy from Mage: The Awakening works.

And I think it was a plot point in the epilogue of that one 'Harry gets a computer and starts using memes in his magic' that the way magic works is based on belief of how it works, and the power of Harry's meme-magic came from all the muggles who propagate internet memes.

** My OC is a Muggle who can choose to let (or not let) magic work on her and who can deactivate enchanted objects. She used to work for Arthur Weasley in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office.

I wonder what it'd be like if you took the fourth scenario (magic is semi-phantasmal supported by the belief of humans), and had a main character who was completely magic-proof; spells fail in their presence, various magical creatures are reduced to humans or animals,

I think there's a character in Marvel or DC, I forgot which, who manages to warp reality to completely miss the presence of magic around him. Who was it..?
