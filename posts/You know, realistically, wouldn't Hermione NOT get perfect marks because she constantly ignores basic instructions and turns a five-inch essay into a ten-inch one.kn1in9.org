All of my teachers either take off points for too little writing or too much writing. Wouldn't it be the same?

I've also read a quote that says that if you can't explain this subject to them clearly in the allotted space, then you're showing the teacher that you don't clearly understand the subject. Or, in Hermione's case, she feels that she should ignore her professor's basic and perfectly understandable instructions and write an essay that is /way too long/, causing her teacher more work than is needed.


** Maybe she sticks to the word count during exam essay? I agree tho, she would have points deducted if we use the muggle marking paradigm. Or maybe it was "in no less than 2 feet, explain blablabla", which is just a minimum word count, not a maximum. Wizards aren't well known for being succinct, their library books seem to be very long winded- so maybe they don't have the idea that less is more, and it was quite normal for students to write very long passages?

*** Yeah the idea is very western-muggle centric in the Middle East and India they don't usually have the same less is more or should be able to do it in x ideas. I had to select resumes from India and they are very long and don't stick to the one page convention. Also when you get an answer to a question from a Persian they culturally feel like it is rude not to add lots of rosy embellishments to end up with a long winded response

**** That's really interesting! I had thought about Asian writing but I wasn't sure if I'd made that up that they write quite a lot- I asked my mum (she's Indian) and she said the letters she recieves from India tend to be quite embellished and long (much more so than how the writer actually speaks). Also, the whole Western 'less is more' idea is quite new, they used to write very embellished papers, maybe because it was a privellaged thing to be able to read and write well so the made it as extra as possible to show off

When I saw Hermione exceeding the word count, I thought she was covering for points that may not be in the answer key (or wrong points) by including extra points.

*** I've never had a word count during exam essays? (As assignments, yes, but not during exams).

I've had everything from ones in the US that counted maybe 10% on that exam and ones in the UK that were two exam questions that counted for 100% of my grade for that class. You were expected to manage your time and give relevant information that answered the question. If that took 50 words or 2000, didn't matter.

The actual time of the exam acted as more of a cutoff point than anything. The exams were timed such that a person who knew the topic could write a correct answer, perhaps with a little time left over. So really, someone physically couldn't write extremely long-winded essays because time would run out.

Besides, it seems like a tremendous waste of energy to expect students to count their words in a timed exam.

******* Huh. I've had to take online (math) tests before and I just always hated them. There's just something about math to me that, psychologically at least, make much more sense (and is easier) when done via scribbling on pencil and paper.

Possibly with an entirely written exam it wouldn't be nearly as bad, but (and this is probably nostalgia speaking here) there was just something about being in an exam hall with a bunch of other nervous people, hearing nothing but scribbling and the occasional desperate rub of an eraser, lol, that focused my mind much better than I would think sitting by yourself in front of a computer would be. But again, that could be a generational thing. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

And thanks for saying I'm not a dinosaur, but I'm not so sure about that! I am old enough to have had penmanship/handwriting taught as a separate class. But I guess I am young enough to have been taught typing as a separate class as well, so I guess I'm not on my absolute last legs, lol.

I remember I hated my typing class in school and thought it was a tremendous waste of time. But, in retrospect, it's the only thing that I still use every single day that I learned in high school. (Thanks Mrs Culbert, and a long-overdue sorry for not taking your class more seriously. üòÇ)

****** Ah but then you get in the nighmare that is defining what counts as a "word". One of the first big hurdles in teaching language structure to an AI.

Is it just any string of text followed and preceded by a space or ponctuation? What about hyphens? What about words that are composed of multiple words but only have one meaning?

Are you defining a word grammatically throgh its use in syntax? Morphology? Or what purpose it serves? Is "Wingardium Leviosa" two words - or do we follow that as it refers to a single concept it actually only counts as one? What about derivatives? If "muggle" is one word, would "non-maj" be two? After all it derives from two "words", non magical? If Defense Against the Dark Arts is more than one word, or Room of Requirement counts as multiple, are DADA and ROR only "one"?

******* I feel like the subject also matters tbh. I can see how professors in a field like psychology wouldn't mind longer coursework essays too much as there's a lot to write about the subject, with differing opinions and all that. I majored in finance, and our topics were pretty specific - going over the length in those pretty much means you're cramming bullshit in there to pad the length. We had a few 60+ page essays getting refused for this reason, on a 25-page limit. I can't even imagine how you'd write 60 pages on financial analysis of a single bank's retirement fund services when it's a /solved problem/ that you're pretty much just commenting on.

Turning this onto Hermione's case with Hogwarts, she could probably get away with massive essays on subjects like history, but for something that only has so much to it like a potions assignment or "write a bit about this spell", I feel like the professors would be right in taking grades off for submitting extra length.

You're probably right, though I could imagine a lot of padding coming from discussion historical contexts and hypothetical usages and such. It's not like spellcasting in HP is 'scientific', so I could imagine there being very little functional analysis to write in spellcasting essays.

*** Yeah. It's one thing of the student took the equivalent of a whole paragraph to put down one point in as many versions they could, because you can safely assume a significant amount of it is bullshit

However when that extra length is taken up by explanations and data and references that actually contribute to the essay, you can't write it off as some kid trying to hide that they don't know anything about the subject.

Plus, there's the matter of she likely added in a bibliography/source list after a certain point, which while it doesn't contribute much to the actual content of the essay, it does take up space and serve to allow the teachers to double check her references since they can't exactly check online that she's actually using legitimate, relevant sources.

The reasoning was that by writing more than requested, it was taking the time away from the professors that would normally be used to read and grade other students essays, and that if she didn't stop, they would start deducting points. In the story, they felt she would take the news better from Harry (plus they were too scared to talk to her themselves as she would use logic to back up her reasoning.) If I remember correctly, Flitwick gave the first reason to Harry about her taking it better from him, and Harry came back with how the professors were just to afraid to talk to her themselves.

** Do we ever actually /see/ Hermione's essays in detail in canon?

Sure, Hermione's work /might/ be annoying to read through and mark, but on the other hand, when compared to the typical student's work, I'm sure the professors (except Snape, who hates everyone) would appreciate the effort. The same might be said of the O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. examiners.

All we know from canon is that the teachers often set certain inches' worth of essay (for lengthy writing), but never did we see Hermione complain about getting marked down for too much detail. You'd think that she would indeed cut down her work if it actually got her marked down in the first place.

Hell, Hermione earned 320% on her Muggle Studies essay, and also above 100% in her first-year Charms work (there could've been a theoretical and practical component), which implies that Hogwarts (or the British wizarding culture in general) rewards extra effort and detail.

Basically, canon seems to imply that you don't get marked down for lengthy writing. It might even be the opposite, in that you get bonus points (also, the coursework marks themselves are just a guide. It's only the exams which are actually worth any real marks).

Perhaps the teachers feel that because Hermione writes and studies in so much detail, she would be able to fall back on something when needed in the exams (if she gets caught out). Now compare this to a student who just about scrapes through with their essays or constantly writes mediocre work. If they get caught out in the exam, chances are they'll give a poor or non-existent answer.

Magic is implied to be very much academic as well as practical. So perhaps the typical examiner feels that Hermione is doing the right thing by having so much detail in her head (she doesn't just cram them in at the last moment).

So, realistically, Hermione's marks might depend on region and academic culture. But within the reality of the wizarding world (or at least, in wizarding Britain), Hermione is often rewarded for her extra detail.

The fanon idea that Hermione is some sort of uber-genius incapable of being wrong while the rest of the student body/wizarding population is a bunch of idiots barely capable of holding onto their wands is simply that, a fanon idea. The only other student's homework we really get to see is that of Harry's and Ron's.

Not to mention the fact it is inches instead of word count. Yeah, it's by hand so maybe counting would be impractical if there isn't somehow a spell, but given how much handwriting size can vary, I think it's pretty unlikely to be ‚Äòeveryone write twelve inches exactly' rather than ‚Äòat least twelve inches' (ie, one muggle sheet of regular paper, just about).

--------------

*Theory 1:* Maybe, just maybe, the length specification was a minimum or even just a nonbinding guideline. But that's boring.

--------------

*Theory 2:* Hermione's submissions were technically of the correct length, because she would use the Shrinking Charm on them before turning them in. Using the Engorgement Charm to lengthen one's homework to the required length had long been forbidden, but nobody had bothered to ban the reverse---until Hermione appeared.

With all the turnover on the Hogwarts Board of Directors and the headmaster's position, it wasn't until Hermione graduated that the rules were actually updated.

--------------

*Theory 3:* If the teachers started penalising Hermione for submitting overly long homework assignments, she would instead spend the time working on her magical and political skills and take over the world. That could not be permitted to happen.

Now, if you are referring to the hypothesis that Hermione was getting penalised for overly long assignment submissions throughout her Hogwarts career, I had considered and rejected it based on available evidence. As I explained in another post on this thread, if that were the case, she would correct that in her next assignment, because Hermione is not stupid and likes getting good marks. If she didn't do that, then there couldn't have been a penalty.

Theory 2 is my personal favourite, because it's a zany misapplication of magic and exactly the sort of bureaucratic kerfuffle that a bunch of bumbling wizards in pointy hats who give their children alliterative names and their towns and cities punny ones would create.

  /Her extensive knowledge, especially when it came to knowing which books held the relevant information he needed for his assignments, meant she often saved him a lot of time and energy, but her tendency to go well beyond what was requested by the professors was a habit that just had to be broken, for her own good as well as his. Proof reading a Hermione-written assignment, so that she would read his in turn, was proving to be less than an even trade./

  /Hermione bit her lip, obviously torn by conflicting desires./

  /"But I've already completed it," she said, a sly look appearing on her face. "That's means I'd have to rewrite it, and you know you are always telling me I do that too often."/

  /"Oh, but I am not trying to make you do less than your very best," he said absently, packing up his books. "I'm just trying to convince you to do less, full stop. It should still be your very best, just nothing else."/

I think your opinion on her is very warped by misinformation, and I suggest rereading the books would help with that.

******** Your right she diesnt call lavender a whore that's my mistake she calls her a stupid bimbo He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!' is the quote which also ties into insulting her for her looks

Hypocrisy is still hypocrisy doesnt matter the reason if I preach(talk alot about it not biblical preach) about not manipulating people but then manipulated someone so that they wouldn't commit murder (dont ask where I got those circumstances from) I'm still by definition a hypocrite

I truly think that hermione being jealous didnt help ron and hermiones relationship but that's more of an inference that imo looks obvious but I guess I could be wrong that's chill my points fir the most part still stand however I really wanna quote what you said but I'm typing on phone and playing smash ultimate right now and dont have the time so

That's a movie-only quote.

That's like saying it's hypocritical to hit someone in self defense even though you look down on abusers.

******* I don't recall the book very well, but I'm very sure Hermione didn't call her a whore. And she reacted no worse than Ron reacted to her dating Victor Krum. Or Harry reacting to Dean, that was even dumber.

And...Hermione did think her looks mattered? That's why she wanted her teeth fixed. She just prioritized other things slightly more.

Don't get me wrong, she's a poorly written character who can be annoying. But I wouldn't say she was hypocritical.

*** while i like Hermione, i acknowledge her faults. but how, exactly, did she abuse Ron? because nothing''s coming to mind, other than Ron being a prick trying to make Hermione jealous with Lavender Brown.

that might be at least somewhat my bias towards ron speaking up, though. i pretty much wrote that jackass off in GoF, and his actions in DH pretty much confirmed my poor opinion. to be honest, other than the twins (who i like), i'm generally neutral (Arthur, Bill, Charlie, Ginny) or actively dislike that entire family.

*** I actually read a really good fic when Harry was sent back to the Founders' time and when he came back, he was like eight years older. He then became the new Defense professor (with his husband Salazar) and he told Hermione exactly that. He said that he wouldn't mark her down just this once but every other time that he would start marking her down. The fic is called Gelosa√æ in √âcnesse and here's the link to the first chapter on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896/chapters/5191223]]

** Students that go over the word limit are rightly deducted points. They are allowing themselves special circumstances that the other pupils haven't. Believing somehow that they are entitled to them.

It's actually a sign that they don't know the right answer or how to correctly provide the information required and instead try to fit in every possible bit of information 'just in case'. It shows that a student is able to distinguish between all the information and the vital information when they stay within the word limit.

So basically, Hermione should have been intelligent enough to know better but instead she awarded herself a different set of rules. She should never have gotten perfect marks for an essay twice the size of the limit. There is a skill in providing a proper answer in a smaller context.

** My headcanon is that ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù means you impressed the teacher. In early years, doing extra reading and understanding it without special instruction is impressive. All O's for Hermione there. But by third year she's getting carried by theory and reading and doing most of the practicals competently (like not finishing the Defense final). By fifth year she straight up defers to Harry on Defense. Which makes me think she's great at being able to cast any magic that she can learn, but not as adept at using it on the fly and we don't know if she was ever able to experiment or innovate with magic. Dumbledore is reported to have gotten O's on his exams by doing things with a wand the examiner had never seen before. Voldemort was experimenting with magic before he went to Hogwarts. So, in my head, Hermione (my favorite character, btw) slipped from O's to E's in her sixth year and beyond because she lacked the creative aspect needed for new magic.
