It has recently occurred to me that this situation is true for both the Malfoys & Dursleys. The son is most likely to turn good, if a second the mother, the father only in situations where the other 2 do. So.. Any recommendations where Verron or Lucious is redeemed but not Petunia or Narcissa?


** ohh there is one where Dudley ended up having magic and Vernon just basically goes “Well if he's gonna be a wizard, he might as well be one of the best.” and Petunia starts to despise Dudley. It starts in first year and shows how the dynamics would change and Dudley and Harry at some point start to become really good friends. Fair warning though the fic was abandoned around 2010 or around then though it does have many chapters.

** Linkffn(magical relations) for Vernon, linkffn(prince of slytherin) for Lucius.

But I agree, these are both much more the exception than the rule

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  During the two months she had watched her eight year-old nephews, Marge Dursley discovered that Petunia was a pathological liar, Vernon had somehow been brainwashed by that no good b***h, Dudley was the spawn of Satan, and Harry was actually a good kid.

** A subplot in Linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) is that Lucius is sent to Azkaban and Draco is raised by a tyrannical, abusive Narcissa. I know I've read another one where Lucius is basically just doing Narcissa's bidding; I'll add an edit later if I find it.

** If I remember [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] correctly: Vernon is quite friendly, Petunia still hates Harry, Dudley is pretty completely absent.
