I've never read any fics where the americans come to hogwarts and just act super american. Do they exist, or are they just... fiction.


** Wolf Lord as Harry raised in America. It has had impacts here and there on the story and will have much bigger ones in 1994-1995 school year and onwards. Don't know what you mean by super American though. The story does have vastly different magical society as a fallout of the effects of WW2/Grindelwald in cahouts with literal Hitler.
