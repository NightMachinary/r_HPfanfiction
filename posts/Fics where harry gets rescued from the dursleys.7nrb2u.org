Shortly before the hogwarts letter or well.... after some major abuse? So to say that he does have some physical/emotional scarring from his time in that hellhole....

one that i know of that does this pretty well is The Accidental Animagus... so im looking for similar ones..basicly :3

on a side note... if it develops into a romantic relationship later on (only m/f please ;P ) i would be delighted!


** linkffn(12760426) This is a fem!Harry story and it is pretty new but I like it so far. I am a fan of the author's other works so I am hopeful about this story. Based on their other stories it may end up being femslash.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is a great one, and has a finished sequel. The writing quality is good, and Snape is the one who rescues Harry

linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) is regretfully unfinished, and features a well-developed OC family who takes Harry in. I loved the writing style and have read it multiple times -- definitely worth it. The story shows a bit of Harry's childhood, then jumps to fifth year iirc

linkffn(In Care Of by Fang's Fawn) features an older Harry and definitely pulls at the heartstrings a bit

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** I am writing that kind of story right now but so far only 32k words are written so it is far from complete. In that fic, Sirius arranges for the Tonks family to take Harry in after his third year. It will have an eventual romantic plot, but not with Nymphadora. She takes a sisterly role in this tale.

  After failing to clear his name Sirius was at least able to liberate Harry from the Dursleys. Trusting his cousin Andromeda to take care of his godson might turn out to become the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.

** Linkffn(Innocent by marauderlover7)

This is a great fic (series eventually) where Sirius rescues Harry from the Dursleys' when he's nine and essentially explores the series as what would happen in Harry was a rather well-adjusted boy who had adults to care for him. Also changes include: Malfoy brothers, where Draco is very different from canon. It's one of my favourite fics in the HP universe where about the only qualm I have is that Harry (in his third year, the fourth fic in th series) is a bit too expectant of being in the know - but other than that everyone seems very much of age and IC, which is so refreshing!

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
