There's this story where time travelling Harry Potter possessed Lockhart. In seventh Horcrux, Voldemort possessed Harry Potter. Is there any story where time travelling Harry possessed Dumbledore/Snape/Fudge/Lucius M./any major character? I can't remember the name of the crack where Fudge travelled back. Or even better time travelling Harry Potter possessing Voldemort after 5th/6th year or during '70s?

While writing this, remembered an old story where it had Harry/Narcissa pairing. Now, I was Imagining time-travelling Harry Potter possessing Lucius Malfoy and wooing Narcissa. Would be fun to write a crack!


** Coexistence is a neat story where harry possesses a bunch of different characters.

*** There was a story like that, with the Potter family also having either a young!Harry or another son (young!Harry's brother), who was oblivious to the fact that under James's disguise was TT!Harry.

In fact, I think there were /two/ different stories with a premise like this, both of which I've dropped for various reasons and can't remember their titles ATM.
