I find the subject itself interesting, but given how Snape behaves in canon, I have absolutely no interest in stories where he plays a major role. So are there any stories where Harry or Hermione get into the subject but do not get along with Snape? Preferably with Slughorn or an OC teacher as the mentor.

No Death Eater whitewashing, no m/m and preferably as little of Lupin and the Weasleys as possible.


** You want Potions to be the focus of the character's study in the fic ahead of other branches like Transfiguration or Charms, or do you just want something where the character excels at Potions without Snape hanging around?

*** I'm fine with either. Perhaps not the"Potions solve everything" attitude similar to what you see in many "Rune" fics, but I'm looking for more than "X, Y, Z and Qhappen. Also, Harry is good at Potions"

*** Is really not about potions. Sure, it has some conflict over the book and Harry getting better results with better instructions/Hermione's fit, but the book is mostly about Riddle home movies, Chest Monsters and passing the idiot ball like a joint.

There are a few Slytherin Harry stories which explore potions further, but all of them have Snape and not Slughorn as the mentor.
