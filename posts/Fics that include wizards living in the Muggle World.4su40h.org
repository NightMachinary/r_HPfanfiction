Something very much like this linkffn(6432055). Basically, I've come to like wizards discovering the world of muggles. I have read Strangers at Drakeshaugh and its sequel.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** Great fic. There's some random wtf stuff in the middle, but it's literally 44/45 great so far

*** This was awesome. Seriously, while Draco is quite OOC, it's given a believable enough foundation and the story is overall quite good.

It could do without wanking though.

It's mostly a Romione fic, but it's well written and does in fact deal with Ron having to deal with Muggle world in later half.

Also, the closer it is to the end, the less good it is. A couple of late characters are literally plot devices.
