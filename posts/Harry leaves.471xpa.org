  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

*** Indeed, loved the concept and the beginning of the story. I have to say though, that half-way through, it kind of loses steam. Probably has to do with the fact that every time Harry has a problem, he turns to the ever-so-helpful house-elf Dobby.

**** Yeah, I admit, the beginning where he completely (but understandably) misinterprets everything that happens due to lack of information (and paranoia) is the best part. It definitely lost steam once the fidelius was cast. But knocking out Dung and running from Remus and Tonks will always amuse me.

** /Harry Potter and the Irish Choice/ by /DisobedienceWriter/ linkffn(3771102) is a multi-part almost novel-length story, which I liked a lot when it was written and published. Although I haven't gone back to re-read it in a few years, I still have fond memories of it.

The first story that comes to mind is a different story though, mostly because its almost 900k words make this an epic tale and the longest Harry Potter fanfic I ever read. It's called /The Brave new World/ by /bellerophon30/ linkffn(2697521)

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
