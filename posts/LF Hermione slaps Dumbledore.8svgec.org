Fanfic where Hermione slaps Dumbledore. It's Harry/Hermione. End scene is a big battle and Molly Weasley attacks Harry and Hermione because Ginny gets killed.

Dumbledore also tries to get them arrested for killing Tom riddle and Bellatrix. Harry responds by cutting Dumbledore's arm off with griffyndor's sword

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

*** This is a good one but not the one I'm looking for! Scrimgeour plays a bigger role in being a dick like dumbeldore.

Also I believe the slap happens in the great hall
