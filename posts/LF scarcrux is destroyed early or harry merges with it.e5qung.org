Fics where the scarcrux is either destroyed or absorbed this has to happen after harry gets to hogwarts most fics where it happen early either dont make sense or just devolve into power fantasies

NO slash No fem!Harry preferably no bashing but characters can be shown in a negative light

No godlike harry like its fine if he is powerful but not insanely OP


** There is one called the seventh horcrux. It's a parody.

** There's a couple of these, but none of them were very good, imo.

I know there's "The Merging", which devolves into uncomfortable descriptions and nothing happening.

There's also another one I don't remember the name of, which was extremely strange as well with ole H descending into his mind and sort of "melding" with a dark spot? stopped reading when it became too weird.

Interestingly, the two best ones I know are Stargate crossovers. One has the best occlumency scene I've seen yet, too. Sadly, those two both shape up to eventually become "I'll write about how ole H runs an entire civilisation in excruciating detail", but before that it's good.

*** i have read a couple like that its just i like reading fics where harry isn't OP but also isn't just barely surviving on luck and him merging with the scarcrux gives the author and easy excuse to give him drive/ambition which he severely lacks and/or knowledge
