I don't understand this ship. In most cases Draco was a complete ass to Harry and Harry ends up with Draco why? Please note that I have nothing against the same sex ships


** Honestly I have no idea, but there are some good fanfiction out there if you just kinda accept that it's a different character with the same name üòÇ

****** If Draco is written in a great way like in Little Bat (the only one I could think of) I like him. I honestly believe J.K mess up on a lot of characters even including The Golden Trio. Everyone has a right to be a fanboy/girl/them (sorry if I miss anyone) I'm a huge Fanboy of Tonks, Luna, and McGonagall

** People love dat enemies to lovers stuff and Fanon Draco is a far easier pill to swallow than Canon Draco

I don't ship it personally (prefer Harry with a Weasley brother or male DA member when it comes to slash)

*** The biggest problem is that there's no real redemption arc for Draco that I've seen. The closest we've seen is him taking Draco's wand in the book, while the movies deleted the scene where he tosses Harry his wand, so Fanon Draco generally get that redemption

** I didn't ship it at first, but after reading some amazing fanfiction, I've come to accept the headcanons by other fans as canon

and I suppose the enemies to lovers is an appealing idea

the other reason could be that they saw two hot guys and want them to smash

** Just like Dramione. Draco/Harry is not much different. None of them actually know each other well. There is prejudice on both sides, so if a fic is really well written with complex characters , why not?

There are many exceptional writers who can make it happen.

**** Yes, there is prejudice.

I am not talking here about Voldemort here, l am talking about children, Gryffindors and Slytherins hating each other. Hermione, Harry or Ron have never tried to be friendly to Malfoy and vice versa. You can't say Draco was evil at 11 and wanting to be a terrorist, criminal and support genocide. Just like Marauders thought Snape was evil at 11 too. Those 2 cases can't be compared, but there certainly is prejudice on both sides. Slytherin and Gryffindor.

Prejudice starts in the family, true, but it is certainly nurtured during Hogwarts years while the staff and Dumbledore do nothing to stop it.

****** I see Malfoy as a mean, arrogant bullying show off with hurt pride after being rejected by Harry Potter. He is afraid of his father and wants to please him.

Evil is a strong word.

Is it Draco, or his father? If you say it's Draco, then you're essentially saying that Harry would immediately jump at the opportunity to bully a Slytherin since that's what his father did to Snape and clearly whatever the father does must be done by the son as well. If you say it's his father, then you've correctly identified that he /didn't/ have the choice like Harry. He couldn't say anything positive about Muggleborns without running the risk of his dad potentially beating him.

It's easy to latch onto ideals from your parents when you're younger because they are your first real heroes. But what happens when you realize that their thinking is toxic and runs the chance of killing you? You have an identity crisis on your hands

** I personally think people who ship things like Drarry, Snarry, Tomarry, Dramione, Snapemione(idk), etc etc should be chemically and physically sterilized, their hands chopped off and their tounge cut out. Honestly that's the only solution I can think of that will improve the general state of not only the hp fandom but the world in general that has zero perceivable downsides.

*** Not really. 6th Year is the only one where Malfoy is really entrenched in Harry's brain.

Most of the time, the trio ignore him and he always is the one to instigate confrontation
