** Considered in “ The Wheel Is Come Full Circle” by GlisteningSunlight, White_Squirrel linkao3(14072127), but generally the wand theory in JKR world [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/the-problem-of-peter-pevensie-and-the-problem-of-wands.html][doesn't make]] complete sense.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione goes to Australia to bring her parent home and gets a big surprise. It turns out her Memory Charm wasn't enough to fill the hole in their lives. Now, she has a new sister who will be starting at Hogwarts as she returns for her seventh year and deals with the aftermath of the war. Epilogue-compliant.

The wizarding world barely needs money to live. Get some raw materials, transfigure whatever u need except food. The "heaps of galleons and stuff" should have been enough for Harry to live comfortably

**** For the books it is canon as Hermione has made us all aware forcibly of the books written about him that she had read. But the books I think are Dumbledore doing or the Ministry to cultivate the public figure of the BWL, golden child of the Light. Just as the Memorial or other things the Ministry must have made it public domain.

For the self monetary sustenance claim, First Gwamp Law of Transfiguration.

** Honestly becoming an auror is the best way to keep the wand owner hidden.

Harry will constantly be getting into battles Nobody knows where the elder wand actually is.

Meanwhile an auror might lose his wand in battle only for his auror buddy to protect his ass and win the fight

I imagine Aurors also have tons of practise duels against other aurors as well.

which means anyone who wants to eventually track down the elder wand will have to go through hundreds of auror cases and workout who the rightful owner is from thousands of possible owners

*** "Practice duels"... Read " PRACTICE". The Elder Wand recognizes intent. So its probably not gonna affect the ownership.

I do agree with the fact that nobody knows where the elder wand. That's a good point towards its security.

But... and pardon me for saying this... A really determined person could hold Harry's family hostage in exchange for the location..

**** Not really, because then the Elder wand would recognize that in malfoy mannor malfoy was not really trying.

the elder wand is insanely fickle. I imagine Auror practises duels are basically like real duels only they dont end with death

a really determined person would be unable too Harry's family are all insanely skilled and talented wizards.

and even if they did some how get the location.

the wand itself is worthless without being the true owner and since harry is an a field that has him constantly in battle

Him losing his wand in a duel against a criminal and his auror back up subdueing that criminal

means the ownership is now on the auror who caught the criminal

that auror then loses a duel a month later, and another auror defeats the guy who beats him

good luck tracking the wand

***** Your 3rd point is, Pardon me. Shit. Who exactly is skilled and talented? Don't include extended family. Ginny is as far as I know a quidditch player? The rest are children.

Also I think it was implied that once the person got the wand he would force Harry to get defeated by him if he required his family to live.

"Back up" Auror is cannon? I don't know about that so...

Malfoy didn't fight in the malfoy manor. He fought against Dumbeldore at the tower and disarmed him. He got beat by Harry at the Manor.

hell most of the time we see aurors in the field they are in pairs.

Ron, Former auror and Joke shop owner. Ginny, survived the war and professional quidditch player. Surviving Weasley twin, survived the war and Joke shop owner.

that's not counting the rest of the family and friends.

******* I just told you to ignore the bloody extended family.

There was no "war". It was more of a resistance. They were kids then. They didn't kill a single person. The most they did was at the BOH. Which tbh wasn't that great. That amount of bullcrap that Rowling pushed into that was... Yeah.

She says that Hermion, Luna, ginny were equivalent to Bellatrix... As if.

It was more to build up tension than anything.

And : Joke Shop Owner, Quiditch Player? That's isn't inspiring confidence in their fighting abilities you know?

****** Just because Ginny is a Quiditch player does not mean she isn't an accomplished witch.

She's one of the more skilled members of the DA as a child and she survives the Battle of Hogwarts, without the aid of Felix Felices.

Good luck doing that if Harry hides the wand somewhere safe.

#+end_quote

While it is true that we see Aurors act single-handedly on occasion, this is generally in the case of being a bodyguard--Kingsley defending the Prime Minister.

Usually, we see the Aurors acting as at least a unit of two--Kingsley and Dawlish to "arrest" Dumbledore, Dawlish and the other Aurors sent to arrest Hagrid

Elsewhere, wizards acting alone ends up badly for them--Ogden fled for his life and required back-up to apprehend Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt; Dawlish got so badly injured by Augusta Longbottom, he was in St. Mungo's for several days, if not longer.

******* I never said she was not an accomplished witch. But being a witch or wizard does not make one a good fighter.

If a person is actually after the Elder Wand he would probably be really really skilled to even have the balls to go after Harry-TheManWhoConquered-Potter.

Good luck doing that? Why would he need good luck? He will tell Harry to get the wand, hand it over to him, and get defeated by him otherwise his family was gonna be in danger.

So that 2 Auror theory is really wonky eh?

But Ginny is described as being a good fighter as early as her fourth year--third year, really, since George remarks her ability with jinxes and hexes /before/ term starts in /Order of the Phoenix./

You can still hurt someone sparring, so I suspect the Elder Wand would count a "practice duel."
