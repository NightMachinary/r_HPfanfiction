Ok, I am not a good writer or someone who knows a lot about writing, so I want to hear your thoughts on how you go about successfully creating a tragic character. The sorts of chacracters I have in mind include Adrian, from Atithesis, and Harry from A Sad Winter, and A Brother's betrayal. You might also be able to fit Harry from Circular Reasoning and Deprived into the deifnition of a tragic character as well.

Also, feel free to link fics that you feel feature a main or prominent character who may be considered, by whatever definition you choose, to be tragic.

linkffn(12021325 ) linkffn(6097877) linkffn(2680093) linkffn(7402590) linkffn(4201115)


** Emily Price in linkffn(11752324).

The reader needs to be able to empathize with the character and then. Which often means they need to like the character. And then whatever happens needs to have an absolute, unavoidable feel to it. More points if the character sees it coming and knows there's no escaping.

The tragic character must, in the end, lose. That doesn't necessarily mean that they die or fail to resolve the plot. It just means that the ends did not justify the means.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** I still have no idea where this story is going. If I had to take a guess, I'd say there's gonna be a bittersweet ending. Maybe Emily will end up alone in self-exile after she does something that makes her lose both the war and Harry.

**** From the setup, I expect this ain't going to be sweet in any way. I'm going out on a limb here, possibly, but I think it'll be at least as much a kick in the gut as the author's ending to [[/spoiler][The Pureblood Princess]]: 200k words of getting us to care about a character and then, "Blam, dead."

** The important thing is to set up the tragical twist in some way. For example, if you just have the main character or love interest die out of the blue, that is not tragic, that is bad writing. SUBTLE foreshadowing is your friend here.

Also, put some disclaimer about mayor character death at the beginning of the entire story. You don't have to say who will die, but quite a few people hate reading about the loss of a loved one and (myself included) .

**** But I start reading a work of fiction with certain expectations. Game of Thrones is often summarised with "everyone dies", so character death in general is not unexpected. Despite this, nearly no one saw the Red Wedding coming. But if I start reading something fluffy and then suddenly, death and agony everywhere, then it is not what I wanted to read, "I didn't sign up for that". Life is miserable enough, I don't need even more misery in my fiction.
