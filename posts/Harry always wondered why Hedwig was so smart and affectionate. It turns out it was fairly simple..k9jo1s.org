After hearing the prophecy, Lily delves deep into magic to try to find a way to protect her son, when she stumbles upon something called horcruxes.

She found that they were considered vile because of the human sacrifice, but upon further reading, found that human sacrifice wasn't required. All it required was a sacrifice.

"Wizards," She declared, "are idiots."

Splitting your soul wasn't that big a deal, because it didn't fracture mind or magic unless you made too many.

So Lily grabbed a spider and went into the forbidden forest before performing the ritual, trying to bind it to her necklace.

Just as the soul fragment was about to latch to her necklace, a snowy owl flew in from out of nowhere and the soul bound to it.

Lily had blacked out from the ritual, so didn't know that she was bound to the owl.

After Voldemort killed her and she found herself being latched onto and possessing a snowy owl rather than being a wraith, she was understandably mad. Even more so when she found that she was trapped in Eeylops Owl Emporium. So when people tried to come get her, was it any surprise she tried to bite them?

Until one day, the Hogwarts groundskeeper came in muttering about buying an owl for "little 'arry Potter."
