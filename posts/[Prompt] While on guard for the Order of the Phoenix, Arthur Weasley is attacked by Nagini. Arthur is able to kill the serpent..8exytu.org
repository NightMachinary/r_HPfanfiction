** Steve Miner, Prime Minister for the British muggles, just /looked/ at Arthur Weasley, who fidgeted awkwardly in his seat.

"So, Mr. Weasley, I understand that you know the causes of the explosion that occurred last Wednesday?" he asked.

Arthur blushed, "Well...yes. Actually, I was the cause of it."

Steve raised an eyebrow, "/You/ caused it?"

Arthur nodded weakly, "I was trying to kill a snake."

Steve blinked, and sat back, "A snake...as in a basilisk? One of the really big ones that can kill you with a look?"

"Um, no, it was more of a boa constrictor. No death gaze."

"I see? And that warranted..." the Prime Minister looked down a letter on his desk, "'An unexploded 4 ton blockbuster bomb', which 'detonated unexpectedly underneath Whitehall Road', making a deep crater, disruption of traffic, thankfully no fatalities?"

Arthur's blush deepened to match his hair, "It was proving extremely hard to kill."

"I see. Why were you trying to kill this snake, anyway?"

"Well, its name was Nagini, and it attacked me while I was standing guard in the bottom of the Ministry of Magic..."

/Arthur dived to the side as Nagini crashed through his hastily-raised Shield Charm, the serpent barely being slowed for a second, before he raised his wand and shot a Cutting Curse at the snake...which deflected off its scales with a loud ~pling!~./

/Wincing as the reflected spell slashed through one of the portraits, which screamed shrilly, Arthur flicked his wand and summoned a steel safe in front of him, blocking Nagini's next strike just in time, before banishing the heavy metal object at the serpent./

/Starting to breathe a sigh of relief, Arthur froze and then rapidly leapt to his feet as he heard an angry hissing, running for the elevator right as Nagini burst through the metal safe./

"So you tried cutting it and crushing it with no effect?" Steve asked.

Arthur nodded, "And I tried a laser, and freezing it, which worked if only very briefly, and suffocating it, that didn't work..."

Steve waved a hand, "Alright, so what happened next?"

"I fled to the Muggle Technology Research department..."

/Leaping behind a large enchanted machine gun, yelling at the already-scattering witches and wizards to evacuate the building, Arthur pulled the trigger and opened fire./

/RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!/

/Nagini was thrown back and pinned against the wall by the thunderous hail of bullets; Arthur grinned and kept firing, before he realised; the bullets that DIDN'T hit the snake were smashing through the wall behind it-/

/KER-RASH!!/

"Oh, so /that's/ what that sound was! The hospital was fielding calls from PTSD veterans who were convinced they were hallucinating machine gun fire! Kind of worrying when they all come from the same place at the same time..."

Arthur's blush resumed, "Er, right...anyway, when the wall collapsed, I couldn't target Nagini anymore, so I hightailed it out of the now empty Ministry..."

/"Accio sword!"/

/A snarl was heard from inside Gringotts as the bank's doors flew open and a goblin-silver sword flew into Arthur's hand, just in time to block Nagini's fangs./

/The snake recoiled, hissing loudly, then glared at Arthur menacingly, before hissing loudly, "Accio...sword..."/

/Arthur's eyes widened in alarm before he ducked, another sword flying over his head and plunging into the ground by Nagini, who wrapped her tail around the hilt.../

Steve coughed and spluttered as part of his cup of tea went down the wrong way, "The snake could cast magic too?!"

Arthur nodded, "It had a direct link to You-Know-Who...the bad guy. I think he could possess it or something."

"And then you got into a sword-fight with a snake."

"I think it was afraid of being cut by goblin steel so it grabbed something else to attack with. That's what did in You-Know-Who's diary."

Steve opened his mouth, then shut it again, "On second thoughts, I don't want to know about that. Now, the train tracks?"

/Arthur flicked his sword to deflect a swing from Nagini, before turning and Disapparating out of the way to avoid a Blasting Curse fired from the snake's mouth./

/Reappearing behind the serpent, he swung his blade down...only for the edge to bounce off Nagini's scales, no more effective than any of Arthur's other attacks. The snake stared at where the sword hit, before somehow smirking and repeatedly stabbing towards Arthur with its own sword./

/Disapparating out of the way again, Arthur raised his wand and began to incant a Sinkhole Hex-/

/CHOOO-WHOOO!!/

/-before leaping out of the way, narrowly avoiding being run over by a speeding train./

/Nagini wasn't so lucky./

/~WHAM!~/

"So this Nagini was knocked for six by a bullet train. And then?"

"Well, it was at that point I realised that during the whole fight I had left the Hall of Prophecies unguarded. So I made to Apparate back there, but at some point, the snake had managed to stick me with an Anti-Apparation Jinx...so I ran for the road and hailed a taxi..."

/"Could you drop me off at Whitehall, please? I'm in a bit of a hurry."/

/The taxi driver nodded and started to accelerate...then shrieked as he was suddenly rear-ended./

/Arthur's attention shot up to the rear-vision mirror; there, right behind their taxi, was a blank-faced young man in a red sports car, accompanied by a large, extremely-angry looking snake./

"Imperius curse?"

"Imperius curse."

/"This'll cost you extraaa!!" the taxi driver screamed as he swerved past an oncoming truck, the back of which exploded and sent melted chocolate everywhere as it got in the way of a Blasting Curse./

/"I've got solid gold, just keep driving! Protego!" Arthur shouted back as another Blasting Curse was deflected away from the taxi, smashing into a political billboard and thoroughly ruining Steve Miner's smiling face./

"And I was rather upset by that. So, you made it to Whitehall, dropped a handful of Galleons in the taxi and dived out?"

"Yes, then I made my way to the," here Arthur raised his voice, "EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MATERIALS, SERIOUSLY, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TOUCHING THESE", he lowered it again, "...Department. Really, the title is shouted and everything. Technically, I dropped by the Auror Office first."

/"Geminio! Geminio! Geminio!" Arthur rapidly cast on the Enriched Erumpet Fluid, before a loud hissing made him turn around./

/There, blocking the only exit from the room, an engorged, shielded, somewhat sooty and VERY ANGRY snake called Nagini glared at Arthur, a glow in its mouth signalling the beginning of an extremely powerful curse./

/Wasting no time, Arthur dived to the side, right into the open Auror trunk he had snatched up beforehand, calling out "Colloportus" as he fell down into its depths, the lid slamming itself shut with a squelching sound-/

** /KA-BLAAAAAAAAAAAAMMO!!/

Steve winced at Arthur's loud recounting of the explosion, "So, this Erumpet Fluid, which I assume is highly-explosive, detonated, and started a chain reaction which obliterated the entire underground Ministry of Magic, and in the process created a very large crater in Whitehall? And you survived by hiding in an extradimensional space, which you were ejected from after the trunk was destroyed by the initial shockwave?"

Arthur raised a hand and started counting fingers, "Um...yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. Yes, that's all correct."

Steve sighed and smiled a little, "At least you finally killed that snake, right?"

Arthur paused.

"You're kidding me."

Arthur waved his hands, "Well, I don't know if it's /dead/, but it is certainly no longer on Earth."

"And what does that mean, precisely?"

Arthur glanced at a little model rocket on the Prime Minister's desk, before he cupped his hands together and flicked them upwards with a little 'boom' sound from his mouth.

**** Eyup. I actually branched out a bit with this; instead of Arthur's recap being just presented in words, I decided to write out the action-y bits as flashbacks, using Arthur's explanation of what happened to skip the not-interesting parts.

** Harry glanced at Ron when he woke, sweaty and slightly perturbed, the scream still echoing in the room.

"It's a good thing your dad was randomly carrying a basilisk fang."

Elsewhere

Voldemort marvels at the sheer ridiculousness that a random Order member was carrying a basilisk fang. The only known basilisk in Britain was in the chamber of secrets. He had immediately checked the other soul anchors to ensure they were safe, and he found them all safe. He doubted anyone knew of the secret, so it made the situation even more odd. He resolved to kill the Weasley's during the summer in order to prevent such unlikely circumstances from happening again.

**** Yeah he could. Just because Nagini was killed with a basilisk infused sword does not mean that he needed to be killed by the basilisk venom to die. That's the problem with human soul anchors; they are vulnerable to all the same things that humans are. But my question is: if a human host of a soul anchor dies, does the soul anchor necessarily die?

** Had that in my story "Uncle Quentin's Spy", chapter 5, seen through Harry's vision:

Harry found himself in a strange place - a stone corridor, but far too large, as if made for giants. Or maybe half-giants. And he was not walking, but gliding over the polished marble floor, towards an empty corner... an empty corner that smelled like prey. Like food. And then he shot forward, faster than he thought possible, his mouth opening wide, razor-sharp fangs stabbing soft meat, poison shooting through them into the prey, which quickly collapsed into a convulsing mass of food. Harry ignored the feeble attempts to ward him off and slithered around the prey, unhinging his lower jaw. He enjoyed the expression of pain and fear and growing horror when the prey realized it was going to be eaten alive. It was still squirming inside him, a most satisfying feeling, when suddenly pain shot through him, and he felt his belly ripping open, spilling his prey and his blood and entrails on the floor.

** Sorry, not a native English speaker here.

"What an interresting development" thought Dumbledore.\\
Two nights prior, Voldemort, after months of laying low, had finally made a move. Running straight into the headmaster's trap, he had attacked the department of mysteries.\\
On guard duty that night was Arthur Weasley.\\
When told about the attack at the time (by no other than Harry Potter of all people, sweet child but Merlin, could he drive the headmaster nuts at times), Dumbledore had sadly counted poor Arthur as yet another casualty of the war.\\
Rushing to the scene, he was very surprised, and very pleased to find Arthur alive, if wounded, and a very dead snake in stead of the worst Dark Lord to ever walk this Earth.\\
Turned out the Dark Wizard's caution had finally provided the light side with a significant victory.\\
If the Headmaster was right, and the snake was indeed...

"Dumbledore, may I come through?"\\
From the floo, he recognized the voice of Lucius Malfoy. Wondering what it was about, he beckoned the wizard inside.\\
Malfoy's face wore an intense sadness. He seemed beaten.

"Then, what may I do for you, Mr Malfoy?" asked Dumbledore, bringing a Sherbet Lemon to his mouth. Keeping his eyes on the floor, the other wizard answered.\\
"Professor Dumbledore, there's no good way to put it, so I'll be blunt. I have the sad duty to inform you that Lord Voldemort is dead.\\
The news of Nagini's demise, the only friend he had at is side all these years in Albania, was too much for him to bear.\\
Last night he commited suicide, casting one last time that spell he so loved.\\
The burrial will be held in three days in Little Hengleton. I hope you can make it, he would've liked you to be there."

Lucius then run to the floo, crying.\\
Several hours later, a shocked Dumbledore remembered to eat the Sherbet Lemon in his hand.

Hope it isn't too lame.
