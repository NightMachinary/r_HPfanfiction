** I think it depends on what kind of fic is being talked about, honestly. Some fics - like long AUs - can end up diverging enough from the source material that they could almost pass as original fiction if the names were changed, and in that case saying it doesn't read like a fanfic may well be a good compliment. But there are also tons of fics that would never work as anything other than fanfiction, and that doesn't inherently make them any less good. (I usually feel the opposite way, honestly - if I wanted to feel like I was reading original fiction, I would, you know, just read original fiction.)

Fanfiction plays by different - generally looser - rules than original works, and often the fics that embrace that end up being the most interesting to me.

*** In the case of long AU's where the characters eventually diverge from the source material, the good ones still start from canon versions and then evolve from there. I just expect the first chapter or two to have people and events I recognize. If you want a smart Harry, start the story from his infancy, don't give me a fully grown Harry who followed canon plot but is somehow a super genius (PS I misspelled genius as I was typing LOL).

**** Sorry, I should have been clearer - when I said AU, I meant it in the more traditional since of the story being set in a different world. A "smart!Harry AU" isn't the kind of fic I was talking about, assuming they're still set in the world of magic and Hogwarts and whatnot. I would call them a canon divergence fic or a canon rehash fic instead.

(I realize I'm losing this fandom linguistics battle, but I find it unhelpful to put, say, Slytherin!Harry fics and coffeeship fics into the same category of "AU.")

** It really depends on the context. If I say that a story doesn't read like a fanfic, I usually mean that the characters are OOC to the point where it feels like an insult to JKR's characters that they share the name.

For example, I recently read a story where Harry dies on Halloween and Lily survives. A couple of years later, Voldemort is back and Dumbledore does a ritual to bring Harry from a different dimension to fix the problem. Except that both, the Lily universe and the verse where Harry is from are total AUs to the point where character names are the only recognisable thing.

I tried to read it twice but never get past the point (around chapter 6 or 7 IIRC) where Harry and Lily compare universes and nothing matches canon.

** The underlying assumption seems to be that fanfics are below (commercially published) original works. It's like when you say "this definitely meets the standard of commercial publishing."

If I were the author, I'd rather want to hear about /what/ made you to value the particular fanfic higher than others. Categorical judgment would better belong to elsewhere.

*** 100% agree with this tbh. I don't know why fanfiction readers like to put down fanfiction so much in terms of implying that it's low quality garbage.

Yes, there are a lot of low quality fics out there. There are also a lot of low quality published and self-published books out there.

At this point, I've read a *lot* more fanfiction(by a factor of hundreds most likely, since I've been reading fanfiction almost every single day for 10+ years) than I have of any other type of pleasure-based writing, and there's a lot of extremely good fics out there that rival some of the best novels in terms of quality-- whether it's an AU or has a ton of canonical elements.

Judging fanfiction by the poor quality fics rather than the high quality fics is silly and detrimental.
