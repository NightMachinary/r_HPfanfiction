Example: The prophecies could be knocked off of the shelves by anyone so all the death eaters needed to do was transfigure the shelf holding the prochecy into something pliable, like rubber, push the shelf down, and hold a bag underneath to catch the prophecy. They never would have needed to touch the actual orb, and thus wouldn't have been cursed.


** Pettigrew - after escaping Azkaban, Sirius could have written to Remus, Dumbledore, hell, even McGonagall, and tell them the truth, enclose the photo from Prophet. It would be much easier for them to catch Peter since he wouldn't expect them to know.

Voldemort's return - show Minister Harry's memory in the pensive? I know memories could be tempered with, but Harry was 14, and I doubt he knew how to do that.

Hiding the Potters - put the secret keeper in another house under the Fidelius or FFS, let Dumbledore be the Secret Keeper. Can anyone explain to me why James choose to endanger the life of his best friend when Dumbledore, the only person Voldemort feared, offered to be their SK?

Freeing Sirius - instead of allowing Harry and Hermione travel back in time and arrange a complicated escape plan for Sirius, Dumbledore could use one of Hogwarts' house-elves.

Prophecy - use a house-elf to take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy, so he could take it. No need to guard it day and night and risk the lives of the very few members of the Order.

*** Most of the pointlessly complicated things in canon can be explained by "Rowling needed it to happen that way". Same reason why the adults are incompetent, or why Voldemort always wait for the end of the year for his plots (it's so considerate of him to wait for Harry to be done with exams before trying to kill him).

Some of the points you mentioned could potentially be explained by canon (the Hall of the Prophecy may have additional protections, or there is a usually a night watch that was disabled by Voldemort thanks to his Death Eaters . . .), but the one that bothers me the most is the one about Fudge.

Fudge does not want to believe that Voldemort is back, and refused to admit the truth until he stood in front of Voldemort himself. Back in PoA, he ignored the Trio testimony saying "They must have been confunded", it is very probable that he would have used the same argument if confronted with a memory. Also, Harry may not be able to temper memories, but Dumbledore can, if you believe that Dumbledore is out to get your post, you can easily reach the conclusion that Harry is either manipulated or a willing accomplice to the plot.\\
The main thing that make me think so is how Fudge dealt with Crouch Jr. Here you have a known Death Eater, who is supposed to have died in Azkaban years ago, who is privy to how Voldemort came back, and who is most than willing to claim the return of his Master and even explain how he did it and is part in the plot. And Fudge first reflex is to have him Kissed before even trying to question him.

At this point, I'm convinced that Fudge is such a coward that, if presented with a living Peter Pettigrew who could explain him is part in the death of the Potters, he would try to discretely kill Pettigrew while maintaining a "kill on sight" order for Sirius, just so he would not have to admit that the Ministry (and more importantly, him) were wrong.

I guess Dumbledore may have used his power and influence to bypass Fudge. But Dumbledore humility (his refusal to force his will on others despite having the power to do so) is one of his most characterising traits. He would probably refuse to ignore the normal, legal way, and the arguments "For the Greater Good" would have no influence on him except maybe making him angry.

**** You have a point. Fudge was a terrible coward, so there's a big chance it wouldn't work out anyway, but there are other people, who are braver than Fudge and Dumbledore could show it to them.

Instead of gathering a group of misfits, he should have gone for the big fishes in the Ministry and WW. There had to be a way to get rid of Fudge.

But yeah, that's also a part of who Dumbledore was. He feared to take power because of what had happened with Grindelwald. Perhaps it was for the best, but I can't help but wonder if there would have been fewer victims if he decided to take the leap, get the power, and do things that needed to be done.

***** I'm not sure it would have been such a good idea for Dumbledore to take power. As you said, maybe it would have been for the best, but maybe Dumbledore would have seen how much better things run when he is in command. So why abandon power now, when there as still so many issues to deal with, such as the Blood Purism ideology? I think Dumbledore taking power by force to deal with Voldemort could be compared as if Aragorn had used the Ring to fight Sauron in LotR. He may have won in the end, and maybe even with less death, but at the end of the story you still have a Dark Lord to deal with, just one with differents motivations.

There is also the problem that Dumbledore is not a young man anymore. He already dealt with one Dark Lord, if he has to deal with a Second one, who will step up to take his place when he finally dies? Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish and you feed him forever. Better stay in the background and teach the younger generation how to deal with their problems.

As for "the group of misfits", I think the problem lies with trust. A lot of people forget that Death Eaters like Malfoy could easily be acquited because there were load of people who actually were under the Imperius.\\
Thanks to Harry, the Order has the name of all the free Death Eater who came back to serve their Master, but it doesn't mean that they have the name of every bad people. Like it's the case with Umbridge, how many people in the Ministry believe into Blood Purity, and would be happy to see Voldemort take power, without taking his mark? And even for those who don't believe into it, how many would be ready to risk their life for some Muggleborn? And that's without event taking into account the people who could betray the Order for unrelated reasons (like Marieta betrayed the DA in OotP).\\
Each member of the Order was invited either by Dumbledore himself, or by another member who could vouch for him and his readiness to risk his life and freedom in the fight against Voldemort, (except Fletcher who, I am convinced, was forced to join by Moody who thought it could be usefull to have a crook in their rank to keep his ears open in the worst part of society).\\
Going for the big fish seem nice, but they are the poeple who could have the most reasons to potentially betray the Order, and as proven by Pettigrew, it only takes one spy in their rank to put the whole group at risk.

Maybe that's what the Weasleys did in DH: mutually protected Fidelius Charms. Also, instead of sending Harry to 4 Privet Dr after Year 6, they should take him to such a place when he stepped off the Hogwarts Express. Then the whole Flight of 7 Potters nonsense could be avoided.

More: send copies of his memory to ALL Ministries around the world and major news media. This gotta be the news of the decade!

Also use Dumbledore's Supreme Mugwump position to make a big splash in ICW.

***** It's easy in hindsight to say what they should have done, and also from a reader's perspective. I'm thinking they chose those they trusted the most and who stood closest to the Potters. We don't really know how close the Potters were to Dumbledore. Maybe they didn't know how much Voldemort feared Dumbedore, and assumed he'd be a too risky choice since he's leading the war on the light side, or a too obvious choice.

****** I think Voldemort's fear of Dumbledore was a known fact during the First War already. Hagrid tells Harry about it when they went to Diagon Alley. Dumbledore created the Order of the Phoenix to fight Voldemort and his death-eaters, Hogwarts was never attacked during the First War, not to mention Dumbledore was quite famous for his power and accomplishments.\\
I could understand if the Potters didn't trust Dumbledore, but why wouldn't they? And then, why Sirius listened to Dumbledore's orders after he escaped Azkaban? If the Potters didn't trust Dumbledore and had a reason for it then, Sirius would definitely know about it, and it makes his loyalty toward Albus a little strange.\\
I think that and Sirius storyline are the most underdeveloped plots in the books. There are just too many plot holes, strange coincidences, and too much ignorance. I accept it as it is, but in my opinion, too many puzzles don't fit.

******* Not really sure how much Sirius trusts Dumbledore, who was supposed to be in charge of the Wizengamot and failed to ensure that people got a fair trial; he surely must have known that Sirius didn't get a trial. About Sirius following Dumbledore's orders not necessarily just because Dumbledore said so; he was very unhappy with Dumbledore about having to stay indoors, wasn't he? But I think he realised why himself. He is smart enough to, but you can obviously understand his displeasure, both with being confined to his ancestors' house and being upset with Dumbledore. I'm thinking the cooperation that we see between them is largely because they are united against a common enemy. I really can't fathom how Sirius is supposed to have such a good relationship to Dumbledore. He'd at least have a much better reason not to trust Dumbledore than the Potters.

I also checked the Harry Potter wiki page; supposedly, Dumbledore had offered himself as a secret keeper, but they'd chosen Pettigrew (Maybe for the sake of it being an anonymous keeper - isn't that why they switched from Sirius too? I'm just theorising)

**** The magic may actually require trust. Like the patronus. The fideleus could be similar to the Patronus in its intent.

Fandom proves that a lot of people don't implicitly trust Dumbledore. Furthermore it isn't show that there is a strong personal bond between Dumbledore and anyone other than Hogwarts staff and Harry.

Dumbledore could possibly not have been an iption.

Say Dumbledore is already a secret keeper, can he take another secret as well? Or does that interfere or dilute the secret?

I think the trust idea is a good one and it makes the most sense. For someone to keep your secret you must fully trust them else the magic wouldn't work. That would explain a lot actually

** Sirius.

The ICW oversees the Statute of Secrecy, right? What was Sirius accused of? Forget "betraying" the Potters. Forget about Pettigrew. He was accused of killing twelve muggles in broad daylight. Did he get a trial? lolnope.

Here's what he should have done: Escape from Azkaban and head straight to wherever the headquarters of the ICW is and ask for a trial. Or an investigation.

Sirius allegedly threatened the Statute of Secrecy and Magical Britain didn't do their due diligence. This should let the ICW step in and give Sirius his trial.

​

Hell, with Voldemort going around killing Muggles, destroying bridges in broad daylight, someone could have went to the ICW with it and it would have been like NATO or the UN descending on a member nation for breaking the rules, blanketing them with troops/investigators.
