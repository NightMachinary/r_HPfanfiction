So I have been working on a story idea for a while. I won't go into too much detail, but in one part Harry meets a group of entities who collect the souls of those who have been marked by the Dark Arts.

Anyway, each of them is supposed to represent one of six motivations that people fall to the dark arts. Now I want to ask what other people would recommend for these motivations, because its an important part of the story.

My current points are: *rage, grief, apathy, hatred, avarice, and terror*.

There is a final motivation (the seventh) is separate: sacrifice. This is a set part of the story.

Anyway, what possibilities can you all recommend for the six?


** Power? Dark Wizards who want to /rule/, to have power for its own sake, not because they particularly hate those they want to rule over but because power is in itself appealing to them. To free up room, you could merge rage and hatred (the difference seems somewhat tenuous).

Also, what of those with ultimately virtuous motives, like --- if not Grindelwald himself --- then some of his supporters? Who genuinely saw Dark Magic as only a means to an end, and had a selfless end in mind?

*** You could say that Power is just another form of Desire, or *avarice* as I wrote (greed or desire work too).

Anyway, I think you are assuming that all dark wizards started using the dark arts to become stronger. People are more nuanced than this. Lots of people fall into horrible behaviors because of /other/ motivating factors.

- Soldiers after a battle shoot people who are unarmed and surrendering.
- In fear of being attacked, someone orders horrific actions be taken against possible antagonists.
- People want something from their neighbor owns, so they steal it from them and pin the blame on another person.
- A husband cheats on the wife, so in response she murders both her husband and his partner.

Just because actions fall into the category of "Dark" does not mean that they were undertaken for the same reason.

**** Unless I'm mistaken, avarice is way more greed than desire.

Desire for power is massively different than Greed for power because of intent.

Are the group of entities neutral or do they subscribe to the good/evil? Do they look at intent when turning to the Dark Arts or does it not matter so long as Dark Arts is used?

******* There are some spoilers here, but this is the gist. The entities are sort of like the collectors of souls who have been scarred by dark magic. Dark magic really is an aberration, and at a certain point they claim your soul (which they are deliberately vague about). This is in reference to Dumbledore's points about how killing and to a lesser degree harmful actions are abhorrent.

Each one represents one of these points, and they collect the soul dark wizard/witch who fell for one reason or another (its sort of a who collects the most situation). This is why they have limited influence on the world, and have their own agenda (its part of the fic), but ultimately they want to collect souls.

******** Since it sounds like they are neutral in good vs evil, I would choose desire over avarice. It's more versatile as you can desire power for a good reason and still have your soul taken.

**** I didn't say that. I said that there /were/ Dark Wizards who become Dark Wizards because they wanted power above all else (Voldemort basically being one of them, though there are also elements of Fear with his flight from death). And "greed" --- as "avarice" --- feels more centered on material goods than on the psychological craving for power over others /for its own sake/.

** Also, what about "sadism"? The sheer enjoyment of hurting others? That definitely seems to be what Bellatrix Lestrange mostly uses the Dark Arts for.

** I like grief and apathy... rage and hatred seem more like reactions and not something that I would point out as some deep motivation towards the dark. Terror is okay, but maybe not clear enough what that is supposed to be. Living in constant terror? Maybe fear would be more appropriate. *Avarice* is a bit 'blah'. I don't see how that necessarily connects to the Dark Arts. You might as well add gluttony and all the other sins.

I'd probably add *love* to the list, but it's a bit unintuitive and might make people say "huh?". What about things like misanthropy and narcissism?

*** Yeah, I was never sold on rage/hatred to be honest.

Fear is good, I just thought terror sounded more like what some god-like figure would relate themselves with.

Avarice I plan to replace with desire, which encompasses all those.

The seventh reason is sacrifice: taking up the dark arts to save somebody else, or to protect others, or to defeat a stronger enemy that threatens others. I see love as part of that theme.

Yeah. Terror isn't bad, I just felt like you'd probably have to explain it because out of five people each one could take it to mean something different.

The Avarice vs Desire change is great. I like that much better!

I approve! Sacrifice is interesting too... Maybe I'm trying too hard to "undermine expectations", but to me the points shouldn't be too obvious as "evil" - if you want something that makes someone go down a dark path and not describing someone who already arrived? Does that make sense?
