:END:
A fic where Harry somehow gets into contact with I believe Ignatius Peverell? The one whom the cloak belonged to anyway. And Peverell is inside his head and trains him in combat and so on and later makes Voldemort kneel at his feet during the battle in the Ministry...

#+begin_quote
  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU.On Hiatus.[Rewritten as Monochrome]
