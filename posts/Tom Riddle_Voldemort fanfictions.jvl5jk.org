Does anyone know any Tom Riddle fanfictions where the love interest is as dark or darker than himself? I feel like that would be an interesting concept to read, him finding out there's someone out there like him and they attempt to rule the wizarding world together. I haven't been able to find a good one with this concept yet.


** I think this could go in that direction, if anyone wants to do it.

Also, wrong flair. This should be request.

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

  Two boys grow up together in an orphanage, grow powerful at school, are torn apart by death and brought back together by rebirth. Horcruxes aren't the only way to live forever. Necromancy, reincarnation, HP/TR Slash dark!Harry.
