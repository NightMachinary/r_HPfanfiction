Basically, I'm looking for Order-centric Remus/Tonks fics. Preferably in which Sirius lives. No character bashing.


** Hmm...it's not especially Order-centric, and it's very long, but there's decent Remus/Tonks in the linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) series. (And Sirius is a main character.)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
