I wrote [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/203519800-this-is-us][this fanfiction]], and it's still in progress, but do read it and tell me what you think in the comments! Here is a description of the story!

/'The Weasleys have always been a chaotic, yet charming family. Here is a story which tells us about the siblings' love. About how the Weasley men could often be so tactless. About how one half of the Wealsey twins falls hopelessly in love - with his little brother's best friend. How she rejects him at first, but eventually their is hope. How Hermione and Ginny are as close as sisters. How the Weasleys have practically adopted Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. How the Weasley brothers treat Hermione like their own sister {except for a particular prankster}. The Weasley family is insanely crazy, but so incredibly loving at the same time. Will true love blossom? Will the Weasley family live a happily-ever-after after all their struggles? Or will the be drowned in sorrow?{Fremione}/

/"No family is perfect. We argue, we fight, we shout. We even stop talking at times, but in the end family is family... the love is always there. Family is where we are loved and where we can love"'/
