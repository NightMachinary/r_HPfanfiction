*** True enough, but he kind of screwed him up. I mean, nowhere near what happens in most manipulative!Dumbledore and when we see it from his perspective plus how the whole thing ended up it actually does make sense, but it doesn't change the fact that he shoved Harry with the Dursley's and for a moment we believed he actually planned Harry's death (before he explained the whole resurrection thing). I honestly think he did what from his perspective seemed to be the best for all, including Harry himself, but he was the root of a considerable part of Harry's problems.

**** True enough.

I think Dumbledore's problem is two-fold: first, he refuses to act sometimes even when he should, because of his baggage and fear of becoming like Grindlewald. And second, he has to juggle the needs of being a spymaster and politician leading the fight against Voldemort with the needs of being a headmaster and professor, and it sometimes results in conflicts of interest (for example, staffing Hogwarts positions for strategic reasons rather than hiring the best teacher).
