I've seen more Harry time-travels than I can count, and many, many time travel stories where Hermione or Ginny or Luna travels back to the Marauders' era.

But I don't think I've ever seen Neville as a Peggy Sue. So yeah, I'd like to see if there are any of those. I'd prefer Neville traveling back to his own school years, and please no slash.


** Well this is funny...I'm actually outlining my own Neville time travel story right now because good grief no one even cares to utilize him like they care.

I actually found a time travel story in the pov of Neville but Hermione went for a ride with him so guess what?

After 2 chapters it became a Hermione pov story where Neville doesn't do much and relies heavily on Hermione..

I've never felt so cheated in my life before

Also, Neville has to operate like he's Neville.

Think about it like Spy Neville. He knows things Neville isn't supposed to know, he knows how to do things that a lot of characters can and can't do but he has to act in a way so he doesn't draw attention to what he's really doing

** That would be good, Neville is a character that is often underestimated, to see the lad go back in time and how that would affect the future events would be a pretty interesting fic to read. Unfortunately, I have never found smthg like that, the closest thing is a story about a self insert as Neville called Neville Longbottom and the Harry Potter. linkffn(4437308)

****** Interesting. Time travel stories usually have the characters (Snape, Hermione, Harry) turn more slippery, with long, intricate plans to ruin enemies completely, but I bet there would be something really fun about not changing Neville's straightforwardness. I mean, the guy basically tells Voldemort to suck it, gets set on fire, then literally pulls a sword from a hat and kills a bigass snake with it. A cunning person sent back in time would probably decimate or manipulate their childhood bully, but I really love the idea of Neville casually being like stay the hell away from me or I'll knock your face in, Malfoy being a little shit again, and Neville responding by literally beating the shit out of him. So straighforwardly badass - very Neville

** It's getting weird but I'm actually writing a Time Traveler Neville too, lol.

In my version it's Bad Future but the time travel is quite accidental (he didn't mean to do it, only wished so and bam! Magic happens).

Then, as the years progress Neville begins to see a pattern in things from his past that will lead to the Bad Future he came from. The issue is that when he interferes, he has nightmares of his future and most of the time his meddling results in worse things happening later.

I don't have pairings and I don't think they'll be included until he finishes Hogwarts (currently writing fifth year), if at all. Not only because my Neville is 45 years old, but also because the plot is focused on the changes in the timeline.

I have the ending already written (the first thing I wrote) but as the story moved on I'm thinking of changing it... Neville's been messing with the events that lead to it, so now there's the original timeline, what could have happened and what will happen. It's weird.

** I like the idea of a Neville time travel fic though I don't know of any. I kind of have an idea for one though. I really wish I was a good writer.

Here is my attempt at an intro:

The Quibbler

The Complete Unauthorized Autobiography of Neville Longbottom

By the Blibbering Humdingers

“They might've run straight through to the hall,” said the rough voice.

“Check under the desks,” said another.

Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, “STUPEFY!”

A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.

“Avada ---”

Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death

Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry.

Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS!”

Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done.

“Get out of the way, Harry!” yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, “STUPEFY !”

The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered ---

Then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered.

Then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered.

Then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered.

Then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered.

Neville gaped, plainly horrorstruck, as the jet of red light drew back into his wand, then flew out again towards the cabinet, knocking it over.

The stunner. In. Out.

The cabinet. Up. down.

His breath. In. Out.

Neville's failure ebbed and flowed like the tide for countless, timeless cycles as a fuzzy calm came over him. He knew it was not a nightmare despite the superficial similarity. The absence of Snape or his accustomed stable position in spacetime didn't seem like his brain's style. He vaguely wondered if this was what it felt like to not be anxious all the time as the formerly distinct boundary between “Neville” and “Not Neville” faded.

--------------

Basic premise: when Neville broke the time turners, it created a stable time loop. He now spends his time cultivating potential universes instead of plants by sending signals back in time.

Constraints:

1. Every successful universe must include Neville destroying those time turners.

2. He can only send back information. Seeds of causality. AKA prophecies. So each iteration only makes minor changes.

3. He has to vanquish the dark lord in order to escape the loop.

If anyone wants to run with it, its up for grabs. Im bad at writing.

**** Thanks. I was about to continue with it but realized I genuinely have no clue how to construct a story.

I suppose the next step would be to jump to it's publication when Neville is younger so that when it actually happens he's already put some thought into it.

The premise kind of lends itself more to munchkinry than narrative fiction I think.
