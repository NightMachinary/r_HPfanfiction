#+TITLE: First couple pages in an original story that uses expository versions of HP characters. Looking for feedback on story idea itself, first draft so I don't need grammar feedback since I'll be editing a number of times.

Lit.High.1 (exported versions of literary characters all going to the same high school(like drawn together or clone high). Goal is 9 books, two books per year of high school, all taking place concurrently over one year, with two stories per year following different exported protagonists from various media, parodying different stories.)

Harmony Silo put the paper down, looking over at James Evans as he walked into the school. She watched him stop to breathe on his student council president photo and wipe it clean of kiss prints from various girls---and a surprising number of boys, throwing high-fives and disarming grins all around as the sheeple bowed down before him.

She sighed, unwillingly admitting to herself he somewhat deserved it. Just before Spring Break he had traveled to Lord Darken's Forbidding Forbidden Fortress--that all were forbade to travel to--and with a dozen news crews filming, had magically dueled him to a stand still with no help while battling his Necromuncher minions, summoned an ancient artifact from beyond the mists of time---an obscenely blinged out sword covered with fat rubies and amber gems that by legend could only be summoned by the heir to the the first headmaster of their old purely magical school, then cut Lord Darken in half from the top of his snakey head to his groin. Lord Darken had exploded into a mass of snakes that then exploded into gibs.

It had stopped a hidden war of bigots out to kill off people like her, magicals born to mundanes. The rumors in the Daily Soothsayer had James only a few votes away from being begged to be Emperor of a United Magical nation.

When he looked her way, he gave her the same grin and she felt her wand slide from her wrist holster. Only a quick move stopped it from flying towards him. She scowled. His power---as defined by a prophecy spoken a year before he was born---was to be Metaphorically Literal. It had been a living hell as he grew up she always assumed.

James sat down in front of her and his eyes twinkled merrily as he smiled at her. She sighed. “What do you want?”

“Can I borrow your Alchemy notes? Mine were lost over spring break.”

She nodded. “But they're at home.”

“So I'll stop by.”

“You know where I live?”

“No, I just figured you would either let me drop you off after class or tell me where,” he said, raising an eyebrow.

“I'll meet you here after class,” she said, looking like it hurt.

~•~

As Harmony followed James out to the student parking lot, she came to a dead stop. “What. Is. That?”

He smiled as he turned back to her then looked back at the glistening white Koenigsegg One:1. “Uncle Sothis got it for me for, well, surviving. Cool, isn't it?”

Harmony held back the snarky comment she wanted to say, that it was a very expensive looking penis compensation, and instead nodded. In the back of her mind she did have to admit it was cool looking.

He opened the door for her and she carefully slid in, clutching her backpack so it wouldn't scratch the car. She knew it was a hypercar because of her father watching the braying moron Jeremy Clarkson and she knew it was expensive but beyond those two facts, she didn't really care.

“So fly or road?” he asked.

“It flies?!”

He grinned and flipped up the carbon fibre oval on her side of the dash and she saw it magically expand and show it was covered with dozens of runic formulas, various knobs, and a block of a thousand octarescent pearls that she assumed were powering the spells on the vehicle.

“How can you break all the laws?” Against magical enchanting mundane items magically.

“When we were eleven, you remember how you suggested I should donate to charity?”

Her eyes widened. “You remembered that?”

He nodded as the car rose into the air and he flipped a toggle that said Invisibility Booster. “Anyway, that led me to another idea because you were complaining about the lack of indexes in the books at our old school.” Before the magical world had been revealed to the mundanes when they were fourteen, they had gone to boarding school in a castle in Eureka, Oregon that had been transplanted from Atlantis before it had fallen into the ocean centuries before the ‘discovery' of the New World by mundanes.

“So, Uncle Sothis and Uncle Remo took my original idea---to create indexes for all books---and turned it into a new series of books, Encyclopedia Arcana. The first edition will be released in about six years they think. They distill every book on magic down to its base. There're over two hundred magicals working on it.”

She stared at him, her jaw dropping down, revealing the hint of elongated canines from an accident in their second year. “How come you never mentioned it before?”

“Because you stopped talking to me about the time the idea got finalized.

“Where's your place at from here?”

She looked out the window and realized their were only a few hundred feet in the air. It took her a few moments to figured out she was looking at Oak St and 14th Way. “Two blocks south and one east.”

He checked for traffic on a magical equivalent of a RADAR then settled down to the ground and her eyes widened at the sound of the engine whining loudly.

“It was silent before.”

“Because flying is for stealthiness, loud cars are a safety mechanism.”

She looked at the RPM counter and saw it went up to 8000 and it passed a red arrow as James hit the paddle to upshift.

He parked the car in front of her house just as her dad opened the door to get the mail. Harmony resisted the urge to giggle at her father's flabbergasted expression and the mail dropping to the ground as the passenger door scissored open, revealing her.

“Hello, Mr Silo,” James said as the man walked to the car while Harmony walked up the stone path and into the house.

“This car is amazing. I never thought I'd see one this close.”

James got out. “Take her for a test drive, Mr Silo.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. She's set to manumatic mode so just shift with the paddles---Right up, left down---when she hits about forty nine hundred.”

Mr Silo slid into the seat and James helped him adjust the seat then got the passenger door down.

A moment later he was halfway down the street.

James chuckled.

Harmony walked out and asked, “Where's your car?”

“Your dad's taking it for a test drive. Thanks,” he said as he took the notes she held out. He read a few pages. “It's so much easier now that we don't have to use quills, eh?”

She nodded. “I miss the castle, though.”

“They're going to turn it into a higher education. For those of us who want to get Masteries and they'll have it affiliated with Willamette University so we can get minors in mundane stuff.”

“I know. But they said it could be years.”

“Sothis threw money at them. He was the angel investor for a few tech companies that blew up recently.”

She wanted to ask which ones but didn't because her father reappeared with the cops hot on his tail.

A few words from James and some autographs and a smile that---literally---charmed the two cops, her dad was let off with a mild warning and James was on his way.

“He is so cool!” her father gushed.

Harmony scowled and went to her room.


** It reads like a fusion between /Harry Potter/ and some shoujo magical high school manga.

Any minute now, flame-haired Bilius Prewett will appear and challenge James to a duel over who gets to date Harmony.

***** I kinda planned on having her punch him out on the reveal of the bet and end the story there.

Or have it end on a Carrie moment where Hermione accidentally magicks everyone after they dump blood on her at the dance.

Or something else. Dunno yet.

****** I don't know about having Hermione punch him out; but I think that the Carrie moment wouldn't be Hermione. Hermione in canon can be pretty darned vicious and vindictive: certainly not a person you want to cross, but when she takes revenge, she does it with conscious use of magic, planning, and manipulation, not accidental magic or impulsiveness --- that's more Harry's domain.

A question worth asking in your premise is that, in all appearances, Harry and Hermione haven't spoken in a few years. In those years, Harry has become Rich, Powerful, Confident, and Suave and defeated Voldemort; what interesting things could Hermione have gotten done in the meantime?

******* James(Harry) has ALWAYS been RPC&S. in the story, Uncle Sothis Noir(Sirius) had him since his parents' death. He's a little bit like his dad in canon but because Sothis learned from the past and, while he spoiled his godson, he also made sure the boy understood that with privilege comes responsibility. but none of that is really important in a parody.

She's the focus next, with her getting a tour of the research center/finishing university I think. I may just keep freewriting for a few thousand more words until i hit ten k then use that to outline and redo my original outline. I'm kinda not feeling the prom bet anymore.
