Note: Westeros is in my story a magical continent created by the Children of the Forest. It is connected to Greenland and the Northern Easternmost tip of Africa.

Edit: I have not started writing it yet but I plan to start soon. I plan to incorporate the War of the Five Kings into the Harry Potter Universe.


** I'm confused. Is this a world where hogwarts and everything are in the world of Westeros?

*** Voldemort likes one Peter and he does not like the other Peter. He's going to love Ramsay like a son in this story lol. He will hate Joffrey though.

** Erm... Okay. So. So. There's a lot to unpack here.

First: "Westeros is in my story a magical continent created by the Children of the Forest. It is connected to Greenland and the Northern Easternmost tip of Africa." That's A HELL of a large continent that you're going to have to explain away without using a fidelius consider that's like, a huge portion of the Atlantic ocean.

Second, your going to need to set up more backstory to explain how the two works are merged. Most HPxGoT stories are set in the GoT universe for a reason OR are just the characters in Hogwarts. There's something to be sad about jumping into a story but in this case, your going to have to establish your setting.

Also, this is a large change with Arya being Lyanna's daughter... Are you still planning on R+L=J? if so, again: you need to explain your changes other than you just like it that way.

Lastly, you need to figure out how Westeros magic works in the HP-world. A large complaint most readers have about these crossovers is that HP magic is clearly more versatile than Westeros magic. It's a solid concern that unless you write in reasons why your characters are as powerful as they are our what their abilities are, you'll be able to stomp over the First Men characters even with their greensight, the warning, etc.

Anyway; it's an interesting premise. Feel free to send a PM or reply if you want to talk more. Best of luck!

*** R+L Does not equal Jon and Arya in this story. I don't want to give away the first twist but it's very guessable if you look closely.

** So I saw the map you posted on thecitadel and was confused, reading this just adds more questions. Without even incorporating the Harry Potter technology or abilities the placement of your continents greatly changes the make up of Westeros. With no narrow sea the east coast will have lost much of its wealth since trade routes are now much longer the north however has a nearby trading partner with Canada so they will be much more prosperous than in canon. The distance from essos to Westeros and having Africa in between also makes those plots eventually moving to Westeros difficult.

With Harry Potter tech and abilities Westeros has to be fundamentally different non magical and magical transportation from hp would be earth shattering the Westeros. I think there are some kinks you need to workout before starting the story or your plot will suffer when it seems like your ignoring established abilities for no reason other than to make your story work

*** The map is just to prove that Westeros and Essos can fit on Earth. Westeros and Essos are hidden by the fidulus charm. Also, the Crownlands and the Dornishlands does trading with Africa and Spain, The Riverlands, the Westernlands do trading with North America. The North with Canada. And Dorne and the Reach with South of Africa, Essos, and India.
