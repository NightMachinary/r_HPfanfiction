Just finished re-reading linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction) and was wondering if I'm missing out on other fics that might be forgotten by now since they were written prior to the end of canon with DH. Anyone have old gems to recommend that I might not have come across, having started reading ff only a few years ago?

I should note that I've read all of the major recommendations that tend to come across this subreddit week to week; in comparison, TPatS was started in 2002 (pre-OotP) and has very few reviews. I'm looking for something more in that ballpark, unlikely as it may be.

*** Wanted to come back and say thanks for the recs! I'd read some of BCGE before but stopped around the time [[/spoiler][they first arrived on Earth That Was]]. Finished it all the way through this time and enjoyed it immensely.

I'm also surprised at how much I'm enjoying The Seventh Horcrux! I was worried it was going to be heavy on romance after the first few chapters, but it really levels out into an excellent DH-AU story. The way that [[/spoiler][the horcruxes are dealt with - I'm only halfway through so far]] really feels like canon. Also, I'm baffled at how many things the author managed to accurately predict before DH actually came out.

Haven't tried the others yet, though I think I started Old Soldiers Never Die way back when and couldn't get past the writing style.
