** I wasn't aware that there was even a discussion here. I always assumed the Mary Sue was a well established and defined trope concept.

*** I mean more that (ESP in the realm of fan fiction if you create an OC story running parallel to Canon OR Sandboxing in the world) how do you deal with having a strong protagonist playing within the rules set for the world and not have it labeled a Mary Sue.

**** What Mary Sues basically are, are half-made characters. You fill them up with good stuff, with their heroics and then you don't give them flaws. Or rather, you don't make them face the consequences of their flaws.

A great OC, for example, is Calypso Rosier in "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" by The Santi. She is very well balanced in how her rather hot temper affects people around her. There are people who genuinely dislike her. Then there are people who merge well with her, like Krum and Harry in that story. And even between those there are sometimes tensions when the characters agencies collide.

If you have a character that "plays with the ruleset" as you say, then it all depends on the character growth you have them do. Mary Sues don't grow in their character because they are by default perfect and everything they would have to learn either comes very easy to them or is invalid. If your character grows with research, trial and error, hard work, sacrifice... and eventually ends up being at the top of the world you have a great classic hero figure.

What Mary Sues often do is that they skip the second Act. The Three Act Structure or the Hero's Journey both have the second act as the act of trial, or growth and defeat, of sacrifice by the hero. The Mary Sue jumps straight from the "Call to Action" to the resolution by being just so much better than the villain. Any adversity this character faces is at best superficial, or, even worse, completely depending on her own "inner turmoil" about some angsty stuff (like choosing between the +werewolf+ shapeshifter and the glitter-"vampire").

To be honest, I don't think it's possible. The problem is the word "protagonist". We already have an idea of who the important characters are in the HP world so introducing an OC and making them important feels like an artificial invasion into the established order - like the video says, it appears that the world has been manipulated to reorient itself around this new OC.

** I think she brings up many good points.

I've struggled with the concept of a Mary Sue in the past. This more than others helped me navigate my thoughts.

Your thoughts?
