...except it's the fanon world, staring a manipulative!Dumbledore, Ron being a straight A-dick, Molly being payed Galleons from the Potter vault by Dumbledore, Ginny wants to use love potions on Harry to marry him and then steal the Potter fortune, Lord Harry Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor (...and so on...), Harry turning Dark and spending time with Daphne (the Ice Queen of Slytherin) + Tracey (the fun one), and Misunderstood!Voldemort.

...leaving a very confused and distraught OC-SI fretting over if their knowledge of the future would be of any use since they've only ever read the books 3 times and really don't remember any of this happing.

*** Yes, and those guys are not worth saving anyway. The best outcome would be them destroying each other.

I personally would use my future knowledge to make good investments in the Muggle world and live grandly there.

**** Excatly or Rob some banks in small towns, far away from any ministry of magic. Magic makes Bank robbery rather easy after all. A disillusionment charm and the unlocking charm and even the newest vault door opens

***** No no no, robbing Muggle banks is too unprofitable and risky. Do you know that average bank heist yields no more than $10k? Using memory charms to get awarded millions in stock options from those multi-billion USD/GBP/EUR Muggle corporations is far better. But the real profitable part is to use that million to invest in the next big thing, which you know from the future! For example, AOL and Cisco stocks had gone up at least 500 times from 1991 to 2000. These earnings are perfectly legit way to amplify your initial capital.

As for how to convert Muggle money into Galleons, here are some examples:

- Diversify some of stock option millions/billions into buying deeply distressed Muggle real estate, and use Reparo to fix them up. Add a few more good wards, they become Wizarding properties that can now be sold for Galleons. Hey, even the Dursley house could be connected to the Floo network!
- Diversify more of their portfolio into precious metals, such as gold. Goblins seem to take physical gold, maybe even Wizards themselves.
- Diversify a small part into exchanging for Galleons directly. Even if you make the exchange 50:1 (vs 5:1 in the Books), [[https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/hermione-granger-london-house-hits-the-market][Hermione's house]] would still fetch 48000 Galleons. Remember the Twins were able to open a big shop in Wizarding Britain's prime shopping district for only 1000 Galleons.

Since I'm on the run from fanon dumbeldore I wouldn't convert anything.

Also if we're in fanon does that mean that we have giant vaults full of galleons? Because if that's the case I'd take a lot of those before I run. Seeing as I could probably melt them down to pure gold. That would be easy money, unless their enchanted against that sorta thing.

******** But the fanon RoR has all the stuff you will ever need, and it can all be removed from the room and sold, not to mention loose change as well.
