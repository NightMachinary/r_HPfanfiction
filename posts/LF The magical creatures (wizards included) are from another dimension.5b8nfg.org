So I had this zany thought; what if the reason that magic exists in the Harry Potter world, and it has the seeming ability to override local laws of physics, is because all of the magical creatures, and magical races (or rather, their predecessors) came from another dimension?

The reason that wizards would be so resilient and dragons can fly with their body weight and there are so many magical races compared to the one non-magical, is because they originate from another dimension where such is normal, and they impose a little bit of their dimensional physics on 'our' world just by being present; presumably, if a 'muggle' found their way to this other dimension, the other world (which would presumably be high-fantasy-ish) would bend for them in the same way, allowing them to bring things like electronics, chemistry, and possibly some diseases to bear in ways that the 'magic dimension' can't resist effectively.

I understand that Harry Potter & The Natural 20 employs an idea something like this; Milo the D&D wizard plays by his universe's rules, only being able to cast so-many spells per day but being able to use spells (divinations, raise dead) that HP-verse wizards can't, while Bellatrix Lestrange isn't bound by the turn order in Milo's home universe.

Has anybody considered this concept? Of intruders from one dimension being able to override local laws/logic with their own physics? And working it into a Harry Potter fanfic?
