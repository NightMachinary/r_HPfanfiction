*Summary:* When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years.

The first two chapters can be found on [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/785942/chapters/1482358][AO3]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9265719/1/][FFN]].

I'll be posting every Tuesday and Friday. The finished story is 112 chapters and about 397,000 words. I have finished writing it, for those of your concerned about the promise of regular updates. :)


** Yikes!! You /really/ need to rethink the format. These tiny one paragraph perspective skips are seven shades of awful.

Here's an example of perspective skips and POV swapping [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][done right.]]

And for God's sake, don't ever use parentheses for exposition inside the story. That's a huge no-no when writing fiction.

*** I figured there'd be someone (probably several someones) who dislike the formatting, but it's the way the story worked for me and bugger anyone who thinks I'm re-writing ~400,000 words of story.

Your input is appreciated and upvoted, but intentionally ignored.

**** Except you totally should take out the exposition in parentheses. It's horrible to read and jolts me right out of the story

***** Yeah, the format is bad, but it's the parentheses that really make me cringe.

****** Alright, just for clarification because I can be obtuse sometimes: is the problem the parentheses, the exposition, or the two together?

******* The parentheses.

Parentheses are generally used to de-emphasize text, or to include text that does not fit with the flow of the thought but you still want to include.

You shouldn't be doing either of those things in fiction because in either case, you're inserting your own perspective into the narrative.

*Edit:* The only instance I can think of where this would be acceptable is when you establish yourself as the narrator (i.e. when you make yourself part of the story).

Something like:

/Hi, my name is Jim and I'll be your narrator today./

Harry was cold (and by cold I mean freezing his balls off).

***** I agree. Some of them could be turned into description, but the rest need to be removed.

** I haven't actually read more than a dozen or so paragraphs (Abusive!Dursleys are just not my cup of tea), but I just wanted to let you know that I actually quite enjoy your style of writing. It's fresh and poetic. Unfortunately, I have to agree that it /will/ get extremely tiresome after a few chapters. I know you don't want to rewrite this, but this style should really be reserved for short stories. It's just too choppy to sustain a 400,000 word fic.

** I'm enjoying it, and don't mind that it's not written traditionally. If I wanted something typical, I'd read published novels. Rock on, I'll be following your story.

** To be honest, I just went to take a look because of this fuss about your writing style - and boy I was rewarded.

I like your style. I /loved/ the bit about - about one of my favourite characters ever, there in the second episode, and the story went from nice to amazing just like that.

And I hate it that I found this before it was completed. Damn I hate waiting.

EDIT: I also checked out your favourite stories for new pieces to read, and was not disappointed. Will continue to stalk.
