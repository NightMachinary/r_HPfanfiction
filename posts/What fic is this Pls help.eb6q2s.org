:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What I remember is that Harry is in self exile because he can not control his powers. He doesn't leave his house. And either Ron or Hermione brings Draco to his home because Draco needs protection and Harry's place is the safest option. I think somewhere in the story, Harry's home gets attacked. Draco and Harry do not get along until they do. And I think Harry has another character (possibly an OC) bring stuff over to the house (maybe even works with Harry) Harry might be a mechanic but that I really don't remember much. Thanks in advance.


** Sounds similar to but not exactly fitting Anchor by Dracosoftie. I think she pulled it down because I'm having issues finding a link, but Harry is basically a shut in because of unstable magic, he's got an OC female assistant, and he makes custom brooms. Draco comes to get a broom made and figures out it's Harry because the glamor that hides him from his customers doesn't work on people who have a strong emotional connection to him and, over the course of the story, they figure out that Draco has magic compatible in the right way to do some kind of stabilizing transplant so Harry can safely go out again.

#+begin_quote
  When Draco's cover is blown during a deep undercover operation and the Ministry is compromised, Ron takes Draco to the only safe place he can think of---Potter. Hiding out with a taciturn Harry Potter, who has been missing from the Wizarding World for almost two decades after a shocking fall from grace, is nothing like Draco thought it would be. Draco has to navigate dealing with this Potter while being hunted by Dark wizards and wanted by extremists in the Ministry. When things take a turn for the worse, Draco has to decide whether he's going to keep running or find a way to protect the world and the people he cares about most.

** Im just confused on why they would a: help Draco, and b: decide that shut-in Harry who can't control his powers is the best place.. or maybe they hope Harry might accidentally vaporize Draco? Could be a good plotline, Ron and Hermione gets all the Death Eaters killed in mysterious accidental ways :P

*** I think there was spells on the house to suppress his powers which is why Harry stays there. It's his choice to. He doesn't want to leave, they're not forcing him to stay there. It's post war, I don't remember why exactly they're helping Draco.

**** I wasn't commenting on the fic itself, but on the premise of said fic :) im not a fan of draco (i tend to exclude all fics with snape and draco tags in them) so all chances to mock Draco is to be taken :P

**** Yeah, sounds exactly like the convulted nonsense some slash authors go through to get Harry and Draco to fuck each other.
