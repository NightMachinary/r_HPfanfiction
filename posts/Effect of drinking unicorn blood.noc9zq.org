According to canon it gives you a "cursed half-life", but what does this functionally mean? How was Quirrel's life different after drinking the blood?


** I've always read it as a killing of the spirit, in a way. Not literally destroying the soul like a dementor, but draining a person of what makes them a person until they're a shadow of themself.

So it's taking away their ability to enjoy the taste of food, or feeling rested after sleep, and emotions are muted, any joy or sorrow or anger or triumph has basically been dampened permanently. So you basically cannot enjoy the remainder of your life.

*** So a bit like the curse on the crew of the Black Pearl in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie? I like that. Of course, they don't become skeletons under the moonlight (duh), but it makes you immortal/keeps you alive while having major drawbacks that pertain to quality and human attributes of life.

*** This could get /scary/ applied to Voldemort: He doesn't tend to experience joy or pleasure from normal things, but rather from triumph and sadism. What would he do, how much would he escalate, if his more ordinary crimes stopped satisfying him?

** My interpretation of the curse is that once the effect wears off, you cannot heal anymore. Your skin cells don't replace each other, your blood doesn't clot, nothing. You'll quickly go into complete organ failure. However if you have the means to do so, you can keep living as long as you have unicorns to kill and drink their blood.

However, I believe it comes from HPMOR where they say that you need to kill the unicorn by drinking the blood, so you can't hit it with a killing curse and then drink. You need to find a way to incapacitate a unicorn and drink its blood directly from the source until it dies from blood loss.

You can't store the blood either, it needs to be drunken from a live unicorn.

My fic slowly reveals about this.

** Quirell was possessed and all but a shell already. Tom had a tattered soul. For these, there was probably not much for the curse to do.

** I think it had to do with the soul/essence of a person. For Quirrel, although he was possessed by Voldemort who had already ripped his soul, I think it affected Quirrel himself as well. His essence became tainted and unclean and he became less human . This may mean that his soul itself was damaged, his magic may have become tainted, or his loss of humanity/self. Basically changing him irrevocably in a negative way.

** Hear me out but what if it's cursed but not in the death way but your wackiest worst nightmare. Like for example quirrelmort gets deage to a baby who can't use their magic at that age.

** In ao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy), drinking unicorn blood (1) curses you with depression, which will inevitably lead to your suicide and (2) cures many negative ailments and temporarily suppresses the others, including the suicidal depression curse.

** Didn't it say in Canon that it only gives you a cursed half-life if you forcibly take the blood? And aside from the curse it functions similar to Phoenix tears I think was mentioned.
