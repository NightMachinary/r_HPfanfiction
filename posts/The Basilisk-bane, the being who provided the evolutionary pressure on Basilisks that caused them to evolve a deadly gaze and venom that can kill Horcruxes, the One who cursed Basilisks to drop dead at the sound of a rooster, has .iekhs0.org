**** Why?! This is bloody creature creation at its finest?! Okay so based on your prompt; Is this creature avian in nature (birds are a natural predator of snakes)? Could it be the true root of where the Thunderbird came from? Or a spider? There's spiders that catch birds and snakes? The lethal gaze of the basilisk would indicate it needed speed to survive this predator, so was the predator fast or had it long ranged attacks?

For goodness sake it could be one of the great eagles from middle earth?! Or it could be an entity (demon or an old god)?! It's a shame that it hasn't be examined and played with. It's also a shame I have the mental fortitude of jelly right now or else I'd enjoy having a go.
