***** I imagine it similar to the alcohol content in kombucha. A person would have to drink 8-10 bottles to get the same effect as one beer. A tiny elf on the other hand could feel the effects right away.

***** It means it is a small beer

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer]]

Small beers have very low alcohol content. Historically, they were drunk by all ages because water wasn't always safe. Fermented drinks were less likely to go bad than stored water.

Incidentally, this is also where the name comes from. A buttery is a place used to store alcohol during medieval times, such as weak beer.

** Muggle Hogwarts students...?

Regardless, not really sure what the prompt is intended to mean. Muggle teenagers already drink alcohol so I'm not sure how adding butterbeer to the mix makes any difference.

**** Are you telling me that all those high school house parties in movies are inaccurate?

It's almost as if you're suggesting that Hollywood would lie to me.

***** Of course, every American girl is a supermodel, and all of them have perfect body, brilliant mind, and very friendly personality.

However, I have been truly shocked when I heard from my American friends, how many of them never tried alcohol, and how many of their parents are serious in offering alcohol even to your own children under twenty-one at home is a crime (which apparently it is ... I was in a dry state, so laws are probably slightly more strict, but still).

And yes, then I was also shocked by how many frat parties of firsties ended up with alcohol poisoning, including fatal ones.

**** Nope, it's more that beer has been the default drink for most of history, though it is illegal to buy or sell underage, no doubt a reaction to the fact that we're a nation of binge drinkers.
