So...yeah. Basically I'm looking to see if anybody wants to read a story where Harry meets the 8 main Universal Monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, Gill Man, the Invisible Man, the Phantom of the Opera, Imhotep, and the Bride) over the course of his time at Hogwarts, befriends them, and they help him defeat Voldemort.

*** Forget the 'if it's relatively well written' thing. There are fics out there with hundreds of reviews to their name... despite the typos left lingering in the summary. Seeing a summary for a story with over three hundred reviews whilst featuring blunders that cause me physical pain to see is quite honestly one of those things that induces uncommon feelings of rage & despair in my very soul.

** There's only one problem with this-most of the creatures listed there have either been rendered completely & utterly insane by what happened to them or have a very humanitarian diet to account for.

*** Well, these would be updated and contemporary versions I admit. I see no reason why the Wolfsbane potion wouldn't work on the Wolfman. And remember, Dracula doesn't have to kill when he feeds.

**** Just don't do the 'Hellsing Abridged' thing to them. I admit that Abridged!Alucard is a helluva lot of fun to read, but portraying Bram Stoker's Dracula that way? By Merlin's Hairy chin & jowls, please no.

***** ...I wasn't even aware there was a Hellsing Abridged. No, these will be mostly close to their originals, though the circumstances leading to the Wolfman being so different from the Harry Potter standard werewolf will leave him pretty angry, and the Bride will be a bit different since she was never given an actual personality in the movies. Oh, and Dracula may or may not be a mix of Bela Lugosi and Dracula Untold, haven't decided for certain yet.
