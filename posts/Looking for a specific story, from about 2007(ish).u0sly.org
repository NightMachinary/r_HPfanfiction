Tis is my first post on here, so sorry if it's in the wrong place.

I read a Granger/Snape on Ashwinder a while back and was hoping someone could help me find it again. From what I remember, Snape comes to Hermione when they are hiding out in the forest of dean, and they have some alone time whilst Ron and Harry get the sword and destroy the locket. It was quite melancholy.

Any help would be massively appreciated!

** I think I know the one you're talking about. I thought I'd favorited it, but perhaps not... You could try going through the angst category and seeing if you can find it in the archives from 2007. I'll keep an eye out for it - I quite liked that story!
