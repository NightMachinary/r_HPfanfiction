Like the title says - why would you write or read a self-insert fic? I'm not saying you're wrong to do so, and even if I felt that way it doesn't mean other people can't feel differently, but I don't entirely understand the appeal and I'm curious.

For those unaware, self-insert (or SI) fics are stories written featuring a character (most often the protagonist) that represents the author (or a fictionalised version of the author) in that world. It happens in popular published works, too - Riverworld by Philip Jose Farmer featured a SI character named Peter Jairus Frigate.


** Im kind of a fan of the concept. I like the mind experiment of, what would you do if you woke up as Harry in the hut with Hagrid, or w/e. Its interesting, how would you use knowledge of the HP world if you were dropped in it. It's not my favorite genre or anything, but I enjoy them every once in a while.

*** Huh. I hadn't considered the hypotheticals of it. That's really interesting. Kind of a furthering of Rowling's 'relate to Harry the Everyman' thing, right? Taking it one step further than his vacant gap.

**** The "HP fan dropped into HP world" genre is quite closely related to time travel redo fics, another popular genre. In both cases the character knows what's going to happen and can use that knowledge to their advantage, but a SI has only read about the future plot and still has to learn magic from scratch like everyone else, unlike a redo character who already knows magic far beyond what they should know. Also, SIs usually have a lot more knowledge about muggle tech and science, which combined with magic can lead to some interesting developments like "Lumos based laser" or "Flying, invisible and unbreakable battle tank VS Death Eaters on brooms" or "Arithmancy problems solved with Matlab" (if the SI has a programming background). There's also "let's use the Potter gold to buy 15% of Amazon stock in 1996 and be the richest man in the world two decades later".

** I'm not a writer, but I can certainly see the charm in writing yourself into your favorite stories or fantasy worlds.

And while SI isn't particularly my cup of tea, I can imagine people identifying with a story about an everyman (everyperson?) being inserted into their favorite stories or fantasy worlds.

*** So, it's the written equivalent of daydreaming yourself with a lightsaber or a wand or whatever?

I always thought the whole appeal of storytelling or reading was to experience characters who aren't you. Escapism and all that. The idea of an everyman is fine - it's what Harry is, after all - but I guess I'm getting a little hung up on the 'self-' part of the title.

**** linkffn(what's her name in hufflepuff) and linkffn(why time travel should be illegal and other morals) are very much not-canonish as far as I remember. I'm pretty sure I've read others, but those are the ones whose names I can think of.

My own linkffn(I'm the heir of what now?!) is short, unfinished, and on hiatus, but goes pretty off the rails right away. Although setting it in 2017 tends to do that regardless. xD

It's very annoying to read a story with potential, and then it just clings to canon like the character's name and personality are the only original thing the writer could come up with, and then they end up not mattering at all. Bleh.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** Just to note, SI in fanfiction doesn't always involve an actually self insert. The term is used for most "modern world character inserted into a story'. If it isn't a historical character (ex. Washington goes to Hogwarts), it usually gets called a SI.

Sensible sense saying "I am imaging what a character based on my best friend in high school would do if he was thrown into a Hogwarts world" is very similar to "I am imaging what a character based on myself would do if he was thrown into a Hogwarts world".

The inverse is also true: A self insert that has the author in the story as coming from the stories world is usually marked OC instead of self insert.

Self Insert, if taken as 'modern character with plot knowledge ends up at start of series' has the same potential for fix-it/plot commentary as a time travel fic does.

**** If the author identifies it as an insert? Sure. But how would you know otherwise?

I guess I am saying the default assumption is "sole, unknown traveler from our world enters book" is assumed to be an SI. Other cases are not. So often people looking for things marked SI are looking for that...

(And sole new in-universe character is assumed to be an OC type).

It is also important to note an author surrogate is not the same as an SI

****** Author Surrogates are characters who are used to profess the viewpoint of the author, sometimes sharing their likeness.

Bob's book contains Mob, a character that looks like Author Bob and preaches his favorite pet issue, the importance of keeping one's hair combed. = Author Surrogate

Bob's book contains a character Bob, who he writes as if 'what if i was in the story'.

Alternatively, author surrogates speak for the author, while self inserts act like the author.
