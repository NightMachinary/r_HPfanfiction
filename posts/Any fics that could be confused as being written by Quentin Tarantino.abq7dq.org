** -"Expecto Royale Ass Patronum With Cheese, Motherf*cker!"

*WHOOSH*

-"Fuck, Harry! You should warn us before using a spell like that, I think you just about popped all of these ni**as right out of existence!"

-"I couldn't resist."

-"Shit, why is there so much blood everywhere, aren't they supposed to be skeletons or something?"

-"I don't know mate, I guess it's just how it is."

-"F*CK!"

-"What's wrong ?"

-"What's wrong?! Just look at my f*cking sneakers man, you've gotten Dementor goo everywhere!"

-"So yeah, it's a little bit of a dirty work..."

-"A little dirty? A little dirty! These go*damned brand spanking new Nike are completely ruined now!"

-"Calm down, for f*ck sake! Why did you even come here dressed to the f*ucking nines, were you expecting to get a date or something?"

-"I dress like I want!"

-"Ooo look, it's me Ronald Weasley, I want to f*ck a Dementor up the a*s !"

-"Shut your f*king mouth!"

-"Look, guys, maybe we can say that the spell was a good idea but, not pointing any fingers, we should all come dressed in old clothes next time."

-"Shut up, Neville!" | "Stay out of this!"

-"BOYS!"

-"..."

-"Can we please go now?"

-"Yeah, sure."

-"Are you blushing, Ron?"

-"Shut up, Harry."

** This is a bit brutal and violent and dark, and weird. Not as quirky as QT. But you have no other recs so what the hell.

Its slash, so maybe not your thing.

  The work Harry does is justifiable. It's justice. He works for his country, and his country is a republic---the magical side, anyway. It's not laudable work, it's not work he's proud of, but it's necessary work. Harry has always taken the necessary jobs that no one else has the stomach for.It's just that he's never deciphered a kill sheet and seen Draco Malfoy's name on it.Career Choices: Harry: Hit Wizard; Draco: Anti-Government Extremist Please see the END NOTES for UNTAGGED *SPOILERY* STORY CONTENT WARNING about the ending.

** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is pretty gory and dark. Not to mention Harry from-the-future has the same "on a mission" vibe that the Bride does.
