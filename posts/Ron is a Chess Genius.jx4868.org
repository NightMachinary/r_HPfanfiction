Ok so I read this quite some time ago and I remember that Ron was sorted in Slytherin and he was a chess genius who entered competition and his mentor was Daphne's dad? If anyone knows I'd really be thankful if you can link it here.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
