**** I really enjoyed it, so I suppose take my advice with however big a grain of salt you deem necessary.

When I first read A Black Comedy, I didn't get past the prologue. Nothing stood out at me or caught my interest. Admittedly, it took quicker than 10 chapters for it to win me over when I tried again, but, in my opinion at least, the prologue and portions of chapter one are definitely the weakest parts of it. I'd recommend going through at least a couple chapters past 10 if you try again. Then end of chapter 11 kicks off the "serious" plot of the story. Not that it goes grimdark or anything like that. There's still a decent amount of Harry and Sirius screwing around, for whatever that's worth. If you've read the "Where in the World is Harry Potter" series by nonjon, I'd compare them thusly

"Where in the World is Harry Potter" is a fun romp, but with no real stakes. It's funny and very enjoyable, there are bits of mystery that make rereading it a treat, but you are never worried something bad might happen. The biggest villain is just used as a device to quickly transition from Book 1 to Book 2.

The first 10/11 chapters of A Black Comedy are pretty much the same. Some implied angst with stories of the original dimensions takeover by Voldemort, but overall the world is a toy box. From chapter 12 on, there is still romping, but it's interspersed with plot. Not necessarily the tension of say, a horror move, but a good action movie. Given the path of the story to that point, an ending along the lines of "Rocks fall; Everyone dies" is unlikely at best, but how the plot is resolved isn't immediately clear. Nonjon also puts in a couple of unique twists as well.

There is also a great amount characters from alternate dimensions interacting, which is something I love when it's done well, so perhaps I'm a bit predisposed to it.

I can be more specific if you like, but I wanted to avoid spoilers in case you do reread it

**** Sorry, I don't know of any other. I think this is the only fanfic I've ever seen, across any fandom, that describes their fic as absurdist, though I imagine other writers have probably written similar stuff without knowing their fic qualifies as absurdism. Heck, I'd forgotten it existed and how much I loved it in high school until I came across this fic.

If you liked it, I recommend checking out the author's other HP fanfics. They're written in a similar vein, especially October (linkffn(10311215)). That one has the most overt Harry/Tom in any of her fics, but it's very light and really barely qualifies (if shipping is a thing that bothers you).

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Okay, I know I'm cheating by listing two, but my favorite HP fanfic isn't my #1 favorite of all time.

Favorite of all time is actually a Naruto fanfiction called The Prodigy Namikaze linkffn(9078436)

Not terribly original in concept (Naruto's younger sibling is the jinchuriki of the Kyuubi and Naruto is neglected by his parents despite being a genius - sound familiar?) But the execution is really excellent and never gets into bashing.

Reminds me a bit of HP and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi, which happens to be my #1 favorite Harry Potter fanfic linkffn(5353809)

** Linkffn(Pedestal)

'nough said.

If you mean HP Fanfic only, I have far too many. None come anywhere near Pedestal, though. Linkffn(Gray: Scorpius Malfoy and the blood runes) is pretty good, though, but I'm waiting for it to finish and the overly-tragic backstories for EVERY. FUCKING. CHARACTER really annoy me.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** A third vote for Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106). I've read it multiple times, and I worry before starting that it will be less funny...but it's consistently hilarious! And one thing that I really, really appreciate is that despite the obnoxious narrator, it still manages to have its sweet moments. Like that ending...
