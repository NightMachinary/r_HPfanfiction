Where a big pile of money is used in a somewhat sensible way.


** Not strictly economics, but in linkao3(1113588) Harry pretty much takes over the underbelly of Wizarding Britain and becomes its crime boss.

Edit: Don't know why the bot always links an inspired by fic for Esama's stuff instead of the actual fic. Must be something about the SEO for it. Refreshing.

*** The products and services Muggles need might be easily solved by magic but the products and services witches and wizards need are still subject to the principles of supply and demand. Otherwise there would not be instances of bribery or the need to work at all.

Examples that come to mind: wands, floo powder, potion ingredients and potions themselves, enchanted items, books, magical creatures and even mundane ones (because most people would still find it unethical to steal hens and other live stock from their Muggle neighbors), to some extent food, beverages, lodging and entertainment industry. Also the services that the Ministry of Magic provides are difficult to replicate by magic such as removing curses from cursed objects, obliviating Muggles or ensuring your safety from dark magic.

*** Not really. Some things are easily duplicated and readily available for almost nothing, but many complex magical goods can be quite expensive. There's a massive industry around brooms powerful enough to lobby the government against allowing flying carpets. When it comes to enchanted objects, the magical world is almost the opposite. You can't really have a robot assemble wands or Firebolts.

Books cost a small fortune, mostly because the much smaller population results in a much lower number of copies sold. Really all kinds of intellectual property related industries would be strongly influenced by the small population.

** I did come across a fic once where Harry withdrew his money from magical Britain, which caused an economic collapse due to him having enough of it that Britain needed it to do business, which caused problems in other countries because they couldn't get supplies from Britain etc.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

** Economics is not necessary in the wizarding world. They have banks with a militarised race protecting the wealth and property of the owner class. The political class and the owner class are the same.

An economic war would require Goblins to side with a revolutionary against a tyrant, but the wizarding world appears to have a caricature of Victorian parliamentarianism. Not democratic but the 'important (wealthy)' people are still allowed to have their voice heard and grumble at whatever they dislike, so a French style revolution seems unlikely.

Maybe a Goblin rebellion would 'do it'.

/Griphook led Harry away from the desk by his elbow leaving the Sirius' matters behind. Harry apologised as he bumped past a short blonde on the way past the other tellers./

/Sitting in the rather gloomy and spartan office, Griphook began: 'Mr Potter, some of our kind are very interested in you, a scion of a House with considerable wealth and fame... How would you like to wrest some control from that allmighty omniscient Ministry that controls your and our lives? It could prove profitable for both of us.'/

/Harry looked into the sunken eyes of his account manager and replied, bemused: 'How, and... how?'/

*** The economic situation in the magical world is pretty unstable because the goblins and the aristocrats don't get along too well. A disruptive newcomer with a completely new way to make money could mess things up by a lot.
