  Lady Hermione isn't quite right in the head. Her kingdom resides in a manor full-of-monsters. She has regular conversations with the Devil and fancies a dark knight who wants to kill her in her sleep. If not for the wonderful library, she might have lost her wits completely by now.

****** That's strange. I liked /Nightmare/ at first, but then when I realized how abusive and manipulative the relationship was, I started to really dislike it. I also didn't like how OOC (Out-of-Character) Hermione was throughout the story. On the other hand, I really loved /Tied for Last/, and re-read it every now and again.

** Linkffn(5278050) it's Tom/Minerva. Kind of angsty but still a really, really good read. And Riddle somehow manages to stay in character along with Minerva. Great period piece as well. It's abandoned unfortunately, but still very much worth it.

** Linkffn(Persephone by dulce.de.leche.go)\\
Tom/Hermione, dark Hermione, AU after near the end of DH, time travel (usage of a time turner multiple times), WIP but updated regularly. Tom is pretty much always in character, and Hermione is often OOC, but for very good reason.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Rose by MissRoseAlanaHorton)\\
Regularly updated WIP, self-described as AU-ish, likable OC. Definitely recommend for a nice long read that will just keep getting longer

  She knew she loved him too much for her own good. She knew that no matter what seemingly unthinkable thing he did tomorrow or the next day, she would desperately try to wrap her head and heart around it in an attempt to understand. And there were only two ways that could possibly end: either she would break him, or he would break her. TRXOC. Lemons. AU-ish. LONG.

  Better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path. Better still to be the consort of Hades than a part of his collection of souls. Ten years after Voldemort has won the war, Hermione reaches a breaking point and shreds the flow of time to change her future. If she can't change the world, she will change her place in it. - Extremely dark Tomione/Volmione. Warnings inside.

** I'm not sure if this exactly counts as a relationship (yet?)... But it has some pretty neat dynamics between Tom and Ginny. It's relationship-ish. linkao3(left hook)

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.
