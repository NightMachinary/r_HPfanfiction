*** A hack of FFN when people visit their profile pages. I've not seen it affect mine after viewing my profile in the app. I doubt the app parses JavaScript so it should be good.

Would still copy it somewhere safe just in case though...

***** Since I already have an ao3 account, cross posting is the best avenue for me. You get the advantages of both sites. But it's just a sad fact that FFN gets way more traffic (and thus story views) on its worst days than ao3 does on its best.

** How can you tell if you've been infected? I closed mine yesterday as soon as I heard. Just checked my profile on my phone without logging in, and nothing looked out of the ordinary. Closed it right after. Do we have an ETA when things will be fixed? I've been afraid to even go on the site to check updates.

My husband told me how it works (he's a software engineer). Can I just say this is a super crummy move? Not cool.

** I may be completely overreacting, but I'm not gonna fuck around with this. I purged everything possible from my FFN profile and I'm not touching that shit until there's a solid confirmation that the issue is fixed. I have backups of backups of my fanfic, so nothing of value was lost. I've been apathetic about FFN for a long time anyway.

**** I did have an AO3 account but was getting zero traffic, so I deleted the account entirely. I might sign up again, but who knows. I did swing by Wattpad once and found it atrocious. Are there any other good archives still up?

***** FFN has been around for a long time, so a fair amount of the site is probably running on really old code. Their development team is small and therefore overworked at best, and nonexistent at worst. Combine these two together and you get a website that is likely to have security holes in it.

*** If you visit the user profile of somebody who has been infected, and you're logged into your FFN account, there is a chance that your profile will get infected as well.

Currently, all that getting infected does is screw with the contents of your profile, but there have been reports of the "virus" attempting to add a second email to your account, which would allow it to change your password and take over your account through FFN's password recovery system.
