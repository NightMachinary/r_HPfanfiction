** Okay.

I saw this thread and my first reaction was to get the hell out, because it would be too self-indulgent to jump into a thread to pimp my own stuff. Then I thought about it again and concluded that Internet anonimity lessens the shame.

If you have questions, throw 'em at me.

**** I don't want to be too spoilerific, but Sturgis always knew. That change that occurred will be addressed further in the sequel. I don't want to say more, because this ties directly into one of the central themes of the trilogy (well, the plan is for a trilogy).

****** To be honest, I don't have it yet. I'm really crap at coming up with titles. I'm insanely envious of titles like /Circular Reasoning/, /Renegade Cause/, /Criminal Limit/. Two words that, when put together, deliver a punch that describes the story abundantly and not enough at the same time. If I fail to come up with something snappy, I may just cop out and name it /Lesser Evils 2/.

******* Well, the third in your planned trilogy should obviously be /Greater Evils/. Then again, going with /Lesser Evils 2/ would sort of give it a classic action movie sequel vibe.

** I think the best part of this is that even with all the studying and advanced tutoring (from Remus, Sirius, Albus and Moody) Harry still has yet to become a top tier (Voldemort, Albus) or second tier (Sirius, Sturgis, Mulciber, /maybe/ Remus) but is still a bit below that, but clearly on the way.

I know ScottPress is taking a bit of a break since he's now completed it, but I greatly await the sequel.

*** Remus is definitely in the second tier, as you presented it, though his limited screen time may skew that assertion. I tried to show that [[/spoiler][at Malfoy Manor, where Remus throws Macnair through a wall.]] Remus is a skilled duelist, but more of a brawler than the widely respected Dumbledorean ideal of a master of magic.

**** FFN doesn't cooperate with my screen reader; I have to use a separate program or website to download the fic and then convert it into a usable form. On AO3 I can just put in the address of the page, highlight where I want it to start (or tell it to read the whole page, but if I do that, it spends five minutes reading tags to me), and tell it to start reading.

I'm not blind, but I do have other health issues that mean sometimes reading is exhausting or difficult. Doing all that for FFN means I have to know ahead of time when that's going to be the case, so I can adequately prepare. On AO3, I can still read spontaneously--I have it read me the summaries of new fics for my tracked tags, and I pick one, and off we go.
