I am searching for a fic where the "endgame" isn't to kill voldemort. Every other fic i read, no matter how good are written we already know how it will end and how it will likely the story is going to progress. Its like a check list, harry gets powers check, horcruxes check, kill voldemort check. I would really like to read about after harry kills voldemort and has to confront an another enemy or there is no voldemort. I wouldn't have any problem if harry and voldemort worked together against someone else (i have already read the wandering devil series).

To sum it up:

1)no voldemort has to die main plot

2)no slash or harem Harry

3)prefer completed series

â€‹

Thanks in advance to whoever helps me get my next fix on fics.


** So I am going to post some similar materials from a previous comment of mine:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is a very AU fic of the wizarding world that features a Voldemort-less world (seemingly).

linkffn(The Skitterleap) an even bigger AU where Dumbledore lost the famous duel, and now Harry is a soldier in Grindelwalds army to be sent on a mission in Eastern Europe.

linkffn(Black Luminary) another AU where the less pureblood centric families decided to flip the table and take power decades before, and now Harry deals with the consequences

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) has Harry literally thrown into Middle Earth during the the Third Age, so Voldemort is completely out of the picture

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin) is an AU where Tom became the DA instructor instead and Dumbledore was a bit more vicious

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

***** Not true.

SoA, Black Luminary are both still updating, with Luminary updating fairly regularly. Skitterleap and a Coin are essentially finished, though they were left with room to write sequels later if the authors felt inclined (pretty common actually). Untitled Tome has been updating slowly, but hasn't yet been confirmed abandoned.

Also, there isn't much point replying to a bot, instead of the commenter. I could have completely missed it. Try to enjoy stories for the journey too - very few fanfics I can recall have ever had anywhere near a satisfying ending anyway.

** You might be interested in post-Hogwarts stories. Northumbrian has a lot, as do several other authors. Linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is quite good despite having a summary that doesn't summarise it well (incomplete but not abandoned).

I don't know your stance on Methods of Rationality, but it's /very/ different to the usual campaign against Voldemort and has no Horcrux hunt at all. The fan sequels explore very different directions, too.

Plus of course the biggest sequel is linkffn(Significant Digits), which is a solid effort, although I never did work out why the author chose that name.

** I am trying to do my best to avoid the general formula in linkffn(We, Harry Potter) (which has the next chapter 99% edited and should be posted later tonight or tomorrow and another chapter 70% written).

So far, I've been doing this by:

- Having 3 of the cannon horcruxes get destroyed completely by accident (diary, Harry himself, and the diadem).
- Dumbledore is aware that Harry isn't a horcrux anymore, so his plotting won't revolve around Harry being a sacrifice anymore.
- Wormtail was /actually/ killed by Sirius completely by accident after fleeing from Ron for completely unrelated reasons
- Sirius is on the mend, having gotten his unintentional vengeance on Wormtail. He's only appeared in the background/as Padfoot until now.
- Harry accidentally set off a goblin rebellion. Dumbledore is keeping Harry far away from this.
- Harry is a literal five-headed-dragon.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

** Every second Starfox5 fic has Voldemort die before the start or during the first half with the actual plot after that. Horcruxes usually aren't the same as in canon and usually bypassed through other means like wiping Voldemort's mind with legilimency or using blood magic.

*** Marriage Law Revolution and Democracy are completely after the war with Voldemort already dead and only the aftermath to deal with. The others have Voldemort as subplot in the beginning with another plot afterwards. Lady Thief is my favorite.

****** Their canon characters, I agree. Lots of stories change their personalities, though.

I started Lady Thief and then thought, "Why am I reading about a successful professional criminal? I have better things to do," and stopped.

***** So H/Hr is my absolute least favorite ship, but Starfox5 writes SUCH GOOD STORIES that I can usually ignore the ship because the plot and world is unique enough, so if you can at all tolerate the pairing his stuff is worth a shot.

***** Lady Thief is pretty good plot and action wise, the romance isn't the main focus and H/Hr only happens in like the last quarter of the story after a bunch of other romances fail.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.
