** /What?!/ That was in the books?! Holy shit, I've never seen anyone discuss that. How did we collectively gloss over something that big? Loads of AU canon divergence fics could have been made from that, like Voldemort retreating and then having to go into politics instead or something.

*** I know right! That was my reaction as well. I was randomly researching what canon says about the requirements for Lily's sacrificial protection cause I was considering a story in which Severus doesn't overhear the prophecy but it still passes in some twisted way, and I happened onto the wiki page saying this. And Harry literally says this to Voldemort in the book.

I have absolutely no idea how come I didn't realise it before and neither had many many fanfic writers judging from the absence of this topic.

**** I've seen /so many/ fics speculate that Lily actually performed a dark magic ritual with blood magic and runes to create the sacrificial protection and now I'm realising that doesn't even work with canon, because Harry obviously didn't do that the second time around lol.

***** Well, what if someone who has the protection can pass it onto others without having done any rituals; however since the protection only works against one person that one person needs to be the one to kill the original protected and the protection seems to be not as effective when spread out given that the Hogwarts Defenders weren't immune to Tom's spells, simply resistant with sufficient willpower.

** There's an element of this in Backwards with Purpose, though it is not until the end of the fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always]]

**** I really enjoyed it. It's a time travel fix it fic where Harry, Ron, and Ginny travel back to their first year to do things better and to save lives.

** I think people ignore it because it is just silly. Imagine -Moody was killed by Voldemort, while Moody was protecting Harry and the others in the sky chase. Scrimgeour died protecting the Wizarding world. Hell, I can think if so many that actually faced certain death, to protect others. So by all means, Voldemort shouldn't have been able to kill anyone for a long while, if indeed it worked that way.

*** I think the canon explanation is that the person who is sacrificing themselves must have a realistic option not to die and choose the death anyway - people argue that when Voldemort called for Harry to come to him Harry could have easily chosen not to go or even escape Hogwarts altogether, and the fact that Voldemort asked him to come matters here. As I understand it, your motivation should also be pure love - which probably doesn't work for cases like Scrimgeour etc.

I'm not particularly liking this idea either, but I see how it can be argumented both ways - so I'm surprised I've never seen anyone writing about it in any way!

**** I don't know if Harry's motivation was pure love, in that moment. More like "I have to die so Voldemort can die". In the same way Scrimgeour refused to betray Harry, so Voldemort could be hopefully defeated. Also Moody had a chance to get out alive. He could have fled, like Mundungus but he stayed knowing he'll probably die. I get what you are saying, though. But that is the reason I think people don't write it, because it makes very little sense.
