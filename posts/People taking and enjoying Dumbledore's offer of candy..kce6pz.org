His sherbert lemons/lemon drops sound delicious. For Americans, you should know his candy is coated in sherbert powder, a fizzy tasty candy substance. I want scenes of folks taking his offer and enjoying the heck out of them.

*** Professor McGonagall raised a brow as Ronald Weasley entered late into her transfiguration class.

Well, by entered she meant waddled. Quite literally like a Penguin, head bent, arms flapping-the lot.

Giving a sigh the deputy head shut her eyes and inhaled deeply before so much as daring to think what had caused the boy to act like such a fool.

The class had yet to notice Ron's disruptive entrance, all heavily focused on transforming a kitten into glass sphere and she decided to take the chance to nip this distraction in the bud.

Clearing her throat she spoke up. “Mr Weasley, could you tell me what exactly you are doing?”

Ron stopped mid waddle and slowly tuned to look at her with wide eyes containing blown pupils.

“On all levels except except physical-I am a penguin Professor.” He clarified.

Right.

“And where exactly did this...realisation happen, Mr Weasley?” She pressed, noting students were beginning to look up from their work.

For a minute she thought the boy might have stopped breathing as he went completely still, he didn't even seem to be breathing. Finally he jolted and after blinking heavily, replied in a slow, barely coherent sentence.

“It...was...it was...Proffesor...no-Headmaster...the headmaster...”

Ah. That explained it.

Giving another long suffering sigh she stalked towards in the clearly stoned boy.

“He gave you a ‘special sweet' Didn't he?” She half groaned, shoulders slumping at the embarrassing visit she would have to make to Professor Snape to get something to remedy this. Of course Snape would monologue endlessly before actually giving the boy the needed potion and by the time he finished bitching about Albus, Gryffindor's and the now dead ‘love of his life' the class would be over and Ron would be a lesson behind.

Oh bollocks to it she'd just ask Granger to fill him in.

For his part, Ron just looked confused.

“How did you know Professor?” He asked as if she'd just revealed the meaning of life.

Thoroughly tired of talking to the boy she ground out her next answer.

“/Because/ Mr Weasley-you are clearly /high as fuck/.”

** I'm writing a chapter for one of my fics where my Dumbledore openly admits he laces his candy with Calming Draughts to help with students' anxiety when they're summoned to his office.

#+begin_quote
  "Iris?" Dumbledore said again. "A lemon drop, perhaps?"

  The torment inside her was replaced by a bizarre mixture of a need to laugh and to simultaneously pummel Dumbledore's stupid face in.

  "Lemon drop?" she repeated. "No, Dumbledore, I don't want a damn ---"

  "Ah, but they will help," he said, sounding as though he was attempting to inject some cheer back into the conversation. "Not many know this, but I lace these lemon drops with a bit of a Calming Drought. It helps soothe the nerves when students come and see me."

  Iris gave a lifeless laugh. "You drug your own students?" she said tonelessly.

  "Not for any nefarious purpose, of course. They are mild and last for only ten minutes. I dare say it's no more interfering than simple pain relievers."

** What weird ass sherbet lemons have you been eating?!! Because I've never known them coated in sherbet my entire life, sherbet lemons are lemon boiled sweets (hard candies) with sherbet on the inside so they fizz after a while as you suck them.

** Lemon drops are another one of those weird fanon things that always bugged me. Dumbledore offered somebody a lemon drop once, in one book, and used them as a password once in another book, and fanfic authors extrapolated that he's obsessed with them and always eats them and keeps them on hand offer to everybody he sees.

*** The problem with two points of data is that you can only /reasonably deduce/ that the line between those points is the correct relation. But that's boring. Fanfiction is all about dipping your fingertips into some ink and flicking your fingers towards your graph to give it 30 more points, and seeing what happens thanks to that. Also known as wild mass guessing.

****** It's been years since I read the books, but I read them about 3 times each, whereas I've only seen the movies maybe once before. I watched the movies with my mom recently and while the first three are fine, the 4th one just slaps you in the face with weird pacing and all the unexplained events. Although the following movies are a lot better pacing-wise, it becomes so much more obvious how much is missing.

We're listening to the audiobooks now, and I've gotta say I really missed Harry's snark.

*** It certainly seems to be that way. One another note, my personal headcanon is that even an Evil/Manipulative Dumbledore wouldn't risk something that easily detectable and perhaps even obvious (assuming you have some common sense; contrary to fanon's depiction of the WW, the kind of important people and high level officials that Dumbledore would be targeting aren't completely stupid... other than Fudge, maybe).

Dumbledore offers everybody candy, the entire class.

In another fic or the same one I don't know... Harry starts eating sweets a lot and he also accepts the lemon drop offer and then Dumbledore says something like... There is nothing to worry about even I liked sweets around your age...

Say some politician who doesn't really like Dumbledore comes back to the office or goes home, suddenly singing Dumbledore's praises. People aren't that blind, even in the Wizarding World.
