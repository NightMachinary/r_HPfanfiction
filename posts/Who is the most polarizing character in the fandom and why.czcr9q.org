** Snape. Because JKR tried to redeem his lifetime of assholery with one chapter of Pensieve memories are the end of DH, and not everyone accepts that as a redemption arc.

Also Alan Rickman's movie portrayal.

There might be an interview to prove me wrong, but I don't think she meant to do this initially. It's kinda like with Slytherin as a whole: a good portion of the fandom liked it and now she's retconned it. "Yeah, some came back with Slughorn." In the books it was just Hogsmeade and Charlie.

The fandom saw his friendship with Lily and "Always" and went "aww" instead of "...uhh...hmm." Because, in that same chapter, she shows us just how awful he always was.

**** JKR flops back and forth depending on the time of day. Years ago, during the release of the last 2 books and the promotional tours, she was always firm that Snape wasn't a good man, but a petty bully. But later she changed her stance and it's starting slip more and more to the point where she's adding stuff that was never stated in the books, like the "Slytherins came back to the battle" information.

In [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/670176159561326592][this tweet]], she says:

#+begin_quote
  "Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world"
#+end_quote

And in [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/670155785817694208?lang=en][this tweet]], she says this on Harry naming his son Albus Severus.

#+begin_quote
  "Snape died for Harry out of love for Lily. Harry paid him tribute in forgiveness and gratitude."
#+end_quote

And [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/670299750852349952][this is the tweet]] where JKR re-writes Snape's motivations as having wanted revenge on Voldemort for killing his girl, and turning him from a petty guy obsessed with a figure from his past, into some sort of moral crusader.

#+begin_quote
  "He stood to gain nothing personally but the triumph of the cause Lily had believed in. He was trying to do right."
#+end_quote

.

And she approved this as canon in Cursed Child:

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE looks at him, every inch a hero, he softly smiles.*

  *SNAPE:* Tell Albus --- tell Albus Severus --- I'm proud he carries my name. Now go. Go.

Look, let me like my bad-and-good character snape in peace, and I wont bother those who tend to hate snape but worship that fucking james potters ground he walks on. Now THERES a short redemption arc- bullies slytherins and snape for years, gets worse and worse until a "prank" thats just BARELY not sexual assault, literally harrases lily constantly to go out with him, and pulls snape from danger ONCE and suddenly he's a hero of heroes, light incarnate. Jfc. All I can say is that if one of my bullies had a similar life, that really puts it into perspective how horrendous he really was.

Or did you manage to forget that Snape's idea of an appropriate response to bubble-mouth was his own patented murder curse?

You're really trying to prove the point that Snape is the most polarizing character huh?

You kinda sound like someone who feels personally attacked because people don't like the character you like, so you wildly start bashing other characters out of frustration. Which to me is a bad habit in regards to fanfiction.

This whole "us" vs "them" attitude seems a bit pointless and silly.

**** It's funny, Ron is the jerk with the heart of gold, yet there's a mountain of Dramione fics trying to portray Draco that way.

I think amongst many factors, the Weasleys' poverty is one of them. How many romance novels are there where the main male protagonist is dirt poor? It's probably easier for many fic writers and readers to imagine wonderful things about a rich character than a poor one, after all the priming the romance genre as a whole gives them.

What's your definition of a "heart of gold"? Most IRL people wouldn't do for their friends what Ron did for Harry in the books. We know this because of what happend in WWII. There were heartwarming stories of people sheltering Jews and other refugees, but the status quo was far more depressing.

I mean on the one hand you have schoolboy drama, and on the other hand Ron risked his life and the lives of his family to help Harry. As purebloods the Weasleys could have just kept their heads down and survived under Voldemort's rule. but I guess because he was rude to Hermione at 11, stopped talking to Harry at 14 for a month or so because he thought Harry was lying to him, and had a Horcrux influenced blow up with both Harry and Hermione at 17 that somehow neutralizes all the good he did. Right.

Which is also a ridiculous premise. Taking over the ministry suddenly turned the Death Eaters into soft and gentle people? At minimum, the Weasleys should have been in Azkaban as they were Order members. Why on Earth didn't the Death Eaters eliminate all possible opposition?

I know that. So? How does this contradict my point? The Death Eaters can still be active. They could've also easily killed the Weasleys, put a Dark Mark above the Burrow and the Ministry could've simply said they arrived too late to save them. And that Harry is wanted for questioning about their deaths.

There is very little you can't do politically, when you've basically won the war and are controlling both sides from the shadows (the Death Eaters and the Ministry).

******* Alright yeah good point. I guess I unjustly put that under his always wanting to carve his own place in the world and then getting the more fulfilling reason that he does it because he loves his friends. I guess I just meant he's not a “heart of gold” in that he's not exactly a precious cinnamon roll of purity and kindness. But he tries to do the right thing, so he's still a good person at heart.

*** Yes. He may have had good intentions but the moment he left the tent and abandoned his friends during the Horcrux hunt, he became a liability in the war. It would have been disastrous had he been captured and interrogated, like he nearly was.

Why? Because he was jealous of Harry. Of all the people in the world, he was jealous of /Harry/. And don't blame the Horcrux alone; he wasn't the only one who was wearing it. He was permanently placed on my shit list at that point.

I also don't like the "normal, regular protagonist" in /fantasy/ stories. It's boring.
