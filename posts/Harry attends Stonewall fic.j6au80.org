:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So has anyone read this fic in which...

- Harry attends Stonewall High

- The Dursleys are (naturally) horrible to him

- He has a close muggle friend, maybe named Sam, with a gay dad who briefly dates someone the reader is led to believe is Lee Jordan's father

- Harry works at a convenience store

- Sam's mom is abusive

- I think the idea is that he'll go to Hogwarts at 15 or 16, but not sure.

I can't remember what it was called and it's driving me bonkers!!

#+begin_quote
  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

*** I think it's technically complete, though the conclusion is admittedly unsatisfying, given how much potential the universe the author created has. I'd love to see what happens next!

** For a moment I forgot Stonewall was the name of the school he was supposed to go to, and was like "omg, Harry Potter threw the first brick at Stonewall!" Which is also a fic I would read to be fair
