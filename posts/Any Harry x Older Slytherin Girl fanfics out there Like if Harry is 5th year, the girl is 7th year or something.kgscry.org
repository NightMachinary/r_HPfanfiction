***** Nope. Technically speaking in canon they are 3-4 years younger than Harry (If I remember correctly) but in this fic they got aged up. Doesn't matter regardless tho as its a good fic

HP Wikia claims they're one year older than Harry but I have no idea what they base that on.

**** It's one of the best dark!Harry fics out there, although I'm really not a fan of the ending. It makes canon epilogue look good. Bit baffling because the rest of the fic is very well written.

** So here's a "Kind of?" answer: Enter the Dragon. Harry is turned into a Shadowrun dragon before canon and goes to Hogwarts. After encountering Him on the train a Slytherin Prefect develops a crush on him and ends up in his circle. Note that Harry is aging like a dragon and hasn't developed to the point where he is interested in girls that way.
