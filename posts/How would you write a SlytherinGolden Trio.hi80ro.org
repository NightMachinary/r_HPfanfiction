** I've come up with something I haven't seen a lot of yet: make the Trio itself a foil to Voldemort, by reflecting in each of them a part of Voldemort's greatness, and showing that they are equal to him through unity, friendship, and love --- and perhaps become more than the sum of their parts in the process. So Harry could have Voldemort's innate aptitude for magic, instincts, grace, way of thinking. Hermione his ambition, ruthlessness, intellect, and passion. And Ron his charisma, social skills, manipulative streak, inner strategist, and so on. The details don't matter that much -- you can pick and choose who gets what depending on your interpretation of their characters. The most important thing would be to make each one a /truly/ essential part of the equation, so that with even one missing they wouldn't be able to keep up with the antagonists (and you could make 'x is missing' thing into a plot element later on). I guess it could work regardless of the House, so the focus on Slytherin qualities would be good --- Harry=magical power, Hermione=ruthlessness/mental power, Ron=manipulation/social power.

*** Harry's green eyes, so talked about, can be a foil to Voldemort's red eyes. Hermione's big bushy hair can be a foil to Voldemort's baldness. Ron's long nose can be a foil to you know what.

** Do you mean as in all three of the original trio sort Slytherin?

That would be interesting even from the start - you could put up an argument that Ron goes Slytherin because Harry has already done so and he makes a snap decision that it can't be /that/ bad if the BWL sorts there. And Ron /could/ be classed as cunning - especially fanon Ron who leans towards "strategic genius who is desperate for glory and recognition."

But Hermione? Who is the one who would sort first of the three? That's an interesting one - firstly she's probably heard that muggleborn aren't welcome there so would be against it. I also don't think Hermione /values/ what Slytherin offers - she's a natural fit for Ravenclaw but she says herself that "courage and friendship" are more important than books in PS, which explains the reason she goes to Gryffindor. I know Hermione can be cunning and sly - she traps a woman in a jar for blackmail ffs. And she could be classed as ambitious - as she matures she clearly wants to change the world. But at eleven, the sum of her ambition is "read all the books and try and make a friend." She's also a highly, highly moral person in a way that Harry isn't. I think Hermione's sorting would be the first major hurdle in making a Slytherin GT fic believable.

In before someone argues this with a list of all the cruel/dubious things Hermione did.

Hermione set a high moral standard for everyone not Hermione. Harry set a high moral standard for himself, but that wasn't necessarily as high as the standard Hermione set for everyone not herself.

Yeah, you're right. I genuinely howled with laughter at that, because you're so right and I don't know how it didn't occur to me before.

That said, it's just another reason Slytherin would be a nightmare for her - because she would be surrounded by people behaving in a non-Hermione-approved way and it would drive her to distraction!

*** You did list the reasons why Hermione could be seen as a Slytherin. Blood purity aside, I think she fits Slytherin more than Ravenclaw. Slytherins do value knowledge as well. And Ravenclaw values some creativity, ingenuity, sense of wonder and questioning of the world that Hermione lacks. She has book smarts, but is more of a stay-by-the-book than a think-of-all-the-possibilities knowledge. Personally, I think Hermione would struggle answering a different trivia to enter the common room daily and might even see the whole thing as impractical.

**** The thing is, while Hermione is /capable/ of cunning, I don't think she values it and she sees it as a last resort.

I don't think she'd go Slytherin because I don't think she cares at all for the values of the house. Pretty much anyone could sort anywhere but Ravenclaw. Intelligence is something you have or you don't, really. But everyone is cunning, brave, or loyal when they need to be. No one is "just cunning" or "just brave." Hermione is cunning, brave, loyal and clever. She could have gone anywhere, based on /ability./ But her /choices/ show that she values moral courage above anything else, which is why she could never be a Slytherin.

Absolutely agree the Ravenclaw riddle would do her head in and she'd see it as a waste of time!

***** Ambition and cunning are not "evil oriented" by default. She does value her cunning and ambition when it furthers her goals, only that her goals are not evil. That is why we have the law-modifying Ministry employee working to help elves where she thinks she can actually do a difference and accomplish her goals, and not a protester or elves-rights activist on the street. That's why we have Minister of Magic Granger and not Unspeakable reasearcher-for-reasearch-sake Granger.

****** I never said they were "evil oriented." I absolutely don't believe that at all, if I had to choose what house I was in I'd want Slytherin. I value ambition myself, very highly.

But Hermione Granger at age eleven sees the world very much in black and white. There are good people and bad people, and rules are there to be followed. She grows out of this over the series and becomes someone who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get the "right" outcome. But a large part of that personality change is from hanging out with Harry and Ron for years, both of whom are massively relaxed about rule breaking but still demonstrably good people. At the age of fifteen, Hermione would fit Slytherin. She's cunning enough to secretly put a boil hex on a parchment and trick people into signing it. She's ambitious enough to try and free 100 house elves. She's confident enough in her own path to decide a teacher is wrong and make alternative learning arrangements. But Hermione at age eleven, at the start of PS? No way. She toes the line and follows the letter of the law, not it's spirit.

******* Hermione at age eleven surely had cunning and ambition in her, only that she hadn't develop it. You cannot say that the hat can't put her in Slytherin "because she has not shown cunning yet" and then say it is okay for the hat to put eleven year old Neville in Gryffindor.

******** No, because it's not about /having/ it. It's about /valuing/ it. So Hermione at age eleven has the potential for cunning, but she thinks it's a Bad Thing. So Slytherin ceases to be an option. She grows up, of course, but at eleven she thinks it's bad to be sneaky and to not follow rules to the letter. She only mellows in this fashion because of outside influences (Harry and Ron). Hermione by the end of GoF is arguably a completely different person to Hermione at the start of PS.

Neville on the other hand has the potential for bravery, and he also thinks bravery is a Good Thing and something he wants to have. So Gryffindor.

********* Might I remind you that 11 year old Hermione was okay with going into the Restricted Section to get info on Flamel. Breaking the rules to get what she wants. She doesn't wait to GOF to exhibit Slytherin traits. All she needed was to see common ground with the guys she saw as rule breakers (Harry and Ron). So I don't see how a conversation with the right Slytherin boy/girl could push her to accept Slytherin a few hours later.

********** However - breaking into the restricted section under Harry's cloak /doesn't mean cunning./ The way they go about most of their rule breaking is not cunning. It is obvious, in your face, bravado. Her plot in book 2 of getting Lockhart to sign the slip, now that's cunning, but that's after over a year of hanging out with those two...

BUT. Hermione does not see herself as a sly or cunning person. She sees herself as morally right, all the time. And again, as you say, a lot of her rule breaking is influenced by Harry and Ron, but that takes more than a few hours, so I'm not sure a conversation on the train would have influenced her. Even as she becomes more relaxed about rule breaking, she still mentally splits the rules into "just and unjust laws," allowing her to still see herself as "morally good."

The Hermione who walks up to that sorting hat is desperate for two things - she wants to do well and she wants to be liked. Developing slyness and cunning won't help her, at least in the mindset she has. It's also important to note that in the UK (I can't speak for other countries obvs), "cunning" and "sly" are generally seen as negative traits. Children will be punished by teachers and parents for "slyness." It's synonymous with lying, cheating, and general undesirable behaviour. Clearly in some social stratas of the Wizard world that is different (Draco obviously got some sort of reward every time he showed slyness), but Muggle UK primary schools in the late 80s early 90s were still very much run around "Christian values" and slyness was "an offence." So even though Hermione has that capability, she doesn't value it, doesn't recognise it in herself, and has been taught to view it as Very Bad Indeed. And /that/ is why the sorting hat would not have put her into Slytherin; for the similar reason that although intelligent, she sees creative whimsy as a waste of her time and thus was not suitable for Ravenclaw despite fitting on paper...

** I'd start by asking how they would get there. Briefly, /we/ know that they are destined be friends and work together to defeat Voldemort, but /they/ don't know that when they get sorted, and while Harry and Ron make sense as friends, Hermione has very little in common with either of them. There also needs to be reasons for them to be sorted there, and those reasons will determine what happens after.

Ron is the easiest. He has the ambition to surpass his brothers. Going to Slytherin would normally be anathema to him, but if he sees Harry sorted there, that might give him the license to agree with the Hat's suggestion to that end.

Hermione has the makings of the perfect Ravenclaw, but she values her vision of justice and the (small-g) greater good---changing the world whether the world wants it or not---over learning as such, so she goes to Gryffindor. There are seeds of Slytherin-ambition, however: she likes to show off and be seen as the smartest person in the room. To move her to Slytherin requires shifting her ambitions to be more self-centred, so /something/ needs to happen to change those.

Harry is probably the hardest one: notwithstanding the Hat's comments, he doesn't really show anything but Gryffindor traits and has little personal ambition. He is the quintessential adolescent male hero archetype. The only way any of his goals become "Slytherin" is if he goes off the deep end and becomes preoccupied with something like resurrecting his parents. It didn't help that Draco is really bad at the whole "temptation to sell your soul" thing. So, in some sense, it's up to Ron and Hermione to drag him kicking and screaming into Slytherin.

OK, here's a way this might go down:

*Point of divergence:* Hermione's and Draco's arrival in Harry's and Ron's compartment coincide.

1. Draco says something blood purist that sets Hermione off. For example, to Draco's classic line "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.", Hermione breaks in to ask precisely what he means by that, and it escalates from there. There is a shouting match, wands might be drawn, and the prefects might end up having to break it up.
2. That gets Hermione motivated to prove Draco wrong; she might even say something about how she could be a better Slytherin than Draco ever could.
3. Now, Harry and Ron are witnessing all this, Ron might get some of his own words in, and Harry's Muggleborn mother is mentioned. The end results: rather than being annoyed by Hermione's know-it-all attitude, Ron is sympathetic to the outspoken Muggleborn; and the trio gets their common enemy (blood purism as exemplified by Draco) two months earlier.
4. Thanks to her new "I'll show them! I'll show them all! Muhahaha!" mindset, Hermione ends up in Slytherin, triggering a cascade.
5. Seeing a determined Hermione marching over to the Slytherin table, Harry basically goes "To hell with it; let's do this!" and agrees with the Hat to send him to Slytherin.
6. With Harry and Hermione there, Ron is easy.

Draco, then Voldemort won't know what hit them.

** As I explain on the other comment threats, I do think Hermione has Slytherin traits, and that such traits are stronger than her Ravenclaw traits. SO you need to :

1. First you need to put Hermione there, and for that you need to get around the blood purity thing. Maybe she doesn't read about Slytherin's disdain for muggleborns (unlikely). Maybe instead of Neville she talks to a Slytherin in the train that she actually likes, a neutral Slytherin. Just get her over the blood purity traits and the leap to the sortin happens naturally.
2. Harry doesn't like Hermione at this point, and he would like to be far from her. However, we all know this one is the easiest. Slytherin was quite a possible scenario to him in OT. the hat just says "Fuck what you think, I'm putting you in Slytherin."
3. Ron is hard, because he really likes Harry but he has the strongest preconceived image of Slytherin. He would not ask to be put in Slytherin... the hat has to propose it and Ron has to embrace the idea. It is difficult because he is the most clear decision to be put in Gryffindor. Ron has a few minutes to analyze the "If Harry is in Slytherin, maybe Slytherin is not all bad" before he is called. So, I guess the only plausible way is have the hat "seeing" Ron's doubts on Harry and lurking Ron's mind based on that. It is a bit of a stretch but I guess it can be made.

I don't think Canon Ron would have a particular bad image of Slytherin, from what we saw in the book, he is probably the member of the Trio who care the less about this House (outside of his feud with Draco and his goons).\\
The main problem with Ron would be his family history. He is not afraid to end up in Slytherin, he is afraid of not ending up in Gryffindor. As he says to Harry, Hyfflepuff would not be that bad (because they are harmless and everyone like them), but Ravenclaw and Slytherin are probably as bad as each other for him.

But contrary to Hermione (who don't really fit Slytherin House and would need to be tweaked a little to go there), it's pretty easy to justify his Sorting.\\
As seen in PS with the mirror of Erised, Ron's biggest desire is to stand out and become his own person. He doesn't want to just be Weasley n°6 (and later Harry side kick), and also want to be Ron. This desire can already be seen as ambition, and the Hat can add some lines like "/Slytherin would help you to leave your brother's shadow/" to sweeten the deal, especially if he did meet Harry on the train, who already got there.

or maybe professor snape was the one to deliver the letter so she wants to be in his house.

Maybe the hat tells Ron, that its okay to have amibitons to stand out from his brother and not have shame for it

** 1. Ron: Ron is probably the easiest to sort into Slytherin. He wants to prove himself to his family, earn money and be powerful. He is also an excellent chess player, something that indicates strategic thinking. The obstacle we encounter here is that Ron doesn't want to be put in Slytherin. He wants to prove himself, but he also doesn't want to lose his family. He is ambitious, but he wants to be greater than his brothers in their field rather than define himself as "different". Being in Slytherin would also be a burden for Ron. At home, he'd miss out on inside jokes that come with being a Gryffindor, and he'd feel like he's missing out. At school, he'd be the blood traitor. An easy way to goad Ron into Slytherin is him getting mad at the hat when it says "another Weasley", or you could modify cannon and have the Weasley's be poorer, and have the kids working odd jobs. This Ron might want to remove that burden from Ginny's shoulders.
2. Hermione: Harry and Hermione are harder, but I'm going to steal [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]]'s idea for Hermione: Draco says something blood purist that sets Hermione off. For example, to Draco's classic line "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.", Hermione breaks in to ask precisely what he means by that, and it escalates from there. There is a shouting match, wands might be drawn, and the prefects might end up having to break it up. 3. That gets Hermione motivated to prove Draco wrong; she might even say something about how she could be a better Slytherin than Draco ever could. 4.

Thanks to her new "I'll show them! I'll show them all! Muhahaha!" mindset, Hermione ends up in Slytherin, triggering a cascade.
3. Harry: For Harry, we'd have to change one thing: The Dursley's. This version of them begrudgingly take care of him, but they punish him quicker than they do Dudley. So Harry learns what they like and sucks up, vowing to one day be so great that they can't deny it.

** Frankly, the only way I could actually see that happening was a full on AU where Draco was nicer at the very start, and befriended them on the train. Harry would simply allow himself to be sorted there, Ron could follow him there if he saw that Slytherin wasn't as bad as he thought (I believe that Ron wouldn't even need to ask the hat too much. Overshadowed by his brothers, he definitely has ambition, even if he's not exactly active in seeking it out. I mean just look at what he sees in the mirror of erised.) I'm not actually sure about Hermione, she's the first out of them all the get sorted and didn't actually befriend Harry and Ron on the train. Maybe if she befriended them, Draco was there and Harry somewhat agreed that he might end up in Slytherin, and Ron went along with that, she would want to follow her friends? Like I can see a good way to get Harry and Ron there, but I can't see an easy way of getting Hermione there without delving into some atrocious cliches.
