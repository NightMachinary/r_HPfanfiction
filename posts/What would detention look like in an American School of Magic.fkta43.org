I'm generalising rather than just saying 'Illvermorny' so this question can include the Fandom schools like Salem (which is a women's institute in canon, apparently).

My question is thus: what would a detention look like in an American school of Magic?

I, being an English person, have never had detention in an American school and have never heard details beyond the Breakfast-Club-esque Hollywood Movie scenes of it, so I'm curious to hear from some actual Americans what a detention might be like.

We have a lot of illusions and stereotypes about America in the rest of the world and I haven't met a single non-American who wasn't surprised to find out that Red Solo Cups were genuinely a thing in the states, so yeah. Best to check with y'all. :)

Would they do the same as Hogwarts and do menial labour/dangerous trips into local secure-zones? Would it be like the Simpsons openers with lines? Would it be different by teacher topic? What would merit a detention in an American school? Is there a demerits-type system or a three-strikes system? Does that Double-Jeopardy thing apply to scholastic punishments? Are detentions supervised?

EDIT - Also, is that stereotype of Athletes being let off of punishments like this due to their status as sportspeople a thing? We outside the US get a very strong view of you Americans somewhat idolising teen sportspeople and them being able to get away with all sorts of shit and I'm curious if that's related to detentions too.

I'm sure you who know more about this can think of more answers to questions I wouldn't think to ask, so feel free to expand beyond those questions!

As an addendum, this is pure curiosity, not research for a fic.


** Detention, at least in my high school, is sitting quietly for an hour studying.

** Would depend on the style of school but assuming a Day School, Detention would probably consist of a hour after school hours spent in a class room either working on your own homework or perhaps even writing a essay the teacher would demand of you or perhaps even writing Lines. Other ideas include assisting the teacher prepare for the next class or if the teacher handles multiple classes and you're a upper classmen with good grades even assisting in grading papers. The main idea of detention in the US is punishing you by eating up your free time

*** Heh. Students grading papers, that's always bizarre to remember is an actual thing.

No school I went to in the UK would ever trust a student, no matter their grades, to actually mark someone else's work. I've seen Hermione being given teaching assistant roles like that in fics and it's almost always an indicator of an American writer.

Did not know that was a detention thing though - giving punished students trust and responsibility like that seems somewhat anathema to us, though I can definitely see it fitting American culture though, Prison Labour and all. #WeDon'tNeedNoEducation :D

**** Usually it's for multiple choice test, where the teacher can plop a small stack and the answer key in front of you and you just knock it out quickly.

And again it's usually asked of you from teachers who either respect you or want you to learn responsibility. And it's usually for much lower class men like in High school a Senior could be forced to over look a freshman classes pop quiz

***** Ah, that's why. MCTs aren't really a thing here outside of online schoolwork and those're marked automatically by the computer systems.

But okay, that makes sense. It's a teaching moment in that "You're a Man now, Junior, here's how you do things" sort of way. Still slightly odd to give a student you respect trust-requiring work as a punishment after they misbehave, but I get the sentiment behind it.

** Generally, there is more weight placed on after school detentions, but most American schools try to ignore those. In my experience Lunch Detention is more common, they stick you in a room with a few other kids while you eat your lunch and do school work. Its generally the same thing without lunch for AS detention.

**** It is more about social isolation and taking away time that you would rather spend with friends either going out to eat or eating as a group in the Cafeteria. Its more so the teachers don't have to look after kids after school is out and the problems it would cause for transportation (not having bussing and no parent to pick them up would be a problem).

Generally its more of an annoyance, but usually you only get them at all if you're constantly doing dumb shit. Most people try to avoid them though so I guess they work. Its better than staying after school for detention, thats for sure. And it is boring as hell too.

***** Oh, yeah. I always forget that Americans let their kids out of school to find food. We don't get that here until A-Level (16-18).

So, getting a detention is a lot harder in the US, you'd say? A later punishment for repeated infractions, rather than a casual deterrent? And when you say dumb, do you mean stupid or bad/disobedient? That slang does vary. :)

Also, regarding the social isolation, say two friends did something 'dumb', would they both be put in the same detention or be allocated separate times/classrooms?

****** Schools letting students leave to get food elsewhere is probably dependent on the school and location. At my high school, we weren't allowed to be anywhere but the cafeteria during lunchtime unless we had a teacher to vouch for us. No roaming the halls. Even going to the library during lunch was banned eventually.

It was something about keeping track of students and making sure nobody caused trouble or was trying to play hooky. I think there were also some complaints about students crossing the road nearby (cars going fast, no crosswalks or safety measures, etc) and complaints from the McDonald's just across that road.

I'm not sure we even had much of detention in my high school, since there was no easy way to assign students dedicated time that wouldn't also cut into classes. Teachers made you change seats (away from friends, to humiliate, or to keep a better eye on you), give you an F on an assignment, sit out in the hallway, or go straight to the principal's office. Then again, I was a teacher's pet, so I never really experienced harsh punishment except for being sent out into the hallway.

******* Ah, the old student hordes sallying forth to raid the Fast Food Places, huh? My A-Level Sixth Form had similar complaints - though due to a more staggered-leaving-of-class system, we were more March of the Penguins than a rampaging horde.

In-class, but not detention punishment. Interesting. Would you say your school had a low number of staff, then? It'd sound like they struggled to get teachers to run the Lunch or After-school detentions the other Americans in this thread mention.

Would hallway trips be for a short time (eg. Until the teacher can find a spare minute to come out and be disappointed/angry at you) or a full lesson/period (if you have lessons running over multiple periods in the US)?

******** We had about 1 teacher for every 24 students. Not sure if that's low or high numbers comparatively.

After-school detentions just run into the issue of how students are supposed to get home, that's all. I mean, most students didn't know the way to walk home and/or walking home meant coming very close to/crossing more dangerous roads -- American layouts are seriously spread out. It's just not feasible to walk home unless you live very close or want to spend a few hours walking along very dangerous roads that aren't made for any kind of pedestrians coming through.

Routine buses also aren't a thing unless you're in a city, so if you miss the school bus, that's it. You either have to beg a friend to give you a ride or phone your parents -- unless you have a drivers license. By the end of the school day, however, the school isn't really responsible for you anymore, so you could very well find yourself locked out of the school building an hour later, alone, waiting for your parent to come pick you up because they had to leave work early because your ass missed the bus or you had an after-school club (clubs required constant teacher supervision to even exist), but your school is in the middle of some cornland state, so there's nothing for miles except the mythical McDonalds that the upperclassmen talk about sneaking out to and the main road where cars are zooming by.

This was a very white suburban school.

If you were sent to the hallway, you could guess that you'd be sitting out there for the rest of class, followed by a brief lecture because there's only about 5 minutes before you're written up as late for your next class. If the class got something to work on/read for a few minutes in-class, that's also a time when the teacher could come out and lecture you on your behavior.

********* I mean, I think that's probably about how many my secondary school had (11-16yrs old) and we had a little under 3000 students (2800 or so, I think?).

Ah, okay. I always forget that American suburbs are different than they are here. Like, suburbs are pretty dense too and we would almost all count living in a suburb as living in that city. If we spread out as much as you guys did, there wouldn't be a field left in the whole of Europe. :D

How long would you say a trip to school might be in that context? Most of my town walked about a mile and a half to get to our secondary school from wherever we lived and that wasn't regarded as weird, so I'm curious to how that compares.

Really? They were left outside for the whole class? That's so weird. Seems like you guys are probably far more... fast paced than we are in that regard. Or at least your teachers were more overworked. :D

The only time I remember someone spending more than five-to-ten minutes out in the corridor was when they broke a window and actually left the building. Was your school day as rushed as it sounds?

********** Bus ride to school might take 15 or 30 minutes depending on traffic, for myself, and I lived in a suburb where a ton of other students also lived. American high school, but also connected to "junior high," so ages 11-18 years old. My elementary school was closer. The school also had a baseball pitch, football stadium, soccer field, a field the marching band used, and a few tennis courts. So the area was pretty big at the school alone. One of the former principals renovated part of the school to look like a castle, if that gives you an idea of what the school was like.

Classes took about 45 minutes to an hour, with 4 minutes between each class, and lunch was maybe 30 minutes? I graduated in 2014, so some specifics are fuzzy, I guess. But yes, entire class. I was told to sit out in the hallway once. Sat and tried not to cry for the entire time. When sent out in the hallway, unless it was for missed homework, you weren't allowed to take anything out in the hallway with you. But it was on very dependent on what teacher you got as to how harsh they were in discipline.

It was pretty rushed, especially with the 4 minutes between classes. So you'd run out of class, to your locker, to the bathroom if you needed it, and then to your next class. If your class was on the opposite side of the building, it would take all 4 minutes just to run over there. It was kind of hell for anyone with any kind of bathroom problems, with constantly showing up late to class or teachers scolding you if you took too long on a bathroom break. I have unfortunate experience with that.

Seniors (last year of high school) were given a lot more leeway on showing up late to class, and after a while, you learned which teachers didn't mind everyone leaving to go to the bathroom at certain times during class. Literally, I had a couple classes where the teachers would usually finish up teaching early, and everyone would just use that time as their bathroom break.

*********** About 15-25 miles then, I'd guess? Average speed limits on rural roads being 40-60mph and all. Probably on the lower side, if the bus had to stop a lot.

Jesus fuck, that school sounds massive. No wonder 4 minutes wasn't enough time to get around. And your school has a bit that looks like a castle? Wow. And thirty minutes for lunch? We had an hour! Wow again. Now I'm amazed at how little time y'all have for anything and generally curious how many lessons a day High Schoolers have, approximately? Seems like they try to cram in as much as humanly possible (and likely more) for those kids. For context on my befuddlement, we had six in secondary school - four before lunch at 1 and two after.

Oh, okay. So, it is more teacher-relative that it sounds. Okay, that's good to know. Makes sense that you'd take your work out if it needed to be done, given how much most of the comments here have emphasised studying and work as part of the detention punishment in the States.

And yeah, those poor kids. Hell, poor girls, too. That's at least one tampon change during the day, and four minutes is definitely not enough time for that. Is that stereotype real? I recall a lot of American things where 'women problems' was used to make teachers stop asking questions. A "Why are you late, Ms Smith?" - "I was changing my tampon" - /male teacher blushes and averts gaze/ "Don't say anything else, just sit down." sort of a deal.

I thought your middle stage was Middle School? Or is Junior High like 'Lower Site and Lower Years' of High School?

It's good that they got lenient towards the end. Seniors are usually seventeen or eighteen, right? Being that stringent to kids at that age would just be ridiculous.

************ The line of schools for my particular school system was a little on the odd side -- we had elementary school until about 4th grade, then transitioned to another school for 5th and 6th grade (which, officially, the school was referred to as an elementary school), then finally junior high and high school. High school, all across America, is 9th grade to 12th. My junior high and high school were actually connected by ONE door, so junior high stuff tended to be restricted to the junior high section except for music rooms, theater, and if you were so good at a subject that you were taking a high school class on it.

The school didn't seem gigantic, but I guess that's just what I grew up with. We had 7 classes in total. 1 through 4, then lunch was broken up into three blocks (A, B, and C) across the whole of 5th period, so 5th period class was an elective that, for the students with B lunch, was interrupted by lunch and then students would return for the second half of 5th period class. I would often leave my school stuff in 5th period classroom during lunch so I wouldn't be running all over to my locker or taking my things to the cafeteria. (junior high and high school had separate cafeterias)

Yes, that stereotype is real. Students at my school have horror stories of the few super-strict teachers just letting them bleed on the seats. I don't think anyone was brave enough to outright say they needed to change a pad/tampon, however. So I don't really know teachers' reactions to that. But in your example, also, most teachers addressed students by first name. Only a few teachers would address you by your last name. Ex, just "Smith." I had one teacher who kept calling students names of alcoholic drinks (he would often mispronounce names to be funny and alcoholic drinks was what he thought about most). It was uhhh yeah! Absolutely terrible when you think about it! But he kept it up for the three years I had him as a teacher.

Seniors are 17-18, yeah. It's usually just called "senioritis" and teachers don't bother trying to be strict with it. I was late to a lot of classes in my last year, and often fell asleep during class, but I put it down to being a teacher's pet that I didn't get in trouble or teased for it for very often. Teachers across the board are more lenient if you've got great grades.

Either that or it's an American thing. You guys do spread out a lot more than we do. Like I said before, not a field in Europe would be left standing if we sprawled like American infrastructure. :)

That's very interesting, on the lunch thing. Sounds like a good way of doing things, to break up the Student Hordes descending on the cafeteria. Was C block of Lunch often left with the dregs or did they keep stuff around/keep cooking stuff to provide the same food to everyone?

Also, on the locker/carrying stuff note - were backpacks not a thing? I remember one time in secondary school I had to carry a PE Kit, a Home-Ec Kit of Ingredients, two classroom textbooks and three classroom notebooks and that was only slightly notable at the time in that "Oh, really? Huh." sort of way.

But I suppose staying silent and squirming isn't really the sort of thing one can see too easily, so it could just be frequency bias.

Anyway. Sounds like your clearly alcoholic/party animal teacher was an interesting fellow, at least. It's always nice when your teachers are interesting and memorable people. :)

Also, I looked into things at my old secondary school, and apparently they not only finish at 3pm now, they have a morning break between second and third classes too. Lunch is now 40 mins. Though, they do apparently now start at 8:30.

************** AP classes -- no, I literally mean some students were skipping grades and going to take a math class with 9th graders when they were 7th graders. Advanced Placement courses are totally different. Taking AP courses allowed you to take the AP tests at the end of the year, and you'd then be able to use that as college credit for whatever college you went on to. How that works: I took AP psychology in highschool, and did good on that AP test. My college pretended that I had already taken their Psychology 101 course and I was able to jump straight into taking Psychology 271.

In lunch, generally, A block lunch got the hottest meals. By C lunch, some of the hot meals were more lukewarm, and a student grabbing something from the shelves of packaged stuff and milk cartons was looking at pretty sparse shelves. Whatever was being cooked that day, was what all lunches got. I think there was talk of introducing D lunch before I graduated, because the school's student population just kept making records in "largest incoming class" every year. If students had an elective for 5th period, they could sometimes get away with grabbing a lunch as soon as the cafeteria opened and then arriving late to their 5th period (to eat in class) when they actually had C block lunch. Electives teachers were usually very lenient, in my experience.

Backpacks were BANNED. Straight up, not allowed to bring your backpack to class. Large handbags were also banned, but those were more tricky to measure by just looking at them, so a lot of us girls found medium-sized purses that just barely skirted the line of what was allowed, and we carried maybe half our books in there, carried the rest in our arms. It was a security risk for drugs, alcohol, and weapons. It was very common to see a student (with either a sticky locker, a locker in a less-used part of the school, or a locker in a super-busy locker bay) carrying a literal stack of textbooks around school because they had no time to deal with going to their locker between classes.

I think most schools have between five and seven classes. I think we'd usually have six classes on Wednesday because that's the day we get out about an hour early. Core classes were science, math, history, and English. I remember electives being languages, health, gym, music theory, psychology, sociology, forensic science, ancient history, mythology, theater, study hall, engineering, and music classes. I'm sure there were others. There weren't many requirements around electives. I think music was required in junior high, and then optional afterwards, and you had to do maybe two credits of languages. One half credit of health, and one half credit of physical education (one semester), which was covered by gym, marching band, or summer gym, which was two weeks of gym on the school grounds during the summer. It was generally expected to take one language class and stick with it until you graduated, and same with which music class you took. Band was HUGE at my school.

I and my friend decided to take beginner German in our senior year, so we were the only two seniors sitting among a bunch of tiny freshies that semester. That was fun.

It's kind of nostalgic telling you about how my high school worked. I don't mind the questions!

EDIT: just realized I told you in an earlier post that I graduated in 2018. I actually graduated in 2014. I think I was getting college years mixed up!

*************** Apologies for the delay - I accidentally hit 'mark all as read' and ended up missing a bunch of messages. Took me this long to find yours again. :D

Okay, sorry to deal with this out of order, but what the fuck - Backpacks were *Banned*? That's fuckin' weird. I guess it makes sense, with America being as it is, but I can't imagine an early schooling experience without a backpack big enough to carry every Hobbit in the fellowship of the ring. I wonder how those teachers would react to those little wheel-track Cowa suitcases that follow your bluetooth signals. :D

I keep forgetting that skipping years is a thing. I don't remember hearing about anyone doing it in any school I attended - and a lot of universities here restrict age to over-18s only, so I'd assume many schools would be reticent to allow students to get ahead, only to be cut loose until they aged up enough for a degree (since you have to be in full-time education of some sort until 16).

But okay, I didn't know that AP was university credits (as I'm sure you probably know, we don't do those here, so it's an unfamiliar system). It's no wonder you all emphasise transcripts so much - that information is really important to your education, huh? It's an interesting approach. How much of a degree could you get, doing AP classes? Like, could you cut a whole year from your college experience just by doing AP at High School?

Also, what learning level/amount does a credit cover? Like, do you get one per 'run' of that class, or do you have to get a certain grade on an exam, etc? Do credits differ if you get different grades?

Huh. That's really shitty organisation, despite the first appearance. Seems quite wrong that you get shafted on your food just because you were scheduled a certain way. What was the provision like, for food? I remember my secondary school was all abuzz when we finally got what was basically pasta-pots with actual sauce. :D

Seems like your classroom selection was pretty good. We had most of that, sans mythology, health, gym (which is PE here and I've repressed all memory of it so I have no idea if I took a GCSE in it), forensics, ancient history (which was covered in history, which was a GCSE I took), study hall, and engineering), plus a little more around IT, DT-esque subjects (I think you call those 'workshop classes?), and more arts and dance variants. Most of that was compulsory for us up until our GCSEs (where we got to choose 3 subjects alongside our array of compulsory ones - English lit/lang, 3 sciences, maths, etc. How did you get informed about that selection and pick what you wanted to go with?

You definitely had a very packed day though. Would you have preferred a slower time of things, but across more days? ie. Same number of classes, just over the weekend too?

Oh, I've seen that in some fics and always forget to google what the hell 'study hall' is. Same question about 'Health class' - what is it?

I bet that was adorable. The closest experience I've had was doing AS and A2 (the two levels of A-level exam when I did them - they're combined into one exam now) theology and ethics, and those kids were only a year younger than I was. Huh. I wonder if that's why a lot of American-written fics use the 'tiny firsties' lines? I've never really seen it in fics written anyone I know for certain is British, just people I know for certain are American or elsewise.

And ah, okay. Thank you for the clarification. I didn't really notice though - I had to google to find out High School finishes at 18. :D

**************** Okay, lot of ground to cover here XD

Backpacks were banned in classrooms, basically. You could come in with all your stuff in a backpack, but you had to keep it in your locker the rest of the time. Sometimes teachers would be kind enough to let you bring your backpack to class if that was your final class, so that you could skip the crowds around the lockers and just go straight from class to the bus. Back in elementary school, backpacks were allowed in classrooms, but once you got into a school with lockers, your backpack had to go away in there.

Universities/colleges in the US (they're the same thing here) don't restrict by age, for the most part. I was 17 when I started attending my college, and occasionally students from the nearby high school would be bussed in to take a specific class. But if you were a gifted kid, excelling above all your peers, and teachers thought you could keep up with more work, you'd be offered to skip to a higher class. In high school, with students shuffling from one class to the next, your classes weren't really restricted to your age group. It was really easy to shuffle your schedule around to accommodate a higher-level class.

AP classes alone wouldn't get you a degree. There's only so many of them, and I think you could get 4 college credits per exam? And they'd only count towards select sections, like AP Gov would cover a politics credit or AP Psych would let you skip Psychology 101 to take higher Psychology courses in college. Some colleges don't take AP credits. But you could shave off a few required courses so you could use your college time taking courses that counted towards your major. In my college, 1 credit basically equalled 1 hour of class a week. Most of my college classes were 3 or 4 credit hours (per semester), and I'd have about 14-16 credit hours a semester. I'm disabled, so I wasn't able to take the 18-21 credit hours per semester that most other full-time students would take.

We had probably above average American school lunches. Hot lunches would rotate between cheeseburgers, pizza, curly fries, salisbury steak, hot dogs, chicken, mozzarella sticks, and skyline chilli and pasta (Cincinnati area school; Skyline is a classic here) (with sides). There were also salads, peanut butter sandwiches, bagels, and soft pretzels. Gatorade and milk cartons. There was also a chest freezer full of ice cream treats. The chicken was widely known as the best way to give yourself food poisoning.

In regards to scheduling electives, I think we received a paper with a list on it and just... circled what we wanted. There were also computer classes, I forgot about those. You'd talk to a guidance counselor over your choices to make sure that you weren't picking a class that was too high-level, ex, taking honors chemistry B when you just barely passed your last chemistry class. (you'd instead be encouraged to take a different science class, like a zoology-focused science class).

With boundless teen energy, it wasn't so bad keeping up with everything. When I got sick, I definitely couldn't keep up, and I remember a number of other students who would routinely accidentally sleep in and were definitely exhausted by the workload on top of lost sleep. I think just making breaks between classes be ten minutes would go a long way to easing some of the stress of everything.

Study hall: you either sit in a big room where you aren't allowed to talk and you work on your homework/study/read, or you sat out in the big lobby outside the cafeteria and chatted with friends. I would usually sit in the lobby area at a table and scroll through tumblr if I wasn't talking to other friends who had study hall at that time as well.

Health class: talk about sex, STDs, drugs, and the absolute basics of general health. We had a lot of "guest speakers" who came in to talk about drugs, sex, and the importance of sleep (everyone laughed at that one because we all knew the school schedule was the absolute worst for a teenager's sleep cycle).

Freshman being viewed as small comes about because most of the incoming class of freshman are about 12-14 years old. In other words, puberty and growth spurts haven't hit yet. Seniors, around 17-18 years old, have gone through all that growing and tower over everyone else. Everyone's grown taller and filled out with muscles and aren't in that lanky stage anymore. So the freshmen vs seniors divide is very, very obvious. My school would call freshmen "fresh meat."

** Most common detentions are lunch detentions. I think my school might've had afterschool detentions but I can't remember and if they did it was super rare. During detention you'd sit quietly and work on homework, eat your lunch, and you couldn't use technology.

You could earn a detention by reaching the late or absent limits. Or enough dress code violations. Or if you were especially rude to a teacher or did something stupid (like vandalism, etc). Or if you were bullying someone, whether in person or online. Also cheating and plagiarism. All of these offenses usually start off as a warning, except bullying which my school had a zero tolerance policy for.

All punishments build up. So if you're late enough or absent enough or you have enough dress code violations, you'll earn a detention. If you've got enough lunch detentions you'll earn an afterschool detention, if you've got enough afterschool detentions, you'll earn an in school suspension (a lunch detention that lasts all day, ie isolation, no technology, doing classwork/homework). You can also loose privileges if you've had enough write ups. Like my school let seniors eat off campus, but if you got in trouble enough you'd loose that privilege. I believe you could also loose your parking pass, but I think that was only for parking lot violations. You could get banned from afterschool activities, from sports, from walking at graduation, from homecoming or from prom.

An example from my senior year was when the valedictorian got an in-school suspension because he got in an argument with a classmate over abortion and posted something rude about her on his private instagram and one of her friends saw it and reported it. He wasn't allowed to go to prom because he got suspended that semester. Punishments rack up over semesters, and then for the next semester you get to start over. So if you got suspended the first semester, but you didn't the second you could still go to events and stuff.

As far as athletes go, I really think it depends on the school, because my school didn't have good sport teams so student athletes weren't favored. And most schools don't have star football teams, none of the ten high schools in my county had good athletes. I do think that there was a higher tolerance for higher achieving students and wealthier students.

Side note: my school had a really competitive marching band, I wasn't a part of it, but I heard from a friend who was, that if a section (flutes, trumpets, etc) was slacking off or messing around they'd get punished with running laps around the field.

**** That's interesting. I didn't expect that semester turn-over thing. Seems quite forgiving, really. Would that really not transmit at all, though? If you basically got to just below the threshold of serious punishment in one semester, would that be forgiven if you started getting in trouble again in the next semester?

It's a really interesting comparative to my experience where punishment was a lot more immediate. I guess my school was just in need of more firm control: it did fail Ofsted inspection twice in my time there (possibly more after I left) before being closed a couple years back.

Reading over your comment, it does all seem *very* amusingly American - be free and do mostly what you want until you piss authority off/do something to violate the rules and then your freedoms are curtailed. It does seem very gradated, very mandated with a strict mechanism for how punishment is earned, meted out, and progressed when necessary. That's good info. You probably wouldn't get the sorts of punishments that Hogwarts had where it was up to the whims of whatever Professor caught the troublemakers, then.

Would you get banned from all events at once, or just one at a time? 'First penalty, you can't go to Prom, second penalty, you can't go to Homecoming, third penalty, no after-school underwater basket-weaving club for you' etc.

That band thing is fantastic. I'm just imagining a group with those low-hanging marching band drums running laps and it's a delightful image. :D

***** Big things like suspensions are what matter on your transcript, but they're not common at all. They are still on your transcript too, so like if you repeat a big offense you'd totally risk expulsion. The rollover is really just for things like absences, lates, and dress code.

Homecoming week is in the first semester, and prom and graduation are in the second semester. So you could loose homecoming, but you'd have to do it quick because it's like a month in. However, if you did something very egregious at the end of the previous year, like in the last week or so, you could lose it. You're more likely to loose a big event. Losing afterschool stuff would come in periods of time, so like a month at a time, or you could loose the entire semester or year at once. It's definitely dependent on what you've done.

I admit, Transcript did throw me before I googled it and found out it was the word for student records in the States. It's been awhile since I watched anything involving American Students (I think Gilmore Girls was the last, just before the new season came out) and I'd forgotten the meaning.

Okay, so minor stuff gets forgiven, the big stuff doesn't. Good to know. Is there an accepted threshold where absences, lates, and dress code escalate to big punishment? Like, say you were late to your first lesson of Thursday every week for the entire semester, then continued that to the next, would that be rolled-over or would you get punishment in the second Semester for continuing?

I was just using them as examples of events, since we don't really do events other than Prom here, and we only started that about 20 years ago. I have no idea what Homecoming actually is. But okay, the rest of the timing stuff makes sense - the worse the fuck-up, the longer the punishment.

******* It's not a very high threshold. I think it was like 3-5 of the same type, but a lot of teachers were pretty lenient about lates and dresscodes. My school was physically very large, so if you were coming from far away and your teacher was nice they'd let it slide if you were a minute or two late, or if it was raining heavily, which it does a lot here. Being consistently late would get you in trouble consistently.

Homecoming is a week of fun events. The specifics are different at different schools, but they tend to follow in the same vein, celebrating school pride. Like some small towns used to have parades for homecoming. I think historically it might have been about returning veterans, but don't quote me on that. At my school, each day was themed dress up day and you didn't have to wear the uniform, and Friday was cross dress day for the seniors (tradition, but not sponsored by school officials). There was a pep rally on Thursday in the afternoon during class, you'd get out to see. There was a club tournament one evening after school where all the clubs would send their members to compete in stuff like tug of war and three legged race. On Friday in school there was Carnival, which was the best bit. The whole afternoon instead of class the clubs set up booths selling food and there was a gong show (a bad talent show), karaoke, pie a teacher, and other games. Friday night was "the big game" so to speak, usually in teen movies the football game they show is the Homecoming game. It's supposed to be against your rival, I guess? Then Saturday there's a dance, it's not a nice dance like prom, but everyone in school can go, whereas prom is just upperclassmen (juniors, seniors). It's basically a mosh pit in the gym.

******** Ah, okay. Yeah, that definitely would not have happened at my secondary school. Possibly my Sixth Form, but definitely not my secondary school. We had no pride whatsoever in the place, only befuddlement it hadn't been closed years back. We used to joke that the only thing that could make our school better than it was was napalm.

It sounds like a really interesting experience. A whole week sounds ridiculous, but definitely interesting. Except for pep rallies. I've never been able to see those as anything other than immensely dull. As an American who grew up with that sort of thing, do you find it fun to attend or were they more obligatory for you? And what kind of food would they likely sell? What do you mean by 'your rival'? Like, specifically a football rival?

Do you think a magical school like Ilvermorny would do homecoming like you describe, or might there be older traditions that they'd favour?

********* I have been reliably informed by my grandmother that Homecoming is for returning graduates to visit. So for Ilvermorny I imagine there'd be a big quodpot match and graduates would be invited to attend. Also clubs are a huge thing here, my school had a ton of them, so I think Ilvermorny would have a more fleshed out club system than Hogwarts did, and they'd do like a club competition. The US isn't very old, so there aren't a lot of older traditions that I can think of, other than like fireworks and parades. If American wizards had the space, they'd definitely have parades with giant balloons.

Um, Pep Rallies can be fun because you got out of classes and students run them so its not super cringe, also they weren't very long maybe half an hour. In primary and middle school they were awful, because the teachers put them on before standardized tests and they were super cringe.

Booths. A lot of the popular clubs on campus with enough members to afford having a booth were cultural clubs - German, French, Spanish, Asian, South Asian, etc. So they'd sell sausages, crepes, tacos/nachos, fried rice/noodles, and samosas respectively. There was also clubs like JROTC (junior army), young democrats, and young republicans who'd sell drinks and 'crisps' and cookies. Honor Society hosted the gong show, band hosted the karaoke, and math club hosted the pie a teacher.

By rival I mean the rival school. Most high schools and universities with athletic programs have them, but only a few are super into it. It's usually tied to sports, but some have them against the next town over. It's just a fun way to increase the hype.

My county has a dress code. Collared shirts (polos or button downs) in white, black, or the school colors (mine was orange, yay). Jeans, shorts, or slacks in navy, black, or khaki and of an appropriate length. Younger than high school had to wear closed toed shoes. On Fridays we could wear a school sponsored tshirt, like a club shirt. You could wear sweaters or jackets as long as they didn't have swears or drug/alcohol references. So I wore my doctor who sweatshirt a lot so I didn't have to wear a polo. ;)

Thank you for the clarification/extra detail on all of that. I still can't quite see "Yay our school!" as an entertaining time in the slightest, but I imagine that's just the innate British cynicism to any institutional enthusiasm. The rest of it sounds fun, though, and I do hope to see a fic in an American school do that all right.

Ah, okay. Rival schools, huh. Just to clarify 'some have them against the next town over' means the school in that town, not the town itself, right? You wouldn't always have two towns competing like Nightvale and Desert Springs in the Welcome to Nightvale podcast?

Shit, really? Huh. I knew they were strict about shit like skirt-length and collar-bone surface-area displayed, but that's genuinely surprising that they'd mandate things like collared shirts. One of the American stereotypes we have in England is a lack of uniform and generally casual school dress. Back before we got used to that fact via media-oversaturation, there were a lot of jokes about it - quite similar in tone to those "Oh, you go to one of those hippy schools in the valley where they let you take time off to go 'find yourself'" things you see every so often in older LA-set TV shows.

At the college level, I briefly worked (2 weeks) in the call center, calling alumni to ask for donations. It was a whole operation.

Rivalry. Yes actually, some very small towns have feuds. It's usually historical, because the founders disliked each other or there was a family feud, or because the two high schools in each have a feud. But it's a BFE sort of thing.

We got our uniform because it would "improve test scores". They instituted it my junior year. Previously the only other school I had a uniform at was an elementary school in the inner city.

In general, most countries have very unique practices in their education systems. Japanese kids clean their schools, for example, which is indicative of a larger Japanese culture of cleaning spaces you use - though I'm told it is falling out of practice these days and student-littering is on the rise. You can tell some interesting things about a culture based on how they teach their children, but my main point is that every culture has something unique to it that others don't do. That could relate to detentions in the US.

Maybe they are the same thing as here. But also maybe not. We're a lot less culturally similar to the States than most people think, in some ridiculously subtle ways as well, so it's always best to check if America views things similarly to the UK than just to assume. For all I know, American Detentions involve fifty laps of the school football pitch shouting the national anthem in pig latin.

When I went to school, this was a thing. Don't know about now, but it was most definitely a thing. The reason why? Sports scholarships to pad their numbers. My school district graded schools on how many kids went to college, and which colleges they went to (for funding and whatnot). It also depended on the sport too. Soccer/Lacrosse/Field Hockey? You couldn't get away with anything. Baseball? Unless you were a very good player, you didn't get away with anything. Basketball/Football? Oh god, you got away with murder. Unless someone got seriously hurt, police were involved, etc. And woe is you if you actually reported one of the jocks and they got in trouble.
