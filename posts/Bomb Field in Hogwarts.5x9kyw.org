I remember reading this story ages ago. It was set after the war, and Hogwarts had been held by Death Eaters. They covered the place with rune traps. I believe it was Harry/Draco and that they were paired to disarm the traps because they had sympathetic magic.

Any ideas?


** Sounds like Transfigurations. linkao3(59676) I think I tried to read that one ages ago because the concept of rune traps intrigued me and had to stop after Draco referred to Hermione as Mione and McGonagall as Kitty iirc.

*** Thanks, that was it. Luckily Draco being a little shit and calling people weird nicknames doesn't bother me.

Do wish it had a more satisfying ending though.

  Draco found the nest down in the Manor's cellars, while he was clearing them out.

** Sounds like a porn fic I read on AO3 a week ago. I'd link it, but I'm pretty sure not even our Lord and Saviour Sir Fanficbot would be allowed to post smut that filthy in here, especially not after that New Rules post the mods posted.
