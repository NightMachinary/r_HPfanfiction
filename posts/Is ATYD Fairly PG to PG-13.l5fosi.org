I've recently started reading All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 and am loving it, (on chapter 30 rn) and I told my dad about it, and he wants to read it with me. I love it and want to, but I just want to make sure that nothing too extreme happens (seggs scenes) since that would be awkward when reading it with parents. Thank you for your time. Please let me know.


** I'd say it's more PG-13... There are 'seggs' scenes but they're not explicit, more fade-to-black. They're more along the lines of...'so-and-so drew nearer...after it was over..." I'd say try it out.

*** Thanks, Yeah I decided to recommend it to my dad, and I'm on chapter 110 now, but I am regretting it a /bit/ after reading chapter 108 lmao. Its a great story though.

** It's called sex. If you can't use the word, don't use bad misspellings, just find a euphemism. "Adult Content" "Mature Content" "intimate relations" "boinking"

*** I think on some social media sites the words if they are spelt correctly are flagged immediately and automatically so it's become common for younger people to intentionally misspell them so their posts don't get taken down. Also dbad

*** Eh, "mature" can mean other things, like in-depth emotional discussion. "Lemons", perhaps?

*** "Adult Content", "Mature Content" and all the other terms you listed aren't clear as to whether I'm talking about sex. I did not know that if on this sub you could get flagged for using the word sex, so I used a misspelling.
