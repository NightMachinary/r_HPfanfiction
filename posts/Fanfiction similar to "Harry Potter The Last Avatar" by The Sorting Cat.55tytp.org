Basically I want a Harry Potter fanfiction where there is no magic. There is only bending. I don't particularly care if he's the Avatar, but it is welcome.

Over 70k+ words please!


** Huh. I would have expected a lot more comments by now. Oh well.

*** This request is super specific. If I were to guess that is probably the only fic that fits your requirements, other than maybe some poorly written copy cats.

If you were to broaden it to where there is no hp magic, but is magic from some other universe you would likely get more results.
