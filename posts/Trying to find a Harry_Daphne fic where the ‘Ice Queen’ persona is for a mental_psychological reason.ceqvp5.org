:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this some time ago but can't find it in my follows/faves anymore.

Basically, Daphne was abused as a child and is emotionally stunted and mentally handicapped because of it. She seeks Harry out for tutoring during 5th year and tries to repay him with sex because that's all she can offer. She needs to pass her OWLs to escape her father's control. As a result of the tutoring lashed out at Umbridge less and makes his year a lot better.

Can provide more details if need be. A shorter fluffy piece that I felt like rereading but couldn't find.
