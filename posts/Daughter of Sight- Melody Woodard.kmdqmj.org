Melody had been haunted with horrible dreams for as long as she could remember, a dream of her parents' death. Meeting Minerva McGonagall changes everything, revealing there was so much more to her dreams and so much more the her as it is. Blessed with the sight and armed with determination, Melody sets out to make right the wrongs the Wizarding world left her life to wallow in.
