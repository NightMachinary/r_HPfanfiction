** For me, fanfiction is something I do for fun and for me. I love getting reviews, but I only post/write if I am happy with the results. I would never demand money from readers.

I think that fanfic writers who think they are entitled to a paycheque come off as arrogant and I will never ever read their stuff, no matter how good it is. J.K. Rowling and other authors, such as Tolkien and GRRM, worked hard to create these fantastic worlds and all we do is borrow their worlds for our own personal fantasies/stories. These worlds are shared with us, but we are not the creators. We may be writing the fanfics, but we are, technically, using someone else's work *without* their permission.

If a fanfic author feels they deserve money, then they should write their own original work. But, to me, if there is no legal contract and they are getting paid, it comes off as copyright infringment. There is a reason we usually write "This does not belong to me, I don't get paid for this" at the beginning of our fics (and it is covered in site rules), which is because we, legally, cannot receive money for writing our fanfics.

If someone, privately, wants to provide a donation because they are extremely happy or supportive, that is up to them. But the author should not demand or expect money from readers. They do not have to refuse a private donor, but they should not make monetary demands. Nor should they make the private donation public.

As someone else said, we are a community. We share our work with each other, we provide proper criticism, and we support each other. But we should not be demanding money from one another. I write fanfics because I love to and I will forever love the world JK created for us. But, if I want to get paid, I will write my own work (which I am currently working on).

Long and short: if someone wants to privately donate, it's up to them and keep it private! If someone demands payment, they're an arrogant twat.

** The fanfiction community is exactly that: a community. The relationship between reader and writer is not one of seller and buyer but rather of colleagues--there's a sense of mutualism.

The commercialisation of this relationship can be summarised thus:

I'm having a birthday party and I make a cake for it. An acquaintance gives me a bit of help in making the cake and I invite them to the party. We have fun.

The next week it's my acquaintance's birthday. I help them make a cake, they invite me to the party. Only when I arrive at their party, it turns out they're charging for slices of cake.

*** I completely disagree. If there are two guys busking in the centre of town and one charges nothing for his music while another has a hat in front of him and a sign saying "Please contribute if you feel like this music adds value to your life" is the second guy an asshole because the first guy is giving stuff away for free?

Your analogy of the party is stupid. We collectively understand that being invited to a party means you're getting cake - and both people get invited to the party. A better analogy for fanfiction writing is: guy makes cakes, every week, for free. One day guy says "I love making cakes, and I want to keep giving people free cake, but if you like the cake, giving me a bit of money would make it easier for me to make more cakes."

You're not being invited to read fanfiction - the author is putting it out there, FOR FREE, and saying "I'll keep doing this for free but it's very labour intensive and I really believe in the philosophy this work espouses, which is why I've dedicated my life to working for this non-profit and I write things like this to convey that message. If you agree with what I believe or if you just like the work I'm putting out, paying money means I have more time and more incentive to create that work." You're radically misconstruing this situation to make the author whose work you admire look like a bad person for something he hasn't done. Don't be an entitled fucking asshole.

We're all part of the same club, no single fanfiction writer would be able to do what they do without all the others.

It's you who are radically misconstruing the situation. The offer wasn't "I'm going to do this anyway, you can donate if you want to say thanks, but it will have no direct effect on what I produce". It was "If you give X money by Y time you will get Z reward" -- a archetypical commercial relationship governed by a contract.

***** The fanfic author uses other people's characters in the same way that buskers play other people's songs. Anyway, you're a Harry Potter fan. Did you pay to see the films? Because the only difference between them and fanfiction is that someone somewhere went "this'll be totally profitable for our film studio, let's get JK Rowling to sign off on it".

As for using someone else's characters and settings, the best fanfiction to me is that which takes the world created by the original author and explores it in a way that the author never dreamed. There are fanfiction stories out there which would be completely unrecognisable as such by the end if all the names had changed, but I read those stories because the characters had those names.

I think that kind of fanfiction can be considered far more 'original' than the hundreds of copycat books with a young orphan going to wizarding school which came out just after Harry Potter got big, but I don't think those authors don't deserve a chance to ask for their work to be compensated. You don't like a book? Don't pay for it. You don't think the author deserves some money? Don't give it to him.

And once again, we're not talking about an expectation of profit, we're talking about someone saying "Now I've got your attention with this work of art I've spent hundred of hours of my life on for free, I'd be very grateful if anyone who feels that what I've done has added value could contribute to this cause I represent".

BUT. Your analogy between fanfic and the films is preposterous. Warner Bros paid JK Rowling a huge sum of money for the rights to the films, she didn't just "sign off." She agreed to allow the film studio to use her intellectual property in exchange for some contractually agreed renumeration. Fanfic is a whole 'nother thing.

** I'm not sure how these things even come up. I mean normally no fanfic reader would offer a fanfic writer money, so this means the author has to have either outright said he would only release future chapters if they got "donations" or at least strongly suggested this. And I have a problem with that. What makes a few authors think they have the right to demand money when everybody else is doing it for free?

In the MoR case, what he said was that donations would lead to an accelerated timetable of chapter releases.

He considered this a kind of dodge around the "can't ask for money" standard, but it a) is a technical dodge, as people are still paying money in exchange for the writing of fanfic and b) isn't even a good technical dodge, because doing something sooner than otherwise planned is recognised by courts as consideration for a binding contract.

Interestingly, that final point means that if he failed to update according to the timetable stated, readers could potentially sue him for breach of (unilateral) contract.

***** It's very easy to frame that in a way that looks shady, but if he was just doing it for the money, why would he bother using a non-profit organisation as a third party to pay himself? He asks for donations because that non-profit does something which he absolutely considers vital for the future of humankind. Yes, he also works for that nonprofit. Yes, he draws his salary from that nonprofit. Being paid for your labor is not a crime.

I find it so weird how people condemn people who expect payment for doing good things. If the CEO of a charity gets paid as much as the CEO of a bank, because their workload and responsibility are comparable and their expertise is of a similar value, it makes no sense to condemn the CEO of the charity more than the banker. Yes, money from the charity's account is going to him, but without him, there is no charity. Maybe all CEO salaries are too high, that's its own issue, but condemning the guy who does a difficult and worthy job for having the same expectations of being compensated for his labor and time stems from this stupid, childish belief that charities shouldn't have overheads. It's so easy to tell yourself that people should be doing charity work out of the goodness of their hearts, but I bet you don't spend all your free time volunteering with orphaned puppies.

LessWrong isn't trying to pull some weird wool over your eyes to get a bigger paycheck, he's asking that people support the cause he truly believes in, whose philosophy is taught in every example of his oeuvre of work.

IIRC a lot of it is a combination of the weird expectation you described, and a lack of concrete metrics to legitimately rate them on. Something like how do you rate a charity working towards curing a disease before the cure is found and you can say who/what actually helped with the discovery?

****** I actually agree with your first paragraph. I do think the author is doing it to benefit the NPO he works for and not for himself. My dream is to one day work for a NPO and I respect that they have to pay their employees an acceptable salary for their work. It's not realistic to ask full-time staff to work without pay, even if it's "for a good cause". The bulk of these donations are most likely going for this NPO to continue doing its research, with maybe a small amount going to overhead costs that need to be paid for this NPO to continue to exist. (Side note, I wish people would stop calling it a charity, it's a NPO that researches artificial intelligence. Charity gives a different connotation.)

The only way I can see this being shady is if the author suddenly got a raise and was pocketing the donations that way. Basically using his NPO to launder money from his fanfiction. Although, we wouldn't know either way if that was the case.

In regard to the rest of your points: I think in some cases, even with NPOs and charities, CEOs are being paid unreasonably high salaries. That's probably a topic for another discussion.

Another topic would be whether he has the right to use Harry Potter material to fund raise donations for this NPO.

The idea of copyright and ownership of ideas and stories was invented by record companies in the early 1900s. People have been reworking and reforming other people's art into their own distinct works since before the beginning of history. Many of Shakespeare's best plays were based heavily on works by other contemporary authors and playwrights. All human cultural expression makes sense only in the context of its production and all the media which has gone before it. How original does something have to be before someone who has put in work is 'deserving' of your cash? If you like Harry Potter, I bet you paid to see the films in the cinema.

**** Okay - let's take a case of an original work: Sherlock Holmes and all the people who are not Conan Doyle who are making money on Sherlock Holmes.

What's the difference between "Elementary" the US TV show and "HP and MoR" the fanfiction?

First off, the creators of "Elementary" are licensed by the [[http://www.conandoyleestate.co.uk/index.php/movies-and-tv/][Conan Doyle estate]] which means they have permission to use the characters and have compensated the estate.

"MoR" is not licensed by JKR or any other of the rights holders to Harry Potter and I seriously doubt the author of "MoR" and his non-profit compensates JKR etc for using Harry Potter. Furthermore, the author of "MoR" is making a profit off of Harry Potter which directly opposes JKR's request.

Wah wah you say - he's just asking for a donation to an NPO. It's a charity afterall. But he's being paid by the NPO and he is profiting.

If you bought a computer from a guy on Craigslist but you didn't know it was stolen - it doesn't make it NOT stolen, it just makes you ignorant of the crime and no one reading this thread who is still saying "oh it's a donation" is ignorant of the crime.

If you can't trust that any money donated would go to furthering the cause of that NPO and not his salary, you don't have to make any donations. I imagine that's the rationale - it matters less that people think he's in it for the money than that the NPO gets more money.

If people see it his way and believe he's not selfishly motivated, that's better from his perspective because they'll be more inclined to give, but if people believe they're putting money directly in his pocket and give anyway, the material outcome is the same. People keep bringing up the fact that he founded and works for the NPO as though it's some big secret he tried to keep from his audience, but it's not, he's as open as he can be about his motivations in all his outputs, because the best strategy is one which doesn't rely on the strategy being a secret.

He wants people to believe in and support this cause he's literally dedicated his life to, a cause he believes is vital to the continued survival of humanity, and he's willing to accept the possibility of some people misinterpreting that as self-interest because the payoff is still more donations than if he doesn't ask.

** P/S/A: The original post is a lie, no one's ever paid me a cent for HPMOR and I have no intention of ever asking for one.

The actual event which the trollpost is twisting is that one time while the charity I work for was running its annual fundraising campaign and seemed to be in danger of not making it, I said that upcoming chapter releases would be 1 per 2 days instead of 1 per 4 days if the charity made its fundraising goal. My salary did not depend on this fundraising goal in any way, theoretically or actually. Furthermore, the number of chapters being released was predefined, so there wasn't additional content being generated or held hostage in exchange for donations - what I'd already written was just being released faster, depending on whether the charity made its fundraising goal.

I've advertised other charities as well in the author's notes of HPMOR, and don't regret it. I doubt J. K. Rowling regrets it either, and if she does, she's welcome to say so.

*** Congratulations on entering the final arc of your story. While I haven't followed it since its early chapters, I nevertheless respect the level of effort involved in completing an ambitious, novel-length work.

I think much of the question of the original post's being a 'lie' comes down to parsing. While you did not receive direct remuneration for your writing, you did ask for donations in response to providing a derivative fiction product on an accelerated time scale. To many, this would meet the criterion of "accepting donations" for writing fanfiction and, despite the strict legality of the matter or the nature of your ties to 501(c)(3) organization, it understandably puts a few people off. It's not an E. L. James level of putting people off, granted, but it does seem to leave most in the community with an uneasy feel once money or donations get mixed up with the craft of writing fanfiction. (And for the record, [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/][S'TarKan]] (Matthew Schocke) of /NoFP/ fame is arguably far more culpable with respect to his shameless acceptance of donations for fanfiction writing, which is part of why I do not read his story any more.)

**** As said, I think there is a direct moral disagreement with people who think that /nobody/ or /nobody associated with you in any way, including a nonprofit/, not just you, can be associated with any money whose movement is triggered by your fanfiction in any way... though in that case they really should be crusading against fanfiction.net for taking ads and thereby profiting off the fanfictions, one would think.

Personally, I give blanket permission to all to take my original fictional works, such as Three Worlds Collide, steal the world and characters, and sell their derivative works at a profit if they so desire. I have a tremendous disagreement with the way modern copyright law is set up and I think the doujinshi culture of Japan, or Shakespeare's ability to riff off common works of his own era, are tremendously healthier than today's infinite copyright. I don't think I'm morally entitled to royalties from the author of the off-Broadway play /Yudkowski Returns: The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski/ which was produced without my knowledge or consent.

  While I tend to publish most of my writing for free, I strongly believe that money is not evil. Therefore, anyone is welcome to take characters or settings from my original online fiction, such as the beisutsukai or the Baby-Eating Aliens, and use them in new commercial works of your own creation. I do ask for acknowledgment and a link or other reference to the original, but so long as the writing is your own, you may charge for access, distribute printed copies, sell the story to a magazine, etc. I don't mind.

That general attitude does inform my approach to fanfiction, and while I diligently obey US laws against charging for fanfiction, and I am even okay with voluntarily abiding by both the letter and the spirit of a norm against asking for personal donations tied to fanfiction, I am not going to obey non-widely-agreed rules advocated by some individuals against advertising nonprofits, or whatever. I have an open moral disagreement with those individuals, and I'm cheerful about that being a thing.

I will accept any and all criticism of what I actually did, accurately conveyed without distortions or sly phrasings. I am /not/ okay with my actions being misrepresented.

***** I think that much of the disagreement stems from the grownups in the community knowing in their hearts that unauthorized publication of fanfiction of work not in the public domain is at best (in most cases) illegal in the U.S. and at worst morally wrong. I'm guilty of this, having published several such stories, only a few of which would be covered by Fair Use (something Shakespeare never had to fret over). None of my most popular fanfiction stories are covered as such, nor is yours.

The legal issue is separate from the moral disagreement you might have with your detractors. We may attempt to justify our illegal behavior with disclaimers of a story's not being published for profit (irrelevant), sugarcoat it with pretenses to Fair Use (inappropriate in the majority of cases, and nevertheless applied on a case-by-case basis), or claim that fanfiction is a sort of "legal gray area" (it isn't: the law explicitly states that copyright holders have the /exclusive/ right to make derivative work from their copyrighted work). While U.S. copyright law is the mess that it is, we're knowingly breaking the law when we publish it. (As are the administrators of ff.net.)

So what we have is a largely underground community a hundred-thousand strong with a love affair for the organic, creative product that's sprung up about our beloved series, as well as a tenuous truce with the author and her publisher who appear to tolerate the use of their intellectual property in making derivative work--so long as it doesn't cross a line. We don't quite know quite where the line is but we do know the line exists--see RDR's attempt to publish the /HP Lexicon/ and the ensuing court challenge. Unlike RDR, we're not a major publisher with a high-powered legal team. If a challenge were ever raised to our publishing of fanfiction, if JKR ever said, "Enough, begone!" it wouldn't make it to a court battle. JKR's attorneys would only have to issue a single CAD to wipe out millions of hours of collective creative effort virtually overnight. It wouldn't matter if they were in the right, legally or morally; the threat of a lawsuit would have ff.net folding in a heartbeat.

And against this backdrop, the most public, outspoken figure in the fandom, the guy written up in /The New Yorker/ and /The Atlantic,/ goes and risks /draco dormiens nunquam titillandus/ over a Thoreauean stand that his interpretation of U.S. copyright law is necessarily the one the courts would uphold (except, of course, that it would never go to court). I'd hope you'd understand why once money gets involved, this changes the balance, making people uneasy. It doesn't matter, really, whether the money ends up in your pocket or your favorite non-profit to save humanity from a futuristic Big Bad. The small but nonzero threat of negative externalities sucks eggs.

Ours isn't the only community wrestling with issues of copyright law and the ensuing stifling of creativity. For example, there continues to be a huge folderol over the removal of cover songs and accounts uploaded to YouTube. The various open software movements also continually fight court battles over their stances with respect to legal sharing of software. It's true that U.S. copyright law remains overly restrictive and doesn't favor the creative use of media, nor will it anytime soon with our stridently pro-corporate Congress, but this doesn't mean that concern over actions that risk bringing the thing down are entirely unwarranted.

This is the difference between a public figure and private one; privacy protections for a public figure are much less restrictive. (Besides, that was Yudkowski with an 'i'; huge difference. I speak from authority, being named Brian with an 'i', not the despicable 'y'.)

****** Sir or Madam, I thank you first for your perspicacious and well-argued points.

It is not clear that HPMOR, which is (a) free, (b) very clear political expression, and (c) parody, would not be Fair Use under US law via the combination of these factors; I'm not aware of US law having tested a case like that. Which is mostly irrelevant in real life, since it's not like the rule of law is still a thing around here.

There's a general question of how much value to lose, for never trying or doing certain things, for risk of upsetting certain applecarts. For example, maybe I should never have written HPMOR because it attains a high profile and so brings down some terrible lightning upon all of fanfiction, independently of any worries about donations. But I don't think that scenario is actually realistic, and I tend not to let low-probability disaster scenarios that I do not think will actually happen in real life, ward me off from generating value, e.g., writing HPMOR and thereby edifying readers, or asking for donations to a charity in an author's note.

Once HPMOR is complete, I might seek out some avenue to Rowling and ask about publishing HPMOR (maybe under the title "HJPEV and the Methods of Rationality") with all profits accruing to a mutually agreeable charity, on the basis that HPMOR has generated a lot of new buzz about Harry Potter and that it will contribute to keeping the brand alive and vital. I mostly expect she'll say no or be overruled by suits. But (if I get around to it) that expectation won't stop me from /trying/ to generate even more value (in the form of more people enjoying HPMOR and income for the agreed charity), from /trying/ to ask Rowling just to see what happens, /merely/ because I mostly don't expect it to work. I mostly didn't expect HPMOR to work.

This does reflect a more dynamic approach to life than keeping your head down and trying not to make trouble. Whether that's /immoral/, or whether big disaster scenarios are realistic, is something where I might well disagree with someone else who feels a more instinctive drive to keep their head down. And I'm not sure I can think of much to say about that, beyond that sometimes people disagree in life, and good and virtuous people may well find reason to criticize me for things that I actually say, do, or advocate, which does not lead me to respect them any less; and that to misrepresent what I do is another matter entirely, and it is the matter I was addressing here.

That is directly asking for money in exchange for spending more time writing.

The story got finished anyway, though later, and my salary would have been unaffected by the counterfactual.

If people hate the idea of fanfiction being tied in any way to charity, then yes, I explicitly disagree and am 'guilty' as charged; I think it's perfectly fine to use the medium to advertise charities. But if they think I'm profiting personally off HPMOR, like the original post implies by saying that I'm 'asking for donations' (slyly implied: to myself personally), then I never made a red cent and wasn't intending to. No, not even indirectly in terms of increased job security or improved salary negotiating leverage. Most of MIRI's funding doesn't come from anywhere near HPMOR, I've been working there for 10 years before HPMOR was a thing, and the marginal funding donated to MIRI by some HPMOR readers genuinely doesn't affect my salary at all. Yes, really actually in practice. I helped cofound MIRI, which means that I'm core personnel whose salary isn't in doubt; I was already funnelling donations to MIRI in ways that have nothing to do with HPMOR; and I voluntarily work far under my market value. I already had 'brings in donations' as an attribute before HPMOR was a thing, HPMOR still isn't most of that attribute, and I don't use that attribute as salary negotiation leverage because nonprofit cofounder. Donations from HPMOR readers do not affect my job status or salary; they just make MIRI more able to do more other things like running decision theory workshops.

** *Disclaimer:* IANAL, and while there was a period in my life when I read and thought about these things a lot, it's been a while, so I might have forgotten things and/or not kept up with the latest developments.

There's the legal issue, which is messy, but would probably come out on the side of the franchise owner over the fanfic writer.

And then, there's the ethical issue. Personally, I think that copyright has weaker ethical grounding than rights over physical property overall, though I support limited copyright as a social contract. (Basically, copyright ethics --- last I looked, anyway --- drew a line between the /idea/ and the /expression/, and while the latter was restricted, the former was meant to be copied: that's how culture evolves.)

In this case, whereas unauthorized redistribution (commercial or not) of a work directly competes with the authorized distribution, distribution of fan fiction (commercial or not) does not diminish the original or its profitability in any meaningful way, so I don't consider it unethical. In other words, I don't see a frachise author having ethical standing to forbid fan fiction in the first place, even if our bloated copyright law might given them the legal one.

This is /especially/ the case for well-established franchises like /Harry Potter/. For smaller franchises, bad fanfic may do reputational damage to the author of the original, but there are less prohibitive mechanisms (like obligation to add a clear disclaimer) to mitigate that, and the issue is orthogonal to whether money is being made from the fanfic anyway. (Honestly, /Partially Kissed Hero/ would have probably done /less/ damage to HP fandom had PL charged money for it.)

So, personally, I don't have a problem with people even going so far as charging for the fanfic, as long as they make it clear and uprfront that they are not affilliated with the franchise, that the money doesn't go to the franchise's author, etc.. However, I acknowledge that, legally, as law stands, they are probably on thin ice.

Personally, I have no problems whatsoever with authors being paid or accepting donations. It is a transaction between two willing participants. HP MoR is an incredible achievement in captivating a vast audience in a crossover of Harry Potter and rationalism. If I'd never read it, I'd consider the concept absurd, and yet the author has made something special. Given the countless hours it has taken to research and write, I have absolutely no qualms with the author accepting donations or with readers giving donations.

The few authors thinking 'they have the right to demand money when everybody else is doing it for free' have that right because they are sufficiently talented, and have a fanbase who are willing to pay for it. All authors are welcome to request/demand payments in my mind, but only those talented enough at their art would actually receive that money.

*** The problem is that fanfiction is work based on copyrighted material. They have no right to make a profit off of someone else's work. In a case like MoR, yes, the author put a lot of time and effort into that story, but it wouldn't stand on its own without the world Rowling created. It's still using Rowling's world and expanding on things from the Harry Potter series.

I think if more fanfiction authors decided to take this route and request/receive money, regardless of talent, that would make the actual authors take action against it.

When you sign the guidelines on ffnet, there is a small number of authors who requested that the site not allow fanfiction for their work. As a result, ffnet doesn't take submissions for these works. Now, this is taking it to the extreme, but what if more and more authors/publishers/producers requested this because they don't like the public profiting off their book/show/whatever? Sure, that's not going to prevent all fanfiction, there will always be clusters of it somewhere on the internet. But it's going to take away easy access and a lot of people probably wouldn't bother with it.
