Hi all,

I've loved the Scorbus pairing since Cursed Child, and I've had a hard time finding many fics that help me forget my anger at the bait-and-switch of the play's ending. Anyone have any particular favorites? They don't need to be Cursed Child compliant but I would prefer an explicit Scorbus pairing by the end of the fic. Thanks!

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4605858][Summer Boys]] is a cute Scorbus.

I also loved the tea time series (already recommended).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/115114][Irradiance]] was pretty depressing but really well done.

And not Scorbus but a James/Scorpius I read recently and LOVED was [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/648800][Houses]]. Linkao3(412816; 115114; 4605858)
