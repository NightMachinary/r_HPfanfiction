While reading the "Muggle Wank" thread, I had a thought: do people who read a lot of "the wizarding world is superior", pureblood-heavy fics develop a similar opinion themselves?


** Which came first, the Phoenix or the flame? Do people read those fics because they agree with them, or do they agree with them because the read them?

In my opinion I think people are always influenced by what they read even when they say otherwise. I know my views tend to shift around on some things depending of what I've read lately.

** Definitely. My headcanon potter verse has be primarily shaped by the fan fiction I've read. I've likely read several times more fan fiction than actual HP books.

** I would imagine. This is based on characterization more, but I find people often read fics and get a very skewed version of that character and then use it as "proof" in debates or canon discussions. I seen a Dramione versus Ronmione debate a while back on this subreddit where someone posted a discussion between two friends of theirs that replied almost entirely of fanon arguments and headcanon. Or someone will list their reasons for hating Ron as a character and while some are valid, others seem to be heavily fanon influenced. Or when people take some throwaway line in canon and see it used so often in fanon that they forget it's not a big deal in canon.

** People that have read too many bashing fics definitely end up influenced, I think. And quite often I see people who think it was canon that Harry's abuse by the Dursleys was far worse than it actually was.

*** Abuse is still abuse even if it wasn't bad (sorry, but we don't really know the extent of the neglect and abuse at the Dursleys - they probably didn't beat Harry regularly with a belt or anything, but Dudley still beat him up regularly (Harry-Hunting!) and he often received no food (we don't know if he was seriously malnourished, but it's a possibility and it might have stunted his growth (compared to his parents he's not that tall after all and most people are at least as tall, if not taller, than their parents!))

***** There's no indication that that was not the case! Sure, it's speculation to say it did (just like it's speculation to say Vernon, Dudley and Petunia never hit him), but if it fits the fanfiction, then I am not against an author using it (note: I don't know if Rowling ever clarified how far the neglect/abuse went, but even if she did: The books never cleared that up, so it's no wounder that this became something that's up to the discretion of the writer in fanfiction! If the story is well written then I don't care if the author makes the Dursleys out to be total monsters (like say: Vernon the rapist!)!)

****** I'm sorry, but to me that just seems really over the top in the context of what's actually in the book. Harry clearly knew his own name, and we see the Dursley's referring to him as Harry. Harry mentions Dudley beating him up plenty, but not his aunt or uncle, so to say more is speculation and not canon. I'm totally not against it in fanfic, at all, but it gets a bit silly when people start to say it's what definitely canon. It even says in the book "the Dursley's had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he'd liked." As for Vernon the rapist, that needs to stay firmly in fanfic, please. You can (and I do) maintain that Harry was abused without turning it into a nightmare scenario.

******* I've never said that all of that was canon - I only stated that we don't know specifics (Harry doesn't like speaking about it - than again: He's "bothered" enough to ask Dumbledore not to send him back to the Dursleys!), but "He'd never been allowed to eat as much as he wanted." could mean that he was never given enough food to be fully saturated (which again might explain his stunted growth, I mean he's not exactly a midget, but he's not exactly tall either!)

I agree that beatings aren't canon ;) (sure they might have slapped him occasionally or spanked him, but not outright beating/whipping him with belts and other objects!)

Vernon is an ass, but I agree that (in canon) he's not a rapist!

Well, you can't - abuse is always a nightmare scenario (for the person in that situation), sure it could have been worse, but "the cupboard under the stairs" is still pretty bad IMHO (come on: Children don't belong in cupboards - even less if there's a whole other bedroom available!)

** Kinda the opposite. Seeing all sorts of /bad/ ideas in fics has likely influenced my interpretation of canon in terms of what tropes should be /avoided/ (if possible) when you're reasoning out conclusions from canon facts.

But the positive form doesn't really occur - I don't really see something in a fic and think "this should be a part of canon". Probably because my primary standard for how much I like a fic is how canonical it feels (not just factual compliance, but also feeling like canon in tone).

** I dunno but I found that after reading deconstruction fics I find that magic in real life would be a horrible thing. Which kind of bred my Practical Magic([[http://colesint.blogspot.com/2016/01/a-united-state-of-terrorism.html][not the movie]]) terrorism story idea.

** I think it's both the fics, and the kind of people you take your cues about what's good and bad from that influence your opinion. And if you're in a clique that thinks muggles shouldn't taint the sacred soil of a HP fic, then that's what you'll think.

People have an easy time slipping into a "Bubble" when online, even without search algorithms doing the work for them they tend to stick to like-minded people, and reinforce each other.

** Honestly, I didn't quite realise the level of blatant corruption and shittiness of the Ministry until I read a couple of fics.

Also, I didn't quite realise how strong Harry is magically until I read a few Super!Harry fics. No, I'm not saying that super!Harry is canon or anything, just that when all the ridiculous stuff Harry's done /in canon/ is put down on the same page, it becomes pretty obvious that Harry's fairly powerful in canon, too.

** Well, it's a fact that wizards (at the basic level) are superior to muggles:

No muggle dropped out of a window (like Neville!) will bounce (no: such a child will be DEAD afterwards!) or recover from injuries (broken bones!) in a few days (or a night if they are vanished and re-grown!) and no muggle can make for example a very detailed statue out of a piece of rock in seconds (transfiguration!) or fly (with or without a broom) etc. etc.!

The thing is they hamstring themselves with their narrow mindedness (suppremacists at least!), so over all they aren't superiour!
