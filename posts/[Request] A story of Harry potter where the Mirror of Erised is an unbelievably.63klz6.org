****** The issue is that I am not a great writer. I am excellent at coming up with plot devices and ideas, but actually putting them into action turns out terribly. Blood Runes is a conglomeration of a huge amount of plot devices, which when separated could form the basis of several decent fics. I wrote that story when I was a weird angsty teen. I wrote about 2000 words in one sitting, and uploaded. Each day, typing on my phone into the ffn copy paste box. Nothing was planned out, and all of the plot devices came to me while writing. So from a certain point of view, it is just a stream of consciousness of my most cringy teen years. But if you like it, then I suppose I am glad that someone is getting enjoyment out of it.
