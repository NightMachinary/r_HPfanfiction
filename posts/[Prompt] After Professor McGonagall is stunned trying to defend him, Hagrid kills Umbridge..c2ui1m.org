**** Hagdrid is a half giant, and we saw fullblooded giants take on far, far worse odds than that in the movie. As long as the aurors didn't whip out AKs, I wouldn't be surprised to see Hagrid simply shrug off most minor to intermediate level curses, stunners, hexes.

*** I'm not so sure.

Umbridge getting killed by a "half breed" would make her a martyr (especially with people like Fudge, Lucius Malfoy using the event for their own ends). People would magically forget how much she had it coming and just remember "the brave soul who warned us of the danger".

Even the students, in front line of the show, would probably switch their opinion and say things like "He went too far" or "I always knew he was dangerous".

*** Yeah, it's well known amongst the students that she was torturing kids. I know they spent a lot of the post-Dumbledore time pranking her and making her tenure miserable, but I'm surprised nobody stepped it up a notch and got a bit more even on things.
