:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I'm searching for this fic: Harry and Ginny are cleaning some Room in Nr.12 and get whisked away via old Family-Portkey. They land in an old Black summer home, find some infos about Regulus and Horcruxes and bond in the meantime. I think Ginny gets ill and Molly sends medicine somehow. There is a sequel about the consequences of their find and their evolving relationship.

Thanks in advance!


** The Legacy of Regulus Black [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=391]] This is it.

*** No that's not it. But I think they are both made for some Portkey-Challenge, maybe even the same.
