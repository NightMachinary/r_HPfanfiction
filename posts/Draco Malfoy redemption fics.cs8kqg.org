Really in the mood for a fanfic with quite specific parameters:

1. Must be well written and at least 40,000 words.
2. Must have Draco being every bit the spoiled, selfish prick he is in canon in the beginning.
3. Must have Draco being a good guy by the end; doesn't have to be perfect, but certainly better.
4. Must centre on Draco at least in part.\\

Fine with it being any pairing, including slash.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** I found this thread and started this story about two days ago and literally couldn't put my phone down reading it. AMAZING.

** I rather like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16821571][*/The Gloriana Set/*]] . The War is won, and Hermione Granger is back at Hogwarts as an “Eighth Year”, feeling reckless and determined to shed her prim bookworm persona. She will do as she pleases, and anyone who doesn't like it will see the business end of her wand. Also returning is Draco Malfoy, universally hated but determined to restore his family's name.

It's updated regularly and I like the characterization a lot there. But it's a love story first, so not sure if that's what you're looking for.

** I'm currently reading this one, and it's ticking all those boxes so far (though, I'm assuming that #3 holds true - it's definitely looking that way). Warning: Severitus

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12614376][Werewolf Discourse, OR: Nicolas Pereyra's Coffee Shop for Dipshit Cryptids]]

Post-war Draco, as supremely twattish as ever, is struck with sudden and incontrovertible lust for an unfairly hot Muggle cryptozoologist barista (OMC).

  Sometimes a family is a reluctant werewolf, an amateur cryptozoologist-slash-barista, a haunted doll, and a lot (like, an unhealthy amount) of coffee.
