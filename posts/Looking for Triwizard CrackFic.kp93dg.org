:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only things I really remember is that there was major Ron bashing, HarryxHermione, and set during 4th year.

Harry either gave his championship or somehow transferred it to Ron.

Harry or Hermione cursed Ron with a flatulence curse I think. It ended up causing part of Hogwarts to crumble because they spelled the gas to appear outside.

And that's all I really remember. I read this about 4 or so years ago on ffnet, and it was already completed by when I read it.

Thanks for the help!

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
