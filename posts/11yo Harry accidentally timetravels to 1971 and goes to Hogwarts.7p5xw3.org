11yo Harry, not de-aged, he has not even met Hagrid


** Color me intrigued.

I'll write it. I've been wanting to write an HP story for awhile now, but haven't been able to settle in which. This sounds perfect.

***** Well, I don't know. Maybe several years? Then he somehow returns to original time, either 1991 or just 20 years later.

Maybe he should stay for 3 years and return to 1994 for the tournament. And everyone suddenly realize that he was that boy from 1971's first years.

Or he is there for the whole 7 years and returns when the war has already started.

Or he never came back and just continues living in the past. That is a really interesting idea! He then comes to Hogwarts and becomes a professor of, say, Muggle Studies. Or Arithmacy (that intrigues me), or Runes. Let's leave DADA to canon. And then he is the one who saves the Stone, kills a basilisk and so on. Canon events but this time he is not a child but a man.

I guess Harry must understand that he is somehow in the past. He has no choice but to go to an orphanage (or some people found him lost on the streets and sent him there). And somehow he has to come to an idea of changing his surname. And something must be done about his appearances as he's a copy of James. Maybe a haircut will help?..

I imagine that he makes friends with Snape as it will open many opportunities for the plot later. And it's reasonable I guess. Harry saw a boy in hand-me-downs and decided that they're similar enough.

I'm just throwing ideas at you.

****** Why would it matter they look the same (Harry and James) if they are different people? It could just be coincidence as it happens quite frequently in our own world. The name thing though. He could change it or he could not. Perhaps he is a badass and is the reason Lily names her son Harry because he was her friend and nice to Snape. She wanted to remember old Snivellus but James was anti his name so they went with his badass best friend. Then young Harry can meet old Harry at Hogwarts and Old Harry can help guide the youngling through all the books behind the scenes. He could be the one who suggests to Fred and George to give Harry Jr the map and he can be the guy who suggests Hagrid be the one to pick Jr up for his letter delivery and such. I suppose in this canon Dumbledore will have known it was the original Harry Potter who is Sr and is ok with allowing him to make suggestions and such to keep young Harry on his paradox free path. He also can be there to remind Sr that he can't alter young Harry's life or else he'll never grow to accidentally go back in time essentially making Sr disappear. You can have the story end when young Harry hits the time loop and goes back and suddenly realises he was Sr all along and that's why they got along so well and why he felt such a strong connection to him. Final ending could be Jr becoming Sr and realizing his fate is to be stuck in this time loop but by sacrafice of himself he defeats Voldemort and saves all those who he loves. Sure Ginny would be sad and such but Sr could explain it to her on round two so she can continue linearly down her path knowing Harry is stuck in his time loop saving the world one and over again.

******* Wait, how can young Harry be at Hogwarts? He has gone into the past even before his Hogwarts letter.

******** I'll retcon that the trace detected his magic and sent him his letter. I dunno actually because if he went back in time he wouldn't magically be 11 again either.

********* That's not what I meant. In your version both senior Harry and junior Harry are at Hogwarts at the same time. Junior and Senior are even interracting. But the point of this fic is that Harry must time travel before he got the letter. He attends Hogwarts in the past, not present (meaning he never got to the 1st September 1991 and was claimed as vanished/kidnapped/something else).

If the plot follows that route that I suggested (he never time travels again and has to live from 1971) then in 1991 he, being already grown-up 31yo man and possibly a professor at Hogwarts, hears that the famous Harry Potter vanished as Hogwarts owl hadn't managed to find him and give him his letter.

If he follows another route of events and manages to travel back to present (either to 1991 (after his younger copy vanished) or to (197x + 20) year), then he continues his studying there.

The point is older and younger Harry don't have a chance to even meet each other.

Though linkffn(Sine Qua Non by AzarDarkstar) might have what you wanted but it's unfortunately abandoned.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

** I have a vague recollection of one like this where harry gets his letter and manages to get to hogwarts and rides the train with lily but doesn't have anything and maybe even is friends with snape and then in the end he is at the staff table or something. I think it was badly written and thus not saved by myself.
