I'm looking for stories with Horcruxes that don't come with the common drawbacks such as insanity. I want Horcruxes to be a powerful way to ward off death and the only reason to not create one is because it's unethical to kill someone to create one. Ideally, there's even a struggle in the main character when he/she finds out about Horcruxes as they are tempted to create one.


** so...you want something that splits your soul to have no drawbacks at all and be completely busted? Magic of all kinds should have draw backs, even in things like DND or Lord of the Rings creating their Horcrux equivalent is something hard even for "gods" to do. Phylacteries in DND cause you to rot away and become undead lich when you do so and Sauron put so much of his power into the One Ring that he couldn't function in the physical world without it.

Why shouldn't powerful magic like Horcruxes have downsides? if we take away said downside any schmuck looking to become immortal could make one and that'd be stupid.

*** Well you kind of make my point for me. I've read so many stories where Horcruxes made Voldemort insane, or an alternate version of him defeated himself, or <more examples>. I want a few stories where this isn't a case. Your opinion is subjective as well. I'm personally far more interested in a situation where magic /doesn't/ have drawbacks, where it's clearly the better choice at the sole cost of your morals.

Where did I say easy? It's not exactly common knowledge. Not to mention while I don't doubt many people would be tempted by one, I doubt that most of those people would be willing to do the killing and ritual to create one. Voldemort wouldn't hesitate; the benefits are easily worth a murder and ritual. Someone like Dumbledore, even as a child, would probably be tempted but unwilling to go through with it.

What's more interesting and gives you more investment in a story? Where Harry just casually beats Voldemort because he's insane due to his horcruxes and can't control his anger? Or where Harry, Hermione, and Ron are struggling to survive and win against a Dark Lord that's cold, cunning, and ruthless and also unkillable to boot and it takes an even greater amount of cunning to defeat him?

In short, I'd like to read something different and intriguing that makes me more invested. I'd rather read a story where magic is powerful rather than where you might as well not use magic because of the drawbacks.
