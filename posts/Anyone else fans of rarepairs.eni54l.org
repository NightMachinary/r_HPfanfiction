I'm a huge fan of crackshipping and rarepairs. I like ships that are based on parallels/foils, favorites including:

1. Luna Lovegood and Theodore Nott, both loners who witnessed death at a young age, and can see thestrals. Both self-sufficient and unconcerned with others' opinions of them. Theodore is a pureblood elitist and son of a Death Eater, while Luna is just a sweet girl and a hero. Good fics have some well-written handling of conflict and redemption of Theo's prejudice
2. George Weasley/Padma Patil, (I'm reading into Padma's character, as we do with blank-slate ships) both identical twins and DA members. Both are considered more intellectual than their twin, though George hides it better. While Padma and Parvati sought to differentiate themselves from one another, Fred and George became Forge/Gred, embracing being thought of as one unit. Angsty, hurt/comfort fics exploring twin dynamics post battle at Hogwarts are an interesting read

I was wondering if anyone else had rare ships that they loved, with a few fics but little overall visibility that they'd like to share. :)


** I love oliver wood/marcus flint stories. I love the fics in which they are both Quidditch obsessed and their teams have to deal with them. Also after-Hogwarts fics

**** These are some that I've bookmarked.

Linkao3(14291154) I liked that one. Oliver and Katie are besties and Percy was kinda an ass for some time. Marcus is just precious in this.

Linkao3(20568335) A longer fic. After-Hogwarts and we get a lot about Quidditch.

Linkao3(5025334) This fic got me into the pairing. Very sweet and really funny. The whole series is great. All of them are little soulmate fics with different pairings. I highly rec this one.

  turning up to his ex-boyfriends wedding without a partner on his arm is something oliver wood refuses to do. which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't painfully single when the invitation to percy weasley's wedding dropped on his kitchen table one monday morning. with three months to find a love to take as his plus one, oliver seeks out the first person he can find who will agree to fake-date him for an evening. it's just pure coincidence that the person ends up being hawaiian shirt wearing, bar-tending marcus flint.

  When he received a letter inviting him to try out for England's National Quidditch team, Oliver had no idea that accepting the invitation would force him to confront his feelings for Marcus Flint, something that he would much rather forget about - after all, there is Quidditch to be played.

** Uhhh Katie Bell/Marcus Flint is one of my guilty pleasures. There's not a ton of fics out there but I swear I've read them all! Usually the characterization is Katie is Marcus' morality pet, and most of the time Katie is pureblood so they know each other outside of school from those circles (I don't remember Katie's blood status in canon). Sometimes Marcus is secretly anti-Voldy but his family is all up in the Death Eaters so being with her is like an escape for him.

I have never heard of Luna/Theodore but I ship Luna with everyone so why not! I am also intrigued by George/Padma, that sounds like a good time.

**** Apologies if I don't do the linking thing right...

linkao3(59264) "Best Kept Secret" - This is probably my favorite. Post-Hogwarts where they run into each other professionally and shenanigans ensue. It gets smutty so fyi if that's a problem!

linka03(71012) "As Savage as Love" - *very dark* and features Death Eater Marcus, so if that does not intrigue you, skip this one!!!

linkffn(5109606) - "Detained" - I ADORE this one and it is unfinished, which is utterly heartbreaking because it is an amazing story and is really well written! Begins at Hogwarts and continues after they both graduate. Worth reading even though it's not finished. Marcus is not evil but he's not a boy scout either. Excellent!

Enjoy!

** I am also a fan of rarepairs that have a reasonable rationale for happening. Not really sure why; maybe it's a way to make sense of how people grow up and evolve through fiction. Maybe because I'm not the person people have expected me to be. But whatever the explanation, it finds its way into my writing and reading.

** I dig Hermione/Tonks. Sadly, there isn't much written with that ship, but it boils down to Tonks bringing out Hermione's fun side. The foil thing is a theme as well because Hermione was generally more mature for her age and Tonks acts silly and isn't ashamed of that ("the ability to behave myself"). It would be a similar dynamic to what you see in a lot of Fleur fics, but I simply find Tonks more likeable since she was friendly towards the cast when Fleur was not.

There was a very promising fic (Dignity in Fear) which had a superb depiction of emotions but was ruined when the author inserting her own opinions on LGTB solidarity. Hermione completely forgets about Harry after the DoM but tolerates a lot of shit from Lupin (but he's allowed to be a dick, he's gay and lost his crush. What about Harry? Who gives a fuck?). I wish I was exaggerating. The author even PMed me to tell me that she had no interest in writing straight characters, even if that meant excluding most of the canon cast.

** user provocative_envy on ao3 almost exclusively writes odd pairings like this. her writing is pretty good so you might want to check her out if you haven't already. off the top of my head, she's written luna lovegood/cormac mclaggen, harry/pansy, marcus flint/cho chang and loads more.

i personally really like marcus flint/oliver wood. i'm not sure how rare that is, but yep. my guilty pleasure for grey fics is hermione granger/tom riddle (yes, i know it's Wrong, but the character explorations are /so/ fascinating).

edit: i don't know who's downvoting me for my comment for whatever reason, but if it's because i mentioned tomione, grow up. people read problematic pairings, it's not the end of the world

** Dean Thomas/Hermione Granger is one I'd like to see more of. I can see them getting together during Hogwarts as Dean is outside the Golden Trio, but still close enough to be aware of everything that's going on. In my head I see them running across each other randomly outside of school, visiting a museum in London then starting a conversation. That said, I think I've only found one fic that had them shipped during school, all the others were post-Hogwarts fics.

Cedric/Tonks, Snape/Tonks, Colin/Pansy, Blaise/Pansy, Neville/Pansy, Cho/Dudley and Cho/Lee Jordan probably round out all the rarepairs I've ran across at some point in time, enjoyed, and wish I could see more of.
