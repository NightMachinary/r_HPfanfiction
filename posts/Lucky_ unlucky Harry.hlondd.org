Are there any fics that deal with Harry's luck? Such as him getting cursed or blessed with good or bad luck or some magical accident maybe that is the reason for his 'Potter luck'.

Open to any recs and pairings/crossovers etc (although I don't know manga or anime..)


** Linkffn(Harry Potter, squatter) Harry's lick is addressed in this and why it goes to such extremes.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** Well there is a story called Lucky Harry by pyrgus where Hsrry has "good luck"

linkffa(457)

There's an abandoned short story called The Best Worst Luck by BabLe7 where again Harry has "good luck".

linkffa(641)

Then there is a much longer abandoned story 120K+ called The Consequences of Honest Dialogue by jacee2u but in this case Harry bemoans his status as Fate's "bitch".

linkffn(3505988)

Multiverse by Bobmin356 where again Harry bemoans his status as Fate's "bitch".

linkffn(7390178)

And the already mentioned Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot where Harry has lots of "good luck" against the bad guys while bemoaning all of the bad guys interfering with his vacation.

  An accident at the age of six turned out to be a lucky thing for Harry Potter. It could get him all the things he had ever dreamed about and many things that he could have never imagined; girls, adventure, a home, and love.

  What if the 'power he knows not' wasn't love? What if it was immunity to something all men fear; female vengeance? A response to my own challenge. harry/multi (technically harem i guess)

** There's a crackfic - linkffn(Luck of the Absurdly Lucky by Right What Is Wrong) - in which Harry overdoses on Felix Felicis.

And linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) has as its blurb, "Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected."

There's another story I recall, in which Ron joins Chudley and finds out why their record is so bad (they have a malaclaw as a mascot, and all the players have become addicted to its poison). He keeps trying to get Harry to join the team, but I don't remember if he succeeds.
