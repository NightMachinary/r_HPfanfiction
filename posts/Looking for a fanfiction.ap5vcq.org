I started it but it wasn't complete and I forgot to subscribe or bookmark and now I can't find it. It was a time travel. When in the room of mysteries something happens and everyone gets split up. Harry ends up in the past with Tom Riddle at Hogwarts still and Hermione seems to be back in normal time but is in Ravenclaw and her memory has been modified. That was all that was written so far. Anyone know this one?

** Sorry it took so long for a reply. Also hope you're still around. Is it possibly The Consequences of an Altered Dimension by Mavrick? It only just updated so I couldn't remember where to look for it when I first saw this request.

*** Thanks! That sounds like it. I had given up hope.

Yes this is it.

#+begin_quote
  With the Time Room in the Department of Mysteries being a poor choice for a hazardous battle to take place in, their well-intended mission to rescue Harry's godfather turned to pandemonium. They now find themselves lost in time and many others are stuck in a broken timeline. This is the story of how people across time and space decide to deal with that.
