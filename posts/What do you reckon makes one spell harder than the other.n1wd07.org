It is believed magical cores don't exist and every wizard can use magic indefinetely.

If the power behind the spell isn't the problem, what makes the Shield Charm hard for some? And if they do know the Shield Charm, why don't they use the strongest version?

I can understand how rituals and potions may have different degrees of difficulty, but I can't imagine the same for spells.

What do you think?


** This is why I can never really understand a magic/powers system with no personal limits for the users, it makes any concept of competion between users nonsensical. You don't have to call it a 'magic core', it could be the amount that can be channelled through the caster before they are 'exhausted' or 'damaged' in some way. It could be the amount of 'mental strength' or 'willpower' required to bend the magic to their purpose, and the more magic or the more demanding the task the quicker you are worn down. While the magic core description gets quite a lot of flack because of how it is abused in bad fics to make Harry unresonably powerful, you need some mechanism like it so that your characters have limits to push.

One aspect however that I feel often gets overlooked is speciality. I don't just mean school subjects, but specific spells or themes. I always imagine magic as holding a conceptual idea of what you want to happen in your mind, and then using willpower to project this onto the real world. Everyone's mind works differenlty, so which concepts are clearer varies from person to person due to personal and enviromental factors. Maybe one person has great hand-to-eye coordination so they can easily conceptualise reaching out with their magic and holding something, so they can do incredibly precise levitating charms, maybe even enough to pick up some chalk and draw freehand with it. Someone else just really gets the feeling of sleeping, they understand it so well that spells that knock others unconcious, such as the stunning spell or the charm Fleur used on her dragon are far more effective. It doesn't have to be completely unique for everyone or gamechanging, but just little variations between people like with everything.

** If knowledge is the barrier, it might be the sheer "mental gymnastics" you have to go through for a successful casting.

A basic shield charm is easier to cast than its more "advanced" forms because you're not adding some additional thought-pattern or forcing yourself to /feel/ a certain way. Especially in the heat of battle, the more you have to "distract" yourself from the battle the harder it's going to be.

Consider the Patronus. The first few times Harry fails to cast it, it's because the /memory/ he chose to keep in his mind wasn't good enough - it couldn't stand up to the Faux-Dementor sucking it out of him.

Other spells might be like that too, requiring you to reserve a part of your mind for a certain thought that might conflict with the current situation. Feeling happy in the face of a Dementor or other threat, trying not to have your concentration on the thought of your shield spell interrupted by the danger you're in...

** In the absence of a magical core, I like to think that a good alternative is that magic is like a muscle.

A person could walk basically indefinitely and not really get fatigued (the issue in this case is your feet hurt after a while, but I'm ignoring this for the purposes of this analogy), however they certainly cannot run indefinitely, at least not without some serious training.

Low level, simple, or well practiced spells are not taxing to perform because doing them doesn't really 'exercise' their magic a great deal. More demanding spells, or spells that someone has little practice in require more effort. A magical then wouldn't automatically default to the most powerful versions of any particular spell as they likely don't need to expend that amount of effort for the effect they want.

This option gets around the issue of a magical core, as in theory, with practice anyone can perform any arbitrarily difficult or powerful spell, and be able to perform more of those spells in a short space of time. It's just that the vast majority of magicals seldom have a need to actually do that, and so they never achieve the sorts of results that Voldemort and Dumbledore (at the least) achieve.

*** From my understanding, the only difference between having a magical core and your version is the absence of varying potentials.

**** Which is a good thing. Inserting varying inherent power levels makes for a worse story.

**** I actually prefer the concept of magical cores as it provides limits that don't exist otherwise. My thinking of magic as a muscle is something I use if I want to fit some sort of limitation, even if it is just the amount of effort someone is willing to expend, onto canon; which otherwise doesn't seem to have any other limits.

It also makes a degree of sense in that respect. The majority of magicals are almost certainly never really going to use 'big magic'. The most taxing magic they might end up doing is using the repairing spell or maybe conjuration. If that's all the magic they ever do, then it's not going to be surprising if they have difficulty actually trying to do more difficult magics, even if they remember how to perform those magics.

Without even my limit, you'd expect to see the average magical busting out heavy magics in an instant. Which if that were the case, then it'd be unlikely that any dark lord would ever have any success, because any rando on the street could put them down.

** Part of that is understanding. If you don't have magical cores and different strength of different wizards (which I am not persuaded is the best idea), then the only thing which differentiates Goyle and Voldemort is the understanding and education. It seems that there is a different level of required knowledge between /Lumous/ and for example /Obliviate/, where for the latter you need rather detailed understanding how brain works, how the memory accumulation works, etc., otherwise you would put everybody into vegetative state or perhaps you wouldn't achieve anything (because your magic wouldn't hit appropriate parts of the brain).

** Conceptualization in my headcanon.

Spells can be either generic and weak or specific and powerful. However, in order to be specific, you need to properly understand and visualize what you want the spell to do.

For example, /Protego/ is a generic protection spell that doesn't require you to understand how it will protect you. However, a powerful spell like /Sectusempra/ with a specific intent will break through /Protego/ because a generic desire "protect me" is less specific than "cut them into shreds". However if you were to just through /Sectusempra/ at your enemy without visualising what exactly you want it to do, the spell would be weaker and not break the shield.

At the end of the day, the more powerful wizards are the ones who are more creative, specific and imaginative.

** One thing, I guess, is throughput. Even if there are no limits to how powerful the magic a wizard can access, there might be limits to how much they can access in any given instant, limits which may change based on inborn ability, practice, state of mind, etc. If a wizard's throughput is inferior, spells that need more power might fail partially or completely.

Practicing an individual spell ought to make it easier as well, as the wizard's magic gets used to being called up in this particular manner, as with muscle memory.

A related point that could increase difficulty for some spells is /how,/ specifically, magic is called to produce a particular effect (like the Shield Charm). I suspect a large part of magical education (especially in Charms, Transfiguration and DADA) is teaching students these magical "movements," assisted at least at first by actual movements with the wand arm and wand, as well as spoken incantations - whereas veteran geniuses like Dumbledore may perform complex or powerful magic silently, with generic wand swishes or even no movement at all beyond aiming, and potentially without even a wand (like his movie Arresto Momentum in PoA, which is with wand and silent in the book).

** Perhaps spells that to go against nature and physics are harder because they have to convince the world or subdue it or something?
