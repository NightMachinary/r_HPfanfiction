Generally how many people here find that they only read long fanfictions, over 100k words, apart from a few anomalies? . I find myself almost exclusively reading long book length fics and never touching anything under 60k words. I think the shortest fic I've ever enjoyed was 60k words called like 'The Greatest Gift'. Which is a harry raises a baby fic. Anyway Let me know, would be super interested to hear from others.

Also if anyone is noticing im asking alkt of these kinds of questions, I'm thinking of writing something about Hp fanfic and fanfic in general soon n want more opinions than just my own.

** Almost, exactly the contrary. I almost never touch anything over 200k, because most of the time it is just suffering with poorly written repetitive fluff.

*** I usually skim over long fics quickly looking for certain phrases that signify it'll be the same damn plot.

Stuff like "Goblins", "Inheritance", "Hadrian", "Trunk", "Ice Queen", "Dumbledork" etc.

*** Same. The ones i hate the most are the single chapter fics but they leave to much of a cliffhanger to be a open ended oneshot.

Length be dammed if the story good and finished.

**** I feel like incomplete-feeling oneshots are a lesser evil then a proper length fic that's tagged as "completed" but was actually abandoned just as stuff started getting good.

Seriously, you'd think authors would burn out /after/ the interesting parts, on filler stuff. I've seen way too many fics abandoned right at the point the whole fic was building up to.

** People will tell you "size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts" but we all know size does matter... and that goes both ways. Some people like it short and in small doses and that's alright while some others, like me, who prefer it bigger so that you can enjoy it longer. But, that doesn't mean we like it dry with nothing going on.

** One of the main reasons fanfic exists is because we couldn't get enough of canon. So if a fic is entertaining, the characters and world continue to grow, and the plot still has momentum, I say the longer the better.

But those are big ifs, and some fics definitely drag on too long. I am personally putting this to the test with my own fic, which is almost as long as canon (books 1-7) and not nearly finished.

That kind of pacing would be completely unacceptable in a conventional novel (my story can't even be divided into smaller fics), but fanfic is a unique medium, and I'm having fun with the lack of constraints.

In answer to OP, I prefer long fics and seldom read anything shorter than 60K words.

** All in all I don't really think it matters how long a fanfic is but if the pacing and storytelling is right. I enjoy oneshots from time to time. I usually read fanfics between 50k-150k words. But I hardly ever read fanfics over 200k. Most of the time, if an author isn't able to tell his story with less than 200k words, the story has a to slow pacing or stretches plotlines unnecessary. There are some very well written exceptions and in those occasions I also read storys with over a million words. But in my opinion most of the time really long fanfics are the result of the inabilty to cut/shorten when it would have been necessary for story telling reasons.

*** Yeah I'm with you. I generally hard avoid anything over 100k unless it's an author I really trust. The long long loooooong ones tend to be a lot of filler.

Shorter fics can satisfy me as long as they're written with good techinques. I don't like short and sloppy fics.

** I think that that very long fics require a degree of focus that a lot of new writers simply don't have. They don't track what they've already done very well leading to really poor pacing.

I do like long fics but no longer start anything over 200k that's unfinished. I'm patient, I can wait to make sure it gets finished.

** In my eyes, there are three sorts of perfect fic length (well, four if you include oneshots) - around 60k for a single-year fic, between 200-300k for a heavy AU fic or 800k+ words for a /full AU/ series, such as the Denarian series.

However, I find that the majority of long-ass fics are simply horribly bloated for no real reason - they're good fics in general, with an interesting plot and decent writing, but it feels like you could cut out a good third of the fic without losing anything of value - for example, Prince of Slytherin, or a more extreme example in Harry Crow whose actual, story-related content could fit in roughly 10% of its total length. Not to say that long-ass fics can't be good either - for example, Benefits of old laws, while not a conventional-type fic (a slice of life about Voldemort reintegrating into society, mostly politics and family interactions, with minor drama thrown in), doesn't feel bloated at all.

All in all, it's less about the length and more about the sort of content you write - it's better to write 60k words of original ideas then do a 400k word length canon rehash using the same combination of cliches that thousands of other fics have.
