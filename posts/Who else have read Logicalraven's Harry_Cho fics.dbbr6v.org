There's an author called Logicalraven who posted this 3 books on the Harry/Cho ship on ffnet back when OoTP wasn't released. Those three books are my favorite fanfictions and I read them every year, more than I read the original books.

Who else have read her stories and what did you think about them? especially the ending.

  Warning OotP Spoilers. Harry starts his sixth year at Hogwarts, but he's in for some surprises. He's going to learn the true story of his parents and learn to deal with loss. There might be a little romance and adventure. Related to my JL fic. Complete!

** Is this the series where Cho goes to Auror training? I remember it being a bit heavy on the depression and dumping bad stuff on Harry.

***** I love how characters like Seamus, Dean or Lavender were brought to life and given personnalities, which lacked in the books. And I love how she never fell into some cliche and gave us exactly what we wanted. She made us want more and more but that ending was just cruel. There's even a fanfiction based on those stories.
