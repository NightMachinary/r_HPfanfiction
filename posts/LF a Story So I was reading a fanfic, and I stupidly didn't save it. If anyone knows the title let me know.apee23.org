I remember the majority of the first chapter though. I for some reason didn't save it, but I remember that everyone had gone up to Gryffindor common room after the sorting; suddenly Gryffindor Common Room was all of a sudden being attacked.

The entrance was being blocked so that the Professors couldn't come in, and the students couldn't go out. I believe that either a fire or just smoke was everywhere. I believe that a bookshelf was going to come down on a first year but was saved (by Harry; I think). Harry ends up using a spell to protect the students, and the other students follow suit.

They end up escaping through using their brooms, Dobby shows up and Harry asks Dobby if there's a way for the first years/smaller students to get out, and Dobby and the House-Elves get the younger years out through a hole.

I remember that Colin had, had a bad fall on his broom; and Harry being Harry, rushed down trying to save him. He ended up passing out and the next thing he knew he was in the infirmary.

When Harry came through, he and the other students explained what happened. They ended up making a plaque for the House Elves for helping them. They weren't able to go to the Gryffindor Common Room since it was so badly damaged, so they were forced to go elsewhere.

That's the last I remember it. I can't even remember if it was completed or on going, new or old. I do remember that a first year that Harry had saved during the fiasco stuck to him like glue, though as well.

Other than that I don't remember it. I know that it's rather vague, but I was reading it, didn't save it and can't for the life of me remember its name at all; and it's irking the heck out of me.

Found it! Thanks to [[/u/heresy23]]

It's Sympathetic Magic; if anyone wanted to know.

It's actually not vague at all, lol.

I counted 18 minor plot points you mentioned, and like 8 of them are probably rather unique. You mentioned also multiple characters.

That's basically one of the most detailed descriptions I've seen on this sub - and unsurprisingly you found the story.

*** Ah I wasn't sure, I had remembered reading the chapter, and wanted it to be as descriptive as possible, but wasn't sure if it wasn't good enough or not.

And yeah; super happy that I had gotten the story.
