I'm looking for fics that are similar to linkffn(the brightest sun by witless maester) in that someone from another universe crosses over to Harry's universe and Harry helps them out and they fall in love.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing. Harry Potter had died in his war. Two strangers are thrown together through some force. Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros. Cross-posted on AO3.

** There's linkffn(12343855)

Harry is quite ambitious though somehow he hasn't figured out what romantic attraction feels like even after living for over a century

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.
