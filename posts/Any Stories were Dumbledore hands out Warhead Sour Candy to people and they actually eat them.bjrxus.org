Or mabye Toxic Waste Sour Candy.

I am more looking for stories were we see people reaction to the Sour candy.

Is it just a fanfiction trope that everyone rejects Dumbledores offer of sweets? because in Canon I think we only see Professor McGonagall reject the offer(I think that is also the only time we see Dumbledore offer anyone some of his sweet either)


** Warheads didn't enter the English speaking market until '93 having originated in Taiwan in the mid 70's.

When you factor in the delay in culture transfer from mundane to magical, it's likely Dumbledore never had the pleasure, which saddens me.

I still think it would make for a delightful one-shot.

Alternatively, Dumbledore is an international politician, (ICW) so maybe he's been to Taiwan and has been buying the snacks in bulk and bringing them back to England.

** There was one story that had this idea. Dumbledore hard the sour candy in his office and suggested each Professor take one and watched their reactions. It was pretty funny but I can't for the life of me remember.
