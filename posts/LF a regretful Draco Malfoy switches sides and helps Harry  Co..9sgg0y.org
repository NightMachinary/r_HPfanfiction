Surely there has to be *one* decent story like this. I don't really care about the pairings, but I'd prefer no slash.

One more condition: The bad guys are still the bad guys, and not just misunderstood. Draco is supposed to change sides, not a brainwashed Harry.


** Not quite regretful but the Code series starts out with a Draco that is reconsidering what he's learned. linkffn(2750775) Full disclosure, the author has gone on apparent hiatus on the 4th story but I have to recommend it anyways because it's my favorite series of all time. Also, the author stopped writing during the 3rd story and came back after 6 years and finished it and started the 4th, so I'm hopeful it'll happen again.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Oh yeah, that's a good fic. Sadly with kathryin's updating pace it will be finished 2030.

I actually don't remember a lot from it... I don't recall Draco doing all that much.

** It's AU from DH because of the way Draco switches sides, but well I find it easy to suspend belief because it is magical. Essentially Draco's story of redemption runs parallel to the events in DH. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4537729/1/Be-Careful]])
