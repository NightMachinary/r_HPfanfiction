** Without the 4 most powerful weapons in fictions, the Deux Ex Machina, the Author Fiat, the Plot Armor, and the "Lucky Hero" trope, Harry could have never won.

Beginning with Ron suddenly stop saying "Voldemort", which he had done so previously, these 4 powerful literary weapons guarantee that the bad guys could never win. On top of that, the bad guys still had to be dumbed down to room temperature IQ for them to have a chance, and the good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. Ugh!

Rants aside, there are several good fics that explored this scenario:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), features a more reasonable Voldemort who had his political opponents, mainly the Weasleys, immediately liquidated after taking over the Ministry. The Trio triggered the Taboo a few days later, Ron was killed, and Hermione brutally tortured for days. Things basically ended in a total cluster fuck.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), has both Ron and Hermione abandoning Harry in the tent. They were soon brutally murdered. Harry carried on an one-man campaign for several years until he freed Daphne Greengrass. One of the better H/D fics IMHO as it does not have that Ice Queen nonsense.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]] and its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All The Clocks]], linkffn(6884267;6989327), Voldemort fully interrogated Harry when he turned himself in and everything was totally fucked in that world. Later its Hermione made a dimensional jump and asked the canon guys for help.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Hmmm... I can't think of any that have the world going to hell specifically because of Dumbledore's meddling.

But /Resistence/ by lorien829 does start out with the world going to hell. You might like it.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.
