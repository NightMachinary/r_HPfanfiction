I saw someone mention that quite a few of these exist out there and I don't think I've ever read one, so I'm looking for literally any fic where Ron goes undercover with the Death Eaters. Thanks!


** linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) has Ron be a spy for Dumbledore in a wizarding Britain ruled by Lucius Malfoy.
