For myself, it's this need that people have to have all the fanfiction read as British, just because the original books are. Fiction with "Americanisms" aren't bad. It just feels close-minded to refuse to read past the first page of a story because someone replaced "biscuit" with "cookie".


** Americanisms annoy me (as a Brit) but I can ignore them if they're obviously things that people just don't think about. Like, I can look past someone saying "sidewalk" because I don't expect the average American to know we call it "pavement", but a character saying "Mom" is very grating.

Personally I don't know why people get their knickers in such a twist about the exact numbers/population of wizarding Britain. I let the numbers fluctuate to match my story and I think that's ok.

***** Having grown up in both America and the U.K. and having retained accents from those periods of my life (I was very concerned about fitting in to the point of ridiculousness and now people get confused about where I'm from because of the way I pronounce certain words), and having travelled across the countries for the sake of bonding and experience, accents differ. In fact I find it quite incredible how diverse it is in the British Isles.

Nevertheless, when I read a British character say "Mom" I'm immediately taken back to that period of living in America when I'd hear my friends shout at their mother's in an embarrassed tone.

And if every character in the fanfiction in Britain uses "Mom" then are they all Brummies?

And even if it's written as "Mum" and it's a Birmingham native, I will hear it in their accent.

But I only reserve this nitpick for "Mom". I couldn't care less if you use "lemon drop" over "sherbet lemon" or "sidewalk" over "pavement."

I couldn't care less if you used double quotation marks for speech (apparently an Americanism) over the single quotation marks.

But I agree. If you're dedicating one word to a certain style of accent of the British Isles (which I don't believe is the case for most fanfiction writers), then you should try to do the same with all the words in that character's dialogue.

When something happens in a story for no apparent reason or just because the author can, it's shitty. Don't waste a cool idea because you're lazy.

Whether it was advertisement, plot, writing, or something else, there is a reason that fifty shades of grey was popular. Back to cores, we can pretty much extrapolate why the 'trope' is common and popular. As there is minimal advertisement, and no money in fanfiction, we know it's popularity must come from either good writing or an idea that resonates with many fans. I've read my fair share of "core" fics and I can assure you, it isn't the writing. The idea is popular with many readers and writers.

We can't say whether a popular fic is well or badly written based solely on its popularity. Its popularity has no bearing on that. Basically, when you make this argument, you sound like a creationist saying 'see how many people believe in my god? He must exist!'

For example, following this argumentum ad populum argument you're backing, all gods exist simultaneously, because all of them were popular at some point, and that many people can't /possibly/ be wrong... and the best book ever written is the one that happens to be top bestseller at present time.

**** Thank you. This is my thought almost every time I see a reason flame on a fic. It seems like a lot of people put down a story for an arbitrary reason and then won't then further clarify. I had somebody argue the other day that because an author didn't use contractions correctly the story was unreadable. I can understand why that might be annoying, but it doesn't mean the plot idea isn't worth at least giving it a chance.

I think bashing is the best example though. Many people view it as cliche, but it wouldn't be if people didn't want to read it in the first place. I see fanfiction as a form of wish fulfillment. Most people just think of it as a what is 'x' happens, but the drive to read 'x' is very much a wish fulfillment. Back to my point of some right bashing can serve as a way to push the plot forward. It can and has been used to explain why a character might be leery of another character. It could explain and has explained why a sudden shift in characterization happens. How things are handled before this point and after this point can make or break any story that uses this. I would argue that any sort of plot device of this manner can also be used as an example. I know I'm rambling a bit I've been doing that lately. I do agree with you though.

#+end_quote

The problem with bashing, so to speak, is that it does not actually explain these things by itself. For instance, the original Harry Potter books... would you label them 'Draco bashing' because Draco Malfoy is often used as the butt of jokes and is often portrayed as an ass? I would say 'no', because it was a consistent part of his character, had a reasonable explanation (upbringing), and he was still recognisably human in his motivations despite his conflict with Harry. In my experience, explicitly labelled 'bashing' stories have drastic shifts in characterisation that are either completely unjustified, or taken to cartoonish levels, and it just spoils the entire story. Yes, by all means, write a misguided Dumbledore who takes things a bit too far in trying to give Harry a childhood. On the other hand, writing him as a cartoonish, stupid villain with an enormous chip on his shoulder about the Greater Good misses the entire point of his character, and instantly ruins my immersion in the story. Especially if you leave him in exactly the same position he was in in canon, assuming everyone else was either too cartoonishly stupid/evil to notice how cartoonishly stupid/evil Dumbledore was. Basically, you have an idiot plot, that cannot survive without a significant portion of the characters being legally braindead, and I would generalise this to the majority of my experience with 'bashing' fics. To me, 'bashing' label has come to mean that characters will be completely OOC for no justifiable reason, because the author says so, and usually to a cartoonish and immersion-breaking degree.

If a character just does not like the main character, that's also not a reason for the narrative itself to bash them in an unrealistic way. By all means, have Harry and Ron dislike each other, if that's your bag. But... imply the reasons for it via interactions with Ron, like HP did with Draco (or better), and treat the character like a human, rather than a subhuman object who is the sum-total of the universe's ridicule. Draco was disliked in canon because he was a git, but there was a push and pull to his rivalry with Harry. Sometimes, he'd win. He wasn't treated like a fucking leper by the fabric of causality.

Basically, what we call 'bashing', I would define as a poorly executed and tactless shift in characterisation. Often, it is either poorly justified, or inconsistent with the setting, and reduces the character to something subhuman. This breaks my suspension of disbelief, and I stopped finding it funny back when I was fifteen. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in that.

In short, no, bashing is still awful in most applications. Unless you're writing very juvenile comedy, I guess.

****** I my guess I would argue that our definitions are slightly different, but without going into a large diatribe about it I believe our differences would be approach. I think bashing can be seen in all written fics where the author is hypercritical of a character. I would argue that without taking things to a as you say cartoonish level you can bash a character. I read a really good story a while back weird Dumbledore had dementia. This is caused most of the problems we see in the books. It wasn't that he didn't care but he wasn't all there mentally. This doesn't come out until later in the story but it does give reasons for Harry to be hypercritical of Dumbledore and fundamentally change their relationship. From Harry's point of view all he sees is a controlling Dumbledore. The reason it went unnoticed was because Dumbledore even before dementia was a little bit screwy. As an aside I would also say a so-called bashing story should even be critical of Rowling.

For me actually, this is a huge deal breaker. I think it's mostly because contractions are such a huge part of how actual people speak. It's also a big red flag as to the writing abilities of the author - if they can't make dialogue sound even remotely normal, I don't really trust that the other parts of their writing will make up for it.

As far as bashing goes, I'd argue that it is usually a great example of being too nitpicky. The bashing part inevitably seems to become just a long list-like diatribe of the nitpicks the author has with the plotholes and characters they didn't like in canon.

They bother me because I don't understand why. I mean, the books are about a little boy who finds out he's a wizard in contemporary UK. Hadrian was an ancient Roman Emperor and while he did do shit in what is UK today, I fail to see how that relates to HP. And no one explains that. And if you want an epic ancient Roman Emperor name then why Hadrian, the ancient Donald Trump, basically, and not Julius Caesar himself? Then Fleur can change her name to Cleopatra for maximum badassery. Just let loose and go full retarded if you started.

Heck, if you want to give Harry another name (the books are called Harry Potter and..., but let's ignore that because we want to butcher common sense here) just call him Darth Vader.

******** It may not be a desire to give him a 'better' name.

I once knew a girl, who had the name of Kitty. That was her real, full name, as written on her birth certificate. She mentioned that people were always assuming she had to be name Katherine, since Kitty was the shortened form of that name.

Harry is a shortened name. So, many would assume that it wasn't his 'real' name. Or it would at least make sense if it turned out not to be. And considering that most of the Weasleys go by shortened names too(William to Bill, Charles to Charlie, Percival to Percy, Ronald to Ron, Ginevra to Ginny), then it's not like there's no precedent for it either.

********** Yes, I know his real name is Harry. That's not my point.

My point is, that the possibility that he has a fuller real name does not trip my SoD. It's something makes sense to me, it's something that I find plausible.

It would be a different beast altogether if an author tried to change his name to something like Stephen or Robert. Harry doesn't derive from either of these names, so it would no longer be plausible.

Your arguments lead me to believe that you approach fanfic in a manner that need a reason to make changes. I'm different, I need a reason to not make a change. This topic may be on we might have to agree to disagree on.

***** One of my friends, in real life, has the name Harry and he's called 'Harrison' when people are angry or annoyed with him. It's like people who use your entire name when they're annoyed with you. It's the same with John and Jonathan.

The only thing that annoys me is when people change it for no reason at all. Such as when he turns sixteen and he finds out that his real name is Hadrian or Harrison. I've done it, I've called him 'Harrison', but his real name is, and always will be, Harry.

I have a feeling I'm in an minority, though.

** Hogwarts having tuition fees.

I was reading that crack fic Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion (I was merely curious after reading a thread on here about Ron bashing and if it's ever possibly funny and that came up as a suggestion) and Lucius loses the family fortune so Draco only has so much to get by before he has to leave school because he can't afford tuition.

I know. There are so many things to nitpick in that fanfic for the sake of canon and some attempt at accuracy and writing in general - so many things.

But it's more often a thing that comes up in fanfiction when I know Hogwarts tuition is free. I think there might even be a fund for less fortunate students for their school books and equipment (although I could be mixing canon and fanon which is annoying).

My problem with it is that Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, the British Isles (okay, not that one, since it is PURELY geographical), Wales, Britain, England, I'm probably forgetting one that I never actually knew existed, all overlap in strange ways.

I like how simple the structure is for the US. One nation, broken up into 50 states plus Washington DC (because the Founding Fathers didn't want the capital of the nation to belong to any one state) and some territories. The states are broken down into counties, which contain cities, villages, towns and/or townships, depending on population. Fairly straightforward.

I don't expect people to know my colloquialisms. I'm from the southern US, and I wonder how many people know that the term for a grocery cart is buggy, or that all sodas are called coke. How would someone even know to search for that to see if there's another word?
