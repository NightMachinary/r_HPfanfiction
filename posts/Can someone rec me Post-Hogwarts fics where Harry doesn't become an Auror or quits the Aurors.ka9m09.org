They can be one-shots or multi-chaptered, though I'd prefer them to be complete. If they're not complete, I'd prefer them to be actively updating (at least one update a month) and if they're on hiatus/abandoned, I'd prefer them to have at least 20k words.

I'm all up for cliche fics, fics where Harry goes into politics, where Harry becomes a Lord (either of family legacy or becomes a Dark/Grey Lord), Harry studies different fields of magic, becomes an Auror, whatever. The fics can also contain dimension-travel.

I'd prefer for the fic not to be Harry/Hermione, though Harry/Hermione/Ron is fine. No pairings are fine, canon pairings are fine, and other pairings are also fine. I'd prefer to have no Harry/Daphne pairings but if it's one of your favourite fics and you'll think I'll like it, then that's fine. The only pairings that I absolutely *don't* want are *harems* or *multi-shipping*.

Canon divergence that takes place a before or during the war is fine. I don't want the fics to be or contain Severitus, though. Oh, and absolutely *no crossovers*. The only crossover I'll consider reading is Twilight because I've had enough Avengers crossovers for the week.

​

Fics of this category I like (and also some that I thought I would recommend but I am not really looking for) are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]

#+begin_quote
  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
#+end_quote

One of the absolute best fics I think I've ever read, to be honest. I love the way that Harry only becomes a Dark Lord because he feels that Teddy's in danger and I love the fact that this doesn't really contain romance and has a hint towards Harry/Ron/Hermione in it. The fact that Harry controlsFiendfyre and is known as the Fiendfyre Lord is also quite brilliant.

#+begin_quote
  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.
#+end_quote

I don't typically like reading Haphne fics but I absolutely love this. I love that Harry's celebrating old wizarding holidays (The Sabbats) with others and is doing all of these amazing things with his money. Him participating in the Wizengamot is also a /big/ thing that I found somewhat hysterical.

​

#+begin_quote
  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.

  *

  /“Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully./

  /Harry never would have imagined meeting like this./

  /The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.”/
#+end_quote

Not one of my favourite fics, per say, because I think that Harry should be more powerful in this, but I like the budding hateship between Harry and Sirius that's going on.

I'm not really looking for fics like this but I thought I'd recommend it.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22327684/chapters/53334382][(draw me after you (let us run)]]

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  

  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. 

  “It seems I have finally caught you.” 
#+end_quote

It doesn't technically start Post-Hogwarts but it's a favourite of mine. Wherein Harry escapes Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries, Sirius lives, Harry finds out about the Horcruxes and the prophecy, and he decides to play catch-me-if-you-can with a murderous Dark Lord after somehow managing to outwit him, and decides to put Humpty together again. Eventually, they come to an understanding.

​

#+begin_quote
  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
#+end_quote

Again, another fic that doesn't start post-Hogwarts but I though I'd add it because it's one of my favourite fics of all time, it's kinda cliche without being /too/ cliche (I think), it's Tomarry/Harrymort, and deals a lot with the darker families, has the "Golden" Trio and other attending balls hosted by Dark families, and it's most recent chapters contains a reveal at the Wizengamot that I love. It contains heavy Dumbledore bashing, though.

Not what I'm looking for, either, though I love the way they handle the Lordships and the Wizengamot and the balls in this.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22119904/chapters/52796104][The Trio]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry hadn't expected Bella Swan when he moved into the house Sirius left for Harry in his Will. He hadn't expected Edward Cullen either. And it was safe to say that Bella didn't expect Harry and Edward, and that Edward didn't expect Bella and Harry. Who knew that a wizard, a muggle, and a vampire could forge such a great relationship?
#+end_quote

It's a Twilight crossover as I'm a little fond of those. I'll admit that I wasn't really keen on reading a fic containing a threesome between Harry, Bella, and Edward, but /I love it/. The way that the characters are written is absolutely lovely and Bella's not actually super boring! Also, Bella gets let in one the secret (/both/ secrets) early on and so there wasn't much of that "What the hell is going on?" going on unless you consider the fact that Harry and Bella didn't tell Edward what was going on. It's incomplete (sadly) but I'm looking forward to an update.

​

#+begin_quote
  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.
#+end_quote

Literally, the best, world-building and personification of Harry that I've seen to date. Basically, Harry travels back in time after travelling the world, so technically it's Post-Hogwarts. It features wizarding culture, Paganism, rituals, liberal use of wandless magic and runes, Parseltongue, and prankster Harry. I recommend reading every part of the series, even the extras, because the author's worldbuilding and characterizations are the best things in the world.

I'm not really looking for fics where Harry travels back in time but I thought I'd recommend it since I love the world-building.

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
#+end_quote

I can't tell you how many times I've cried myself laughing like a hyena-fox hybrid. Not necessarily time travel, but Tom and Harry eventually get reborn into their original life and they fuck around with people, mainly Dumbledore.

It's, once again, not Post-Hogwarts but I thought I'd recommend it since it's a favourite of mine. I'm not really looking for fics like this, though the soulmate bit is cool.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1127441][Step Back in Time series]]

#+begin_quote
  When a bitter, dark, and battle worn Harry Potter steps through a rip in time. He didn't think he would find himself with a baby in his arms on his Aunt's front doorstep on the night his parents were killed but that was just the beginning.
#+end_quote

It's a series where an old, wizened, Master of Death Harry Potter steps through a time rip to right after the events on Halloween 1981. He basically raises himself and later gets into a relationship with snarky Potions Master Severus Snape. Harry's pretty badass in this and it rehashes some of the books, but quite vaguely since it's featured around the older Harry and not his son "Ry."

Not what I'm looking for but I thought I'd rec this because I don't want someone to recommend it to me again and I kind of liked it.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8660149][Who'd Suspect a Hufflepuff?]]

#+begin_quote
  After losing the war Hermione and Harry are left as two of the last alive. In a desperate bid for their survival they travel back in time to kill Tom Riddle before he makes his first horcrux. Using cunning and intelligence learned from their time at war they work to save the world before it has even begun to fall. Lucky for them, everyone overlooks the Hufflepuffs.
#+end_quote

It's a 10k word one-shot. One of the best forties fics I've read that doesn't include Harry/Tom. It vaguely features Lordships, blood magic, and a cheerfully annoying Harry.

It's not really post-war but I thought I'd recommend it since I enjoyed it. Not really what I'm looking for either since it doesn't feature Harry out of Hogwarts and doing stuff.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1471330/chapters/3101062][Life After Death And Betrayal]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry is twenty two years old, moving to Forks to settle down and open a bakery. He's seen death and suffered betrayal at the hands of those he trusted. He also has a secret he hasn't told another living soul. He is the Master of death. Things change for Harry, giving him a reason to live other than his godson for the first time. Jasper/Harry SLASH.
#+end_quote

It's another Twilight crossover that I thought I'd recommend since I enjoyed it. It's Harry/Jasper as it says in the description and Harry attended culinary school post-war and has opened a bakery in Forks, Washington. Harry's also Master of Death in this and Ron and Hermione betrayed him right at the end of the war, so there are some bitter feelings.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/517558/chapters/913822][New Beginnings and Second Chances]]

#+begin_quote
  The Final Battle had ended, but the price payed was far too high. Seeing Harry lose the will to live Fawkes gave him a gift, an opportunity to have the life he always wanted. Now Harry just had to choose to accept it and find the strength to keep living.
#+end_quote

Features dimensional-travel where Harry goes to a dimension after everyone dies where his family is alive! It's abandoned so beware of that but I though I'd recommend it since I liked it and I especially like the Harry that's featured in it. It's quite a bit cliche but why not?

It's also another fic that doesn't technically meet what I'm looking for.

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896/chapters/5191223][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]]

#+begin_quote
  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.
#+end_quote

Quite possibly one of the best time travel fics that I've ever read. Harry gets sent back to the Founders' time due to the /Priori Incantantem/ in the graveyard. He is promptly found and healed by Salazar Slytherin, who invites him to Hogwarts as one of his snakes. Eventually, they manage their way back to only a few days or weeks after the graveyard incident.

I love this fic and I'm reccing it since it features Harry as a teacher and is technically post-Hogwarts (at him attending, at least).

​

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?
#+end_quote

The /only/ harem fic that I'll ever like and recommend. I mostly like this because it contains some politics, the Wizengamot, old obscure wizarding laws, and Harry opening a sort of halfway house for witches in trouble rather than criminals.

​

*Thank you for any recommendations and enjoy what I've listed here!*


** So- I don't know if this fits in with what you want, but here is one I liked:

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]]:

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

Harry becomes a dark lord after Hogwarts. (oneshot, 12k words)

Also ,This probably doesn't fit in, but here is a dimension travel fic set just after the war (8th year?) where harry and 5 others go to an alternate dimension where Harry isn't the BWL.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts]]:

#+begin_quote
  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.

** I have some recommendations, since it seems that u do like time travel fics (which is a trope i adore) and i have a couple of post war fics where Harry has a different career.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]]

In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

This is hands down one of my fav fics. It has wonderful wonderful world building and is very political. It does feature toxic relationships and other triggers so please be wary of that. But its so incredibly amazing. It made me cry, laugh and gave me chills and really changed the way i thought about things in real life. Its not yet complete but its still being updated.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771]]

After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.

Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP. Warnings in author's notes.

This is hands down on of the best time travel fics ive ever read and i doubt I'll read one as good in a very long time. It is very political and features a hardworking and smart but not overly smart and over powered Harry. The characterization is amazingggg. I highly highly recommend.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15795267]]

This is rlly nice, i recently found this fic. It features politics within Gryffindor. It characterises all the gryffs within Harry's grade wonderfully. It's not exactly what ur looking for but it delves into politics within the house which i thought you would like.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16035464]]

Harry was at a loss, but it wasn't as though he could let it show. That wasn't what a Saviour did, after all. But loss entailed the need for direction. When a helping hand was pointed the way, he clutched it like a drowning man. That way wasn't the path he'd expected to be set upon, but what more could he do?

Two years later and Draco Malfoy is relieved of his sentence. But doing his time is only half the battle. When thrown his own rope, an offer dangled from an unexpected direction, Draco takes it as the only option rationally viable. He hadn't anticipated who he'd meet on the other end of that rope, however, and that changed things. Especially when change entailed Harry Potter.

They always did have a way of bumping into one another. Fate, as it happens, seemed unerringly persistent in that regard.

This is a rllyyyy good post war fic that explores Harry working in modeling and Draco as a photographer. Its so so sooo gooddddd. The writing is stunning. I highly highly recommend. It was such a strange and unexpected career choice but somehow it really really works.

-[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]]

Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

This is another time travel fic, it features Harry having a different career choice working with seers. Its a work in progress tho, but a substantial amount has been written. Amazing world building and writing.

Well I hope you enjoy these fics as much as i did🥰

** 1) Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]

2) no voyage by aheartcalledhome well written Harry/Ginny fic dealing with the aftermath of the war themes of ptsd. Not novel length but complete and worth reading in my opinion. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23968243/chapters/57648346]]

3) Harry Potter, Wizarding Barrister Harry finds himself doing an unusual thing after the war: defending the innocent before the Wizengamot. Here's what happens during his final case. This is a long one shot but In my opinion it's still worth reading it in terms of a good postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3548160/1/Harry-Potter-Wizarding-Barrister]]

4) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Harry the mod becomes Bella and then starts beating the everloving shit out of edward anytime he sees him refusing to go with the “script”

And does he want to when he finds out his parents are still alive there? Chapter 46. Unfinished but worth reading.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1542080/1/]]

6) Made of Common Clay Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

Harry breaks the system everyone gets fucked no shits were given
