Kind of an opaque description, I know. I just got done re-reading The Eagle's Nest by Heart of Aspen and I loved how the author explored the way Ravenclaw worked and practiced magic through the contemporary POV of Draco and Hermione and was wondering if y'all had recs for fics that do stuff like that? Maybe the Chamber of Secrets had a library inside? Maybe the trio stumbles onto Helga Hufflepuff's spellbook? Really just interested in how magic has changed in the centuries prior to canon


** Hmm. If you're actually interested in founders era, I'm currently writing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23957842][this fic]]. It's set entirely in the (late) founders era but one of the major things I focus on is how /different/ magic is then, and as the story continues slowly parts of the magical world will begin to become a little more recognisable.

If you're looking for modern era set fics that explore the founders from a historical perspective, I don't have as much to suggest.
