** "Professor Dumbledore, what does this mean? It says I only got an EE on my OWLs, but "Results boosted to O due to extra credit assignment" but what extra credit did I do?" Hermione asks, confused.

"Getting rid of Dolores. Though I'd only give you an A on that personally, Minerva was biased. I'm disappointed in you, as you didn't take the chance to finish her off. Quirrel, Lockhart and Crouch Junior are the reason Harry has the best grades in defense after all. If he gets rid of Severus this year, he'll get a guaranteed O on his NEWT" Dumbledore replies with a smile.
