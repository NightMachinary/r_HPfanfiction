I love unique takes on MoD!Harry, especially ones where it's more of a curse than an excuse for overpowered god status. Here are the fics I know of; feel free to add more. Any pairings are fine.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4198062/chapters/9483075][Marks of the Master]]: Gen. The Hallows cause Harry to unlock his status as an Avatar of Death, a higher entity.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/690222/chapters/1268184][Petrichor]]: Gen. Harry falls partway through the Veil, and something in him changes. Sadly, this fic hasn't gotten past the beginning stages, but what's there is very interesting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644/chapters/32183310][Resurrect the Living]]: Harry/Voldemort. Being Master of Death involves seeing aggressive, ghostly echoes everywhere. Harry travels back in time because he needs Voldemort's help to stop it.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/pseuds/The_Carnivorous_Muffin][The_Carnivorous_Muffin]]) uses the idea that only Death can collect the Hallows. Which means Harry, while not realizing it, has always been Death. This specific story takes place after the end of his own universe and makes being master of death more a curse of immortality than an embrace of power.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244][Spoonful of Sugar]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/widdlewed/pseuds/widdlewed][widdlewed]]) is an AU where Harry's status means interacting with Death as a person. Whether this is a kindness or a curse is more up to interpretation.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315][tell me whether he is dead]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell][LullabyKnell]]) just makes being MoD kind of spooky and inconvenient.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]]) - dead things, gen. It's simply brilliant. MoD is a curse here :^ )

linkao3(tell me whether he is dead), gen

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Time to put your galleons where your mouth is) - classics, gen. Although "time to..." doesn't really focus on Harry being MoD.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10218541]]) - As good as Death - actually, I don't remember what it was about, but I read it 2,5 years ago, marked as "liked" and put in my mod collection, so...

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]]) - Train to Nowhere (it's said to be tomarry) - It's very good and it's probably MoD or something related? I haven't progressed far into the story but I know that if Harry gets knocked out, he spawns on King's Cross and talks with dead Albus

linkffn(It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts), snarry, - it's an old fic and full of tropes but it was almost the first fic for me and I liked it very much :') Also there's an interesting plot. But really, beware of tropes. And Snape is OOC here... And Harry, I guess........... Very good recommendation from me, yeah

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244]]) - Spoonful of Sugar, gen - good one, I hope it gets updated

I'm not sure about recommending linkao3(survival is a talent), drarry, and linkffn(The Bitter Hug of Mortality) as Harry is a born necromant there but they both are very interesting. In the latter one Harry even interacts with Death one time.

Linkffn(On a Pale Horse) - another classics, abandoned

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155]]) - Full Circle, tomarry, very good and interesting and I don't remember MoD parts there but it's in my collection so I have to rely on old me

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21033122]]) - Life 15, summary reminds of Again and Again but is actually a good fic, WIP

linkffn(Again and Again), tomarry (but tomarry scenes are designed to be skippable, so try it) - classics, very interesting. I love how Harry just doesn't care anymore. Also, I liked parts where Harry publishes his non-fiction works in political magazines.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2528972/chapters/5621090]]) - Hell to Raise. Abandoned but interesting and good. Harry is an accidental necromant here and he accidentally reanimates dead things :^ )

--- not sure ---

Here we step into the "not sure" and "I heard about it" territory, so be prepared

linkao3(The Graveyard Is Empty Because The Ghosts Are In My Head) - abandoned, gen. The beginning (when Harry is back in time) is full of tropes (he's lord potter-black-insert-many-surnames-here, I almost dropped it there but I was curious and read further) but actually after Gringotts it's pretty good.

linkao3(Just for an Hour of Every Day), snarry, linkffn(Hallows and Pathos), gen, - I haven't read them.

linkffn(Be Careful What You Wish For) which is preface for linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783]]), rise of the wizards. Haven't read.

linkffn(Coming Back Late; Path of Decision). Knowledge of Sandman in the latter one is not required, they say. Haven't read.

linkao3(Inevitabilities) - Harry is a necromant here. Haven't read.

linkao3(Be the Death of Me) - interesting idea and well written. Death's subordinate fucked up and took Harry's soul when Death and Fate made a deal long ago about him surviving. Death feels guilty and decides to have his first vacation since the beginning of his existence and ventures into the mortal world to live as Harry Potter. Sounds very interesting, right? Why would it be in the "not sure" section? It's readable only up until the start of second year (if not earlier). The author got impatient and wanted lemons. The pairing is snarry. The result is disgusting. I understand that Death is millions years old and it's just his body that is 12 years old. And his body is very horny. It would be probably tolerable if only Death felt that way. But when Snape starts having wet dreams about mf 12 years old boy... WTF??? So. I advise you to read it until the end of the 1st year, then drop it and say "ah, it's so sad that it's unfinished". This part is really interesting. And I liked the interactions between deities.

linkao3(The Arts of Potions and Spells) - haven't read.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) - haven't read and never will. I'm sensitive about Snape and I like him portrayed as a good or neutral guy. Here he is clearly not tolerated so I dropped it pretty early.

linkffn(Of Shadow, Shine And Shades), snarry - I almost haven't read it.

linkao3(The Dead Master) - abandoned, I read it, marked as liked but I don't remember it. There was something about Harry being partially dead?.. Like he had no pulse, for example?..

linkao3(The Call of Death) - it's good but it has only a few chapters and was updated in September... Maybe if we bombard it with comments, the author will want to continue?

And a bonus oneshot - linkao3(2Spooky)

--- crossovers ---

Here are some abandoned crossovers with Naruto: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10052824]]; Ninja Who Lived; Multicolour Post Its) linkao3(Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black)

Here is a finished crossover with Dragon Age, it also has a finished sequel: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10001746]])

I'm no fan of Marvel but there are a lot of crossovers with it. Probably better wait for other users or use filters on ao3 to find them.

If you're interested, here is my [[https://fanfics.me/collection37841][collection]]. It's on a russian site but if I post a comment for a work, it's mainly in English. It has fics from ffn and ao3. For all those who are concerned about publishing others' works: they are not published. It's just a name of a fic, name of its author, its summary and a source link. Nothing more is stored.

  Whether the civilians need a last-minute cake baked in time for a birthday or a limb fixed because the hospital is too busy or even a bar fight broken up because nobody else is willing to interrupt two drunk shinobi, they all know to go to the green-eyed foreigner. So it stands to reason that, sooner or later, ninjas would come knocking as well. Insanity ensues -- they're messing with a Marauder after all. But mostly, Hiei just wishes they would all leave him alone.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
