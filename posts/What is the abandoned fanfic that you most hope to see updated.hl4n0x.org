For me it's Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama. I have read it multiple times and I am still blown away by it's detail and story telling. It's been 6 years since the last update, so I know we'll probably never know the end of the story, but seeing an update would be AMAZING.

What story/stories do you want to more of?

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past /would/ be my choice, except that it probably doesn't qualify, because the author continues to publish reassurances that it's merely delayed, not abandoned. And he has still managed to write a chapter about every three years, so I'm trusting him on that. It's a good example of how to write a Peggy Sue fic, with foreknowledge balanced by the butterfly effect, and a focus on friendship-building that means Harry being overpowered doesn't detract from the story.

Forging the Sword is a good candidate, though. It's a bit grim, but really well done, with the Trio getting serious about learning but still having to really earn whatever they achieve.

** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025317][Desperate Times, Desperate Measures]] by daye, although the author seems pretty adamant it will stay abandoned. Even though it's smut-ish, the non-smut parts are the best Harry/Tonks I've seen.

I'm Still Here linkffn(9704180). Harry sent to alternate reality by VD after they've torn up the world fighting. Haven't read it in a while but I remember finding it really engaging.

Magical Relations linkffn(3446796) Dudley goes to Hogwarts too. Starts in 1st year (which I usually hate) and is up to 5th. Last update 2016. Honestly one of the most original fics I've read.

0800-Rent-A-Hero linkffn(11160991).

** God of the Lost by Gravidy. Dramione epic scale, heading toward novel-length story. I came across it 10 or 15 years ago on FanFiction.net and looked for it again a while ago and it was gone. I'll never forget this story. It was so beautiful and intriguing... it turns into a kind of Heart of Darkness/journey through the jungle type thing. Would love to see this re-posted and completed. It's the story that initially sparked my interest in fan fiction.
