I'm looking for fics like The Traveller that integrate Fairy Tale influences and elements. Can be fairy tales from anywhere, not just European. Folk tales and minor non-theist mythology (ie. No Deities/Gods) are also covered under this request.

The Traveller - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612/]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

*** Ah, you've recommended this to me before in the 'fics with different magic systems' thread. I just finished it yesterday and really enjoyed it - though I was amused at how much of the Gentleman Bastard series I could see in it, Joe had definitely just got done reading that when he wrote that one. :D

So yes, thanks for the rec (again)! :D

***** Heh. Most of Joe's fics are. He's great at writing epic and mysterious feeling things. If you like this fic, I'd recommend you actually go and read The Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch. It's more thievery than drug-dealing, but it's got a very similar real-ness and mystique-worldbuilding to it.

Enjoy. It is Harry-Voldemort slash (though weird and innocent in a similar vein to Fantastic Elves), so be warned in advance if that's a thing that bothers you. It's not really a big relationship fic though, it's definitely a subplot at most.

We're just embarking on a readalong over at [[/r/SnarryBookClub][r/SnarryBookClub]] of The Forest King, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17509988/chapters/41246642]]) by drawlight, a fic that heavily incorporates Celtic mythology and folklore. (The author often includes fairy tale and folkloric elements in their work, so if you like this one, check out their other fic.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/172866][Requiem at Dusk]] by femmequixotic, mixes together concepts from various mythologies about the Underworld and uses the Orpheus myth as a starting point. Locked to AO3.

Full disclosure, this one's mine: The Lost World, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/729180]]), fairy tale and garden of Eden references.

The Stolen Child, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29726]]) by Delphi, Dumbledore/Snape, based on British folklore and a Yeats poem

[[https://severus-shorts.livejournal.com/13205.html][A Rowan in Winter]] by Duniazade, Snape family gen. This feels like it's drawing upon a magical or folkloric background, but it may not be specific.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519517][The Bone Mother]] by rinsbane, Andromeda/Bellatrix, Andromeda/Ted Tonks, a story that draws upon the Baba Yaga folktale. Locked to AO3.

  In a single night, all magic disappears across the world. Harry receives a strange and yellowing letter that there may be an exception, that one wizard may be yet living, isolated in the little town of Cokeworth. As Severus Snape begrudgingly assists Harry with unraveling the mystery of the loss of magic, they sink into a world neither had ever dreamt of, learning that there are many things shrouded in history and legend, that some of those things do not wish to be found.

*** Snarry is the pairing term, right? So, they're together? Is there actual development toward them getting together in those first three, or are they the usual "They're in close proximity, now they bang!" type short-burn relationship fics? I'm not complaining either way, I'd just like to know where to set my expectations in that regard. If Snape isn't a bitter, bullying twat like canon, it's good to have some explanation.

I do love Yeats, and The Stolen Child was a pretty good poem. Even Torchwood quoted it once. :)

Ah, Baba Yaga. I've used her for D&D things often. Sounds good. And is Andromeda-Bella a romantic incestuous pairing? Again, just checking to set expectations.

**** I haven't read the first one yet, but I've read other fics by the author, so I'm confident it's a slow-burn development and Snape is his bitter self. He's not as much of a bully in the second; he's more stern and subdued. There's some development in the third, but I was more concerned with fairytale/metaphysical matters.

Andromeda/Bella is an incestuous pairing, yes, but I wouldn't call it romantic. The story is meant to be creepy and unsettling.

ETA: I saw your question about sex addressed to another reccer, and in light of that, you may want to skip The Lost World and The Bone Mother.

***** Well, that's good. Like I said, I was just checking. I don't mind fics that take the un-canonical approach, I just like to be aware of what I'm reading so I don't go in expecting full development and find a "Snape was always nice all along, he was just forced to be a Nazi twat" or "You're hot, I'm hot, let's bang!". Setting expectations and all that. :)

Romantic in a simple "They're together" sense rather than a candle-lit dinners sense, I mean. Like, are they dating or just fucking?

In regard to Lost World and Bone Mother, are they overly smutty to the point where if I skip the sex I'll lose the thread of the plot? I can deal with my boredom in regard to sex scenes for a good plot, and those two do sound like interesting concepts with good plots.

****** I don't think being a "Nazi twat" comes up in any of the fic, so as with all shipfic, YMMV in regards to plausibility.

For Lost World, you shouldn't lose track of the plot if you skip the sex. I enjoy writing sex scenes, but they have to carry some of the story's weight. They're not just decoration. In this fic, they're part of the intensity, the seduction of the garden, the temptation to run away from increasing melancholy. It's meant to be erotic, but the scenes also have a thematic job to do, especially as the story is more about atmosphere than plot, and about the encounter with an older fairy tale type of magic and an older sense of fate.

With Bone Mother, it's a given that the Black family see morality and love through a very different lens. There's no dating involved. There are power plays and possessiveness underlying everything, and Bella is the most important person in Andromeda's life. The sex scenes are part of the whole incestuous fascination, the decadence that runs in a family raised to believe in power and superiority.

I don't think I can give a conclusive answer in either case. You can give them a try, and if the sexual aspect bothers or bores you, just move on to a different story. In terms of acceptable levels, only you can decide what works for you and what doesn't.

  "Nazi twat"
#+end_quote

Fair enough. Like I said, it's not about plausibility, any trope or pairing can be fun/interesting if it's done right and I'm not remotely attached to any headcanons, it's just about setting expectations. Expecting one version of that kind of pairing and getting another has always rankled slightly (the ambiguity is generally not done too well when pairing what is essentially the Magical Equivalent of a Nazi and a Half-Jewish Person), so I like to check beforehand so I know if I'm getting something where Snape and Draco grow from their canon selves or are just stuck in Leather Pants and claimed to have been nice all the while. For additional clarification, I'm definitely not saying either version is good or bad, they can both be interesting and fun. Checking in advance which it is just seems to get me more fun/interesting stories where it happens. It's how I found the few Harry-Bellatrix fics I've actually liked, for example.

#+begin_quote
  For Lost World
#+end_quote

Hmm, okay. That's good to know. I'm the kind of asexual where eroticism is completely lost on me - I find sex scenes about as entertaining as football matches, and I fell asleep at the only stadium match I went to. :D

It's a very interesting approach, though. Kind of reminds me of a mix of the Goblin Markets poem and a novel I read called Spellcast! by Barbara Ashford. The novel had a similar aspect of sexuality being thematically entwined with the seduction (though of the Theatre, instead of a Garden - and I see where the Edenite references come in :D). Hmm. I'll give them a try - I did actually enjoy the scenes in Spellcast somewhat, given how they furthered the plot and themes of the story.

#+begin_quote
  With Bone Mother
#+end_quote

Huh. That all sounds very Freudian. The Psychologist in me is curious, now. What the hell. I'm giving Lost World a try, I can give Bone Mother a go too.

Sure, but that doesn't mean I can't value the opinions of others. I've been convinced to try fics that I never would've myself that I've enjoyed immensely. Never any harm in getting input and advice, even if you disregard it entirely. You've certainly changed my perspective somewhat. :)
