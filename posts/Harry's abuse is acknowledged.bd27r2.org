As you can read in the title, I'm looking for a well-written fic that adresses the abuse Harry went through (one shots are also welcome). Someone like Dumbledore, Snape, Draco or even Ron and Hermione (could also be another character) discover what Harry is still going through and decide to help him (and maybe even give the Dursleys a long overdue ass whooping). Thank you in advance!


** Barefoot is a fic than not only acnowledges Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys, but has Dumbledore genuinely horrified over his own ignorance in that regard. It's a very good read, give it a shot.

** My favorite one is Eight by Lily Elizabeth Snape. It takes a little one but when Snape rescues Harry as a child it takes him a little while to connect the pieces as he was reminded of James. There's later some retribution to the Dursley's
