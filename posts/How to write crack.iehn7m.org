I have so many ideas for ridiculous scenarios that could be hilarious, but I somehow end up making it angsty and dramatic every single time. I don't know how to maintain the casual insane vibe.

Is there any way to, dunno, learn to be funny? Or is it something you either have or don't and I just don't?


** Studying the mechanisms (how and when they work) of absurdist comedy will help you write better absurdist comedy.

For example, knowing how to use a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan][Straight Man]] or comedic foil or how and when to properly [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging][lampshade]]

** The biggest difference between "well-written crack" and "cringeworthy bash fic" is the narrative tone. When writing crack, you must not come across as preachy and it must never seem that you are actually believing what you are writing.

For example, there is a Germany YT parody where Dumbledore's rap career (with such great tracks as "grandmother fucker") isn't earning enough money so he produced cp in the secret porno chamber to balance the books. Sounds like Dumbledore bashing turned up to 11, except that it is not even taken seriously in the parody but clearly just thrown around as a joke. The woman who made it (writing, voicing all characters) now works for state television.

** Practice helps.

Whenever I feel like the crack is becoming serious/dramatic, I think up the most ludicrous thing/reaction that can happen in the scene, and tone it down to make it fit.
