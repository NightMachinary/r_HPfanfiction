Self explanatory, but there was quite a popular thread previously (I'll link it in comments below) about the adoption of abandoned fics. Obviously we all have favourites out there. But I thought it'd be good to have links to a few stories up that there is general consensus about picking up. What are some of your recommendations?

Out of the night by raining ink always stood out to me!


** I totally agree, there are many great stories that have been abandoned and it would be great if someone adopted them to continue the stories. But some authors don't want others to continue their stories and many authors have not only abandoned their story but also the site, they wrote on and you have no chance of contacting them.

*** Agreed. Which is why we should aim for ones like out of the night where the author has given permission to utilise the story. Hopefully we can use this to gather more

** How much time has to pass from the last post to be considered abandoned generally? I don't mind messaging a few authors. Something like magical relations by evansentranced?

*** I'd guess it should be more than a year and ideally the author has mentioned they're either abandoning it or on hiatus. Reach out though and see if you get a reply! I think it's all about letting people know what's available.

** The idea pops up every so often (it's appeared three times in the last year, once due to me) and it never really goes anywhere.

In terms of what happened in that linked thread specifically - the OP of that post didn't make a sub, but someone else in the thread did (and it didn't get much traction).

** Dead Man Walking by KittySmith (or is it KittySmith?) on FFN is my nomination. She seems to have lost interest in the HP fandom, but is still sort of active on ao3, so we could probably get in contact with her.
