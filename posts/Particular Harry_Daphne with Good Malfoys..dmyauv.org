:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Key facts for this fic was that Lucius was forced to join Death Eaters due to his father threatening to harm his mother (Lucius is much closer to his mother than Sirius) And Charlus (James's Father) Duels/Defeats Lucius's Father, forcing him to flee and Lucius becomes a spy for Charlus in the Death Eaters group. After deaths of James and Lily, Lucius tries to get Harry adipted himself but due to Albus's more insistence on Lucius's alleged Death Eater status and him already dropping off Harry at Dursley's, he's unable to reach harry until He arrives at Gringots.

Maybe Lucius, James and Sirius were more closer-knit grout than Remus and Peter.

Harry and Daphne might be in a betrothal contract.

It was quite an interesting read for me. Do let me know if you guys have any idea of what fic it was.

** Possibly? linkffn(What Might Have Been by Catherine or Cate)

Or? linkffn(Wheels Within Wheels - Part 1 by Bfd1235813)

I haven't read either, but just found then from scrolling through the Harry/Daphne and reading summaries. The story you described sounded really interesting and I'd like to read it.

It might be easier to find if you know more details, most importantly was it complete? If not, do you know a general word count? Besides Harry and Daphne, do you know which other characters were tagged for the story?

Knowing one of the genres or ratings would be helpful, but not a deal breaker.

What can really help is if you know what the summary was, or one or two specific words (like Malfoy, or Gringotts) that were in the summary.

  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.

*** Nope, not those. The story was incomplete but the author was good on updating it. It was around 20k words when i read it but now could have expanded more.

Draco was tagged with Astoria i believe (Silver Trio)

I don't really remember anything rating or genres or Gringotts scene but i remember vividly the scene where Lucius explains about the friendship between him, James and Sirius (he must bee older than them i think) and how he worked with Charlus as his spy in the Death Eater inner circle after Charlus defeats Lucius's father Abraxas Malfoy and Abraxas running off after the duel, never to be seen again.

** You'd need to make Lucius a bit younger to be close friends with James and Sirius. Without antagonistic Malfoy's you will need someone else to fill the that void. You could have the Weasleys be bigoted Slytherin purebloods. I can easily imagine Ron taking Draco's place. Draco might end up in Ravenclaw instead. Maybe make the Longbottom family bigger to act as Gryfinndor friendly family for Harry. I don't know where the Greengrass betrothal comes in. You could just have them introduced early in the fic through Draco or Neville.

*** The antagonist in the story were Wesleys, Dumbledore and Voldemort. Yup, Lucius might be younger to fit the storyline and maybe the bethrothal was set so as if a family has no male heir, the contract would take place.
