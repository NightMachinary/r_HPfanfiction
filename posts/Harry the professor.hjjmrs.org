Looking for a fic where harry takes on the post of the DADA teacher.


** BLACKBOARDS AND BROOMSTICKS is my favorite one of this!!! :) It's canon compliant (as much as it can be) and super great! I love adult Harry and also Ginny's relationship too. :) :) And I don't even like teenage Ginny very much.

** Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery by semprini on ffnet is quite good. He takes on the post in 6th year I believe - not sure if your looking solely for ones post-hogwarts, but if your open to still in Hogwarts, this is one of my favorites and it's part of a series (there are 2 more after this one)

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
