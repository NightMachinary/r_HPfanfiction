  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** I just can't see Hermione becoming friends with Parvati and Lavender... though it's something that'd be amusing to read. A lot of comedy, I'm sure. I wouldn't mind reading a story with Hermione being friends with Parvati and Lavender.

I really wonder, if Harry, Hermione and Ron hadn't of been friends, who would they be friends with?

Like if Hermione was still attacked by the Troll, and Harry and Ron still saved her, so she was more chilled out, but they just weren't friends.

That'd be a interesting story, I could see as a drabble fic or a oneshot or something.

*** Arguably we see them through Harry's perspective.

In terms of what they actually /do/ - well by 3rd year they like Divination, and in various other subjects they're happy to get stuck in - iirc one of them gets injured herding Skrewts in Care. Plenty of fuel there for alternate interpretation. Maybe one of them has an encounter with a seer in between age 11 and 13 that influences their interest. Maybe Hermione would get the same kind of interest if exposed to the right evidence.

I can certainly see a friendship or even relationship between Hermione and Lavender after the Battle of Hogwarts. Being comrades in arms would certainly create a bond between them, especially with Lavender being almost killed.

*** I think when the owls would've come up anlog of people would've approached her. Also I guess hermione would've had a hard time till fourth year when she would've gone to the yule ball with Krum. Harry and Ron would've probably missed a lot of homework or done it in the last minute. Also good luck with the basilisk

**** Harry and Ron would have had to try harder, but I think that they would have been able to do it.

Harry likewise, is incredibly lucky, I think they'd be able to handle the Basilisk and stuff like that.

***** Yeah though they would've never been in Myrtles bathroom where the entrance to the chamber is if it weren't for Hermione brewing polyjuice potion there. So Ginny would've probably died. Though in his first year it would've been probably better if Harry hadn't went through the wall of fire with the potions. This was also hermione who got the solution to the riddle. Hmm though I guess they might have become friends in the third year because of the time turner, depending on the fact if Dumbledore would've been willing to let Sirius die. It's more of a butterfly effect
