I believe it was called On the way to Greatness. Last time I checked it wasn't finished. Does anyone know if there's a completed version or if that's all there is.

**** Oof, I didn't realize it had been over a year since its last update. The author recently confirmed on her ffn page that she hasn't abandoned anything though! See the August 2015 update. :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1541187/mira-mirth]]

***** Considering it's 20 chapters over the course of six years, a year-long gap wouldn't be too far out of place. I'm not sure, since Fanfiction.net doesnt't timestamp updates, but it's possible she writes whole books(which are usually around 4-5 chapters each) and releases them all at once.
