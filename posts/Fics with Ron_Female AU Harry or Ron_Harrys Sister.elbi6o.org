  Ron wasn't expecting her to even show up tonight. But she did. He wasn't expecting her to dance with him. But she did... Harry didn't expect to fall for him in just one night after four years of friendship... But she did.

  Ron is very insecure about himself and his relationship with Harriet. Harriet on the other hand just wants to sleep. (Now with sequels)
