When Harry was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he realised that he was a Wizard, that a whole section of his identity had been actively hidden from his for his entire life. Free from the overbearing image of 'normal' that the Dursley's strived for, Harry is free to discover and experiment with who he is as a person. Free to finally discover what sort of person he was looking to grow into, as every other Hogwarts student does.

However, he also had the option to discover who is in a more literal PHYSICAL way. As, in his second year, he discovered he was a metamorphmagus rather than a parselmouth.

A story of a genderfluid, shapeshifting Harry who is more looking at what physical form he wants to settle on and the influences he has from those around him. E.g: Sirius is very adamant that he remains as much like his father as possible whilst Snape wants to see more of Lily (both making Harry incredibly uncomfortable).

Tonks isn't as helpful as Harry would like, as she sees the power as a toy more than anything else. Harry is left to try and figure things out on his/her own.

As well as:

- The Dursley's predictably horrid reactions,

- Ron's initial worries that Harry is doing this for attention,

- Hermione's often clinical and tactless approach that doesn't take Harry's feelings into account,

- McGonogall's unwavering and unquestioning support as she doesn't miss a beat addressing Harry regardless of what form he is trialling,

- Ginny bisexual awakening, as she loves Harry regardless of form

and

- The magical and muggle words differing and/or similar attitudes to transexual individuals.

I'd love bits where Katie, Alicia and Angelina are helping Harry through any female related questions and queries about her body. Harry having bonding moments with Fred, George and Ollie whilst presenting as a guy.

《I've always wanted to write a story about a shapeshifters (metamorphmagus in this case) approach to gender-fluidity, as they have complete control over their physical form.》


** Bonus: Hermione, once she understands, nicknaming Harry Loki because in the original mythology Loki was a genderfluid shapeshifter.

** I had a really rough draft for a similar idea, but never actually developed much/if any of it. Nevertheless, feel free to take a read:

Harry is born as a Metamorphmagus, but is conditioned into suppressing it once his abuse at the Dursley household picks up. He doesn't remember much of it - if at all, and this period of time was between ages 3 and 6, with 6 being the moment where he no longer manifested any changes (regardless of emotional stimuli), though for the year and a bit before the power had already been mostly suppressed. 

During Harry's second year - ala Chamber of Secrets - when he, Hermione, and Ron take the polyjuice potion, the latent, repressed Metamorphmagus power is violently reactivated. This is largely due to how Polyjuice interacts with Metamorphmagus', which is to say /not very well/. It causes spasms, half-changes, and makes the user lose control of their Metamorphmagus ability. A variant on the Polyjuice potion is used to suppress Metamorphmagus powers, even, however the main brewed Polyjuice potion is highly reactive and highly damaging to a Metamorphmagus. Harry is no different, as the potion both reactivates, turns uncontrollable, and makes the effects of using the Metamorphmagus power more extreme. This causes him to - not exactly unexpectedly - end up having a violent, seizure-like episode. 

Before Dumbledore or any other staff member can try to fix the problem, numerous students see and are made aware of Harry's episode. This, along with the knowledge that a student has been petrified immediately after, causes Aurors to investigate. Dumbledore is (maybe momentarily?) stripped of his position and authority while the Ministry scrambles to find out what's causing the petrification events. This draws in several curse breakers, people who specialize in wards, those who specialize in exploring magical buildings, and monster hunters. 

Harry remains in a magically-induced coma throughout all of this while medi-witches work to first diagnose the problem and then wait for Harry's body to overcome close to seven years worth of neglect not using his Metamorphmagus ability. During this, Harry's horcrux is both found by specialists and is removed. S/He retains their Parselmouth ability.

At around April the team brought in identifies the Basilisk, finds a way into the Chamber of Secrets with the help of some research (Salazar was a Parselmouth, after all) and a book of phrases in Parselmouth, before promptly killing the Basilisk and retrieving Ginny - alongside the Horcrux, something they believe Dumbledore is aware of and is identified as purposefully hiding - and calling the case to a close.

On May 23rd, Harry wakes up in St. Mungos. 

Harry has reverted to what is known scholastically as the “malleable state”. It's an indistinct humanoid figure with single-tone grey skin, a mouth, two eyes, no nose, no ears, no genitals, and a distorted musculature that shifts and changes at random intervals. This state is what a Metamorphmagus ends up in when they have “episodes”, something that can be triggered either by extreme emotional duress, poison that specifically targets their shapeshifting abilities, or other maladies that conflict with their natural ability to change shape. 

Tonks - off screen at the moment - helps to guide Andromeda through getting Harry to first recreate his ears, which is done by telling him to focus on needing to hear and to ‘push'. Crude but effective, this leads to Harry regaining their ears, though they're so overwhelmed by the noise that Andromeda needs to create a one-way silencing charm so that Harry doesn't lapse back into the malleable state. 

Afterwards, Tonks fully enters the scene, introduces herself, and guides Harry through reverting back into what she describes as ‘his base state, of a sort'. This is done by following the same logic as his ears, though Tonks is there more physically to guide him and encourage him, even going so far as to enhance how loud her heartbeat is to soothe him through his anxiety about using the ability, something he doesn't understand but is so drugged out on potions that he babbles about it anyway. It's incredibly painful, like pulling knots out of hair just a thousand times worse, closer to a crucio, but Harry manages it and reverts to their original form -- their true original form. This prompts Andromeda to get really nervous, same with Tonks, because Harry's ‘true' form is definitely a girl.

Which. Y'know. Is maybe a problem, considering the whole boy-who-lived bit.

*** I envision that McGonagall would initially think this is some James Potter level pranking Harry is getting up to and would initially write it off as attention seeking.

However I can envision her losing her cool a little and either giving Harry a detention or making them stay behind after class. There, after a heart to heart, where McGonagall sees that Harry is just trying to discover themselves, she would flip to being understanding and on board.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** I looked for stuff like this back before I realized I was LGBTQ+

If any of this stuff exists, please point me towards it.

What's funny is that I have a female tiger (specifically a tigress) for my Pottermore patronus and my Pottermore wand had a unicorn hair core. I wasn't born female. Also, I hadn't realized I was LGBTQ+ until 2017. I was a Pottermore beta user.

My patronus is literally transgender, so I really want to read a compelling LGBTQ+ fic with this kind of thing. Long before 2019 I hadn't liked anything after the second task in GoF. If a fic exists that radically transforms the series along the lines of the prompt, I will read it. I'm all ears for any fanfic that does this.

** That's an interesting topic, but I don't think the ability to change forms, when coming later in life at least changes who you are, or at least your sexual preferences.

I know males who identify as females but are still attracted to females. And vice versa.

This reminds me of Alex Fierro, a child of Loki in the Magnus Chase and The Gods of Asgard series who can shapeshift in to almost anything and also changes genders. They also end up being the MCs love interest.

I imagine Harry would just see "himself"(I don't know what pronoun to use) as well, Harry.

I can see some people would have a problem with it.
