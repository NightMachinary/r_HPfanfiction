I imagine at some point Harry may have snuck up from his cupboard under the stairs and secretly watched as Dudley and Piers watch WWE and was hooked. I'm imagining him being influenced by the product and working it into his Hogwarts days. Maybe the Triwizard Tournament and he cuts some promos on people. Or just in his attitude.

“Those Potter stinks badges....I can tell you what you can do with those..Goyle you take it and shine it up real nice and you pass it to Crabbe. Crabbe you take it and turn it sideways and hand it to Malfoy and Malfoy you can stick it up your candy a$$!!!” Or...

Ok, Tom Riddle..I have proven ,son,without a shadow of a doubt you ain't got what it takes anymore. You sit there and you flick your wand and you say your unforgivables and it didn't get you anywhere.You talk about your horcruxs talk about Your Elder Wand.......Avada Ka Harry says i just whipped your @$$!!

Or... When your Dumbledores Army you are DA for Life...it's just too sweet!!”

Or... him doing a version of Dusty Rhodes hard times promo but about how Umbridge put hard times on him.\\
She put hard times on Me and my friends. You don't know what hard times are folks. Hard times are when the Misuse of Muggle artifacts workers are in the hospital, they got 4 or 5 kids and can't pay their wages, can't buy their food. Hard times are when the Divination Professors are out of work and they tell ‘em go home. And hard times are when a man has worked as a Headmaster for thirty years, thirty years, and they give him a watch, kick him in the butt and say “hey a High Inquisitor took your place, daddy”, that's hard times! That's hard times! And Dolores you put hard times on this country by takin' Harry Potter out, that's hard times. And we all had hard times together, and I admit, I don't look like the athlete of the day supposed to look. My knees are a bit nobbly , my Glasses a lil' big, but brother, I am bad. And they know I'm bad!

Or... Rita Skeeter here at the Triwizard Tournament interviewing Harry Potter

I'm talking about all the way to the top, yeah. I'm justifiably in a position that I'd rather not be in. But the cream will rise to the top, ooh yeah. Potter Madnes, yeah has got more to offer than the judges and Hogwarts thinks that I got yeah and let me tell you something right now, cards stacked against the Harry Potter and This tournament but let me say it yeah, let me say it out loud and let me point to the Headmaster, Harry Potter is not happy with your decision, yeah. I am the cream in Hogwarts and there is no doubt about it, yeah, you Rita Skeeter you know that I'm the cream of the crop!

Or... Get ready for the moooost electrifying move in all the Wizarding World: Epeliarmus!!!!!!


** Harry (/Dudley) would've grown up seeing wrestling in the 80's (beginning of the WWF, Hulk Hogan, first WrestleMania, nationalisation etc) so I could see this being interesting, especially since he's in his 4th year when the Attitude Era starts. Contrast the growing edginess of wrestling to how his future darkens etc.

But that would require a lot of wrestling history knowlege lol. And of course, British pro wrestling is totally different.

*** So, Steven Regal? Love this idea. I could totally see Harry empathizing with Bret deluding the Montreal Screwjob. Thinking of of the Ministry villainized him and maybe finding solace in Stone Colds attacks on Mr. McMahon
