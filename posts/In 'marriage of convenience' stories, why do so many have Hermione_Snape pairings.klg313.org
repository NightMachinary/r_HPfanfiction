Why are there so many HG/SS marriage of convenience stories in the fanfic world? I'm sure there are several high-quality ones but just think this pairing is creepy and seem to come across it the most often in searches. Haven't been able to bring myself to read it. It'd be one thing if Snape was at least kind and not her asshole teacher but...


** The thing with this ship is that, both Snape and Hermione come up as smart, with an interest in academia rather than sport, a talent for making up spells, not very sociable, they both have a muggle background, one chose the dark side with moments of lights and the other the light side with moments of darkness. They are like a Ying and Yang couple, sufficiently similar yet different that they could make a strong durable couple, they complement each other well. That said, there is the 20 year gap, the teacher/student relationship, and the fact that Snape is an arsehole. That's why most Hermione/Snape stories include a forced marriage, or another situation where they have no other choice than to spend lots of time together. Because even the craziest shippers can't think of why they would even get them together on their own. Once they are together, the story just get momentum, but it's starting them that is an issue.

Hence the Marriage Law sub-genre. I can't remember where it's from, but I think it was a challenge on When I Kissed The Teacher Forum: the ministry sees the birth rate getting low, and forces any adult witch and wizards to get married within the year...

I have read (and written!) plenty of SSHG where they are not forced together. Especially the fluffy post-war romances where both of them have matured and and can appreciate each other a little more just for who they are.

Hell just last week I published a fic where the only point you might say they are "forced" is that Minerva tells Severus she expects him to give Hermione real advice about her apprenticeship with Slughorn if she asks for it. They manage to develop a friendly professional relationship as they deal with the aftermath in the 6 months following the war. He falls for her like a ton of bricks, but he's patient about waiting for her to be ready for more.

I've gotten some comments that this story is a fresh take, but it's certainly not /unique/ in the elements that make SSHG work as a ship. It's a lot of the same stuff you mentioned in your comment -- the not-so-sociable intellectuals with moments of light and dark who might complement each other well. Which is why ultimately I did upvote your comment. It's not entirely accurate, IMHO, but it certainly tries to add to the discussion, with only one nasty comment about the "craziest shippers" and our ability to make it work.

**** I have been hyperbolic in my comment (OP was only asking about marriage of convenience stories), and I apologize for insulting writers whose work I have loved. There are plenty of stories that work without the "forced interaction" (like you said: often post-war, definitely post graduation). I am now quite curious about your stories. They seem to be exactly the kind I like. :)

  I see your points. I can see Hermione be willing to overcome preconceptions to date a Slytherin or...idk...Zacharias smith. But a MOC makes the most sense for connecting the two.

  Does Hermione make up spells? Is she unsociable? I don't see her as unsociable, often bossy and annoying, but not the type to hide in a corner.

**** Of the top of my head some spells have been implied to be her creation, or something she came up and not just read about: the flame in a jar (that she used to burn Snape's clothes), the Point Me spell, that spell to make the coins match each other for the DA (inspired by the Dark Mark), that mean curse on the DA sign-in list, her beaded bag with the undetectable extension charm...

As for the unsociable part, Hermione didn't make any friend for the first month, and didn't gained many more friends after Harry, Ron and their circle of friends. She doesn't even seem to get along with her dorm-mates. She's not anti-social, as in hiding in a corner. She knows people names and such, but in the books she's not as emotionally and socially aware as in the movies. She does seem to be someone who if given the choice between staying home with a boring book or going to a fun party, would pick the book every time. She'd be one of those introvert people who have been thriving with social distancing and lockdown.

** One of the original MLC Challenges was in 2003 with the Snape/Hermione group WIKTT. It's a /very/ old trope for this /very/ popular ship from one of the /golden ages/ of the ship.

If you want a couple of good ones, two of my favorites are by miamadwyn:

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit]], Snape and Hermione are both Hogwarts professors who get married for the financial incentive. They are buddies. It's funny. If you like /banter/ you gotta read it.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/457318/chapters/787129][The Disillusion Law]], we jump to close to the ending of the implemented marriage law, where Snape is a total jerk (and everyone tells her so), and Hermione gets the damn thing repealed. It might not be your cup of tea since you want a /kind/ Snape but it does have a HEA.

** It's just the easiest, quickest way to get these two characters together, since they are so different in age and positions in life.

The HGSS ones I read usually age Hermione up a bit (/using the time turner explanation of her 3rd year of classes)/ or the fanfic doesn't have them do anything explicit and just implies they get together finally after she graduates /(they have a love of the minds or deep friendship until she graduates)/. They also usually make Snape even younger than he already is, so that the age gap narrows even further. Keep in mind, that the actor who plays Snape is a TON older than book!Snape, so don't let that color your vision.

I like Hermione with Snape faaaar more than Lily because we just don't know that much about Lily. Lily feels like a Original Character to me in any fanfic because we don't know anything about her from canon. I generally don't like reading Original Characters, I like to read about Canon characters and see how the author expands them further. Hermione is the "best" canon character because (A) she's very smart and so is Snape and (B) there just aren't a lot of female characters to choose from in Harry Potter. Narcissa Malfoy or Mcgonagall are the only other females that are possibly intelligent enough to handle Snape, who aren't batshit crazy (Bellatrix). I also HATE that Hermione ended up with Ron. I didn't really like her with Harry either. Hermione is sooo smart. I always thought she would end up with a nice Ravenclaw, not the two dunces of Gryffindor. Snape is plenty intelligent enough for Hermione once you take care of the age gap issue a bit and the teacher/student issue. No, it's not canon and will never be canon, but it's a hell of a lot of FUN in the hands of a talented writer.

If you do want to explore this ship more /(with fanfics that give fully fleshed out explanations and scenarios for how HGSS could work)/, I have my favorites listed here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cdkuzu/my_severus_snape_fanfic_library_list_please_help/]]

  I appreciate your thoughtful response, and also think Hermione could do better than Ron. Book Snape is in his 30s, and with a lot of the marriage law fics I see the female character being 17...still a little too old. Though I think that's better than Hermione/Lucius...at least it's not her classmate's asshole father.

  I just have a hard time considering Snape actually hooking up with someone. I guess it's also him being described as greasy-haired, yellow toothed, and an asshole. So I guess I could try the 'love of the mind' stories as you put it.

  I may check those fics out. I also thought fanfiction was stupid until two months ago and since then have positively gorged on them. *Shrugs*

**** It's definitely "love of the mind", aka the more in love you fall with someone, the more physically attractive they become. This happens a TON in real life. We females are often guided more by our emotion than the physical aspects. Also, a lot of these fics downplay those characteristics by saying it was all from Harry's POV. AKA Harry isn't attracted to guys and therefore would view Snape in the harshest light possible, unlike female students. There's also scenarios where Snape is depressed, but he gets more cheerful once he has a friend (hint Hermione awww! ;) haha) and he starts to clean himself up and doesn't look so bad afterwards

The biggest reason I think these fics were written is because of Alan Rickman. He's much better looking than book!Snape and has been voted as having the sexiest voice in history (by women). If anyone else had played Snape, I don't know if he would be as popular. When I'm reading these fanfics I'm imagining a young Alan Rickman -> go watch /Sense and Sensibility (1995)/ for a Young Alan with a velvety voice. ;) [[https://youtu.be/clTG6sYtJig?t=70]]

***** How do you know I'm female? Just kidding. And it'd be interesting to see where Snape lightens up due to his new friendship. He is funny at times in canon.

Yeah I get the Alan Rickman thing...the scene in OOTP floats through my mind when he says 'Control your emotions, discipline your mind' i'd want to listen ;)...sort of reminds me of Draco's popularity being linked to Tom Felton.

****** oh 100% on the Tom Felton thing. If you want people to hate your villains, you can't hire pretty people to play them LOL.

I've never been very interested in Draco myself, but he often shows up in my Snape fanfics and I usually end up liking him, although never as much as Snape. I also enjoy fanfics where Harry gets to be competent and intelligent, as long as he doesn't feel too OOC while doing so. Still Canon!Harry, just less of a dumbass, usually because Snape or Hermione is helping him out and Harry actually LISTENS to them.

** I've never liked the ship either, but I've read one or two popular ones to see what it's about. It really just seems like a way to romanticize Snape and give him a happy ending. And I think they choose hermione because she's smart, so she'll at least keep him interested in that regard, and because there's a sort of parallel with her and Lily. And also because just like Harry is pretty much an OC in fics, Hermione is the canon character that gets turned into an OC when the plot requires a female OC. (Which is a shame, really. I'd love to see all the drama that Lavender or Parvati would drudge up if they were forced to marry Snape or Sirius or Lucius Malfoy. Or god forbid, Luna fucking Lovegood. It would be beautiful chaos)

Like I said, I don't really agree with the ship either, but I think that's usually why.

** Kind of unrelated, but I read a cheating Romione this week where Ron raised the kids while Hermione focused on work and her "friend"... it had no bashing and Ron just wanted to keep the kids, so that was nice. Until it's revealed the friend was effing Snape. It wasn't really important but it felt so weird to have Snape telling Ron off for easily giving up the love of his life. Kind of ruined it. I don't know about those marriages fics because I stay far from them, but at least in this one the appeal was on both being smart and working on research together.

** Another view: I often see fanfics as a way of therapeutical writing. People get into FF (and especially HP Universe) because it's a fantasy world were you create whatever you like and fit á character in there which you also can just create how you like it. Those stories often come with problems, plots and twists that involve the real-life writers life. Writing is a way of solving and bringing problems in perspective. SSHG + forced marriage is something .... That just happens so often. A relationship or even marriage of two people not working out with each other comes up VERY often in this world. The FF could work as a problem solver for people watching their parents getting divorced - in SSHG, they surely argue with each other but at the end they will always find a way to deal with each other, even fall in love with. Could work for someone describing their own marriage, their own relationships were they Sohle can't escape and hope for a romantic ending.Hermione does represent somehow who is capable of someone who could take care of something of she wanted too. .. something motherly, something that Snape always needed from his traumatic past. Although Hermione often seems far away from emotions or empathetic- she has something that I could take for motherly. The way she cares for the boys in the trip for instance, thinks for them in case they get in trouble again. Reliable! Knows everything when you ask! Snape would need an anchor like that.

TLTR; therapeutical writing! Projecting your own problems into a fantasy story. Hermione has motherly vibes and Snape is not the typical guy for emotions, so he would choose someone who is more into rational thinking.

** For me personally, I am not a fan of that particular plot device but I do enjoy the fics involving time turners. Somehow Hermione ends up going to the Maurader's Era and hooks up with a teenage Snape.
