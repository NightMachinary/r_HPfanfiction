Please recommend me a Severus Snape story. I like the romance pairing between SS and HG or just a story about SS in general. I'm not a huge fan of HP and SS though.


** Chasing The Sun. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun]]

*** I second "Chasing the Sun." I just recommended it in a different thread, but it's definitely a good read. One of the longer ones, but the characterization and side characters were great.

*** Sorry it took me so long to reply back. Thank you for your suggestion :) I loved "Chasing the Sun" I want to read "The Art of Brewing" but it isn't completed and the last update was in January...so scared to start reading something that might be abandoned

** If you want good characterization, I'd recommend the work of Delphi on Ao3. They don't write pairings that could be viewed as conventional, by any means, but their grasp on Snape's character is a favourite of mine, and I appreciate that they don't soften his character to make him more palatable or likeable.

I'm half and half about Snape/Lily. I like the idea that they would be together, but without Lily/James there would be no Harry. I wouldn't mind reading one (as this would be my first time reading one).
