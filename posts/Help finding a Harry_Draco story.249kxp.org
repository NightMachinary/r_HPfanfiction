A while ago I read a story where Harry and Draco accidentally touch in the robe shop before first year and gain a mental connection.

Through this connection Draco sees that Harry is abused and promises to become his friend and they do so in secret.

I think it was between 30 to 40k words.

Thanks


** Can you let us know what it's called when you find it? It sounds great.

** Have you tried asking in one of the various H/D LJ communities? It's a whole lot easier to find those niche fics in their own communities, compared to here (A gen-centric community, so DLP without the elitism and jerkass)

** i went hardcore looking, even though i'm not a Drarry shipper. This was the closest i got...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581954/1/][Mental]] - HP/DM. Harry thinks that he's already spent quite enough time sharing a mind with someone else, thankyouverymuch. A miscast Legilimency spell says otherwise...

not from year one though, sorry :(
