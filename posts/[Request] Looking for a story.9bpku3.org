Looking for a story I read many years ago. The basis was Harry and Hermione had a child somewhere around 5th year, her parents were taking care of the child while they finished school. They got married secretly while in school.

I remember it starting in the Gryffindor common room shortly after the final battle. I believe Harry was pacing and Hermione was sitting in a chair talking to him or something along those lines. The Weasley's were completely in the dark.

I also remember a scene of them walking towards the burrow a few months later with Hermione pregnant and her little sister with them.

Any help finding this is very much appreciated!


** Is it this one?

** Actually, now that I reread your post I think it sounds more like this one

** Thank you for your suggestions, unfortunately neither of them are the one. They are close but not the one, I do recall that there wasn't any time travel involved or anything like that.
