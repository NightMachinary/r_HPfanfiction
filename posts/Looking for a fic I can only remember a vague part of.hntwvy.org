:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I was recently talking with people about good HP docs, and I remember that in one I read AGES ago, Harry was the only champion who did NOT know what the first task in the Tri Wiz was.... for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fic!

Any help would be great!!

It was deleted, the scene you are looking for is in chapter 11. Took me a while to find it, hope this is what you were looking for!

** I feel like I read one of these pretty recently, but for the life of me I can't remember it. One detail I vaguely recall is that Cedric, upon hearing this, decides to not make that mistake again and that's what prompts him to tell Harry about the prefect's bathroom for the egg clue

** Did Harry not know because he was attacked? If so I think I know the fic. I'll quickly have a look to see if i can track it down.
