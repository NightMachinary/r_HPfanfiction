*Ship:* HAREM (Hermione, Ginny, Susan, Daphne, Tracey, Hannah and Padma) Haphne\\
*Timeline:* Summer of fifth-sixth year\\
*Words:* 453,769\\
*Complete:* No and abandoned!\\
*Personal summary*: Harry becomes a girl and has to deal with it. Magical oaths and marriage but /extremely/ slow burn. Heavy focus on magical and physical training and gender identity. OP Harry!\\
*Personal comment:* The fic was abandoned at a pretty unremarkable point so this might not be worth the 453k word of reading.\\
