Hello! In celebration to a year of subscribing to this subreddit, I'd like to see some of your favourite action battle scenes. I'd like to read uprooted moving trees, hurricanes, blood animated golems and all sorts of that stuff. (Sorry, watched some Naruto episodes yesterday and I want to feel the Senju vs Uchiha vibe) Besides the big big bang bang stuff, I also love to read some creativity and uniqueness used in those scenes.

Right now I stared the all mighty Wastelands of Time and I have to say, the first three chapters had both their awesome parts and their not-that-awesome-monologue parts. PLEASE DON'T SPOIL THAT FOR ME.

Out of my head, two fics that have really good fighting/dueling scenes are: Wind Shear linkffn(12511998) and Whispers in the Night linkffn(12104688) The second one has very clearly some D&D inspirations for the spells used which warms my nerdy D&D fanatic soul.

Guys, girls, thanks a lot for everything this past year and let's hope the HP fandom will still live on.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][/The One He Feared/]] has a great scene in chapter four.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** A few have stuck out to me over the years.

Though I found the story lost my interest at some point, the gear wheel well battle from The Song of the Trees was incredible. (Harry vs Hermione) linkffn(2859327)\\
I think Too Young to Die had some good ones. Totally worth a read. linkffn(9057950)\\
Hogwarts Battle School also had some cool fights. It's not always flashy (it is sometimes though) but its always thrilling. Very fast paced and creative. linkffn(8379655)

I've read a few that bring in transfiguration to fights and often make it entertaining but can't for the life of me think of any. If anyone knows of any I'd be glad to read it. Especially starring Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Do yourself a fever. Find a copy of Ootp and read the Voldemort vs Dumbledore in the atrium. It's a brilliant piece of writing.

I saw you mentioned Naruto in your post. If you read naruto ff, I recommend anything by Dr.Snakes. His battle scenes are such a thrill to read. Conveys the speed of 2 super-humans battling.

HP wise, most of my recommendations have been made. Every one of those fics is worth perusing.
