So after reading one too many HP fanfic where Harry boldly proclaims to a random goblin who isn't even introduced by name that "I have a friend who is a house elf, one half giant and I know a centaur." To which the goblin happily responds with what comes down to 'please let me fix your immediate problems, Mr Potter', I am done.

I had enough. I dearly need a fic where some random goblin quickly covers their nametag and asks whether Harry actually remembered their name. Asks whether Harry actually is on equal footing when it comes to emotional investment with in that friendship with that house elf and half giant.

I need a fic where someone -anyone!- tells Harry he is virtue signaling and being a bad ally.

I vaguely remember reading one fic where Harry realised what a bad ally he was to dark creatures as an Auror only after he was turned into a werewolf himself, but that was like the first chapter and a justification to Harry becoming a time traveling dark lord himself.

Someone please tell me there are fics out there that are worth reading where Harry explores allyship or simply being a proper friend to someone with a bit more to chew on than being muggleborn. Some fic where their friendship is one of they key factors of the story itself, rather than something haphazardly added by the author to either make Harry look diverse or to give him help from unexpected corners?

Thank you for any recommendations you may make!


** Cant say I've ever encountered either scenario you spoke of. Most fics are harry recognizes griphook legitimately as I've never seen a fic where they wear nametags. Or goblins are just assholes dont care that he recognizes them and only care about money.

*** What pissed me off into writing this post to begin with was chapter 2 of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2374939/1/The-Dark-Witch-and-the-Necromancer-ENGLISH]]

Sure I suppose I ought to be reading the entire fic with a grain of salt, but it actually got me thinking: how many fics do I know that take this unintended trope that basically makes Harry a bad ally and actually explore it?

**** Most I've seen is when harry recognizes a particular goblinnthey basically tell hime "what you want a medal?" Maybe not in so many words but that's the gist

***** I have read those as well, but never where Harry had an actual reality check he'd chew on for days to come, something that tears at his self image for days or months to come.

Basically, what I would really like to read is an in depth character exploration that could be read as an analogy for the white guilt/bad allyship for BLM many people finally have to face these days.

*** Both are rather common, usually in the "political" type of fic where Harry impresses the goblins with a customary greeting, after which they bend over backwards for Harry. This usually leads to the "friend of half-giants and house elves" scene.

***** Heavy Politics would be a joy to read compared to your average "political" fic. Usually, they even come with a romance, if not a harem.

****** I dont mind harem as long as it's not harry gets every girl in the series cause reasons. But when a fic goes into the minutiae of how the wizengamot works and 90% of the fic is on that with very little actually being done it's just boring

** It sounds like you're just reading too many shitfics tbh. And looking for more shitfics might not help. I can't recall any good stories with what you're mentioning, the closest is probably any fics with a mention of Hermione's SPEW.

** Here try this one it has the Goblins coming to rescue Harry from the Dursleys and helping him get Sirius free all because the potter family was good friends with the goblins and other 'dark creatures' as well as a evil dumbledore and good snape teaming up with Sirius.

*** As a far-leftie I respectfully disagree. Bad allyship can be performative allyship, and Harry's allyship to either Dobby and his struggles, or to the centaurs or goblins is hardly ever written as something else than Harry getting brownie points after saying he is friends with non-humans while seldomly reaching out to them or seeing what he can do for them without directly needing something.

For that matter I urge you to Google 'preformative allyship' in order to inform yourself, in order to recognise it, and actively play your part.
