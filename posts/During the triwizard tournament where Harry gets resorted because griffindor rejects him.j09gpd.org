  After the events down at the Chamber, Harry decides to become the master of his own destiny than to let others decide his fate. He learns of a different connection that he shares with Voldemort; and magic that will make him a more than equal to the Dark Lord.

  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, he is kicked out of Gryffindor Tower by those he thought of as friends. It isn't until Snape finds him that the truth comes out about The Boy Who Lived

  freaks sleep on the floor, freaks stay in cupboard, freaks don't get to have friends.' His Aunt and Uncle's words filled his head as sobs finally overtook his small frame. This is where he belonged, on the dusty floor all alone. He shouldn't be near other people; nobody wants to be near a freak.

  That night Harry cried himself to sleep as panic and sobs wreaked havoc on his too-small body. He paid no mind to the cold or the aches in bones. When he woke up the next morning he refused to move. This was his place now, and this is where he would stay.
