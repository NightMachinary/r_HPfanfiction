I loved Harry Potter hitwizard and the Harry Potter becomes a dark lord after accidentally getting sent to middle Earth. Anything like that would be appreciated.

E. Fucked up. He doesn't become a dark lord in the Shadow of angmar. I meant the one where he gets sent to the beginning of time after Dumbledore sees him locked up post voldy kill. He then continues to befriend Voldemort in his new timeline and becomes super powerful. The point is it's good


** Several examples I can think of fit this bill:

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) is somewhat similar to Nightmare Man, though arguably better written and a Harry who is a cackling maniac.

Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) and other works by VotN depict a much darker Harry than we see in most of canon, wiling to use utterly brutal methods to kill his enemies (ex. turning grass into iron and impaling the blades into death eaters).

There is also Traitorous by flamata where Harry joins the death eaters, though the fic is no longer available online.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

******* Ah, I missed the edit, but it still isn't nightmare man, unless OP is misremembering things.

1. In nightmare man, Harry was never shown to be locked up by Dumbledore after killing his Voldemort.

2. He never became super powerful after befriending Voldemort; he already was "super-powerful" long before, much more powerful than Voldy.

3. He wasn't sent to the beggining of time, he was sent to the early medieval ages... Or somewhere thereabouts. At most, 5,000 years.
