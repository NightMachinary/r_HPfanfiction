#+TITLE: Good disaster fics with the sort of preparation or overal world wide panic as in Invincible (BSG x-over). Apocalyptic and dystopian settings work as well, like Worthy of Magic. Crossovers are cool, as long as it isn't Naruto. Pref Harry centric, no slash for MC, rest is fine.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/117/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] seems to be heavily foreshadowing a Worthy of Magic style apocalypse, though it hasn't reached it yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] has Harry come back in time from a post-apocalyptic setting, its first chapter at least fits your request. I didn't like this one much though.

You think? I didn't get this feeling at all. What made you think that? Puts a complete different spin to it, to be honest.

Read and didn't like Circular Reasoning, thanks though.

The prophecy that James is obsessing over, the fact that muggles are gradually driven insane by proximity to Harry, and all the ominous Wild Magic stuff.

***** Hmmm interesting... To be fair, I don't remember the wording on the Potter's prophecy at all. All i remember is that its the end of (blank) if a Potter goes to Slytherin. That's it. I thought the reason muggles went insane near Harry was mostly because of the "assumed" horcrux. Which is weird because Jim is a parselmouth as well. Idk, he has so many plot points that I doubt we'll ever see the endgame.

** So lets see:

- linkffn(Incorruptible: A Dementor's Stigma) is the only zombie-apocalypse in the HP universe that you will find (or at least noteworthy ones). Pretty good, though a heavy emphasis on believable wizarding politics.
- linkffn(Sole Survivor) depicts Harry as a wizard surviving in a Mad Max style apocalyptic future.
- linkffn(Beyond the Curtain) is a more recent fic that deals with Harry and others fleeing to Europe post-Voldemort takeover and planning their return.

*** I think Sole survivor got the wrong link, cuz that one is a Hermione/Draco (unless it is what you linked after).

Hated Incorruptible, too much politics for my taste.

Been in love with Beyond the Curtain for a couple of months now, really enjoying it.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

This fic reads like a documentary of the events after Harry accidentally gets into a super bowl ad and exposes magic to muggles.

Amongst other things, the discovery that magic makes it possible to duplicate enriched uranium causes an incident significantly worse than the cuban missile crisis with nukes flying and getting portkeyed around to various cities by various countries and terrorist organizations.

It's a million word fic with a lot of things happening, including space exploration, multiple wars and advancements in genetics, the stuff in the summary is only a small sample of it all.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
