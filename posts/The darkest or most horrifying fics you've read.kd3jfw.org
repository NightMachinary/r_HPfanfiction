Id like any fic that absolutely destroyed you.

Not because of gore (though ill accept that) but fic that emotionally scarred you. Fics with characters slowly going insane or having to do horrific things that made you gape at the screen with how well written they were.

I want the darkest of the dark and the most well done trauma fics you can find. Fics that are just plain horrifying to read but so /so/ good. Those in the likeness (or better, or darker) than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return][Eternal Return]]

** 1) The Eyes by Shadenight123

Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash

Excerpt from the story:

Harry gripped his knees with the palm of his hands. "They are puppets," he whispered. "The old lady that stinks of oil and ricin is empty inside. The man who brought me here is not human. The man next to the door is a monster. They are all creatures. They devoured their innards. They aren't meant to be."

The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

GEN

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]

Worth reading it but fucked me up Good please give it a chance it's probably nothing like you've ever read before.

2) Remembrance Voldemort remembers. Set in the distant, indefinite future... Excerpt: "I do not know why I can't die. I have been stabbed and poisoned before, and lived beyond what any other witch or wizard did. Now I am waiting for death to take me, but it will not come..‚Äù

It's a oneshot that fucked me up the hollow words are aching to read.

********* They're pretty different, so I don't know. The Bright Sessions starts as therapy sessions for people with superpowers, like a woman who time travels when she has panic attacks or a girl who can read thoughts but can never turn it off. Eventually the real plot is revealed, though. Tanis is about a man who discovers the myth of ‚ÄúTanis‚Äù online and becomes wrapped up in this whole situation when he goes to investigate it. Tanis is really hard to explain, sometimes it seems more like a living entity, but sometimes it's more like a place.

** !linkao3(Casting Moonshadows)

Casting Moonshadows got less dark but the beginning has a lot of family trauma and abuse and things that made me very uncomfortable to read... Remus's dad is an abuser. Remus has a LOT of baggage. Sirius is also abused and goes through some tough stuff... I don't want to say to much because I'll spoil it.

It's really good! But I dunno, I the first half made me very sad.

***** hm sadly my reaction shall disappoint, as an avid reader of body horror and someone who had been to the darkest corners of AO3 this was not the darkest I've read and dint phase me. But it was still grisly and dark. I didnt even care about the horror of the plot, what got me was the Stockholm syndrome displayed in the work. it was well executed though.

** linkao3(17483099)

Truly the most disturbing fic I've read, not because of the violence but because of the slow shifting of lines between light / dark and the buildup of what Hermione is forced to do which comes to a crashing realization in chapter 22. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a fic like this one, I /literally/ started dry heaving

  Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.

** Not exactly like the eyes but these stories have a very atmospheric tone to them that is both horrifying but also interesting: ‚ô•Ô∏è1) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls ¬ª The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1508866/#google_vignette]]

‚ô•Ô∏è2) Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way. Excerpt:

"Did you come down here to try and stop me from getting the Stone?" Quirrell demanded.

"No. Don't worry; we won't insult the clich√© of hero versus villain by ignoring your offers of power, glory and material wealth," said Potter as they approached. "So... please, begin tempting us."

3) Leviathan Rising Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/952100/1/Leviathan-Rising]]

‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è4) Blood Crest ¬ª Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings. HORRIFYING BUT AMAAAAAAZING STORY!!!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest]]

‚ô•Ô∏è5) Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails Oceanbreeze7 Summary: Are you a witch or Are you a fairy? Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary? ‚ÄúThe fairies will do wicked things sometimes,‚Äù Harry murmured gently, ‚ÄúSteal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the milk crocks.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo they ever steal anything more?‚Äù Luna asked him rhetorically. Harry couldn't answer.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896]]

6)Veeeeery dark fem Tom Riddle male Harry psychologically disturbing but very well written story WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è Has NONCON at the very end chapter Tamsin Riddle is a dark as shit character

Datura Katsitting (Nekositting)

Summary: ‚ÄúAre you afraid of me, Harry?‚Äù His mouth opened, but no words came. His mind blanked, his cheeks draining completely of whatever color had stained them in response to the curious note of Riddle's voice. It sounded innocuous enough. Harmless with how casual she'd asked the question, but Harry knew better.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13800042/chapters/31727376?view_adult=true]]

7) Evil Be Thou My Good Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]]

8) Luna Lovegood and the City of Ink ¬ª Luna has a horrifying discovery in the halls of Hogwarts Harry Potter, T, English, Horror & Supernatural

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12618909/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-City-of-Ink]]

9)Don't let the title fool you....

Welcome to Hufflepuff! by The Sinister Man Harry Potter u:12-26-2014 - It's 1991, and eight newly Sorted wizards and witches are about to start their first night in House Hufflepuff. There'll be singing and camaraderie and macaroons and only a little bit of screaming.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10921110/1/]]

10) Dark as shit well written story warning slash

Is love wanting to eat you? Baryshnikov

Summary: Tom didn't understand love, but he was drowning it and it was all Harry's fault.
