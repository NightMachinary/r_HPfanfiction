Well written is a must; bashing kept to a minimum if it exists at all would be preferable. Other than that, go nuts. If there's a way I can look this stuff up on my own, please let me know that too. Thank y'all in advance!

**** Oddly enough, I don't think of Lilly as an example of fem!Harry. Her personality and nature are so different from every other version of Harry (any gender) that I've ever read, plus she's in numerous spinoffs, so I tend to think of her as a unique character.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/][When Harry Met Tom]] is the other fem!Harry fic by The Carnivorous Muffin. It hews a little closer to canon but is still one of the more unique and well written fem!Harrys I've seen. linkao3(15676317)

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** Seconding the recs for Victoria P and A Long Journey Home. Best of the best material.

So I use my favourites list as both a fave list and a follow list. Here the one's currenly on it with Fem!Harry.

Fics that will probably stand the test of time (and not get removed when I get around to removing dead fics from my favourites) :

- Tales of Three: Iris throws a knife at Dumbledore when he shows up to tell her about Hogwarts. linkffn(12953614)

- To Rekindle the Flame: A Fem!Harry take on the Shadow of Angmar. Sadly, only two chapters. linkffn(13234212)

- Hermione Granger's Guide to Gender Flip Fanfiction: A metafic that talks about the tropes involved in genderflipping in the fandom. linkffn(11511190)

Others:

- The Never Ending Road: This one hasn't updated for a while and I don't actually rememeber how good it was. Has a sequel. linkffn(8615605)

- The Pureblood Pretense linkffn(7613196) : First in a series. Alanna the Lioness crossover, where Fem!Harry is pretending to be her boy cousin. If you can ignore the conceit (which has worn out by now), it has some interesting elements that make it worth a read. Currently on the Futile Facade linkffn(11911497)

- Certain Dark Things : Voldemort's horcruxes have come alive and are running around making a mess of things. It comes laden with fanfic tropes, so YMMV. This one's worth a gander at, if only because the children feel like they are children and the adults feel like they are adults. linkffn(13135713)

  A fire burns deep within Iris Potter, and such things must be tempered --- even if it's with Albus Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. After a disastrous end to a school year, the two find themselves tangling with old enemies, eldritch magic, time travel, and that which should have perhaps been left well alone. Morally gray fem!Harry, mentor!Dumbledore.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Swords and Sorcery]] is a Fate/stay night crossover, with Emiya Shirou crossing dimensions and being de-aged and eventually taking a caretaker role in regards to not!Harry. Lots of Fate elements pop up, if that matters, but most are woven in with HP canon stuff.

More relevant, main character is Iris Potter. The author has spent a lot of time on figuring out what should be different between Harry and Iris in terms of upbringing and societal expectations, and the fic is just generally really nice to read. Very slice of life for most of the time, with the occasional burst of drama and/or action. There is also a very prolific readership with quite a lot of omakes, ranging from 'Iris has been dimentionally displaced to generic Isekai world' to 'Hermione is Darth Vader now' and a few recent ones have Iris time-traveling to WW2 to meet her grandfather, who is part of a magical task-force that protects the Queen, plus added Great Holy Grail War in WW2 because why not.

It should be at about the end of year 2 now.

Really loved it, though sadly there is a bit of bashing, it was really unique. Also it and it's sequel are 2 of the best one piece crossovers there are in my opinion

  The Emerald Rose, once a girl being manipulated by traitors, now a woman married to a powerful Shichibukai and surrounded by a Family that protects their own. Safe and sound, happy and loved while loving in return, she didn't expected the traitors to dare call her back to them. Fem!Harry. Rated M to be safe! Picture not mine.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
