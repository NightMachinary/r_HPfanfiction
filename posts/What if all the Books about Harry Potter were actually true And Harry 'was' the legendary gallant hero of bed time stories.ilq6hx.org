Hey there!

I had this little crackish idea that wouldn't leave me. Sadly, I don't have time to write it myself but I thought that maybe some of you boys and girls would be interested in this.

Like said in the title, a What if, about all the amazing and quite outlandish stories about Harry Potter being actually true. Making him the incredible wizard that parents tell bed stories about. Of course all those adventures when he was only two or three years old is too ridiculous even for this idea, so a little spin is in order. Something like him having Dumbledore as mentor, or Harry arriving to Hogwarts at a later year, allowing him to perform those incredible feats.

You can even redeem Lockhart and actually make him into a real good wizard and not a fraud, so that in one of his books, he actually worked along with Harry Potter himself :)

Harry's character is of course up to you.

Tell me what yoy think about it, as I would love to read something like this.


** ''Harry'' potter did acomplish amazing things Henry marcus potter, known as his friends as Harry Father of fleamont henry potter grand father of James fleamont potter Great grand father of Harry James potter

basically my idea, is people are bringing up old stories about what harry's great grandpa did and saying he did them

** Well - if you really want a Harry who's unrealistically good at everything, there's linkffn(Harry Crow). But I found the characters very flat, with Harry stepping on them all because they're either doormat friends or caricatures of enemies.
