This fic has been stuck in my head and I can't figure out what it is. All I remember is that I think Hedwig got killed during Harry's trial (incredibly vague, I'm sorry) and I think it happened in a very brutal way, such as pulling her head off, because the scene stuck with me for several years.


** It was some Azkaban fic I think.

  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?
