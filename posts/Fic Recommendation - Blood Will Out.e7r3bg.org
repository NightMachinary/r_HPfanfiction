Blood Will Out by frnklymrshnkly

Rating: Teen And Up Audiences\\
Relationship(s): Marietta Edgecombe/Pansy Parkinson\\
Words: 21561

Marietta Edgecombe is determined to see her Ministry career though the same way her mother did, hard work, low fuss and a steady climb up the social and career ladder. However, being convicted of complicity and being forced to attend mandatory the Voices Heard programme is throwing a wrench in her well-oiled plans. She is also dealing with some seriously nasty period cramps. Needless to say, her day is not going well.
