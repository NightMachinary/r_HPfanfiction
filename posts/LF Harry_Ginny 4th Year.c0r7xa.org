I'd like a fanfiction where they get together at the beginning of fourth year or end of third/second


** Why? They never had anything in common except Ron.

Never really understood the attraction to the pairing of those two.

*** I agree that Ginny should have had more screen time. But saying nothing in common is a bit much. They shared interests in the books and Ginny, whenever she did show up, listened to Harry's troubles without disparaging him.

Rowling wasn't good at developing relationships, but I think Harry & Ginny are possibly the healthiest couple in the series. It's healthier than Ron/Hermione who both would be at fault. It's healthier than Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, where one runs roughshod over the other.

*** Honestly that was JK Rowlings fault. Ginny should have interacted with Harry in third year and could have turned the trio into a squad of 4 but nope
