** In /What's a Little Death between friends?/ Harry is ridiculously overpowered, to the point of being able to duel Voldemort to a standstill. It also contains the whole Lord Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin trope, which I didn't mind but you might so fair warning. On the other hand, the writing is very good and the story reads easily so I recommend it. linkffn(12101842)

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

A bit heavier on both the power and the romance, but extremely well done on both. Warning, it is rather dark so if you don't like that then be warned. If you don't mind a darker story, then enjoy my friend it is incredible!
