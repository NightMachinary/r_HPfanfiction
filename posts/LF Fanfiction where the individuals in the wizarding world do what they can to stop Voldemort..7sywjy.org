An example of this would be the guards of Azkaban killing all of Voldemorts followers when they see that it is Voldemort attacking. They know they can't stand up to Voldemort and they can't escape so they kill all his followers. Stories like this where random witches and wizards who are not the main character make choices that help hinder Voldemort.


** Well, it was mentioned in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheNightmaresOfFuturesPast][Nightmares of Futures Past]] that Mad-Eye Moody led a last stand to protect Azkaban from Voldemort, killing all the Death Eaters they had imprisoned rather than allow them to join Voldemort's forces.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linffn(The Return of the Marauders) - Shit happens in Diagon alley and the population helps.

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW) - That's actually a big spoiler, but lets just say that a boatload of citizens help Harry and gang invade/attack somewhere, after they rescued said citizens.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
