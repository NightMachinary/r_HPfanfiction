He had no friends at the time, no one knows anything about him. How do you think rest of the school looks at him?

Sorry typo. its SNAKE not Snape.


** I know this is probably a typo, but now I kinda wanna see a story where Severus Snape's parents lived up until 1981-ish, and after a big knock-down argument, a thoroughly drunk Tobias storms out and gets hit by a car on Privet Drive the night Harry is left on the Dursley-doorstep and then haunts him for the rest of his life. Be a really interesting Harry w/Mentor Snape teaching fic. I think they call it Severitus?
