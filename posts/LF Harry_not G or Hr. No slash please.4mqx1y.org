I've been reading WAY too much fanfiction lately and while I am a HUGE Ginny fan in Cannon, I like seeing Harry paired with someone unusual.

Also it always weirds me out to read H/Hr! I just feel like she's too much of a sister/motherly type for him to date. In my opinion at least. I can see why other people would like her with him but it gives me the heebee jeebees lol.

I love Harry/Daphne just because I find the whole dynamic of him dating a Slytherin interesting. Its so different than cannon and that really appeals to me.

So really I'm just looking for something unexpected.

(If your suggestions have a few good lemons that's ok too) ;)


** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is Harry/Well written OC after Ginny dies.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

****** I can understand someone may immediately put the story down because of the "Angry Harry" parts. However, personally I would recommend just skipping the instances where he rants and stuff if you really don't like it. (Especially the one in the first or second chapter in the Great Hall.) They're not really that common because the story gets less and less angsty by somewhere around the 3rd-4th chapter. Get past that, and you've got my favorite HP fanfictions of all time.
