Description of the fic is below, but I marked it as a Spoiler, just in case. I really enjoyed the story and would love to read others where Harry is at other schools of magic. Don't really care if there is a romance or not. Also don't care if Harry goes dark or not. It just needs to be good haha

SPOILER: Harry Potter has a twin who is the BHL. Harry ends up going to Durmstrang and learns a lot of Dark Magic. He is friends with Victor Krum. The story ends at the Yule Ball.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.
