Assuming HP is actually immune to the killing curse, what if there are other people out there on whom the curse just doesn't work?

Most people don't even discover this fact about themselves because they never get hit with it. And the people that do survive it, shrug it off.

Maybe it was some other green curse.

Maybe the attacker didn't perform it properly.

Maybe it didn't hit me and so on.

Even if they're sure they were hit with it, very few people would try and replicate the feat.

Harry Potter was just a baby with basically no other magic performed in that particular room in the moments before the attack so it was easy to find traces of the killing curse and deduce that he was hit with it but somehow survived it.

What do you think?


** Wait, a universe in which TWO mothers love their children? Seems like a pretty big coincidence.

** So I'm writing this with canon in mind because of the discussion tag though it seems like it could be a prompt.

Harry's immunity came from his mother's sacrifice. It isn't a naturally occurring thing nor is it something that can be replicated. The magic came from ancient magic that stems from love, which JKR has said is deeply unscientific in that it cannot be replicated, predicted, or created intentionally.

  except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life

  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific

Which is why there has only been one survivor of the killing curse.

  “Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me.”

*** We don't know that Harry's immunity came from his mother's sacrifice. That is just a theory that Dumbledore has. I mean, a mother sacrificing herself for her child? That surely happened at some time in the past, right?

**** Sorry, I should have clarified that the quotes were from JKR. And yes, Dumbledore did say something along those lines in the books as well. JKR has also stated Dumbledore is the medium by which JKR conveys world building information. And of course, there has only been one survivor of the killing curse. And the sacrificial magic is not consistent nor can it be replicated as evidenced by the earlier quotes.

** It wasn't that Lily was willing to die for her child, the magical protection started when Voldemort gave her the choice. If Lily had leaped in front of a killing curse, Voldemort could have killed Harry with ease. Voldemort asked Lily to move and she begged him not to kill her son and asked him to kill her instead. That's what started the sacrificial protection.

It's not that Lily was the only parent willing to die for her child, it was that:

1) Killing Harry was the primary objective

2) Voldemort didn't want to kill Lily

** I personally subscribe to the idea that it was a 'Perfect Storm' scenario that allowed for Harry to survive being struck with the Killing Curse on Hallowe'en Night, 1981. Where there were enough individual factors playing into his survival to make it nigh unreplicatable.
