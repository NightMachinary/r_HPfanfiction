I see these characters all the time Fanfiction and at this point some Fanon versions of them are pretty much commonly accepted. Daphne Greengrass - Ice Queen, need I say more. But now that I'm actually trying to write my own story with some of those characters, what do we actually know about the slytherins besides Malfoy from the books, movies and all other interviews articles and QnA's?


** Honestly, there isn't a lot of characterization given to the tertiary Slytherins besides Malfoy and his direct cronies. I know that

Theodore Nott has family in the death eaters. Whether or not its his father, or some other relative I don't know. I know nothing about his character, however.

Blaise Zabini's mother is hinted at being a black widow, with multiple marriages to her ending with her being widowed, but all we know about Blaise himself is that he's dark skinned, pretty, and Slughorn had marked him as someone who would grow up to be important. I know he took the place of Crabbe or Goyle in final film due to Crabbe or Goyle's actor getting into legal trouble.

That's all I could pull from my brain that was directly from the books about the Slytherins from Harry's year group. The only other Slytherins really get any "screen time" in the film or books were the quidditch team, but beyond "unscrupulous and rough" we aren't really given much on them.

*** Zabini is also more like your typical Slytherin - he calls Ginny a blood-traitor, I believe.

*** Nott's father is a Death Eater who was caught at the Ministry. That's in HBP. It's why he doesn't get invited to the Slug Club.

**** It was mentioned, at the very least, in the American English version of Half-Blood Prince. He was played by a guy of African descent in the film, but if I had to hazard a guess from his name, he's more likely of a swarthy Mediterranean Italian complexion, so darker skinned than your average Englishman, but paler skin than your average African.

** Tracey Davis and Millicent Bulstrode are half-bloods.

Theodore Nott is seen as an equal by Malfoy and the two are at least acquaintances. JKR tries to fit a conversation between the two in two different books, GoF being one. Nott's father was a Death Eater who went to school with Voldemort and his grandfather/great-grand created the Sacred 28.

Bulstrode, Parkinson, Flint, Crabbe, and Greengrass are Sacred 28 names.

Flint was held back a year (JKR continuity error).

Crabbe, Goyle, Warrington, Montague, Bulstrode, and Parkinson were on Inquisitorial Squad.

Blaise's mother is an implied wealthy black widow.

** Blaise either believes in pure blood ideology or he acts like he does, because he dismisses the notion of being romantically linked with Ginny on those grounds. The same episode also has, iirc, Pansy suggesting Blaise has exacting standards about what he considers attractive in women but thinks Ginny meets them.

Either way, that first point makes a lot of fics which present Blaise as a kind of :only sane man" in Slytherin OOC. From what we can tell, he's either insane in the same way or is a complete jellyfish that acts like he's equally mad.

And that's in addition to the other things everyone else has said.

Honestly, Blaise is the only side Slytherin character we have any information about, unless you're willing to look at the Cursed Child, where it seems Theodore Nott is a better inventor than he is duellist, but regardless is willing to do very dodgy things for Lucius Malfoy (presumably for money, but it could be ideological). Although, I suppose, we could say Pansy is legitimately into Draco, but that's probably not useful in terms of characterisation. (Nott's qualities as a duellist depend on how good you think 40 year old Harry is at duelling, since Nott cuts his, iirc, cheek.)

I'm sorry, what? "A complete jellyfish"? WTF does that mean?

** Here's a 2004 quote titled Malfoy & Nott from JKR:s old website (unfortunately it seems she never published the actual chapter anywhere):

"I liked this scene so much I tried to use it twice; unfortunately, it didn't work in either place so I finally laid it to rest in one of the cardboard boxes where I keep all my old drafts, notes, electricity bills and chewing gum wrappers.

As in the case of Dean Thomas, I know much more about Theodore Nott than has ever appeared in the books. Raised by a very elderly widower and Death Eater father, Theodore is a clever loner who does not feel the need to join gangs, including Malfoy's.

However, in this scene Theodore's father (the same Nott who was badly injured in the closing chapters of 'Order of the Phoenix') goes to visit Lucius Malfoy to discuss Voldemort-related business and we see Draco and Theodore alone in the garden having a talk of their own. I really liked the scene, firstly because it showed the Malfoys' home, and the difference between the place where Draco has grown up and number four, Privet Drive; then because we rarely see Draco talking to anybody he considers a real equal, and he is forced to see Theodore as such, because Theodore is just as pure-blooded as he is, and somewhat cleverer. Together these two Death Eaters' sons discuss Dumbledore's regime at Hogwarts and Harry Potter, with all sorts of stories that the Death Eaters tell about how this baby boy survived the Dark Lord's attack."
