In case you don't follow the fic. Or haven't read it yet. I'd suggest that you try it out!

*** No problem! But mostly I was talking about the people who don't have an account it have read the fic before. I used to bookmark my fav fics until they became so numerous that I had to open an account.

*** That's hard to say. From my own experience, I started reading this before Game of Thrones so I wasn't too lost. This story actually got me into that series TBH. So you shouldn't be too lost, though I suggest that you read the story carefully and it would be a bad idea to skip over scenes.
