** AGAINST.

The Unforgivable Curses are distinguished by the necessary intent required to cast them.

Regulation should be based on potential for abuse, not abnormal properties of a small set of tools.

The Unforgivable Curses should be regulated, there's no doubt against that. In fact, they're quite convenient legally, because merely casting them is an irrefutable confession of the intent to harm.

Spells are tools. Some are more dangerous than others. You can kill someone with a knife just like you can with a severing charm. However, some of these tools are either exceptionally risky and dangerous (human Transfiguration), or specifically designed to harm (a whole lot of curses), or both (Memory Charms).

The first category is the least problematic. Difficult and dangerous magic is more likely to harm the caster than anyone else. It could be compared to workshop machinery -- as long as there are warnings and disclaimers where it is accessed (in this case, spellbooks and in the classroom), it doesn't need regulation. The few cases where others can be harmed by accident, such as with esoteric Transfiguration or spellcrafting, a simple exam and permit system would suffice to discourage amateur activity.

The second category, spells specifically designed to harm others, definitely needs to be regulated. Like guns, the only reason to have access to them is defending oneself from others. Unlike guns, however, there's no visible deterrent gained from having access to these spells, so using them in self-defense is sketchy when safer things (shields, Apparating) would suffice. Additionally, you can't confiscate or deny access to these spells after they have been learnt. Access to books and tutoring for these spells should be restricted to those who can be expected to need it (Aurors, cursebreakers, Hit Wizards, teachers etc). The average Joe doesn't need to know curses; the Stunning Hex suffices in the majority of circumstances.

Memory Charms deserve a special mention, because they're in the awkward position of being very risky, having a staggering potential for harm, yet still being critical to the operation of Wizarding society. They can leave a person effectively brain-dead either by accident or on purpose, can cover up crimes, or force people to commit crimes. Use of and instruction for Memory Charms should be restricted to the government's Statute-of-Secrecy-keeping forces, and /possibly/ registered Occlumency instructors.

It should be said that regulation of magics, like regulation of weapons, is not a replacement for standard legislation of crime. Just because dedicated torture spells (like the Cruciatus) is illegal doesn't mean torture shouldn't be illegal, and vice versa.

Why can't we get away with not regulating specific spells? If I shoot a Cruciatus Curse at a rock in the forest, am I doing anything wrong? I have a bunch of hatred built up inside of me, but there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that, and the rock can't feel pain either. It's torture that we find repugnant, so that's what should be illegal. Or if Magical Britain allows for assisted suicide, wouldn't the Killing Curse be the most humane method? Then it would have to be murder that was illegal, not the use of the Killing Curse itself.

**** Where it is practical, spell /can/ be grouped on function or other properties with regards to legislation; indeed I'd call it necessary for such policies to be feasible. I wasn't clear enough; by 'regulation of spells' I was referring to the regulation of the learning materials for and the casting of dangerous magic /as opposed to/ the making illegal of murder, manslaughter. I'll try to clarify in the original post. Sorry!

The Cruciatus was an example, and would probably fall under the umbrella of 'torture spells' (spells specifically designed for or having no use outside torture).

The Unforgivables happen to be a special case because you /can't/ cast them without intending that particular casting to have an effect. You can't cast the Cruciatus at a rock in a forest unless you legitimately /want/ to cause what you're aiming at pain, for its own sake. It would be supremely difficult to find someone with sufficient misanthropy to cast the Killing Curse at strangers (Voldemort's the only one who managed that that I can think of), yet still feasibly employ them for assisted suicide. That's a different argument, though.

** AGAINST (but probably not in the way you think):

The regulation of magics in Britain is currently inefficient and ineffective. Individual spells are near impossible for the Ministry to regulate. Indeed, Priori Incantatem only reveals the single previous spell cast from a given wand which is easily removed by casting another basic spell, and the Ministry has no way of tracking which spells are cast when without expanding the Trace into some sort of country-wide mass surveillance network, which may not even be possible. In this current situation, criminals can effectively get away with crimes unless there is other, better evidence for the illegal use of the banned magic such as multiple eyewitnesses (which no competent criminal would be foolish enough to allow).

In addition, the regulation of individual spells leaves the Ministry behind the times when it comes to applying the laws to intelligent, ground-breaking criminals who are capable of inventing new magic. Consider the case of the Cruciatus Curse. The Cruciatus is illegal (and gives the caster a life sentence in Azkaban), but torture itself is not. A new, and possibly more effective, torture curse may not actually be illegal because, as far as we know, torture is not actually illegal in Britain. This method of blacklisting spells leads to an ineffective form of law enforcement and hamstrings the judiciary's ability to serve justice to criminals.

A more effective method of regulating magic is to regulate the consequences. For example, the Imperius Curse is a versatile, powerful compulsion curse. However, it is not the only form of magical compulsion. Other spells and potions, such as love potions, do exist that can convince the victim to act in ways the otherwise would not, and basic spells such as the Confundus Charm can be deadly when applied properly. Even in canon we see new ways invented to do this (Fred and George's line of love potions). For the Ministry to keep up with this, they have to regulate improper compulsion rather than specific forms of compulsion. For example, a mass ban on the compulsion of love (or love-like behavior) would be considerably more effective than banning specific spells and potions. And a broad punishment for the use of torture would prevent creative criminals from avoiding Azkaban.

Under this more robust legal system, the Ministry would be able to keep up with advances in magic because they would only have to add new rules as new classes of magic became an issue rather than creating a law for every single spell and constantly playing catch up. Instead of providing life sentences for the three unforgivables, it would make more sense to punish murder, compulsion, and torture and all the other criminal acts that are possible with magic.

Side note:

This would also have the added benefit of making integration between muggle and magical societies much easier. Laws such as murder is illegal are equally applicable in both worlds.

*** Should not both the tool and the act be part of law?

'Regulated' does not necessarily mean 'illegal'. Murder being illegal does not mean that access to the best tools for that job, especially ones that don't have many other uses, should be restricted just like Muggle firearms are restricted in certain countries.

How does banning criminal acts substitute for regulating dangerous magic, especially the kinds that can cause bad accidents?

**** No, we're not gonna refuse to regulate dangerous magic. We're gonna refuse to directly regulate specific spells. For example, if your workplace has many flammable substances, you can ban Fiendfyre, Incendio, etc., but it would be way more effective to just create a punishment for creating fires (through magic specifically) in the workspace, and voila, OSHA is happy and any idiot who comes up with a new fire curse is still gonna face charges. Given what we know about Magical Britain, however, they're way more likely to create a laundry list of spells you're not allowed to use. Actually they're way more likely not to have workplace protections, but that's a whole 'nother debate.

***** Good points. It's more effective to legislate based on effects than methods in most cases.

What do you think of magic that has /no/ benign purpose (the Darker torture spells; the Unforgivables)? Should they be banned specifically, or just let them fall under the umbrella of other crimes? On a related point, are all crimes with the same result (murder by Severing Charm versus AK) equal, or should they have different punishments?

****** No, I don't think even magic that has no benign purpose (that we can think of at least - AK for assisted suicide for example) should be legislated against. Even assuming "dark" magic is fundamentally different in some way, how on earth are you even supposed to track it? Besides, it's definitely possible to come up with scenarios where using dark magic is the only way to protect oneself. Regulating the spells directly means you need to write in exceptions for each spell. Letting it fall under the umbrella of other crimes vastly simplifies the process.

Regarding the related point, yeah, if you kill someone, then they're dead. It doesn't matter if you chopped their head off or if you really, really hated them and shot an AK at them. Either way, you meant to kill them, and you did. You should be punished for /that/, not for your ability to use obscure curses to shorten your term in Azkaban.

******* Regulation of magic is not necessarily a ban on casting certain spells; it can take the form of restricting access to dangerous materials (keeping things in a 'Restricted Section' of libraries or something similar), or licencing systems to restrict categories of magic to those who need them. Additionally, it's not necessary to track all casting of a certain type to feasibly prohibit it; just like the Muggle world, crimes should be investigated and prosecution should be based on evidence. It's not universal or perfect, but it's a strong deterrent if the investigators are capable.

I agree with the second point, as long as the conventional distinctions between murder and manslaughter etc. still apply.

***** Just like owning and using heavy machinery is not outright illegal, learning and using most dangerous magic shouldn't be outright illegal. A competent licence system, like Apparation licensing, is much, much better than a blanket ban. Retroactive licencing is also feasible.
