** I started evaluating independent books the way I would be reviewing simple fanfiction. So I don't care any more how famous the writer is, how much of a bestseller the book itself is or how many awards it has received --- if it is poorly written, I just say that it's poorly written instead of unconsciously trying to still glorify it for some merit or another just to not seem to be not understanding “what the author wanted to say”.

This affects my perception of films also --- sometimes I stumble upon a film with top ratings that would've sucked in comparison to really good examples of fanfiction (plotwise and tropwise), and all I can manage to think is “that's it?”, “this is what all the fuss was about?”.

** I really hate cliched worldbuilding -- Sanderson is good for me because he works new concepts in all the damn time, I didn't like Jordan because nothing felt new -- so if I don't want to spend the time learning a whole new magic system or mythological background, I'll read fanfiction. It saves time and lets the plot move faster. I read about ten times as much fanfiction as paper-and-ink fantasy these days.

*** Fanfiction is easily consumable. It's pretty much junk food! I'll read bad fanfiction, but carefully vet my book purchases.

**** I don't read bad fanfiction that often. There's enough good fanfiction that I don't feel like I have an excuse not to be reading the good stuff. Then again, some of my personal preferences in fanfiction don't jive well with the "Community's" view. I like HPMoR a fucking ton, for example, and I haven't seen anybody speak positively of it on this sub.

At the same time, I'll literally go to Barnes and Noble and grab books off the shelves with my eyes closed. Maybe I'm just backwards.

***** HPMOR is a self-insert author tract and that is pretty much the entire point behind it. Since I do not agree with the author's world view, the Harry in this story (and many other characters in it) are to me absolute sociopaths and the story is as unpalatable for me as a Darth Marrs fic.

But if you like it, good for you.

****** HPMOR is the first fanfiction that I was willing to read (being assured Snape wouldn't be diddling Draco, etc.). All the rest followed.

****** What about the characters in HPMoR seems 'sociopathic' to you, to the extent that you'll decline to read /that/ story but not others?

Same question about the author. He seems to me like a man with grandiose and unlikely goals, but an ultimately well meaning one, putting aside his personal character.

And I strongly question your objection that 'HPMOR is a self-insert author tract', since most of fanfiction follows that line.

******* Author tract is what the author calls it himself in several places. Nothing wrong with that per sé, but it does explain why the fic is what it is.

I absolutely do not wish to imply that I feel Less Wrong is sociopathic, let's be clear. I just have serious issues with a world where people like his version of Harry Potter exist.

Sociopaths are unable to respond to emotions and hardly show them. As it is popularly portrayed, it can be seen as a subset of autism. From what I read of HPMOR, up to almost chapter 100, /most/ of his characters have this trait and their decisions are purely based on what he considers to be logic, without any concern for what I feel is common morality.

I read a lot of fics and will not read a lot of others. I simply do not care enough for HPMOR to continue reading it. Perhaps once it is complete I will read through it again.

I know a lot of people adore the fic and subscribe to its values. A lot of people also love reading fics where Harry gets m-preg with Snape's child. I don't care for /those/ fics either.

** I started reading fanfiction at a young age and was very naive and sheltered. I remember the first time I stumbled on slash. I was so shocked! I had to close it immediately and felt ill. It was foreign to me-guys like girls and girls like guys. That's the way it works, right?

I wonder how I would have reacted to friends coming out as gay if I hadn't read slash at some point. Probably poorly. It's weird to think about. So, thanks fanfiction?

*** I think that's indicative of the Harry Potter fandom in general. It's a very accepting community.

But totally agree with you, fanfiction was the first place where I was really exposed to anything LGBTQ. At first I was horrified (starting reading fanfiction when I was 10, religious background), but it was so accepted in the culture that it just became normalized. So it made me think critically...that what I had grown up with was just completely wrong.

** Reading fanfic helped me get confident enough to begin writing again (I hadn't done so in over a decade, basically not since high school).\\
The recognition has been great, but I also really like having a creative outlet again.

** It's made me more sympathetic. I've read all sorts, gone through so many scenarios, seen so many consequences play out, that when crap happens in real life I'm /slightly/ better prepared for it. Actual tangible books hadn't really done the same (with the exception of a few choice series, like HP), and I think a big part of the reason is that it's a place and people you already know. Things you're already attached to. It's like having an imaginary argument with someone in your shower.

It also drastically reduced (or was a contributing factor in reducing) my gross-out level for age difference relationships. Growing up, I didn't know of any differences greater than three years. My entire family was within that range, adults tend to not reveal their ages (back when I used to think of twenty year olds as adults... Lol). But my #2 OTP features a large age difference. I've even shrugged off age differences in my own life as being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

As a whole I don't think it was fan fics that did it, but the repeated exposure to ideas and situations with these characters and this universe. Made me think about things early on, before they became an actual concern in real life.

** I've been reading fanfiction since I was about 12 or so, and I've been reading it almost every day since. Fanfiction is an escape for me, because none of my real life issues can possibly relate to a world of magic. After a bad day there's nothing better than coming home and reading fanfics :)

** It's very empowering, I think. Fanfiction can sometimes have a very bad rep (looking at you "Fifty Shades of Gray"), and while it's definitely true to think there are some horrible stories out there, there are some REALLY good ones. I just finished what exists of the Alexandra Quick series, and it's like a whole different level of awesome...and the people who write fanfiction (I talk to a lot of them, even on here) are just normal people. So it's very empowering to think, "If I can do this, I can do anything." Plus, I have friends who majored in Creative Writing and want to be the next Great American Writer...and I've written 10x more than they have as a casual HP fanfiction writer because I just do it for fun. And I enjoy it so very much. It's my sanctuary. I'm a graduate student and I work very hard, so sometimes it's just nice to escape for just an hour or two a day.

** It's made me much more cynical I think. I see cliches and tropes in every form of media, and am constantly looking for the evil manipulative motivation in every move, searching for the overarching plot even when there is not one. On the one hand, not every motive is evil (morally or legally wrong), but on the other, I see that there is a lot of manipulative bullshit, and I often see through it. Unfortunately I "see through it" only slightly more often than I see something where there is nothing lol
