In canon purebloods seem to be pretty similar culturally but wouldn't the it be more interesting if they actually had different groups within the wizarding community of Britain? First the Roman wizards who came over and set up shop long ago. Then the Anglo Saxon wizards who sailed over from Germany. Then the Norse wizards who came with the Vikings. And of course we should include the French wizards who came over during the Norman invasion. Instead of just one group they would be very divided and feuding.


** I doubt, even with wizard lifespans, that these would still be active and relevant overall but I could see where specific families can trace their lines back to those groups, and perhaps that some of the blood-traitor vs pureblood vs Sacred 28 type distinctions have roots in those old feuds.

I could certainly see Celtic and Anglo-Saxon magic users being more "whatever works" about blood purity while Romans and Normans looked down on the conquered lands and considered the existing magic users barely better than the muggles.

*** Yes that's more what I meant. The idea that cultural backgrounds contribute to what a family's values are.

** Perhaps not fueding because it's been a long time. But maybe families with signature spells and crafts passed down the generations from their background, and other little details like that.

There could be remnants of fueds. Like how it's not uncommon for an English person to claim to "hate the French" but not really mean it. It being brought up during football matches against the French etc. Just little things like that perhaps but translated from muggle to magical

** Why? It's not true of the rest of the population?

*** You make a good point, but I'd argue that, unlike muggles, magical societies have the potential to be more fractured because they have ways of hiding their enclaves away (space warping magic, wards such as the Fidelius or unplottable charms to completely hide their existence from outsiders, etc.) Additionally, Wizards seem to travel primarily via teleportation (floo, apparition, portkey), so the concept of national boundaries demarcated by physical proximity needn't apply.

Of course there's no hint of that being the case in canon, but I've seen some interesting fanfics that touch on the idea.

** The magical population is too small. Just like no wizard is truly pure-blood, no wizard can trace their ancestry to just one of these sources.

** Alexandra Quick has a similar concept in America, in addition to blood status, and I think it makes more sense there.
