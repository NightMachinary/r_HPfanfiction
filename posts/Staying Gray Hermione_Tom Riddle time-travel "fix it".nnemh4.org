:END:
I can't find this story anywhere, so I feel like I must have gotten the name wrong. It was a very long Hermione/Tom Riddle fic where she went back in time to try and keep him from turning evil, and fell in love with him instead. I think they get married and Hermione has big struggles with how evil he still is, even though he loves her. One of the plot points is that he still makes the diary, and also wants Hermione and their children to make horcruxes.

I thought it was called "Staying Gray".
