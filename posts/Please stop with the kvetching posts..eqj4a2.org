I keep seeing these posts that are just “I don't like X” where X is whatever, some trope, some pairing, some characterization... What is the point of these posts? It's should be taken as a given that since this is fanfiction, any individual reader won't like most of it, and will absolutely love some small subset of it. The story one reader hates is the same story some other reader loves. The existence of stories you hate does you absolutely no harm, and brings joy to other readers with different tastes. Let's fill this group with links to the stories we like, not gripes about the stories we hate.


** It's validation, basically. They're explicitly saying 'I don't like X', but there's an underlying 'I'm not weird for that, am I?' addendum to it that people don't really write. They say "I hate X stories because they're blah blah blah" in hopes of getting someone else to go "Yeah, you're right!" and thus feeling better or at least less-bad about their opinion.

Of course, sometimes those rants are just catharsis. It feels nice to yell and scream sometimes when you're feeling frustrated or angry. And just writing it in a word document and only reading it yourself doesn't always help, screaming into the void and all that.

The fact that those hated stories exist does no harm, but the presence of other people that also hate those stories or people reading and validating those expressed feelings can do them some good.

I agree that finding community through positivity is better, but every little helps, right?

*** Of course people discuss their preferences, like, “I like X, please recommend some stories with more X” or “Here's a great example of X for readers who enjoy that sort of thing.” Those posts can actually start a discussion. But what sort of discussion do people think they're starting with “I don't like X”? Do they think writers are going to be like, “Thanks for letting me know, I'll stop writing X. Heaven forbid there be something on the internet you don't like”?

Judging by what I've seen, those people usually don't consider the writers at all when making that kind of post. There's little to no empathy involved. Instead, they anticipate the typical pleasant feeling of having their own opinions echoed back to them. After all, the corollary of 'encountering opposing views is stressful' is 'echo chambers are comforting.'

Fortunately, on this sub those posts don't always turn into a collection of people bandwagoning onto the OP's opinion. Instead we sometimes get an interesting discussion with all kinds of people voicing their different views on the topic. The "Wool's Orphanage" thread is a good recent example.

The most popular sort of discussion on the sub, judging by the frequent pet peeves threads that get hundreds of replies.

The implication usually is "change my mind". But given that people can get very passionate about disliking stuff, the bar for success can be very high. Or they dislike something based on the stuff they have read with that theme (for me, that'd be Snape-centric fics because I started a lot of them back in the day but enjoyed none of them).

I have made a few posts about looking for stories with an overall premise I do not like but with a twist which would actually interest me in it, but I usually didn't put it as bluntly as OP is describing.

For example, a Dramione fic where Draco spends years 2-4 actually investigating Hermione because he wants to find out how that mudblood can best everyone rather than outright insult her. And then slowly develop a friendship with and a crush on her. All while maintaining his attitude towards the Weasleys and without changing anyone else (eg Snape, Lucius). Didn't find anything there. Or Bellatrix romances where things diverge before she kills Sirius as that puts too much water under the bridge (Passageways was decent in that regard, but the OP inheritance kinda ruined it).

*** No. I legit want people to stop posting these pointless kvetches here in this group. This is a change that might actually happen. There is no chance that writers will stop posting stories that some readers don't like somewhere on the internet.
