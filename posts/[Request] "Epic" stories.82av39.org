  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

**** Update: I finished this and I did enjoy it, but it felt like there were not enough amazing magics that the main character used.

Spoiler below: [[/spoiler][A small issue I had with it is that Albus (and actually almost every Weasley and Potter in Hogwarts) suddenly becomes very powerful (i.e. can duel multiple aurors without problems). Then he uses the Superstorm Devoctrix afterwards and almost immediately nullifies it again (by destroying the Pandoran Catalyst). I really would have enjoyed some prolonged fights between Superstorm users.]].

I guess a lengthy and well-written story with hidden magic does not automatically make a story 'epic' in the way I enjoy it most.

Anyway, thanks again for your suggestion!

** I'd say, from my perspective, the stories that I feel that are epic and that fit into what you asked "character growth (eventual godlike-ness), new/strong magic, expansive worlds with hidden depths." are these, though there are more. linkffn(Delenda Est; A Cadmean Victory; Paid in Blood; Imprisioned Realm; The Legacy by storytellerspw; Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin)
