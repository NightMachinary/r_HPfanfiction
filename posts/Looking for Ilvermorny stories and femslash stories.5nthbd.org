Hi! I'm looking for good written ilvermorny stories with Harry as a main character. Already read "the Ilvermorny champion". Also looking for good written femslash, already read everything with McGonagall/Hermione and most of Hermione/Bellatrix. Any pairing is good, just please no Hermione/Ginny. Fem!Harry is also excepted. Only criteria is that it's good written and over 80k wording, in both requests.. also not opposed to M rating in the stories, as long as they're over 16.

Thank you!

Those are the two that I really like. Though I gave up on Bonding about 10 chapters ago, it's a 1 mill wording story.
