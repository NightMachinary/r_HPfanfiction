As I said, I'm looking for fics in which ghosts, paintings, Peeves (something else I've not thought of?) are well-developed characters that really add to the plot of a story. I don't care if they're the main character, but I'd like them to be involved or pertinent for at least part of the story (e.g., jbern's /The Lie I've Lived/). I'd also be interested in something like esama's /Unsealed,/ which features a character that was a Hogwarts ghost but isn't at the time of story's action (sorry if that's a spoiler, but I think it's a fairly well-known story.)

I'd prefer to stay away from stories that feature portraits of the Founder(s) who get intimately involved in Harry's training or whatnot (e.g. /Cadmean Victory/), just because I find that trope rather stale. Same thing with Phineas Nigellus portraits, unless he's truly a developed character.\\
Pairings/het/slash are all fine, so long as the story is well-written.

Thank you in advance.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19796][Lady of Sorrows]] linkao3(19796) features possibly the rarest of rarepairs, the Grey Lady/Sir Cadogan. The romance aspect is well-done, and it also ties into how Riddle managed to wheedle information out of the Grey Lady.

  A budding romance between a ghost and a portrait could be a tale out of a storybook. But does Helena Ravenclaw's "fairy godfather" have good intentions, or something more sinister in mind?

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
