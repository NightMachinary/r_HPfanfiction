In fics where Colin survives or fics that show more of him in school I've found a trend where authors hint at or blatantly state that he is gay. I'm writing my own fic and have him in a minor role, but kind of dramatic. It's a Harry/Ginny fic and I thought of adding a scene where Harry not so subtly tries to ask if Ginny and Colin had dated at some point. Having Ginny laugh it off and hint that Colin would be more interested in Harry just seemed to make sense to me.

I was just writing and this idea came to me, I'm not sure if it's good or if it will seem cliched or trying to force a character into a role. Any suggestions?


** You might get some flak from readers saying you've picked up fanon as canon, but Ginny might simply be referencing Colin's blatant (and canon) hero-worship.

"It was positively annoying! Anything we did and he'd ask, 'D'you think Harry would like this?' as if having your best friend as my brother would grant me some instant door into your mind."

*** It's more like:

“Yea we were in the same year and both Gryffindors.” Ginny answered. “It's not surprising he opened a photography shop, he was always lugging a camera around with him. Most of the pictures I have from school are probably duplicates he gave me.”

“So did you and he ever date?” Harry asked as innocently as he could.

“Me and Colin!?” Ginny asked before breaking down into a fit of giggles. “No. Definitely not. Actually he'd probably be more interested in you than me.” She added thoughtfully.

**** You should use commas instead of full stops in the dialogue. I probably won't give the fic another glance if it's punctuated like this.

** To be fair, Rowling never says Colin ISN'T gay.
