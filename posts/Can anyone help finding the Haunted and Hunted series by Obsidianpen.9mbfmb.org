Hi, everyone!

Does anyone have a copy lying around of Hauntingly by Obsidianpen? The story recently got removed, and I'm dying because of it.

â€‹

Thank yooou! :)


** I only had the first two on my kindle, so mobi type: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J3y_noqM6vXHD2IAOXZln4nvRmPhzh_7][Mine]] [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fKbrrMYdMxkNYn63v_-CsDUMGc5h-q4Z][Hauntingly]]

Edit: Found an unconverted epub of book 3 on my other computer: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=153PlOhidaJux4nk0fvWVd5Dy1DWbiXHI][Draco Malfoy and the Master of Death]]
