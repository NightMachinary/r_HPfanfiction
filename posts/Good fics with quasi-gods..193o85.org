So I just read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect]['A Butterfly Effect']] by SlyGoddess for like the thousandth time following the recent update. My favorite character of said fic definitely has to be Nicolas Flamel, what with his mysterious tendency to be mysteriously mysterious.

Does anyone have any other well-written fics in which non-main characters play a similar role; as a sort of overseer/quasi-god? For those who haven't read the above fic, I guess the best way to describe it would be a character that resembles Doctor Who.


** The Wizard from Earth

Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks

Guardian (a Stargate crossover)

  Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks

This one is really strange - enjoyable story that includes Super!Harry, SuperAbusive!Dursleys, boring parade of moving machines in the first chapters, dumb Malfoys unable to do anything AND overdoing crossover. Usually one of this things is enough to ruin fic for me.

status: may be read as complete story, sequel of sequel is abandoned.

**** Yeah, I'm usually not into crossovers or.. guns and engines? but Harry Johnson is one of my all-time favorite fics.

** I'm trying to remember...there was one where the old Egyptian Gods were actually powerful magic users who used assassinating evildoers to create "soul-jars" or horcruxes and thus, became immortal. They took Harry in...think maybe it was by Dr T?

Another one with Flammel...wish I could remember the name right off, took Harry in, made him his apprentice and then revealed the story. "How would you like to be the next Nicolas Flammel?" a la Princess Bride.

Sorry I can't think of names...if I remember I'll post links.

**** Actually, once I confirmed (thanks to the A/N in your story above) that it was Dr T, I went and researched his stories to find the one I was thinking of.

***** This is quite well done, but suffers from overpowering one side and keeping other completely unchanged. At least it is not case of One-Sided Ridiculously And Perfectly Helpful Goblins but something quite interesting. Also, Paraguay bit was hilarious.

****** It was...disturbing how casually Harry accepted a black widow on his team and then used her at the end. And Hermione Weasley cheating with someone other than Harry? Blasphemy!

Other than that the backstory and Egyptian history bits seemed legit and it was an enjoyable read.
