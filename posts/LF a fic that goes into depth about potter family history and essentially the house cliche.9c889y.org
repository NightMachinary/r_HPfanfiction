** Well, it goes somewhat indepth, but only up to Harry's grandparents, and there's some Black Power (not the movement, the family) going on there. linkffn(Honour Thy Blood)

There's also a lot of it (Harry was raised by elves of the Potter family and an ancestor-ghost of his) in linkffn(Saviour of Magic)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
