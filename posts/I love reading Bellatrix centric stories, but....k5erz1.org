But I am not sure how nearly all fanfic writers depicts her character and- let's say condition instead of insanity. I read some good stories though, about her background, childhood, Hogwarts years and her marriage etc.

I find it quite interesting that people tend to think she was either born that way(which isn't interesting to read, as if she is a caricature, I prefer to read to see more sides of her character) OR, have extremely abusive parents.

I found plenty of stories that Cygnus and Druella abusing her, not only mentally but phsycially too-even raping her. So okay, that give some sort of meaning to her condition- not only to her insanity but also her worshipping Voldemort. But I have some doubts about it and here is why.

1. I am not really convinced that Blacks are purely evil: We know this from Sirius and Regulus too. Even though Sirius emphasizes that he hated the way of his family thinks, not even one of the oldest generation of Blacks were in Voldemort's squad nor a Death Eater. And when you think about it, within the youngest generation, 4 out of 5 member of Blacks betrayed/worked against the Dark Lord in some way(Andromeda, Sirius, Regulus and Narcissa). So I am not sure that since they were born and raised under the same house, while Narcissa and Andromeda were sane and having healthy relationships but Bellatrix doesn't- even before Azkaban- is convincing.

2. It doesn't make sense that Rodolphus the sane/loving one: This is about stories focusing on their marriage. Comparing to Blacks, Lestranges were way into Dark Magic and side, we know that Rodolphus' and Rabastan's father were Death Eater too-one of the first one actually. So I believe it is more convincing that Rodolphus and Bellatrix made entirely arranged marriage/or they have abusive kind of understanding of love and make each other deranged. But Rodolphus as a loving, caring figure who willing to have a healthy relationship while Bella is insane-there are something missing here.

I know this is kinda long post, but I would like to learn if anyone thinks this way-or contrary, I would like to see your arguments. And if you know any story that fit to my understanding, please let me know!


** Have you read this essay? It's a really good examination of her character - mostly focusing on canon, but there are a few nods to fanon around.

*** I've read it. And while I admit that there are some really insightful parts, there is also a couple of problems.

The biggest one I have is that the author seems to dive too deep into their own headcanons. I'm mostly talking about how they try hard to portray Bellatrix as a very family-bound person. The most blatant example of it is how there are some "clues" in the text, that supposedly suggest Bella and Sirius were "close" when they were young, and that Sirius' death was basically an accident; allegedly Bellatrix' triumphant scream was wrongly interpreted by Harry, and her later instructions concerning the Cruciatus Curse were a result of her subconscious need for punishment.

It's similar with the Malfoys. While I agree Bellatrix was close with Narcissa and wanted to keep her out of harm's way, her sister was definitely not more important than Voldemort. Every next assumption seems to be more and more unlikely. In "Dark Lord Ascending", when Bellatrix is making a show out of herself, according to the author, it was to distract Voldemort from humiliating the Malfoys; not because her emotions and longing were GENUINE. The author states that Bellatrix was the person who manipulated Voldemort in some way - not the other way round.

Later they lean heavily towards the idea that Bellatrix was purposefully avoiding killing Tonks. When Voldemort ordered her to murder Nymphadora and she almost cried it was likely not because she was happy and relieved - it was because she didn't want to do this. The fact that Tonks survived the Battle of the Seven Potters, and the later months was somehow proof of Bellatrix' unwillingness to kill her niece.

In short... This analysis was neither hit nor miss. As I said earlier I agree with some parts, such as Bellatrix being (unjustly) perceived as a crazy bimbo by the majority of the fandom, and that she's much more capable, intelligent, and calculating than people think. I was also glad that the author decided to throw the film version out of the window - otherwise, it would have been a complete mess. But at the same time, the author keeps on overanalysing the tiniest, insignificant details and tries to use them as proof for the legitimacy of their own headcanons, thus making the essay a highly subjective read.

**** Well... yeah. That's the nature of the fandom - you won't find a single character who isn't subjectively viewed. Rowling's plot-railed whimsy saw to that.

I can't really comment on any of your other points because I barely know shit about canon.

But the essay does do what it does well (by fandom standards, anyway :D) - it decides it's going to see a family-bound Bellatrix character and looks into the key aspects of such a character, pulling in various parts of canon to support that idea. The OP wanted ideas around a Bellatrix character that wasn't born insane or abused, and that's what that essay provided.

Also, did not think people would still be reading months old comments, so kudos on your dedication. Thanks for picking mine. :)

***** Heh, what can I say...? I'm a no-life who spends way too much time either drawing, reading, or going through old, interesting threads.

I agree that it's hard to find something that isn't viewed in a completely objective manner, especially in the fandom with such a long tradition. And when it comes to the essay itself I think it's well-written and easy to read - definitely one of the most detailed I've seen so far. My main beef was that this text was presented as a summary of canon information, and it was quite obvious that the author was getting too influenced by their own vision and therefore it felt as if they tried to paint that vision as a fact. It's mostly seen in the description of Bellatrix' relationships.

Quite a shame, because if not for this one problem, this essay would be marvelous. It's very rare for someone in the fandom to give so much thought to the book version of Bellatrix.

** FWIW, regarding point 1, many studies have shown that:

1) In abusive families, it's not uncommon for one individual to be the primary target of abuse, instead of the abuse being spread around. It can be well enough hidden that some siblings either have no idea the abuse occurred, or only a vague sense that there was “something” going on, but surely it wasn't as bad as what the abused sibling claims. This is especially common in sexual abuse.

2) There is no one “response” that abuse victims have. Some may get angry and lash out. Some may display avoidant behavior, and run as far and as fast away as they can get. Some try to become “perfect” in order to minimize the abuse. (I think we've covered the 3 Black sisters right there, lol.) There are other responses too, not just those, and they do tend to be overlapping, so this is kind of a simplistic run down, but yeah. We really can't draw any conclusions from the reactions of the Black family, except to say this: were any of them what we might call well-adjusted? I daresay not. The closest might be Sirius pre-Azkaban, but even he seemed to be an attention-seeking horse's posterior. But even if we did call him “normal”, that certainly shouldn't suggest to us that the Black sisters weren't abused, especially as they had a different set of parents.

So, in summation, I do not think the points you presented argue against the prior generation of Blacks being abusive. In fact, if anything, I find the behavior of the latest generation, all of whom seem maladjusted to a greater or lesser degree, to argue for /some/ type of abuse happening, whether emotional, physical, or sexual.

That's not to say it proves anything either. Obviously there's nothing in canon to say either way. But the preponderance of the evidence seems to indicate (to me) that there was /something/ not quite right going on there. Therefore, I don't find fanfic speculating that some (all?) of Bellatrix's behavior could be linked to childhood abuse to be far-fetched at all.

*** That's low-key what made sense to me in reading Bellatrix. She's not so much inherently evil, as having tried to get acceptance from her family by being the super-supporter of the Dark Lord that would please them, and broken herself in trying to fit that ideal. In the same way that Narcissa decided to be the perfect pureblood wife and Andromeda left the family to avoid.

** The YouTube Fan Film 'House of Sisters Black' has it that Bellatrix's father was removing her memories to keep her in line. It's well worth a watch! My fanfic (told from Narcissa's POV) has it that Voldemort himself was teaching Bellatrix Occlumency/Legilemency and was deliberately changing things in her mind - just because he could.

** I think people discount the effect of a lengthy prison sentence on someone's mental health. Sirius and Bellatrix were both essentially in almost complete segregation in a 24/hour torture prison for over a decade.

The United Nations says anything over 14 days segregation is torture FYI.

Bellatrix would not be okay after Azkaban regardless of what state she was in before Azkaban.

** I have two fic suggestions!

The first is a WIP called surrogate on AO3: a truly masterful look at the relationship between Bellatrix and Voldemort, exploring her relationship with Rodolphus and Andromeda as well. Rodolphus is serious and thoughtful, and the two unite over their mutual love of Voldemort (not exactly romantic on Rod's part, but... very interested). Set during Deathly Hallows but replete with flashbacks. It's one of the best fan fictions I've ever seen: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11682174/chapters/26295996]]

The second is a story called Vacillation. It's actually a Lucius/Narcissa story set during the first war and delves much more deeply into their psyches, but Bellatrix and Rodolphus get a lot of attention too. If you're solely interested in Bellatrix I'd at least recommend you read chapter 18, which almost reads like a lengthy Bella/Rod one shot. Rodolphus is totally wild in it and while I'm not sure how canon that is, it's a fun read. The L/N parts are canon though, and it's completed.
