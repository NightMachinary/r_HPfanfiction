I'm feeling pretty burned out on fanfiction (read over 25 million words over 2 years) and I'm looking to read something fresh. I'm sure many of you have felt this over your time reading fanfiction and would like recommendations. I'd like them to have adventure in them and magic and all sorts.


** Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller trilogy.

Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series.

Trudi Canavan's Age of Five trilogy.

Anything by Neil Gaiman.

George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.

Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus trilogy.

Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld (I recommend starting with /Guards Guards/).

Jim Butcher's Dresden Files.

Also consider Duncton Wood by William Horwood and the works of Guy Gavriel Kay.

*** Thanks for the recommendations.

The Kingkiller trilogy I've been putting off until the last book is out so I can smash through them all in a week and having such a long wait for the last book in the ASOIAF series I've realised can't handle another wait. Brandon Sanderson's books on my list. Have you read the Mistborn books? Are they worth a read?

His Dark Materials I read growing up and can remember enjoying at the time.

I've never got around to starting any of TPractchetts work as there is so much of it that it is a daunting.

**** The thing about Discworld is that it's not like a traditional series where each book follows from the previous one. The Discworld series is separated into "sub series" which follow a certain location/character, for example the Rincewind series, the Witches series, the Guards series. My personal favourite are the Guards books - they're most like traditional fantasy, I suppose, in that there's a hero and a mystery and adventure, as well as lots of humour. In theory, each book can stand on its own, though it's certainly more enjoyable to read the "sub series" in a certain order. But yeah, the point is that you don't have to take on the whole of Discworld -- I've been a fan for over 10 years and have probably only read half of them. Pick a sub-series and start with that (hint: pick the Guards books XD).

With respect to Mistborn, they're okay but nowhere near as good as the Stormlight Archive. The problem with Mistborn is that each book is all about the end-of-book reveal/twist, and a lot of the series is major filler/padding to set that reveal up. There were definite parts in the second and especially third books that I really struggled to push through to get to the end. But the first book was really great, so I'd recommend trying it at least.

As for good collections... eh, head over to SpaceBattles, go to creative writing, and sort things by view/replies, and then search for "Worm". There should be a lot of them. Off the top of my head, some that you should absolutely read are A Cloudy Path by LacksCreativity, Here be Dragons by Ryuugi, Cenotaph and it's sequels by Notes, and everything Thinker6 does, most notably Weaver Nine.

** Dresden Files, obviously.

There's some magic in Stephen King's Dark Tower series, but not much. If you read Sword of the Hero and those fics though, and liked the /epic/, you can't go wrong with Dark Tower. Again, low key magic.. but so much adventure! King is probably our best contemporary author, hand's down.

There's always Wheel of Time, if you want a long one. Didn't like Kingkiller, but maybe you do. The First Law was.. okay? Can't even remember if it had magic, but it was an okay fantasy read anyway.

You've read the classics, I expect? Lord of the Rings and the likes? If you haven't, this topic is unnecessary and Tolkien is waiting for you. Someone mentioned A Song of Ice and Fire, which are good books too. TV series has caught up now, though, and Martin will probably never get around to finishing this.

Being on Reddit, I expect you are an adult. If not, there's a LOT of YA that does HP-like. Paolini, Riordan etc. It's not very good for an adult experienced reader, but who knows who you are behind your username. Maybe you like this kind of stuff.

Plugging Dark Materials from Taure's suggestion too - this series reads like it was a fanwank group project from [[/r/atheism]], but it's actually rather fun. Interesting themes, at least. Not very exciting magic.

I'm a couple of books into Wheel of Time but I've become so sick of a few certain characters that I've had to drop it for a while in hope that my feelings about a certain braid tugger mellow out.

Yeah I've read LoTR but got put of the rest of his work by children of Hurin. I'm caught up on ASOIAF both the books and the show and I'm sick to my back teeth of the wait for the new book.

** So glad no one recommended the "Sword of Truth" series. Was totally disappointed then the series turned into the author's personal political/social soapbox. Blech.

** The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini(sic). Eragon first, then Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance.

There's magic, swordplay, adventure, dragons and a young boy. The author was in his late teens when he wrote Eragon, and his writing style evolves over the course of the series. Go read it.

** The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny is pretty amazing. It consists of The Corwin Cycle and the Merlin Cycle with five novels each. The first half is /a lot/ better IMHO, it's got epic adventures and mystery and magic.

** I found "The Chronicles of Siala" by Alexey Pehov to be a good read. Its a very high-fantasy setting with a simple treasure hunt as original plot. But its conflicts, twists and mystic parts are a great thing to enjoy.

I could also recommend "The Water Mirror" by Kai Meyer and subsequently the entire "Merle Trilogy".

Its more mystical and somewhere between low and high fantasy. The magic has a very "above the understanding of mere mortals" feel to it.

You could also try "Empress of Mijak" by Karen Miller, the first book of the "Godspeaker Trilogy".

Something I absolutely adored about this book are the female characters. They pack a punch, especially Hekat, who is the protagonist of the first book. However, magic in this is at best very sacramental and divine (read: subtle).

Something that has no magic in it, but makes for an amazing read is "Metro 2033" by Dmitry Glukhovsky. Its the core-story for a mass of books and if you like suspense, gritty and dirty, disease-ridden worlds where survival is the mantra and violence the answer, this is for you. The main protagonist is also way over his head in his task, much like Harry was.

** "The Talisman" by Stephen King and Peter Straub. And I know everyone has already said it, but Dresden Files. The Narnia series, too- you may recognize some names and slightly familiar situations to HP in that.

** Ahhhh, I was just like you last year. Read way too much HP ff since 2011, far more than I'd care to admit.

One of my favourite books straight off the bat was Dresden Files, ofc. Hugely recommend ASOIAF, as well as (!) a Way of Kings by Sanderson - the magic system might feel a bit off after all that HP but still, very good book.

Also maybe try rereading the main series. I'm pretty much a HP expert at this point, but it's amazing how much you miss when all you read is Fanfiction.

** In addition to all the other excellent suggestions here (but especially Discworld - please don't be overwhelmed, each is a stand alone novel, start with Guards Guards, Thief of Time (like I did!) or The Wee Free Men) here some more:

Black Jewels trilogy by Anne Bishop - interesting mostly-matriarchal society with magic based on jewels (like a psychic manifestation of a soul) - hard to explain but really vivid and complex world and society. The characters/core plot aren't AMAZING - theres a lot of holes :( -but the world setting is just phenomenal and worth the mild exasperation for the rest.

The Empire Trilogy by Janny Wurts and Raymond E Feist - a standalone series linked to Magician/Midkemia series. I read this without having read Feist's core series. Its not magic-focused though until the third book. Another great society/world built on an alien world. Very political.

Good luck with Dresden Files, I'm about to start reading my first! I was advised to skip straight to Grave Peril (book three?)

** If you like Dresden Files, you might want to check out the Alex Verus series. Similar concept with the urban wizard stuff, but main character is a diviner rather then a standard wizard. Great series.

** I rec'd this in response to Taure's comment, but to direct your attention to the Malazan books, OP... Here's a link to the first one at [[http://www.amazon.com/Gardens-Moon-Malazan-Book-Fallen/dp/0765348780][Amazon]].

Fabulous books, Erikson recently finished the 10th book so the main series is completed. He and his friend are continuing to write accompanying novellas and trilogies to flesh out side characters, so there's tons of high quality material to read. Erikson drops readers right in the middle of his world without coddling, but it makes reveals and plot twists much more striking. The worldbuilding is FANTASTIC. There is a magic system, and it's pretty interesting/unique.

If you like ASOIAF, you'll like the Malazan books... because the Malazan books are superior, honestly.

edit - plug for [[/r/malazan]]. They're really good about tagging spoilers there... and make sure you don't get spoiled. It's worth it.
