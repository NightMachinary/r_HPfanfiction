Draco/Ginny pairing is a huge plus but not a requirement. Thanks!

** Draco accepting the Order's help is the premise of linkffn(Turn by Sara's girl). The writing is really top-notch and it has one of my favorite characterizations of Ginny.

linkffn(Wait for Me by Mugglehugger) has Draco accepting Dumbledore's offer of protection. The author's technically sound, but he whitewashed Draco's character completely. I remember reading about half of it before giving up.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

  HPDM slash, AU of HBP. Snape never swore a vow. Draco accepted Dumbledore's offer of sanctuary. But when Voldemort kills Narcissa in retaliation, and Dumbledore insists on creating a soul-bond between Draco and Harry to subdue the Horcrux in Harry's soul, Draco decides to use both the soul-bond and the sanctuary to keep his family safe. No matter what Dumbledore intended.
