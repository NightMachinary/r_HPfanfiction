At first I didn't get all the fuss about them but I just started a fic where the characters do situps and levitate objects to strengthen their magical cores, and found it so stupid that now I really want some good crack fics poking fun at them!

For example, something along the lines of: Harry figures out that your magical core is actually just an obscure tiny muscle thats part of your oblique abs, magically powerful people just happen to have the right kind of posture that keeps it flexed all the time, whenever you cast a spell you flex it without noticing, and once people figure out it's your magical core everyone starts training for battle by sitting on the floor and lifting a medicine ball from side to side.


** Not magical cores as such, but linkffn(All Full of that Wizard Angst by CalamityJim) has Voldemort lecturing/ranting about what affects a wizard's or witch's power.

**** To be honest, the Ron-bash was the most disappointing part for me. For that matter, his inferiority complex with respect to his older brothers and his occasional jealousy of Harry should give him plenty to angst about.
