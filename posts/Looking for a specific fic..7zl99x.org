Alright, I've been going insane looking for this fic for a while.

From what I remember, it was a Goblet of Fire AU in which Harry decides to take the easy way out in every event. I think in the Third Task he uses a ladder to climb the hedges.

If anyone can find it, or anything similar really, I would appreciate it.

*** That was it, thank you.

...Sadly I had forgotten how many crappy tropes and bits of fanon were present.

/sigh/ If only just the lazing about instead of trying were there, but attached to a better story.

  Dumbledore had tricked him into becoming a Champion but Harry wasn't going to take it lying down. He may be forced to compete in the tasks but who says he has to complete the tasks?
