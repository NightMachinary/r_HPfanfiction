** Not that I like bashing at all, but if someone hypothetically puts a gun to my head...

1. Snape: Because fuck this "/I'm okay with infant murder as long as my childhood obsession survives/" bastard. So, /SO,/ many fics give Snape a pass, or even make him somehow a victim for god's sake. Snape does not deserve any forgiveness. He was not a good person.
2. Draco: Fandom loves him because he's played by an attractive actor. That's it. Seriously. The fact that somehow Dramione(basically a Nazi paired with a Jew) is one of the most popular ships in fanfiction community is mind numbing.
3. Hermione: Because she gets too much wanked.
4. Weasley twins: They get left out from Weasley bashing stories because they're funny(supposedly). But I feel like sometimes their practical jokes go too far and they need to be called out on that.
5. Neville: Because I'm tired of seeing him as either "Better Ron" or "Good Draco".(I still believe canon Ron would kick his ass).

** In no paryyicular ordrr:

Umbridge, but it's low hanging fruit.

Hermione, mostly because its rare and she has her faults, too.

Fred and George (counting them as "one character unnit" here). I am not overly fond of them, and as they are often the only ones /not/ bashed in Weasley bashing stories this is at least somewhat different.

Snape, but, again, low hanging fruit.

The adult Dursleys. If I had to choose only one of them, Vernon.

--------------

Honestly, not a fan of bashing stories, though. Apart from the castharsis of just screwing over abusive adults in that series, I guess.

I do like stories thst dont shy away from showing character's faults, but that's because I LIKE characters to have faults. I dont consider that bashing.

linkffn(4545504; 10645463)

Quite a few more have Hermione as part of "manipulative Dumbledore's" network of spies where she reports everything he does. Sometimes she wisens up and is redeemed, sometimes not. The worst have her betray Harry for some rare books or something equally stupid.

Or they go down the reverse of potion queen Ginny and have Hermione do the potioning. I remember reading too many arcs like these.

Molly - cuz she has some pretty big canon flaws that aren't criticized.

**** More of just frustration over Tumblr Potterheads writing looooooong speculative posts about what a Good Person he was and well, all of his actions(being a Death Eater, having a slave, never sticking up for Sirius) can be excused because he found a Horcrux and tried his best to destroy it. 100K notes.

Usually in the same posts, Narcissa will also get a long 'feminist-positive' rant about how Good she is and how she obviously changed and people who don't like her hate women. It's all more speculative headcanons than anything of substance.

Basically, I'm sick of certain Death Eaters getting worshiped for doing the bare minimum, and all of their faults being excused by a significant portion of the fandom. So I seek fics where the characters I've become most annoyed with, get dragged.

** Hermione, because it's rare (in comparison to others), to say the least.

The Twins, because they're just bullies. Also, somehow it's okay for them to bully Percy and Ron, but Ginny gets a free pass? And the twins can bully Ron but Ron can't do the same to Ginny? Double standards but whatever.

Arthur, because not even trying to get a better-paying job when you have seven kids is selfish af. Yeah, yeah, I know they have food and a home and everything else, but a few extra Galleons would have gone a long way in terms of material comfort. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524997/8/Must-Be-One-of-Arthur-s-Boys]]) gives a plausible reason why that might have been the case, though.

Molly. The constant combo of smothering/emotional distance reminds me of my own mother.
