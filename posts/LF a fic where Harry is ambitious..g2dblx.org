I'd like to see him embrace his fame and pursue power for whatever reasons, because he likes the feeling of beeing able to accomplish incredible feats of magic.

But I dont want him to be dark and start crucio'ing people left and right just because he can, or allying himself with the murderer of his parents.

I just want a Harry who wants to be the complete opposite of what the Dursleys told him to be, id est "normal", a Harry that gets told during his entire childhood that he is trash and worthless, not to make any waves, just to suddenly discover that he is special, that he has MAGIC, and realising that he can, in fact, be amongst the greatests if he wants to, and works toward it.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

  Albus Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice sacrificing an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake had been. Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James, instead, he had inherited more of Lily. Far too much, in many people's opinion...

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years
