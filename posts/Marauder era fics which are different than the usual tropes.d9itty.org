The idea of the Marauder era has always interested me as it could be a good prequel. But whenever I attempted to get into the genre, I quickly dropped the fics because they all felt the same. Namely, I was annoyed by:

- Teenage drama as narrative focus. Especially since we all know that James and Lily will get together.

- Snape redemption arcs. An interesting idea which sadly turns into wish fulfillment (reconciliation with Lily, possibly a romance) rather than a logical conclusion (Snape becomes a better person but Lily still isn't talking to him)

- Snape and regulus deciding to become spies

- time travellers banging someone from the past, no matter which pairing

- villainous depictions of the Marauders or marauder wank.

So are there any fics which are set in the Marauder era but are different from the usual stuff? No (future) Death Eaters, no m/m and preferably as little of Lupin as possible. Give me Lily/Edward Tonks/Andromeda Black for all I care, just something new.


** Would love to see anything new recommended here, Marauders' era is pretty much all I read.

I'm finding it difficult to come up with many good ones that don't have Sirius/Remus as a pairing, as it's such a common one for this type of story. Not sure if you'll like any of these to be honest, but maybe someone else will. I will tentatively recommend 'face death in the hope', which is Harry timetravelling. It's really good and updates with a bunch of chapters every few months. The tags say it's supposed to be Harry/Regulus eventually, but there has been nothing like that happening so far, in fact there has been zero romance in 200 000 words. Also no Lupin (yet). linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

The next one I'll (again tentatively) recommend is "The hell where youth and laughter go", which the author finished very recently. It's an AU horcrux hunt with good characterization and loads of little subplots. It's got plenty of mature themes, a tiny bit of slash and it does contain Lupin. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]])

The one I know of that fits your requests best is "All These Complications" which was taken down years ago by its author. It is also unfinished, which is completely heartbreaking as it was seriously good. If I remember correctly it's around 200 000 words and lots and lots happen. It's another AU horcrux hunt type of thing with no slash, some Lupin. Google Drive is here: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsWVJGdi1YTEI5Zk0]]

** Well, if you are open to a time travel element, linkffn(Timely Errors) is one I really enjoyed. There's no time travel banging involved - it's involved as an excuse to get Harry to interact with his parents/their friends as students in Hogwarts for a week or two.

Very well done IMO, if the premise intrigues you.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

*** I don't mind TT, I mind the whole "let's ship these two people? Age difference? Watch me!" (unless done completely, 110% cracky in a Harry/Lily fic). Harry in the 70s can be fun.

** I immediately thought of a fic and realized it goes against one of your requirements but I'm going to suggest it anyways because I think it's just so well done. linkffn(13104570) If you're not too opposed to the Regulus becomes a spy thing you should've it a shot, the authors have a great cast of characters and they have another series that is probably my favourite in the HP universe.

*** I guess it depends on how it is set up. I remember one fic where Snape and Regulus go "well, this sucks" and Dumbledore immediately decides that a 14 and a 16-year-old are the perfect spies. That one was rather awful tbh.

  In the thick of the first war with Voldemort, Regulus steals the locket horcrux; and pulled from the grip of its trials, he survives the cave. What follows is a tale of espionage, blood politics, and accidental vigilantism. Welcome to 1979.

** There isn't much left once you eliminate all that. How about Fred and George time traveling back? Snape is interesting here.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]])

Does it still count as Marauder era when they've just graduated? Because you didn't say that you don't want things written in the style of Evelyn Waugh. That's not an overused trope yet, I don't think. Sorry, there's some Remus, but his silence is hilarious.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
