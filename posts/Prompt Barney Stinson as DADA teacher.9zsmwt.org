The humor of how lockheart exaggerates the truth about how great, PLUS barney's awesomeness.

"Today, I will be teaching you the four Unforgivables."

"Professor, there are only 3."- Hermione

"just, just...ok?

As I was saying. The 4 Unforgivables:

The Killing Curse

The Cruciatus

The Imperius

And Marriage Contracts"

** "There I was, I, Barney Stinson, leading an expedition to find the Yeti. There were four of us. The lovely Pandora Lovegood and her husband Xeno, the brilliant Newton Scamander, and then there was me. Barney Stinson. The discoveries we would make would revolutionize all that we knew about wizard-kind. The Yeti was rare, it was elusive, and it was all I had ever wanted. I had been hunting it since I was but a lad of ten. In the great forests I spent my summers in, in upstate New York."

"Professor," Hermione Granger raised her hand, but there was no mistaking the edge in her voice. "I believe the textbook says that the Yeti is native only to Tibet and the Pacific Northwest."

"Oh, that's just what they want you to think. The Yeti is definitely a creature of the Appalachia. Hollywood just pretends that it lives in the Pacific Northwest because California likes to take credit for everything, and the whole thing with Tibet is 'cause some Yetis went to a pilgrimage to find nirvana or something. But most of them still go to church, which makes sense since Jesus is awesome. And the Yeti is awesome. And I, Professor Stinson, am awesome."

Hermione's eyes widened. "But that's not what the books say!"

"There's a lot you need to learn, Miss Granger. And I can teach you a lot, but not if you keep interrupting. That said, you really need to learn that not everything official can be trusted. I would have thought having to learn from Umbridge would have taught you that."

Hermione went bright red. Ron Weasely, Harry Potter, Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas all exchanged silent looks and decided that they all would never, ever mention this after class because Hermione was getting very angry. And she was scary when she was angry.

"Idiot mudblood," Malfoy sniggered.

"I heard that!" Professor Stinson snapped. "Alright, Malfoy you get a choice. Either I take fifty points from Slytherin or you do fifty push-ups, what will it be?"

"What?!" Malfoy looked outraged. "I am not going to do push-ups!"

"Okay then, one hundred points from Slytherin. Twenty for name-calling, thirty for blood purism, and fifty for talking back to the awesome professor! I am the professor and I am in charge and now you are going to do one hundred push-ups, or it'll be two hundred points."

Malfoy sputtered with rage but Crabbe and Goyle pulled him out of his chair and onto the floor.

"My father will hear about this!"

"I'm not afraid of your dum-dum daddy, Malfoy." Professor Stinson snapped. "No more interruptions, that goes for everyone.

"Now, where was I? Oh yes, we were an awesome team of bros. And Pandora was a girl, but she was married to Xeno so she was still kind of a bro. We had our mission--find the Yeti. We started on winged horses, but I rode a griffin because I was the coolest and I had raised the griffin myself. His name was...Griff. Griff the Griffin. We flew over the forests and up the mountains and then we went on foot. Well, Xeno tried to travel on a pogo stick, but it didn't turn out so well...man, we were awesome but he could be a real nerd. But eventually we found them--the Yeti. And--that was a girl push-up Malfoy, it doesn't count. You have to start all over."

That's about all I got at the moment. I'll come back to it.

*** *Part 2*

"And so we found them at last! The Yeti, a race of super-strong and super-hairy beings. They weren't quite human but they were awesome all the same. They could do magic too, in ways most wizards would never have even dreamed of. Way better than most of Britain."

"My family," Malfoy began, his arms trembling, "has preformed more powerful magic than any in-bred tribe of savage monkeys."

"What did I say about back-talk, bucko? That's your new name--Back-Talk Bucko. Shut up, Back-Talk Bucko--the professor is talking. And add fifty more push-ups."

"What sort of magic could the Yeti do that wizards don't?"

"Good question, Mister Longbottom. Five points to Gryffindor for getting us back on topic. Now, the Yeti, they had devised ways to become invisible."

"We already have Invisiblity Cloaks! And Disillusionment Charms!" Hermione was seething. "You're just making things up as you go! You don't know anything at all. You're as bad as that rubbish in /The Quibbler/!"

Professor Stinson was appalled. "I will not be spoken to in that way, young lady! And I will not allow you to insult Xeno's life work. He and Pandora are two of the most awesome people I ever knew. They were the only journalists I ever knew who were cool. Way cooler than that Canadian. In fact, I have a good mind to bring them in for guest lecturing."

Harry and Neville exchanged a look. Xeno and Pandora Lovegood...Luna's parents. Luna had told Harry matter-of-factly that her mother had died when she was only nine, and that she had seen it happen.

"I doubt it'll be a worthwhile lecture, if their daughter is anything to judge."

"Hermione," Neville hissed. "Shut up!"

"Daughter?" Professor Stinson's irritable expression vanished. "Oh, Pandora and Xeno! They retired from awesome hunting when they learned they were going to have a baby! That was so long ago, the baby must be going to school here! And it's a daughter? Xeno and Pandora have a little girl? I'm so happy, I'm not even going to take points."

"Blatant favoritism...ow..." Malfoy groaned. "Everything hurts." His arms buckled and he crumpled to the floor.

"That was only your fifth push-up, you big baby. You still have one hundred forty-five to go."

"Er...professor," Neville hesitated. "I'm not sure whether you heard, but Pandora died a few years ago."

"Wait, what?" Professor Stinson looked stunned. Hermione stiffened.

"One of her spells went badly," Harry answered. "Luna saw it happen. She was nine."

"What..." Professor Stinson cleared his throat. "Very well, thank you Mister Longbottom, Mister Potter. I had not realized that I had been so negligent. I will do everything in my power to teach Miss Lovegood the art of being awesome.

"No homework, because homework is not awesome."

This is harder than I thought.
