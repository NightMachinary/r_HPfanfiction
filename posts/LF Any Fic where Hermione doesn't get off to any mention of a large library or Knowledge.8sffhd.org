Im seriously beginning to hate the trope where Writers have her basically just get off to some library. Any good fic that doesn't have Hermione as a huge part or they dont over play her need for Knowledge.

*EDIT* YOU'VE ALL BROKEN ME...SEE YOU IN THERAPY


** Well shit, now I need to write a story where Hermione literally gets off on the existence of libraries.

*** Harry decided that Hermione was being too uptight about the Halfblood Prince's Potions book, but thanks to Lavender and Parvati, he knew just how to get to her.

Sat in the Library, studying Ancient Runes, Harry spots his bushy haired friend Hermione. Deciding to sneak up on her, he ends up right behind ear and whispers into her ear "Bodleian" "More Harry.... more!" Hermione begs, her panties starting to moisten. "Library of Alexandria. Library of Congress. Reading Room"

  During the trio's stay at Grimmauld Place in DH, Hermione spends some quality alone time with a good book. PURE SMUT. You'll find no plot to water down the smut in this fic.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** I think you are looking for less Belle!Hermione, but this got me thinking that having a Hermione who does go crazy over books come across a library and (against reader expectations) go 'eh', have Ron and Harry be massively confused, and her all "I've eaten Hogwarts Library, this doesn't compare"
