If there aren't any good ones, any suggestions on how to write one well?


** There's A Matter of Force, where the SI is Harry's sister.

Your mileage WILL vary. She's a complete Mary Sue, but the author leans into those tropes purposefully so it comes out funny rather than cringey.

I like it. The SI borrows very liberally from various pop culture, and there are numerous running gags throughout the story (such as the usefulness of towels, which DO pay off on numerous occasions).

And it's complete!

--------------

If you're open minded about whose twin the SI is, there's also In Bad Faith, where the SI is Draco's sister. It's incomplete and never reaches the first year of Hogwarts, but the worldbuilding is well written.

Those are the only good ones I can think of.

*** In Bad Faith depresses me. It's such a great story but the author is one of those poor deluded souls who doesn't appreciate their own work.

**** Sorry for responding to this after 5 months, but it sucks when that happens. Like how the author of what's widely considered one of the best, if not the best, Pokemon fanfics of all time stopped writing because they thought their work was bad and even took it down. Like sure, maybe the writing isn't on the level of Tolkien, but being better than 99% of fanfiction, and a fair amount of actually published novels, is still a great achievement. Most people can't do that.

It looks like in the case of In Bad Faith the author just decided they don't like SIs. That's unfortunate, as SIs are awesome when well done, which I remember their fic being.

Is an absolutely amazing story that is well written, funny, sad and charming. It's also complete and the SI isn't a Mary Sue either!

EDIT: Fanfic bot not working, so I posted the link instead.

***** Yeah. But the best suggestion is to be aware of the fact that you are writing something for fantasy fulfillment rather than for provoking thought.
