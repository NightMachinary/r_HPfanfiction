  "I said beat him, not tickle him!" Amelia bellowed, annoyed at how standards had slipped since her days on patrol. "Jenkins, stomp that groin!"

  "Yes, boss," the Auror agreed.

  No, you gotta grind your heel when you-" Amelia growled in frustration. "Palmer, why is his left hand not broken?!"

  "Sorry, boss," the Auror said shame faced.

  "You can't expect to-" The woman sighed. "You want something done right," Amelia muttered to herself.

  ...

  Amelia rolled up her sleeves, pulled a detective's lead weighted rubber truncheon from her robes and set to work showing her Aurors the difference between regular brutality and police brutality.
