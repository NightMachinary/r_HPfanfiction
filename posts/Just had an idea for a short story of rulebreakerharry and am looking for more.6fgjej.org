Such as the rules say a student must wear the official robes to class. There's no language saying he must continue wearing them DURING class so he transfigures them into a pinhead costume or a carmen miranda fruit dress costume. Stuff like that where he follows the letter but not the intent.

And yes, i will be writing this and adding it to my anthology on broken pottery or its own standalone like stranger in a strange land and the cookbook of doom.

EDIT: meant more rulebreaker!harry stories, not more rules.


** - Curfew usually has a specific start time, but the end time may not be specified (I've only seen the end time specified once in a fanfiction). Therefore one could argue that at midnight it's now a new day whose curfew doesn't start until that evening. "That was yesterday's curfew, today's doesn't start until 10 pm."
- Do the rules for robes specify the material -- would lace of the appropriate color qualify? If the robes must "extend to the ankles" (or some such), does a single inch of material extending that far qualify (they have extended to the ankles) and the rest can be any length? Are there rules preventing "flair" on robes: pins, patches, badges ... oh, wait, badges were /fine/, so how about hundreds of badges/etc?†

† I just had the mental image of, the day after Draco's badges, Harry, the twins, and other Gryffindors walk into the Great Hall wearing badges that say "Support Snape, the REAL Hogwarts Champion for putting up with Potter".

** There are a couple of stories that come to mind on this. linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB) is a quirky harry that finds loopholes to do less work. Maybe not the exact direction your looking for, but it is pretty funny. Another is one that I don't remember the name of. The thing I do remember, is that Harry and the Weasley twins fake a Gryndilow infestation just to back up a homework excuse he gave to McGonagall, and it draws the MoM in, etc. The last I can think of is linkffn(Anti-Hyphen). Slytherin Harry who loves exploring

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
