I have read the different Whiskey Wedding challenge responses and really liked them and was wondering if there were more like those

i really like harry/narcissa or tonks


** There are those that have him being forced to marry Narcissa, Andromeda, Tonks, and even Bellatrix, but funnily enough I don't think I've seen one where he's forced to marry Rosmerta -- which I find odd, given that there's probably a fanfic out there that has him shacking up with every /other/ older female character under the sun /but/ her, and she's described to be incredibly attractive in canon (and shown to be in that Harry Potter mobile game).
