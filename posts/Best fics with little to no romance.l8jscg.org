** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28991619][Still Standing]] linkao3(28991619) - Percy-centric, post-war. I'd say it's background Percy/Oliver, because this is really a character study of Percy and coming to terms with himself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26243248][Beneath This Mortal Earth]] linkao3(26243248) - Andromeda-centric, post-war. Retelling of the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23576830][sometimes we've gotta let it go to waste]] linkao3(23576830) - Remus and Sirius (sort of) raise Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22103842/chapters/52754038][Dear Mum]] linkao3(22103842) - the Weasley kids write home to Molly.

  Andromeda did not weep for her daughter. She could not. It cut deeper than tears, deeper even than pain. She felt nothing as she watched a yawning crevasse open where moments ago the Hogwarts stone had kissed the edges of Dora's body. The vines and soil of the next place rose up and engulfed the body, the last remnants of Andromeda's husband and child. The tendrils wrapped around Dora and wrested her from her mother's grasp, swallowing her beneath this mortal earth. A magical realism retelling of the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Anything by TheDivineComedian. Their writing is incredible, they really expand the world and delve into little stories about Dementors and boggarts and Remus and it's all great... Wolfstar is assumed but never the focus. linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian)

linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is an adventure story where Harry is sent to 1978. He doesn't find his parents but gets dragged into the war in his own way. There's vigilantes, pirates, a prison break. It's just absolutely fantastic! Every character is there for a purpose and watching them all grow throughout the story is so satisfying!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I have always enjoyed sorting AUs or stories that be begin in first year, so my recommendations reflect that.

My first recommendation would be "Becoming Harry Potter".

It is about Harry being sorted into Slytherin together with Ron. It has no romance so far and should there ever be one, there are no signs that it will be a central aspect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12174463/1/Becoming-Harry-Potter]]

There is also "On the Way to Greatness", but I assume you already know this one as it is quite popular.

"Old Blood" is another one, though it has not been updated in a while. Harry is in Gryffindor, but from the very beginning it is clear that there are several clear deviations from canon. Like the other stories I recommended, it is well written and does not feature bashing of any kind or riddiculous characterizations of Dumbledore.
