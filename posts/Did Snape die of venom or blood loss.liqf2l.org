** Likely blood loss, but that's mostly because it was a more immediate problem. Had someone been around to heal the wound itself, he'd probably have died from the poison. Then again, the poison mostly seems to have been some sort of aggressive anticoagulant (see Arthur's case), so he might have survived at that point if he had a diligent healer familiar with the prior case.

** I think both would have played a part - see Arthur's hospitalization in book 5.

Nagini's venom made it so the bleeding wouldn't be /stopped/ (at least not by anything Snape could have done himself), which in turn caused Severus to bleed out. Cause of death would be listed as blood loss in the end.

**** He'd been drinking honey badger anti-venom since he started hanging around Voldemort again.

** Both probably. I'm no expert but if the bleeding stopped the venom would still be in his blood and even if using some potion he cleansed his blood he is still bleeding out.

So since both were happening it was probably both that killed him.
