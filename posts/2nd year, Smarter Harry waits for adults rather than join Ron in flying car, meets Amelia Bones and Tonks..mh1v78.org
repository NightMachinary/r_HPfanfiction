:END:
This is really just a scene from the fic - probably pretty early - but it's what I remember...

When finding the portal to 9 3/4 closed, Harry remains calm while Ron panics. Ron takes the flying car, while Harry sits down and wait. Soon Amelia Bones and Tonks arrives to check the portal, and Harry approch them. They (I think Tonks) apparates/floos Harry to Hogsmead/Hogwarts.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

And he knew more than most people that it was illegal because he was the head of the department in charge of regulating such objects. Ron and Harry may have inadvertently drawn this to the Ministry's attention, but the fact remains that he broke the law and it was his fault. You can't really blame Ron and Harry for his wrongdoing being discovered. He ought not to have done it in the first place.

The worst thing they did was decide to take the car, knowing that magic isn't to be done in front of muggles and overlooking solutions that should have been obvious to children of that age, especially Ron as he was raised in the magical world. He ought to have known there were other means of magical travel that would get them to Hogwarts or thought of using Harry's owl to ask for help, even if Harry didn't know or forgot about magical options in a panic. Even Harry could have asked someone at the station for help getting to Charring Cross (since he would be able to speak to muggles without a problem) where the Leaky Cauldron is and they could have asked someone like Tom about what to do.

It's shown time and time again that no matter what anyone does, they don't get expelled (except for using magic outside of school when underage, but even then you have to have broken it multiple times to get expelled).

A good number of students - not just Harry - did shitty things that would have gotten them punished, suspended, or expelled from school in real life - and they never get suspended or expelled. As far as I can recall, the only actual expulsion in the books that's mentioned is Hagrid's, and that was after he got framed for Aragog killing Myrtle.

Not what I referred to.\\
They constantly, before the death-eater attack, had to obliviate a muggle because people kept doing magic stuff and mentioning magical stuff in front of him.

Honestly, most of the cast would either be expelled or in Azkaban if we went hard on 'following the law to the letter'

Hermione? expelled and lucky if she avoided Azkaban. She literally used time-travel to set free a mass-murderer in the eyes of the ministry and law.

Hagrid? totally deserved Azkaban. Raised a dragon in his tree-hut around children and send two kids into an Acromantula-nest, the father of the nest which he raised in Hogwarts around children.

Snape? Death-eater and used an unforgivable curse on Dumbledore. Azkaban with no parole even if Dumbledore asked him to use it.

Hermione definitely would've been expelled had she been caught. But she wasn't caught. Hagrid also should probably go to jail but Dumbledore interceded on his behalf and got off with a broken wand the first time and I'm pretty sure didn't get caught later on.

They have a committee dedicated to coming up with excuses for magical incidents and Voldemort rampages all over without muggles catching on to magic being a thing, I don't think that one flying car is really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.

They probably won't go to juvie if it's a first time offense but they will get expelled. It's the same principle. From the way it's presented, the penalty for showing magic to a muggle is expulsion.

Harry's possible punishment for multiple infractions of the underage magic law in combination with showing magic to a muggles in his fifth year was expulsion, yes, but that's not the same thing as what happened in this instance.

When a muggle develops wizard powers it's probably one of the very first things the wizard who comes to their house will tell them because 11 year olds are dumb and learning that they have magical powers would be something that they would absolutely tell their friends about unless it's made abundantly clear to them that it's illegal and they will be in a lot of trouble, real trouble not "oh it'll be okay as long as I don't get caught". Exposing the magical world isn't like sticking your hand in the cookie jar when your mom's mot looking. They would definitely stress the real world importance and real world consequences for exposing magic. Harry would absolutely know this because there's no way that this wouldn't be one of the incredibly important things that Hagrid would stress when Harry learns about the Wizarding World.

*************** Yes it's absolutely something that everyone should be told when they're introduced to the wizarding world, but you're making an assumption that Hagrid told Harry all of the really important things he needed to know about the wizarding world, when there's no evidence that says he did (or didn't) tell him about the Statute of Secrecy and the consequences of breaking it.

We know that Hagrid left things out when he introduced Harry - he didn't tell him how to get on the platform, for example - and he in fact broke laws right in front of Harry and told Harry to look the other way. He busted into that shack and gave Dudley a pig's tail when a) you shouldn't use magic on a muggle like that, regardless of whether they know about magic or not, and he doesn't undo it and b) he's not supposed to have a wand to use magic with at all because he was expelled from Hogwarts. Hagrid sets the example for Harry that it's okay to break laws in the wizarding world.

And again, if it's such a major thing that a twelve-year-old should get expelled immediately for it, then by your logic, Bagman and all of the wizards/witches at the World Cup should have gotten into legal trouble. Sure, arresting hundreds of wizards at the Quidditch World Cup would be problematic, but they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, right?

**************** The way I see it is a range of severity. While yes Bagman and the other wizards broke the rules, it's a relatively easy fix. They know who they're mind wiping. Like you said, they've got an actual system for dealing with this kind of thing. Some idiot accidentally shows the muggle selling tickets magic, quickly obliviate them no harm no foul. We see this in Fantastic Beasts 1 when Newt accidentally shows Jacob magic and is prepared to obliviate him, almost like this is a common occurrence. However Harry and Ron didn't just accidentally show a spell to a specific muggle that someone can quickly obliviate. They flew the car over the heavily populated London in the middle of the day. The ministry now has to figure out how many people saw it, who saw it, and track those people down to wipe their minds. And they have to account for who saw it, who they might've told, and whether or not people will believe them and possibly spread the word. If some homeless guy sees than it's not a big deal. But if a respected government official sees it than your secret world isn't gonna be a secret for much longer. This is why it's expected that this be made clear to all 11 year old wizards, arguably making it irrelevant if Hagrid actually told Harry. If the wizarding world had been exposed that day, I highly doubt the courts would give Harry a pass because the giant who picked him up forgot to mention that showing magic to muggles is a big nono
