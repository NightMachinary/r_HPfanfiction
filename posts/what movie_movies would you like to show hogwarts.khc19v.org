** All of the Disney Princess films. Lord of the Rings/Hobbit. A lot of M. Night Shyamalan films tbh. The Alien series. A lot of Pixar films too.

I think these kinds of films showcase the average 'muggle' view of magical/supernatural worlds pretty well. Fascination with the concept of something more being out there than just plain humans. The artistic direction in the films I'm thinking of would be interesting to have the residents of Hogwarts see.

Like hey, muggles have changed and while there will always be the religious dipwads out there, they aren't the majority anymore.

** There's actually a scene in Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) where they open a Hogwarts cinema. They first show The Lion King because it doesn't require any knowledge of the muggle world to understand what's going on. Later they get more bolder with Star Wars.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
