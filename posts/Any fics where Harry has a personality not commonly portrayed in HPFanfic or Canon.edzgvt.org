  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.

** One that springs to mind is In the Mind of a Scientist, where harry is the archetypal mad scientist. like actually mad, not the quirky weirdness that might be charming. I didn't read much because there were a lot of needles, and I don't like imagining needles. But it seemed pretty unique from what I remember

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

It is slash but I think it's pretty good. Harrys personality is a mix between Luna and Dumbledore.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.
