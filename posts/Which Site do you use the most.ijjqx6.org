** Not much of a point in having "godly" filters when so many authors purposefully mis-tag their fics to get more clicks, and the rest does it by mistake.

In spite of ao3 being better in many regards, the tagging system and the general insanity of the userbase still pushes me to use ffnet + scryer more.

** AO3 because the quality of writing is generally better over there and you can actually search for stuff. And you can load everything up as one, instead of clicking to load up more chapters.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of disturbing pairings. Am a Snape fan. Lots of Hermione/Snape, Snarry and more. Remus/Snape is okay, but /Snarry/? Just personal opinion but nooooooooo. Age gap, they hate each other /and/ teacher-student relationship beyond just kinda friends is really morally not good.

FFN is alright. But stuff on there tends to be not as well written from what I've seen (quite a lot is good; just more likely to find the twelve-year-old writing their first fic).

And don't even think about Wattpad. /vomits/

** Mostly ao3 because of the option to filter out things I don't want to see in a fic. My list of excluded tags is so long I fear trying to find anything to read on another site would be a nightmare.

** These days, I usually use FFN and Ao3, but mostly FFN as I find the tags on Ao3 so unweildly. On FFN, when I don't want romance, I just filter out romance, and that's it. On Ao3, very few people use the Romance tag, so I have to keep applying the filters to filter out specific relationships, as all the relationships that are tagged, aren't all readily showing up. I filter out Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Voldemort and hit apply, and then I have to filter out Harry/Lucius, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, apply those and repeat until any romantic pairing is removed.

*** Try applying general under the categories tag. That should reduce the amout of fics with a pairing tagged to a few percent out of 50 000 fics.

*** If you exclude the Underage warning it takes out most of those. It's not a perfect solution because not everyone tags it, and I really wish AO3 had some stricter rules on underage content to begin with (like FFN does), but it's something.

** So far I've mostly been using ao3 because it lets you download a whole story as html (maybe ffn does too, but I haven't noticed how). I don't particularly like ebook formats and I prefer to read offline without having to navigate between pages. Converting the html to plain text is easy with "lynx -dump". ao3's filtering is pretty good though I'd like it better if a few things changed.

** AO3 mostly. I like the filtering. What I did was apply all the filters I wanted - setting the filters to exclude explicit, underage, dodgy pairings and so on - and then saved the resulting filtered page as a favourite. This means that accessing the site via my favourite, it applies the same filters each time so I don't have to pick them again. I do also use ffn, but mostly when I'm following links that others have posted rather than going to the site and searching there myself.
