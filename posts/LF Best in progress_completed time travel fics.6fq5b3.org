What are some really well done time travel fics that are either in progress or completed?

Edit: I left out the fact that it should be Harry-centric.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Harry back in 1970, got down to business immediately, and was a lot more ass kicking than in "Delenda Est". This story is very promising and updates fast.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

#+begin_quote
  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.

The only criticism/warning I have for this story is it only seems to update once a year, but I like pretty much everything by this author. Everything but the Twilight fic, and judging by the other stories it's probably good too.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck.
