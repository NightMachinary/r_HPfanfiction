I honestly just want to see a character heavily struggle with the fact they have no money. any weasley is fine, other characters are too. But I'm more interested in female characters struggling.


** I'm starting to pull together the plans for a Lupin-centered fic that would have emphasis on this sort of thing. My question to you, and others, is what you would expect/want to see in terms of magical poverty?

*** In terms of Lupin, I'd like to see him trying to weave around werewolf laws while living this poor lifestyle. He should be probably be treated as sub human as canon suggests werewolves usually are. Difficulty in walking in public areas such as Diagon Alley, preferring to be in Knockturn Alley, presumably the dark rich families take advantage of the poor and give them oddjobs such as murder,theft,espionage etc. Because he's poor Lupin has difficulty getting a regular dose of Wolfsbane potion (maybe fucks with his sanity?) Maybe a lack of love life too. Money + Status is important for females in the wizarding world me thinks.

*** I don't think food is too big a deal. Remember the Weasley's survive off of Mr Weasley's paycheck and still have plenty of food on the table for everyone, including Harry. They are even able to feed the Order when they come around.

As far as we know healthcare and school is paid for via the taxes. This makes logistical sense as they are things that everyone has to have acces to if you want to keep the society hidden. Ex. People with donkey ears are pretty damn obvious.

I think the biggest problem is material goods. One thing to take notice of is they probably cost a lot more than muggle stuff. They don't have the same type of mass production as muggles as far as we know.

If you write something with kids in it then remember that for kids then material goods means a lot. Kids often believe that people who have more things are inherently "better" because they have what they want. It's more complicated than that, but you get the idea...

Enchanted items are very expensive. If you write a story where they have something that is enchanted then have your protagonist consider selling it. If it is an heirloom or something which their friends gave them then that can really tear them apart, knowing that it could make everything easier but that the item means a lot to them.

In terms of Lupin you should remember that people don't know he is a werewolf before Snape tells everyone at the end of book 3. He probably comes up with other excuses to why he isn't come into work around the time of the full moon, but it ends up with him being laid off anyway.

Except they aren't technically permitted to do that. Statute of Secrecy and all that, not to mention that the generic Reparo is pretty limited.

It's like people never recall that not everyone is as skilled as our protagonists or has +a walking library+ Hermione on their side. The average wizard cannot in fact do all of those things, especially Aguamenti which happens to be a NEWT-level spell only taught (in Magical Britain at least) to people with firmly above-average grades in Charms. In other words, a good half of the magical population if not more don't know how to create water on demand, especially considering that being in a NEWT-class is not a guarantee of passing that class.

People tend to scoff at the whole "Ancient and Noble Houses" trope, but to my mind things tend to make more sense if Magical Britain actually /has/ an aristocracy for a reason, and that the Hogwarts-Durmstrang-Beauxbatons triad is the magical equivalent of the Ivy League, and only accepts people who are /super/ talented at magic, or at the very least above average in their capacity to cast it.

******* As far as the magical triad goes, I get what you're saying, but I tend to think of the magical schools in a bit of a different light.

I would see those three as very Ivy League in the way you are saying, but very traditional magic. Sure, there are breakthroughs, particularly when entrepreneurs get involved, but overall pretty traditional.

I imagine, due to the populations and intermingling of cultures, that Ilvermorny & Castelobruxo would be more innovative, more likely to mingle different theories and types of spells and magic together.

Then Uagadou & Mahoutokoro really have their own style and traditions that aren't always easily integrated in bits and parcels, so largely end up in their own very strong systems, but little used by the others.

Hence, they'd all be very magically strong, but all in different ways.

Much like you see in higher education in the U.S. today, the Ivies still have a lot of the prestige, connections, etc. However, many students (particularly in the sciences) opt for the MIT & Caltech (Ilvermorny/Castelobruxo, in my mind) options.

Alas, just a theory, but one of the best parts about fic is the differing opinions/ideas.

**** You might have trouble getting good housing, but you could stay dry with the impervius charm, and transfigure stale food into edible food, and use warming charms to keep from shivering. Transportation would be a snap using apparation. It would not a good life, but it would be far superior to the life of a similarly poor muggle. Of course, if you're bad at magic, you wouldn't be able to do the food transfigurations, your impervius charms would leak, and the wind would whistle through your warming charms and steal away your comfort.

The big disadvantages of being a poor wizard (with decent skills) would be in getting health care (potions are expensive) and education (we know Hogwarts costs money.)

*Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect*, linkffn(9065880), contains lots of this theme. Ginny especially was suffering a lot in this story because the Weasleys couldn't even afford to buy her a decent wand. Harry only showed up at Hogwarts after year 6 and things quickly turned around.

**** Because Harry did give Weasleys some favors from time to time, such as Ginny's textbooks in year 2.

Harry's presence at Weasleys also gave them a certain level of political clout, I guess. In this story for example, Arthur was blamed for the petrifications caused by the Diary and sacked from the Ministry, which made their finances far more precarious as a result.

They couldn't even afford a suitable wand for Ginny, and she thought she was a near squib. Ginny was bullied, humiliated, and ridiculed throughout her first 5 years at Hogwarts, until Harry finally arrived in his year 7 and immediately mobilized the other three houses against the bullying Slytherins.

***** I haven't finished the story yet, but I think from the sounds of it, I disagree with the decision Mr and Mrs Weasley made. A wand is very important, so I'd be making sure the kids had a decent a one as possible, and letting the books take second place. I'd also be complaining about having to buy so many books that aren't even textbooks, and telling the kids they'd have to share. How many were there? Seven? Ridiculous. I'd be buying two sets and telling the five kids to share - only two of them would be in class at the same time, the twins. Surely the books don't change very much, Ginny must be able to inherit some books from the oldest five, at least. Ron managed with Charlie's old wand well enough, and even Neville must've gotten by with his dad's - you can't tell me they couldn't find something.
