** I have an archive of the site as of 25 September-ish, though due to an oversight I don't have the text of NSFW fics. I'm going to put up an archive, but if you need anything before then, let me know.

*** It seems to be working for the moment, but more often than not I can't get pages to load these days, I just get errors.
