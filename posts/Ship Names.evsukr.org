Is it just me that thinks Portmanteaus are a really boring way to do ship names? Like, just sticking the two character's names together might be clear and concise, but it's quite dull. Like, the Harry-Fleur ship would be Fleurry with the Portmanteau method, but it could be FlowerPot, which is kind of interesting. Or Lunar Harmony for Harry, Luna, and Hermione. Shit like that. I find the latter far more interesting personally, but I'm curious what the rest of y'all think.

Also, what interesting pseudo-names can we come up with for other pairings? Like, what would Harry-Ginny be instead of Hinny?

*** Same. The only time I like a ship name is if it results in something really hilarious sounding. "Snack" still makes me laugh.

** My favorite one I've seen for a reasonable-ish ship is Pots n' Pans for Pansy/Harry. Another one I like, but is far, far more niche, is Gin n' Tonic for Ginny/Tom Riddle. Can you tell I like weird Slytherin ship fics?

** So oddly enough, after I replied to this post today, an author on an HP fic forum I frequent was talking about writing a Sirius/Lily and wanted a name for for the ship (I think I've heard the portmanteau Sirily but she was batting around other ideas).

I suggested, instead of a portmanteau, Stargazer.

Because it's...you know...a type of lily...and Sirius is a star... /-awkward geek smile-/

*** Nice one! I personally usually refer to it as Sily and it's what I've seen the most. Also fits my personal taste of it, even if the majority don't find my own preferences any better :P

** Harry/Ginny, prior to OotP, was called HMS Orange Crush, though not sure where that originates from. Post-OotP it was called HMS Chocolate, originating from that scene in the library where, for the second time in that book, Ginny cheers Harry up, discussing about how to contact Sirius while eating Easter chocolate eggs. Have also seen the less common HMS Emerald Flame, used by the defunct "The Firelight" forum/fic archive.

** I know I've heard of more “creative” ship names in the past (years ago) that I thought were pretty common at least at some point. I couldn't recall any by memory except Pumpkin Pie for H/Hr. Also one that is in widespread use now obviously is Wolfstar (Remus/Sirius).

I googled to try to recall any previous names and came across [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names][this Fanlore article]] listing a bunch of ships and their portmanteaus and “nautical” names (e.g., HMS Pumpkin Pie). Some of them are pretty fun. Some I wouldn't have necessarily adopted myself.

I like FlowerPot, though!

Edit: Would be cool if I actually linked to the article, right?

*** Pfft, nah. Take all the fun out of it, why don't you? Everyone knows you're totes supposed to just mention an article with some slight context and let everyone frantically scour the web for any mention of it. Make 'em earn that info. :D

Thanks for saving me some time though. :)

** I like that there are different ways to do ship names... they aren't all like portmanteaus (that said, there are some portmanteaus that sound nice to me-- lumione is just pretty to say). That's also SS Evil Genius apparently.

I know in Star Wars there's StormPilot (Finn/Poe) and JediStormPilot (Rey/Finn/Poe)... RosePilot is especially cute.

** There's a few memorable ones like Wolfstar (Sirius/Remus), Starbucks (James/Sirius), but some are vague. It's not clear what flowerpot (Harry/Fleur) refers to by name. It could have meant something like Jily or something else. Then there's shipnames thst can be outright misleading like Ginger Snaps. The first time I saw it, I thought it referred to Snily (Snaps->Snape, Ginger->redhead->Lily). It actually refers to Jily. I never really understood it, how it references James, and to me Lily isn't even a ginger (not that my guess was better here but it was the only thing I could think of)

This is why I generally use fused names, or just Char1/Char2.

And some fused names are great. While I don't care for Snape/Sirius, I always got a bit amused seeing it called Snack. There's also Honks.

**** To me, "ginger" means the kind of color Weasleys have as their hair color -- borderline orange.

Meanwhile, I always pictured her with auburn hair, which is a darker red. I think the books actually mention it somewhere, allthough I don't remember where.

** creative naes would be great because if you don't kno them you get to read the story and have the wondrous ahhhh moment when you finally work out how the pairing name fits. Also if you want a name for HarryxGinny it is Shit because thats just my opinion. Also anything to do with smoking weed because Harry's pot and Ginny's fire, or firing a clay pot now that I think about it. Ok I definitly like calling them the 'Blunt' pairing.

Hinny is officially changed to the 'Blunt' pairing.
