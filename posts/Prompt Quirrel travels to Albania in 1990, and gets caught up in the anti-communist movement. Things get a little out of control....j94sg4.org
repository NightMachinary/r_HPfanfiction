*** Quirell changes his name into Kiril Kiroshevic and single handedly wins the war by using magic. He re-unifies Yugoslavia and covertly uses magic to turn the nation into a European power house. Lord Kiroshevic achieves in a few years what Voldemort failed to do his entire life.

​

"We must seize the wands of production, for the sake of the Yugoslav people!" - Kiril Kiroshevic, prior to his stunning conquest of Zagreb.

****** Highly doubtful. The first six months of communist rule in Russia showed Stalin that was impossible. The FARMERS were in near open revolt as they saw the fruits of their labour taken without what they felt was adequate compensation. That is, they saw the slackers being equally rewarded as the hard workers, and refused to plant the crops. A modified form was allowed in which the farmers were allowed large private gardens where they could grow and sell their excess to others. The constraint was that they could not HIRE anyone to work for them.
