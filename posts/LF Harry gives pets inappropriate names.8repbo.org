He gets a Turtle? Calls its Voldetort. A dog? The Bark Lord? A Rabbit? Bunni who must not be named. Silly names that get him in trouble.


** Got more. An Owl? Lucius Owlfoy. A Toad? Umbridge (Especially if he gets it during fifth year) a Rat? Peter Pettigrew. , or Wormtail for short.

** Well I suppose there is linkffn(So Sue Me by lunakatrina), really weird story, long abandoned and incomplete but what is there is funny. Harry names his owl Voldemrot and doesn't see anything wrong with it, mainly because his defining character trait in the story is being a sarcastic little shit.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

**** Rarely have I seen an accent even harder to parse than Hagrid's; well done there.

To explain and all accents aside, my point was that [[/u/LittenInAScarf]] had already come up (seemingly off the top of his head) with enough funny ones to prove he could write quite the one-shot. So I'm telling the talented writer in question to stop wasting their time asking for something so specific in spite of clearly having the ability to write it on their own for the /rest/ of us to delightfully read.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
