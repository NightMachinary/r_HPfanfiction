and explains why they should actually be punished for what they had done and not gaining points. How Neville should be the only one to genuinely gain points and Snape takes some points off him so that Slytherin wins and everyone except Gryffindor has some respect for Harry to some extent.


** Ya know, when I read the title I was thinking in memes, "do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?". And then in the post, "they had us in the first half, not gonna lie."

*** No, I remember this one because I just read it recently. Harry had stolen the Sorting Hat at one point during the year, and he produces it, reminding everybody that Dumbledore had threatened 150 points lost to whoever stole it, forcing him to take the points away. Let me check my history.

**** I don't know if it's what OP is looking for, but I do know what you are talking about:

His Own Man - linkffn(5453054)

It is time travel, with Harry going back to his younger self. The general theme involves Harry getting closer to Slytherin students because he wants to give them a choice. He doesn't want them caught between the impossible options of following Voldemort and following Dumbledore. Slowly and gradually, he makes an impact while also struggling to remain independent of Dumbledore's manipulations. Dumbledore isn't evil, I don't think, but he's not quite “good” either - at the very least, his use of immoral mean to achieve otherwise moral ends renders him unacceptable to Harry.

It's sadly not finished, and given the time since the last update I doubt it ever will be.

  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

  A series of one-shots, which may or may not be considered connected, from a world where Harry Potter did not turn off his brain when sorted into Gryffindor. Usually Harry, but not always.

** Sorry, all. I have spent literally hours looking through my history and saved files, and can't find it. (Strangely I've learned that the word "hate" is very prevalent in HP fanfics.) I clearly remember him thinking his house is going to hate him for this, when he decides to stand up for what's right.

Here are some more details, in case it spurs somebody's memory.

- Harry really, really doesn't like Dumbledore in this fic. It might be time-travel, it might be that he learned early that Dumbledore is the one who left him at the Dursleys, or it could just be that he recognizes attempted manipulation. It might be one of the ones where Dumbledore blocked all attempts by the Muggles to remove Harry from an abusive home. Bottom line: Harry really doesn't like Dumbledore.
- Harry has played many pranks over the course of the year. (I'm leaning toward a time-travel because of what he's able to do, or maybe he just has a time-turner or elf accomplice.) Dumbledore is the butt of most of them, which has caused him to be very angry with the prankster, whom he can't identify. Of course initial suspicion falls on the Weasley twins, but they are able to convince others it isn't them.
- When the Sorting Hat is first taken, Dumbledore announces in the Great Hall that there will be no questions asked if it is returned. He gets angrier the longer the hat is missing (and the other pranks continue), prompting him to announce the massive loss of points to whomever is caught with it.
- When Dumbledore gives the extra points at the Leaving Feast, Harry stands on the table and announces that if last-minute points are given, then they must also be taken. He reveals the hat. Dumbledore obviously doesn't want to take the points, so McGonagall does it. Then he announces being out after curfew, and I think another offense. Ron is unhappy but joins Harry by standing up to announce that he too was out after curfew.

I hope somebody can track this down, because after all these hours of searching, I want to read it again, too.
