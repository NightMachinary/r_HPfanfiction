  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** linkffn(12597395)

linkao3(11682105)

Not NSFW as of now but this is a very high quality LVHP that I've been following from the beginning. It updates fairly regularly. It's unconventional in a good way, a bit of a slow burn, with an unusual plot.

Harry is the Master of Death; this story features a canon Harry that has been reincarnated again and again, living as different people in different worlds. The only thing in common is that he always defeats Voldemort. In this world, he is Harry Potter again for the first time, and the Chosen One is his older brother Jonathan Potter. This Voldemort is different from all the other Voldemorts, and Harry forms a bizarre relationship with him.

I don't like LVHP as a ship, I'll be honest, but this story is so engaging and original that I don't mind the ship. It's honestly written in a way that makes the ship not only believable but interesting. I highly recommend it in general as a fic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.
