Assume you have magical ability roughly equivalent to an Auror.


** I think the best way to go is to pick a specific industry and take a significant market share - the obvious candidate being the energy industry. If you go by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_oil_and_gas_companies_by_revenue][this]] table, the oil and gas industry is worth around US$5.3 trillion in revenue /per year/. So even with just a 20% share of the global energy market you would become a trillionaire in short order (assuming low costs).

Power plants with turbines enchanted with perpetual motion I think is the way to go. The key is big ticket items, because there's no way one wizard can enchant enough batteries to improve their performance.

Though if you wanted to do it with no social conscience: buy a load of old, depleted oil wells. Cast replenishing charms on them. Sell your infinite supply of crude oil for $20/barrel and monopolise the world's entire oil industry. Then watch the economic and political chaos unfold.

*** Step 1: Make a little money with other methods like house renovations, a few million dollars should be enough.

Step 2: Buy expensive materials that can be duplicated with magic. Use this to get to a few dozen million. At this point people will notice you and might ask where you get the money from, so be careful.

Step 3: Create a fusion startup. After a few years of wasting money on prototypes that don't work, use magic to power one and make it look like legit fusion power.

Step 4: Go public with the company to make enough money to start mass production of magic fusion reactors.

Step 5: Supply the world with green cheap power.

Step 6: A few years later, release small portable magic generators that look like cold fusion devices and sell them to automobile companies to power cars.

Step 7: Your fusion startup is now powering most of the world and you're a trillionaire.

**** We've only seen the refilling charm used on liquids, so I'm going to assume that it doesn't work on solids like diamonds. So a wizard wouldn't have an infinite supply of diamonds (assuming diamonds can be created with magic).

Aside from that, the market for diamonds simply isn't there. Oil has value because it is useful. Diamonds have value because they are rare. Flooding the market with diamonds would destroy the value of the item.

***** Diamonds aren't actual that rare. There's just a cartel that controls and limits the supply. You could also use the duplicating charm to make duplicate diamonds rather the refilling charm. But I agree they aren't actual useful.

The only potential problem with oil is one of scale. Size is important in magic. While you could certainly cast a refilling charm on an oil well, would it refill enough to be useful? For personal use, yes, but for industrial export? Human magic seems to like working on a human scale. We've seen the refilling charm work on bottles, never lakes for example.

****** Well, even in the cartel situation, diamonds still are rare. They're just rare for a reason other than natural scarcity. That said, the "diamonds aren't rare, it's all artificial" is one of those commonly-repeated internet facts which misses a lot of nuance. While it's true that diamonds are not rare in general, and that diamond companies hoard large stocks of them, /gem quality/ diamonds are still quite rare, especially towards the upper end of quality.

Regardless, the "you don't want to flood the market" argument holds.

The problem with duplication vs. refilling is exactly as you say: scale. With duplication, the wizard will have to cast the spell for each duplication. With refilling, you just have to cast one spell. The extent of the refilling charm doesn't really matter - you just charm the wellhead itself with the refilling charm, so that even if it only affects a bottle-sized area at the top of the well, it's still going to continuously refill it such that you have an infinite supply.
