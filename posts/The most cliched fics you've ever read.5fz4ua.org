  In this story, I'll be loosely following canon, but instead of luck, Harry will use his intelligence to get out of situations. He will be stronger than canon but not enough that he can be counted as 'op', at least not to an extent where Voldy becomes a non-issue. This will be a humorous fic, to an extent and will exploit, to an extent, the lack of common sense that wizards have.

******** I mean, it TECHNICALLY qualifies...?

And remember, it's the /lack/ of common sense that wizards have. Because apparently wizards, as a whole, are genetically retarded in addition to some of them being inbred. It's not like they have an entirely different worldview, much like someone living in 3rd world Africa compared to someone living in Britain. No, they're just stupid.

Gettin' real tired of this shit.

** Hard to pick out a specific one from this list - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=5549]]

More disturbingly are the authors who do it in a completely serious manner as if their ideas are completely original and new.

**** Why would you do that to yourself? Just out of curiosity, was there ever any struggle or real conflict or was it just Harry godstomping everyone who looked at Hermione funny?

***** The premise was interesting (not the execution), and it was so highly rated. By the time I got halfway through (what like 50 chapters in?) I had spent too much time to not finish it. I have a bad habit of having to finish stories. Oh and no, no struggle. It was 100 chapters of poorly executed power fantasy. What I really don't understand is why Robst seems to get H/Hr married as soon as legally possible. Like ok great the legal age of marriage in Scotland is 16 fine, but come on totally not necessary.
