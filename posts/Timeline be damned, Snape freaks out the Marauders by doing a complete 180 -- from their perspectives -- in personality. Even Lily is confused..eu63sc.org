I love 'peggy sue' fanfic, where the MC is sent back in time to relive their life. Especially if it's a version of Snape, who has gone through a lot of character development -- imagine how freaked out the Marauders (Sirius and James, in particular) would react to the new Snape.

  After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.[Story related warnings can be seen on the first page.

I know that my reading speed at 8-9 was not as good as it is now, and helped to make OotP seem excruciatingly long (well, that and the angst). Actually, the latter part might play into it too - it felt much longer due to annoyance with Harry. Annoyance that might pop up less in fanfic, at least in that sense.

*** linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) does have brief Snily, but doesn't last. I got the impression that, with Jily being a nonstarter (he found someone else) and Snape having residual feelings left from the first go-around and Lily not being entirely against it, they tried to date, but it didn't work out -- the sparks of passion simply wasn't there.

Incidentally, this is actually the fic that initially peaked my interest for a fic with the ship proper, so I suppose in a sense this fic is the reason it's one of the pairings I like the most.

** Would he really do a 180 in personality though. I love Snape fics but one issue I find with Snape time travel fics is that is he is portrayed as this nice, redeemed individual who has no issues acting like a student and has no emotional problems.

He was a death eater, he was absolutely not a nice person or someone who can easily connect to anyone. He was bitter and hated himself and everyone else. Also very sarcastic and relied on dark humour to interact with others. I just don't believe that he would wake up in the past and become this nice powerful person on the side of the light without some growth in personality. Just because he is in the past does not mean that he would stop despising Sirius Black or James Potter.

I would love to see a fic that actually explores his issues and how he would handle being thrown back in the past. The closest I have seen has been linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me by laventadorn). The author at least attempts to keep his former bad personality traits and does a good job with leaving in his sarcasm. There is a scene there where Remus remarks that the new Snape that he sees is extremely dangerous and has him convinced that Snape is about to kill him at one point. When Snape actually ends up helping Remus in a way Remus is just very confused.

Snape has to come to a realization himself that the marauders are just children who haven't experienced the war. That the Sirius Black who spent years in prison who he hates is not the same person as the one at Hogwarts. I always thought that it was great way to portray Snapes growth without Snape being nice or outright helping.

*** Your argument about Severus just not being a nice person is sound. Therefore, I propose the following:

Through employing gratuitous amounts of Occlumency, one Canon!Snape does indeed successfully portray the part of Past!Snape with a drastic, sudden, and unsolicited heel-face-turn in personality... BECAUSE his sense of humour is such that freaking out his greatest childhood nemeses makes for a brilliant pastime. Hehehe.

A partial and purposeful Cassandra-Truth. Snape's character /has/ evolved. Some. But not so much that screwing with the Marauders' heads doesn't sound /incredibly satisfying./ Perhaps he might even drop hints that aren't really hints that the Marauders read far too deeply into. For instance: his agemates (from both Slytherin and Gryffindor) begin to postulate that Severus has been Imperiused. He then feeds this assumption; for the lolz.

*** Personality is up for some change, I think - and a big part of Snape's canon personality comes from his bitterness (and blame) towards Lily's death. He basically wallows in that misery for over a decade - and you're right in the effect it had on him.

However, if you give him the chance to fix everything up? I could see him having stewed over the issue, agonized over what he could have done differently, or promised himself he'd do it better if he had another chance. Enough so that it can be justified to have him change his personality for fanfic purposes - though, like you say, I think it's much more /interesting/ to have him struggle with the change and not instantly become nice/helping.

**** I think he would, at least in the beginning, do pretty much a 180 in such a situation -- because he has agonized over it enough to have basically devised hypothetical scenarious and how he would play them out.

However, once he actually gets such an opportunity, and after the immediate concerns has been dealt with and he has run out of hypotheticals, I could see him struggle since he hasn't /actually/ turned into a nice, carefree and happy person, no matter how much fanon Peggy Sue SS usually depict him that way.

** There's actually a lot of Snape-centric Peggy Sue fics. The vast majority of them throws him back to the 70s (1971, 1976 -- the Mudblood incident, or post-graduation but before the Potter deaths) and are typically Snily fics, the rest throw him to the early 90s where he gets closer to Harry Potter (mentor/parental/etc).

linkffn(6413108) Severus goes back to 1991 and takes a more active role in Harry's life. Gen.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) Severus goes back to 1976 (start of 6th year, not the Mudblood incident) and puts focus on acting as a mentor figure to Slytherins and later, Head of House (again). Snily.

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me) Both Severus and Lily goes back to 1977, and tries to assimilate into school life but encounters trouble due to shenanigans by both the Marauders and by Death Eaters. Snily.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

** *Reboot* linkffn(9552519)

Snape is the MC for the first half. He goes back further than Harry and Hermione. Hell, he doesn't even teach at Hogwarts. His mother does though. Snape "wakes up" a few years before first year. He ends up along the lines of the adopted brother of Petunia/Lily. He doesn't end up with Lily. Petunia isn't a cold-hearted bitch. Neither does she marry Vernon (the scene where it happened is a good pennydrop moment). Harry and Hermione "wakes up"... a year or so before Hogwarts? I can't really remember.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
