I'm having a hard time finding a particular fic...

Tom is innocent, and was imperioused by Dumbledore as a Child, Harry reads out his diary in the Slytherin Common Room, A lot of characters essentially 'Time Travel' and regain their memories, includes the Twins, Lupin, Sirius, I THINK Tonks and a bunch of others I can't remember...

I hope that's enough information, since Google and my Memory has failed me!

Thank You!
