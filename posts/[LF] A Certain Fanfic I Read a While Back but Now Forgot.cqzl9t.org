** It doesn't have any SS/HP in it as the Mauraders et al are only 11 in the fic, but linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) has everything else. The sorting is briefly mentioned in the very beginning of chapter 14. There's a lot of Bellatrix Black in it; I'd expect that to be remembered more than Severus going to Ravenclaw.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I expected that to go one of several ways, but alas, I don't know of the one you're describing. I'd recommend linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe). Similar concept (although Snape doesn't play a major role). You might like it.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
