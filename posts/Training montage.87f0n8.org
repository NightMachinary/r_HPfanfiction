I'm looking for fics that have harry and the gang ( Can be any gang really) get themselves A) Swooped back in time, learning cool and old shit. B) Warped to a fantasy/other world where they learn otherworldly shit. C) Trapped in a book doing all of the above.

I remember a fic that have Harry, Hermione and Ron transported to DnD and Harry was a Ranger. It was pretty good. Anyways, thanks!

  I remember Hermione once telling me that I had a 'saving people thing,' and now more than ever that's evident to me. Three days in this reality, a place I was supposed to only chart for Hermione's possible tourism venture, and I'm already making plans to fixing. But what can I do? With villains and monsters running rampant, and the world barely hanging on?
