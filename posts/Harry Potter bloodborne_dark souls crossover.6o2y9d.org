Harry Potter bloodborne/dark souls crossover


** Only thing I can find so far with decent writing quality. linkffn(12057347) Seems to be a one-shot though. I'm personally looking for something with a bit more substance. Either cracky as I suggested here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ni79j/im_looking_for_some_of_the_silliest_dumbest_or/dkalf9b/]] or something post-Hogwarts with a bit more seriousness attached. I'd love to see a well-written Hunter Harry that manages to capture the terrifying tone of Bloodborne.

  Blood. Men were born from and undone by it. Madness and arrogance was all it wrought. Yet men lusted for it, lusted for the secrets it held. Dark Lords were no different in that matter. Slaying his young foe has stirred blood that runs pale and a dream never meant to be touched. Tonight, Harry Potter joins The Hunt.

** I'm surprised there aren't many Bloodborne crossovers, combining insight with magic is such an interesting concept.
