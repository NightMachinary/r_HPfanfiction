In this fic harry takes someone down to the chamber of secrets and tortures them to death.(I think it was either Rita Skeeter or Hermione but I could be wrong.) I'm not sure if he joins Voldemort or not. Any help would be appreciated.


** The fic you're probably thinking about is Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness]]).

*** I agree that it's likely that, but I'll put something else that fits the criteria. linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday).
