I read a story a while ago on fanfiction.com in which Harry Ron and Hermione got sent back in time to the age of the founders and Harry ended up knocking up Helena Ravenclaw , who then ended up having the first Potter. This was such a good story but for the life of me I can't remember the name. Does anyone know what it's called?
