** You need to make Voldemort more sympathetic than cannon and Dumbledore more openly ruthless. Instead of being about being bigoted towards muggles, Voldemort is fighting the ministry for freedom to explore all aspects of magic. Follow the dark magic isn't inherently evil trope. He's still a terrorist, but it's harder to hate him purely from an ideological basis. You can make a manipulative Dumbledore that sacrifices people and never grew beyond the greater good philosophy. Make him someone that's not above brainwashing children, taking hostages and executing enemies. Finally make the ministry suck a little bit more. Slightly more oppressive towards half breeds, etc. That way Voldemort is even justified in trying to overthrow the ministry and Dumbledore is more despicable for trying to preserve it. In a situation where everyone sucks, it becomes harder to cleanly identify the good guys.

Depending on how you want the story to go you can even disregard the prophecy or make it so prophecy is only self fulfilling in this AU. That way Harry doesn't automatically has to kill Voldemort and the struggle to pick who to fight for is more meaningful.

Lots of Tomione fics use this strategy to humanize Tom a bit, and make his pairing with Hermione more believable - blood purity is sort of explained away as Tom using it to whip up support to take down an ineffectual, crooked (and quietly prejudiced) ministry, rather than a truly held belief. I think this has sort of mixed results with regard to operating somewhat within character bounds and believability, but it can be done with strong enough writing.

** It's not that hard, but you need to rewrite their motivations and methods. For example, you don't write Death Eaters as sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis who relished torture and murder and wanted to exterminate Muggleborns and Muggles. But they can be someone who fought violently for their traditions and rights, kind like the last Japanese Samurais.

On the other hand, Dumbledore, in control of the Ministry, was determined to change Wizarding Britain into a highly centralized (and autocratic) state. To achieve that, he needed to break the power of the "Old Families", with violence if necessary.

As for their methods and tactics, you leave canon behind and write what parties in civil wars generally do: atrocities on both sides. You can still have Bellatrix as the crazed sadistic warrior, but you can also write Frank Longbottom as the chief Order henchman who had killed and tortured many Death Eaters.

I will also change Voldemort's personality from that monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain. He will be not someone who rules by fear mainly, but through courage, leadership, persuasion, and protection. He is someone who will go to great lengths to exact retributions for the suffering of his followers; he shows both immense magical powers and strategic brilliance. In other words, this Voldemort has earned the loyalty and respect of his followers.

this is basically irrelevant but I feel the need to point out that the samurai rebellion was actually much more similar to the Death Eaters than it is usually portrayed. Samurai were wealthy and politically powerful, and sought to restore that position while purging the “barbaric” changes to Japanese culture

** I think that the others have pretty much answered your question: make the Order more ruthless and morally grey, while the Death Eaters should be actual people with actual goals, instead of (mostly) a bunch of one-dimensional villains.

What I think is important is where you go with the whole moral ambiguity angle. The thing is, there are *a lot* of fanfics which justify Voldemort and the DEs and/or villify Dumbledore and the Order, but most of them just go for a full perspective flip: the good guys become the bad guys and vice versa. The Weasleys are suddenly a bunch of villains who would like nothing more than to drug, rob and control the Boy-Who-Lived, while the Malfoys are about the nicest people you've ever met, and so on. And, well, aside from being unoriginal to the point of cliché, this isn't really "morally ambiguous" - it's still the same "good guys vs bad guys" story, just with the sides switched.

What would make for a compelling story, IMO, is if /both/ sides could be reasonably considered "good guys": they would both have ideas that are worth fighting for, they would both genuinely believe in what's best for Magical Britain, but - as it often happens - their ideas are just incompatible with each other, and the increasing levels of hostility between them combined with either side's inability to back down would eventually lead to a full-blown civil war. Once again, as another commenters have said, both sides would have good and bad people, and both sides would ultimately become more and more violent in desperate attempts to win.

For instance, you could write Dumbledore as a conservative whose experience with Grindelwald has left him with a deep aversion for any sort of sudden change within the magical society, and Voldemort as a revolutionary who believes that the Magical world is stagnating and needs to change. They would both believe that they are fighting for the good of the people, and, furthermore, that the /other side/'s actions would eventually lead to the destruction of the society they are living in.

Or you could have a Voldemort who's still mostly out for himself (if not quite as sociopathic as he was in canon) versus a Dumbledore who wants to bring about a better world - and would stop at nothing in order to do so, even if it means destroying the old families holding back progress, or forbidding the knowledge that could be used for evil ends. In other words, a classic conflict of individualism vs. collectivism.

tl;dr "although a conflict between Good and Evil can drive a good story, it's not half as riveting as a conflict between Good and Good"*

** Depends on what you are really asking. Do you want to make the War between the Order and the Death eaters one where good and bad are subjective? Or do you want a war where it is unclear who is in the right?

The first is the more interesting one, the second is bigotry apologia.

In the first, you create a varied AU. You can't have moral ambiguity when literally one sides platform is bigotry. Bigotry is bad and wrong. So make the Death Eaters a sympathetic band using morally grey violent means to accomplish their ends. To keep thematic ties to canon make them a resistance to a cultural and political takeover (pne with actual valid concerns, not bigotry dog whistles). Muggleborn and current government policy are driving out traditional wizarding religious activity, and (valid, not discriminatory) traditions and politics. Have them have tried to work within the system, raise their concerns validly and get ignored, have a leader assassinated or thrown in prison, along with a number of followers, let the rest become violent activists/terrorists/resistance depending on point of view.

Make the Order more of a concerning influence on politics. They are a group trying to enact changes that they think are right and make things better, but they are an external group with a concerning infiltration of the government and educational system at multiple levels, whose members are loyal to one man and his vision.

If you just want the second path, where the Death Eaters are still bigots but there is still visual moral ambiguity from an in character perspective, show some areas where the actions of the Death Eaters are indisputably good, and not just for non-muggleborn. And also show some conerning things about the order and decisions/actions they've made. Be careful not to fall into the trap of showing Death Eaters in a positive light unless you are going to drop the bigotry completely.

** This is very easy to do, and very hard to do well.

For instance, giving Dumbledore a scheming hidden motivation that is nefarious works, but is also a bit boring and overdone. The bigger problem is that Voldemort is one of the most categorically and archetypally evil characters ever written, right up there with Emperor Palpatine.

/IF/ I were to do this, this is how I would go about it:

** Adjusting Dumbledore
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adjusting-dumbledore
   :END:
I wouldn't make Dumbledore evil, I would make him inept. He's portrayed as so powerful that he doesn't even really need to use his power in the books. So all-knowing that he doesn't even need to ask questions. Instead, make him only /convinced/ that he is these things, while in fact he's senile.

In this way, he can still have the same pure motivations, and even genuinely be working for good... but if he's unable to exert control, all his /followers/ will more independently express their own morals, letting you show the "light" side to be more fractured and less trustworthy.

Maybe his followers are there more for a blood feud they have with someone on Voldemort's side or personal grievance than for principle. (This is already almost the case anyway when you think about the people in the Order.)

Maybe he has all his powerful positions because he's uniquely someone who has genuine respect from the wizarding world, is easy to manipulate as a figurehead, but also is convinced that he's acting on his own plans and motivations.

This seems easier and more interesting than just twisting Dumbledore into another dark lord.

** Adjusting Voldemort
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adjusting-voldemort
   :END:
Personally I wouldn't want to just rewrite Voldemort's motivations. So instead, what I would do is use his most evil action to make him sympathetic: the Horcruxes.

The Horcruxes split his soul. What if /one/ of those soul pieces ends up in a situation where it sort of resets and gets to live a different life than the original Tom? Maybe it comes in close contact with Neville when he's a baby, supplants Neville's soul, and takes over his body. But Neville is just a baby, so at first Voldemort's soul doesn't "fit" into the new body... it doesn't have the memories, it doesn't have the motivations... just moments and flashes of feelings and dreams.

As the Neville-mort grows up (I chose Neville randomly, you could use an OC or literally any other character you're willing to sacrifice), he slowly pieces things back together, but now it's mixing with his "second life". He finds himself disgusted with who he used to be, but maybe also sympathetic to the things that the "true" Voldemort cares about.

This in effect lets you create a third character that takes the place of Voldemort as a character. The original Voldemort can remain something more like a "force of nature" within the story, like he was in the books. Just an inevitable consequence.

But it gives the space to flesh out a meaningful characterization of Tom, /and/ it also gives you the space to explore something that Rowling wrote in the books then */immediately/* contradicted with how she portrayed Tom: that people aren't inherently evil, no one starts out that way. They are made that way, and then they choose to be that way.

** Harry's Dilemma
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: harrys-dilemma
   :END:
I think the interesting thing here would be if Neville-mort reveals himself to Harry, and is the one that sees the morally questionable nature of the Order. Maybe Neville-mort reveals that he wants to remain neutral, but says he's informing Harry because if Harry decides to kill Voldemort, he'll have to kill Neville-mort eventually since he's a Horcrux, and he's leaving that decision up to Harry.

That makes the whole Horcrux aspect of Voldemort a lot more interesting, because it makes them a challenge to Harry as a character, not just a plot obstacle.

** 1) Voldemort needs to actually have a goddamn point. Canon is just him being incompetently evil for the hell of it. Maybe he's like in To Reach Without, where his entire purpose is to draw all the pureblood supremacists into a single group to eliminate them all. Maybe he just wants to rule. Either way, he needs actual goals and ways to accomplish them.

2) Play the Ministry and Dumbledore as the horrific oligarchy that it is. In canon, the good guys are corrupt government officials. Arthur Weasely is an excellent example. He has no functional knowledge of muggle society and technology, and yet he runs a major ministry department on muggle technology. He does favors to bail out his friends after they break the law. The government runs a kangaroo court system (when they bother to give the victims a trial before tossing them in the torture box.) Why on Earth would Harry want to support that? Why would Harry want to let them do whatever they want? Tearing down that system is a good thing. Of course, this would take some tweaking of Voldemort's ALL OF THAT BUT WORSE cartoonishly evil canon self, but whatever.

Hell, since I already brought up To Reach Without, let's include that Lord system that Dumbledore bashers love. Hogwarts is for people of a certain social standing and muggleborns (for reasons). The "everyone works in the government" tone from canon is entirely because they do, Hogwarts is the school for high-standing people. The entire rest of society is educated in other schools. Tom Riddle, having been harassed for years because of blood purity, discovers his heritage. It makes absolutely no difference, because they're racists and don't give a damn. His new nickname is mudsnake. He allies with Myrtle Warren, a fellow victim, and they start plotting. They rally the lower classes in an enlightenment revolution and immediately set upon terror attacks. The factions that form are the ministry pureblood supremacists who use the revolution as fuel for their bigotry, Dumbledore's faction of status quo supporters, and the majority of people, who want equality but not by murdering every government official. Tom's faction doesn't include the rich Slytherin crowd, since they're quite happy with the system and equating cleverness with evil like in canon is a goddamn stupid idea. Dumbledore puts together his Order, which as in canon is mostly recruited from technically-not-child-soldiers just out of school. See? They're adults! Snape and Lily still fall out, but this time as a result of Snape becoming radicalized in the much more overtly racist Slytherin house and Lily disagreeing about the violence.

Tom (because he's starting a people's revolution, he's doing it under his very common name) is by now waging war and learns of a prophecy about a potential threat (wording slightly altered because he's not a Lord and cares more about the revolution). The resulting battle when he attacks the Potters kills every participant, except for Harry and Sirius, who is promptly thrown in prison for +leaving the House of Black+ participating in killing the Potters. Dumbledore holds up Harry as some sort of messiah, to which people outside the upper class give a resounding meh.

When Harry shows up at school, the classist and tacitly racist undertones are much more overt, and the half-blood upstart stomps on all their precious pureblood protocol. How rude of him to not say "Well met, heir Malfoy" and all that. How very rude. Years one and two are a bit different in their events, but events still happen where Harry has to fight something. By the summer of year three, Harry's struggling with living with the Dursleys and being forced into fighting to protect people who hate him. When he runs away from them at the end of third year, he winds up meeting Severus Snape, who is running an apothecary on the edge of Diagon (not a single street, but a full town). Snape's not a teacher at Hogwarts because he was an associate of enemies of the state, but is having a great time doing research and taking apprentices. Seeing Harry as another abused child who slipped through Dumbledore's ironclad "don't give a damn" policies, Snape takes in Harry and mixes stories of his mother with comments on how Tom Riddle also got the "you must return to the dangerous environment" answer from Dumbledore. One comment from Snape about Sirius leads Harry digging into what happened to Sirius and trying to rescue him from the literal hell he's locked in. The end result is that while Harry hates Tom Riddle for killing his parents, he also absolutely despises Dumbledore's appeasement of the classist and racist elements that made his life so awful.

** Something I've wanted to try myself is Voldemort/death eaters agenda isn't blood purity, but freedom. Freedom from the ICW and the statue of secrecy. Why should wizards hide when they clearly have the power? Freedom for creatures like giants, and dragons to freely roam. Basically leading to genocide of the muggle world. Blood purity can still be a thing just like Superiority over muggles is, but it isn't a war against mudbloods it's a war on taking the planet from muggles and coming out of hiding.

** first thing you can do is simply make the good guys more powerful than the bad. the rebel alliance/underdog narrative generally only encourages a view of righteousness where if the order ever did some distasteful things it would be placed in the light of desperation.

have instead the order collect a wide range of allies. but ones that are not necessarily good. dumbledore attempted to negotiate with the werewolves and the giants. what if he succeeds here along with say the vampires and maybe some hags.

Fenrir Greyback in the order of the Phoenix. Fenrir wants more rights for werewolves, same as dumbledore and remus. what he wants to do with more freedom is another thing.

and then those house raids against suspected death eaters begin. its early days with voldemort during the fifth year. he still needs to regain his following only his inner circle has returned and even that is diminished by deaths and prison. old family homes are powerfully warded. the use of creatures like giants or contracts with goblin curse breakers would be what they would need to break through and "citizens arrest" suspects.

dumbledore does not have to be evil here merely not completely in control. after the reign of terror of voldemort people could be willing to play hard ball. arrests without warrants hassling suspicious people. or those groups who aren't elevated by an alliance with the order could be discriminated against by the order. aurors cracking down in Knockturn Alley and overturning businesses.

fudge can still refuse to acknowledge Voldemort's return but he could decide to restart the Manhunt for Sirius Black to a fever pitch. what if he decides to claim Sirius Black was behind the World Cup/the tournament/Cedrics murder/ and crouch jr.s escape and death?

it's a conflict without easy resolution because Harry would have to keep sirius a secret in order to keep the ministry working with the order. fudge is already paranoid this is a coup attempt after all, sirius being in cahoots with Dumbledore might be a political time bomb that might destroy any unity in the light faction.

there are plenty of light families who suffered losses. have them throw the first stone and semi competent voldemort could rally those neutral to his banner.

a big thing would be that i would encourage in such a change is make Dumbledore less omniscient. make him his actual age. a 90 year old man. old out of touch and dying. his calls for peace may actually work against the order or lose the legitimacy of his movement.

imagine like the last of the Mckinnons setting fiendfyre on the branch family of the Rookwoods home.

** If you don't want to completely change canon like most offer here, then lean more into the idea that a lot of the death eaters don't have a choice, because their families are in danger if they don't become death eaters (that would be a bit closer to WWII german soldiers instead of the SS/SA/Gestapo). Let Harry meet Death Eaters that fight desperately because they fear for their children/siblings lives, but maybe they would let those they don'\\
t have to brutalize flee. Like letting them just ignore some kind of info that hints at someone smuggling muggleborns out of the country.

And on the other hand, let the Order fight more desperate as well. Let them fight more in a guerilla war tactic way. They know who the death eaters are and don't fight them in the open, but attack and kill them at other times. I have a plot bunny story in my folder about one member actual hunt down the death eaters and those that support them in other ways (money, influence...) but that could lead to an old couple being murdered in their home, and that character would kill the sposes of death eaters as well, take their children (whip the memories and send them away, letting them be adopted by muggle families. The character justifies this, as giving the kids a chance to be good people. But a small part thinks it would be fair if the death eaters end up killing their own missing children for their twisted ideology)

You don't have to change the ideologies for either side, but you can play with individual ideologies just fine
