I find myself looking for a Fic where our beloved Harry steadily becomes more in touch with the darker sides of magic. Preferably no slash and i'm open to any pairings.

At first glance it looks like a typical wbwl, but its fantastic. No pairings.

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.

** linkffn(5353809) HP and the BWL, pretty well-known story

linkffn(2973799) Harry sees something in an enchanted mirror and can't get enough :)

There's another one I can think of but I forgot the name. It's where after Sirius dies, Harry starts to become obsessed with killing Bellatrix. It's Harry/Bella

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
