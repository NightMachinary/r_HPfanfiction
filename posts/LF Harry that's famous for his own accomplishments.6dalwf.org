Are there any fics where the Wizarding Britain, if not further, finds out about the troll and the Basilisk and dementors and everything else Harry's done? Where he's famous for being a kid that defeated several extremely dangerous monsters and saved several lives? If he's famous for being the BWL or not, I don't really care. I would prefer it not to be post-Hogwarts.


** well, he is already famous for defeating voldemort.

i mean shit this guy supposed to be some scary ass dark lord and yet he get defeated by 1 year old,11 year old,12 year old,14 year old.

shit might as well just retire from this dark lord business and go on vecation.

***** At the age of 1 and of 11 he did nothing (besides touching Voldemort). The magic that defeated him back then was his mother's work.

****** because no mother has ever died for her son/daughter.

pull the other one.

it started and ended with reflected killing curse, and as we all know, no "mother protection" was on him once he reached 17.

also we all know the whole protection thing was bullshit, it didnt save him from the dursleys, it didnt save him from dobby, and it didnt save him from the dementors.

******* Lily Potter did something that granted Harry this protection, something that went beyond taking the bullet for him. Whether it was some ancient norse ritual, dark magic or something of her own creation we do not know.

That magic protected Harry when he was one and when he was eleven. At that point the protection ran out of juice or Voldemort would have been dissolved before he could finish that resurrection ritual.

Tl;dr: Lily blasting Voldemort out of his body twice before Harry took over and defeated Voldemort in the end.
