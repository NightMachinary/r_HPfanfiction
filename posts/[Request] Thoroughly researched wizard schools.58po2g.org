I love extended universe stories especially stories involving non-UK wizarding countries or schools. Could anyone recommend any well written stories? I prefer ones that are very through and well researched, especially if they involve local culture. I'm sick of reading Mary Sue universes. I'd really appreciate help with this. Thanks!


** The best I've read (the only one that isn't a circlejerk about how shitty and backwards Magical Britain is, to be honest) is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity]]. Long, excellent and complete. Can also recommend Houses Divided on there if you're into Next-Gen fics, in case you've missed it.

EDIT: Also, while it takes place at Hogwarts and is a Next-Gen fic, [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/JPHEC_info.html][James Potter and the Hall of Elders Crossing]] by G. Norman Lippert is /very/ well written (as I recall, people were speculating that Rowling herself was behind it while it was being published); anyway, while it takes place at Hogwarts I did find the American exchange students (and their school, what we learn about it and the students and staff) very well written and researched. It's not the focus of the story, but still. Both of these deal with American wizarding society though, I've yet to find one about other places that doesn't degenerate into either the above mentioned shit-on-britain-athons, (slightly disturbing) exotification or both.

I've wanted to write a fic that takes places and involves wizarding society within my own culture (Nordic/Scandinavia), but I always end up writing something cringy as fuck that boils down to "WE WERE VIKINGS AND SHIT!".

*** Thanks for these!

I think there could be a lot of awesome magic that comes from the history of the region. You could go stereotypical and have a bunch of viking battle magic, or what I would do would be to focus on elemental manipulation. Have lots of magic that focused on charming water, or wind to carry your vessels across kilometers of ocean. Spells that extend the growing season or promote better crops. Or storied divination magic based on wood and runes. I feel like there's a rich basis for the universe.

As for school, I immediately go to a mountain enclave hidden from the world that practices intense magic which pushes the boundaries of nature and the body. If your environment is extreme, as many wintry mountains are in Norway, then you're forced to stay indoors and practice advanced magic. As someone who lives in Minnesota, I know that the Scandinavian culture has a rich magical universe waiting to be explored.

**** All good ideas. That's pretty much the reason I'd want to write it, there's a lot of folklore from which to draw that has the /feel/ of the HP verse but that I've never seen. A favorite is various magical creatures (specifically the Valravn, literally "Raven of the slain", supernatural ravens and by some accounts half raven-half wolf who have gained human knowledge by feasting on the fallen on battlefields... kinda like a Norse hybrid of a Sphinx and a Redcap, in HP terms).

Well, you already have some basis with a Durmstrang probably being there. You can go from here. I.e. there is a heavy focus on battle magic because there are many dangerous creatures, maybe something with magical ships.

**** Durmstrang to me has always been just "Russians in general and a few Germans, for some reason", really. That's how it's portrayed and that's what I see. You can make this work within canon though, just put the school on the Kola peninsula or something... I really do think that what we've canonically been told about it's location has to do with Rowlings lackluster knowledge of the geography of subarctic Europe. And I can't fault her, really, no one cares about that shit except me and the other five people who are insane enough to live here. Regardless, given the historical relationships of the region, having Scandinavians and Russians "united" like that would make no sense, at all.

The vision I've always had with my ideas regarding this has been that Nordic magical society would be very insular and very backwards, for lack of a better word. The idea being that due to the process of Christianization in the area having been a slow, bloody process (there were organized resistance against it for a long time, the process was not complete until the 1300s) making the magical population separate itself nearly completely from muggles early on (rather than with the Statue of Secrecy).

*** For Scandinavia, you could imagine a society where fosterage with maternal uncles is still widely practiced; where marriage intervenes after the birth of a child; give runic studies more importance and take it in other directions (for example, enchanting and cursing objects based on the inscription of poems with language-specific structures, and curse-breaking based on the comprehension and interpretation of said poems); integrate the sami tradition of music based divination; have gender specific magic rituals; see the clash between the old families who use divination to contact their ancestors, practice ritual magic (in the North and East), christians families who despise all forms of divination, and see the practice of magic and betterment of oneself at it as a command from God (in the South and West) and mostly non-religious muggleborns that find themselves courted by the two factions but really uderstand neither.\\
2 millenia of history with several very different cultures in interaction, there's much more than just the Viking phase to explore.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10101403/1/Fixing-Past-Mistakes][Fixing Past Mistakes]] is a good example, if you're patient enough. It has a very slow start, I don't think they actually make it out of Britain until Ch15 or so? The author has a unique and unpolished writing style that takes some getting used to, and the beginning of the story is a bit tropey (Manipulative Dumbles and Abusive Dursleys), but all of that eventually takes a back burner to the main story, which has Harry growing up in the Caribbean. It's not complete yet, but is still being updated.

Spoiler and one paragraph summary of the first 15 chapters, in case you don't want to read the tropey bits: [[/spoiler][Harry is killed by the Dursley's when he is 3 years old, and Dumbledore as been lying about getting updates on him. Everyone finds out he's dead when he doesn't show up at Hogwarts. Drama ensues, Dumbledore has a stress induced heart attack, and Minerva and crew find some spell to send a person back in time to change the past (except not actually change anything, the author does fixed timeline time-travel very well). They send Severus back (for actually well explained reasons), he goes back and gets Harry, and moves out of the country to raise him.]]

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Despite Shinji attending Hogwarts (at least so far), the Mahoutokoro plays big role throughout the series, Triwizard Tournament takes place in Durmstrang, there was a bigger mention of Nu'utea Kohu - school-ship from Pacific and character from other schools appear or will appear later.

Japanese heavily use ofuda, they also don't use apparition (due to centralisation of wizarding world in Japan), but have flow-walking, a combat oriented teleportation technique. The Hawaiians have kapua, their own twist on animagi.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
