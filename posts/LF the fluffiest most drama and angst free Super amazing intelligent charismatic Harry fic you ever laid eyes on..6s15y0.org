**** Well, I have no real experience with Shadowrun and I found Enter the Dragon to be enjoyable nonetheless; basically anything that differs from Harry Potter canon has something to exposition it.

Enter the Dragon was never finished, but it has one big long chapter that runs from Harry's initial transformation to his getting on the train for first year.

Only the first few sentences are boring, and they're exposition for why Harry becomes a dragon; once Harry turns into a dergy, the rest is one big silly comedy.

****** I'm glad you liked it! I think a sign of a good crossover is when it feels kinda natural, to be honest :) Shadowrun is a fantasy/sci-fi fusion with a huge noir/gritty cyberpunk leaning that somehow just /works/. The type of dragon Harry is is specifically from Shadowrun, with the weird bioalchemy and the love for hoarding stuff, and meeting Dunkelzahn (who is one of the Really Important Characters in Shadowrun). Anything about the Awakening is also Shadowrun, and anything about nexuses? nexii? and the unholy creatures locked away is from Rifts.

Since an RPG is basically just a story told by a group of players in an overarching setting, I don't find it that different from using a book or a film as fanfic material. If anything, it's easier in some ways because some RPGs really go to town with their worldbuilding and have a ton of notes for players.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

*** Wait, I know it's been a while since I read it, but iirc, Magical Relations is neither drama free, nor does it make Harry into a Mary Sue, which is pretty much what OP is asking for. In fact, I remember it being relatively serious, what with the side plot of [[/spoiler][Dudley struggling to come to terms with his mother's disgust for magic and subsequently him for being magical]] and the whole [[/spoiler][death of Anthony thing]].

Trust me, have a read of Harry Crow, then come back and tell me Magical Relations comes anywhere /close/ to being as bad.

**** Welp, seems I misunderstood OP's question. Weren't they asking for drama and angst-free Harry? Or was the title sarcastic?...in which case, nevermind my recs.

IIRC Magical Relations was quite stress free before they went into fourth year, and the Harry in this fic is quite drama and angst-free, a mostly well-balanced child. And no, part of the reason I haven't read Harry Crow is because of its notoriety...had I known OP was asking for fics like it, I would never have mentioned Magical Relations or Timely Erorrs, lol.

*** I just caught up to Magical Relations after reading it all week. Man, I'm in abject despair when I realize that it hadn't been updated in a year! The author had gotten all the way to sixth year. No one ever gets that far. I really wanted it to go the distance. :( And its probably one of the best written Draco's ever. The author actually confronted the blood purity issues instead of hand waving them away.

**** Well, I can think of two fics that got almost as far (or even further) and is on par with MR quality-wise, so you might want to check them out if you haven't. They're both pretty popular recs in this sub though so you've probably heard of them, but just on the off chance you haven't...:

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi)

HP&BWL has more chapters on the DLP forum.

But, yeah, I feel your pain :( That moment when you realize this awesomeness is over and you might have years to wait, or worse yet, never hear from the author again... At the moment I'm just hoping that evansentranced is taking a rl break and will return at some point. I do think they'll come back though, considering they also have the sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them to write, and if you look at the update pattern of MR, the breaks have become longer the longer the story got.

Definitely agreed on best Draco. For most canon-compliant Draco I'd go for OTWTG (in fact, for most canon-compliant anyone other than Harry I'd probably go for OTWTG, and the title of fave Dumbledore definitely goes to it), but evansentranced certainly knows how to make him charming and likable whilst still keeping him believable as Draco Malfoy. Same goes for her Snape. She's done an excellent job giving Dudley and Vernon character development, too.

But back to Draco - yup, the entire arc from fourth year to the end of fifth year is really impressive in terms of his growth and the transformation of his friendship with Harry, the way he struggled constantly between morality, family loyalty and friendship. It's what made his turn at the end of fifth year so believable - and man, now that I think about it, MR Draco had grown so much, really, and I admire him so much for turning away from his family and their values when it's all he'd ever known. And I would never have said the same thing about the canon Draco. Imo Rowling's arc for him feels kinda unfinished; he's left in a kind of awkward place like Severus, but I suppose that's how Rowling sees him. She doesn't see the possibility of real change for him, thus why it's doubly important for fanfic writers to go through that process before treating Draco as a reformed character, when most of them just...jump straight into the second part, I guess. Which, yeah, makes me uncomfortable, too, so I know what you mean. (It's even worse when some try to excuse it, ugh.)
