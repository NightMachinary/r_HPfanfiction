I am looking for something with an interesting story but with a bit of smut.

Lengthy fics (40k+ words) Complete or at the very least still with regular chapter releases.

I can go for just about anything. My favorite category is time/dimension travel. I don't mind dark Harry as long as he's not cruel and violent for that sake alone. Mostly happy ending oriented. Not too big of tragedy unless it can eek out at least a somewhat bittersweet ending: think linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm)

And thank you guys for any suggestions at all!

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** Thanks for the rec!

Is this a fic that follows cannon with a Harry/Hermione relationship? It doesn't really give much detail.
