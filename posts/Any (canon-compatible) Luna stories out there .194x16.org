I'm thinking of writing my own, but I want to see if anyone else has done it yet!


** There are some. What's your idea?

*** I was thinking of a life after Hogwarts sort of story, perhaps flashing back to her memories of Hogwarts. Looking at the HP wiki page for her, it sounds like there might be a pretty fascinating story there.

** "[[http://margottenenbaum.livejournal.com/23310.html][Quixotic]]". Ginny breaks up with Harry for 9 months. Post DH, pre Epilogue.

"[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7611783/1/Pair-the-Spare][Pair the Spare]]". Luna Scamander reminisces upon finding her spangled-silver dress robes at the back of her closet.

Both of these are quite bittersweet, in their own way, but well-written nonetheless.

** Most of the Luna stories I run into are a Luna/Harry pairing /(which I'm anything but opposed to)/ so I can't help immediately, but I'll keep on the lookout for you - Luna is my favourite character and I try hard to find people writing her well - and report back if I find anything.

** Yeah...I don't know of anyone who had written a Luna Scamander fic, I'm sure its been done.

There are plenty of canon compatible stories where Harry/Ginny and "Aunt Luna" all live together. My favorite referral to this ship is Flaming Nargles (H/G/L)

LiraSnape has long since stopped adding to her lists, but she has many lists of lists and all are worth perusing. Some may not like her taste, but it is a great place to find sub categories of genre for fics of a certain type. She did good work. The one above is specifically H/G/L, though I cannot remember which stories specifically are post Hogwarts (I'm sure the descriptions say so)

** This sneaks in the back door of canon-compliance, in that it could have happened but probably would have had further impact if it had.
