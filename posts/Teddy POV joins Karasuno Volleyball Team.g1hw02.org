I had this in my mind for a while now. Ever since I read Of Ties and Volley by I-Like-Pie-Too-Dean. This fanfic is a onshot with pairing Harry Potter/keishin Ukai

My imagination overwhelmed me and thought maybe (not Harry/Ukai this time) Teddy joins Karasuno, Yachi does not exsist and Victoire became the 1st year manager.
