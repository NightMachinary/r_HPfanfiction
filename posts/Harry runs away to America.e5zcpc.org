Doesn't have to be running away but a fic where Harry goes to America. Post war or Hogwarts age I don't mind but I'd rather it didn't spend too long on Harry being younger than 13


** bellerophon30's story /The Brave New World/ from the mid 2000s is the first that comes to mind. In the summer after 5th year Harry decides to leave Great Britain to go overseas and attend a magical school in the US.

In my memory it stands out as one of my favorites in the 'Harry attends a different school' category, but I also haven't read it in several years so I'm unsure how well it has aged and how much my tastes have developed since then.

It was originally posted on FF.net but the author pulled it a few years ago. Now it's available as a copy in several places [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/bnw/a/0/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][like this one]].

** Probably not what you want, because there is not much of presenting something specifically American, but linkffn(11916243) is all about Harry & Hermione running away to America and then returning back (not even permanently).

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.
