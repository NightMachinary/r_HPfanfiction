:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fanfic where Harry is adopted by the Malfoys and Harry and Draco became brothers/best friends. I am currently reading Motherly Love which is exactly the fic I'm looking for but it's too short and unfinished. So is there any Malfoys/Harry fic that's a good read? Thank you


** linkffn(Growing Up Black)

Not the fic you're looking for but it's still pretty similar.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the weird and wonderful story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II complete. (Warning: Part II ends on a cliffhanger. If you dislike that fact, Part II, Chapter 35, might be a better place to stop reading.) Part III is on indefinite hiatus.
