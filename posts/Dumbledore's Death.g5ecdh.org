Couldn't they have amputated his arm to prevent the spread of the curse? Or is there something about curses that prevent it so, I've missed from canon?


** I suspect the curse is more like leprosy (or Hansen's Disease if you prefer) rather than like gangrene. That is, you can cutoff a physical manifestation (or symptom) but the curse is on the body as a whole. If you cannot remove the curse (read: counter-curse, cure, etc.), it will continue to affect the afflicted.

** One fic I read recently they tried it but the curse was already all through the body within the first few minutes

** It was mainly contained within the arm, but it had already affected him. He was 100 percent going to die from it, but snape managed to delay it from killing him.

** I suspect anyone who designs such a fiendish curse (that can't be dispelled through normal means, that can't be halted; only slowed, that will slowly wither away your body, that slowly /spreads/ while withering away your body) would have spelled it against such trivial means.

It would likely resurface somewhere else, like on the other arm, or a leg.

I dislike it when powerful magics with a lot of thought and power behind them are defeated through such obvious and trivial means, often muggle in nature. There was one crackfic, surprisingly enough, that had the curse jump physical objects, so it transferred through some tongs into the wielder's hand. That I liked.

Curses are almost alive, especially ones that act stationary. I suspect one can adapt to a very high degree to remain effective.
