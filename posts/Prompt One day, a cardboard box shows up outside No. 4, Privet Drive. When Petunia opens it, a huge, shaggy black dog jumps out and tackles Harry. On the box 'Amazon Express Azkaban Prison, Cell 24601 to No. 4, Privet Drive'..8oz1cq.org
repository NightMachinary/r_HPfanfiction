** Hmmmm. That could potentially be a fun thing to write, but if I was clever Sirius, I wouldn't have myself shipped from Azkaban. Nope: I'd swim across the sea and find a sympathetic muggle who doesn't know who I am yet to ship me to my godson. And then Harry gets a new guardian-puppy, there's a dogfight between Ripper and Sirius, and harry and Sirius can fight Voldemort together.

*** Now the question remains, is OP refrencing any one thing in particular(Simpsons, Twin Peaks), or going straight to the source(Les Mis√©rables). If anyone is confused just search up 24601, you should be able to find it out there somewhere.

Thanks,\\
