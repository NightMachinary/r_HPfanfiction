Any fic where Harry has more close friends than just Ron and hermione without bashing anyone Preferably avoiding the trope with multiple lordships and insane amounts of money and marriage contracts also where Harry isn't as passive about learning about his family I like multi fics just when they are well written and done slowly rather than just written for the lemons No slash unless canon and no harmony and no hinny


** Bruh I'm looking for a timeline where I have mire friends. Any help?

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
