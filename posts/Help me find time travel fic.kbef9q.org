:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember this fic pretty well, I just can't think of the name. Hp travels back in time, is a Slytherin, and James and lily aren't dead but are in hiding. He's not supposed to know this. In his second year he corners snape and takes lily's hair from shapes locket or something and kisses snape. It's explained that polyjuice doesn't work on dead people. Snape avoids him and basically never speaks of it again. In third year, he petitions to get a time turner and keeps tweaking hermiones nose because she has one too but doesn't know about his. I think he also may have had a pet snake? And I'm like 95% sure he traveled back in time to explain why he's so op.


** I've read this. Let me think.

IIRC this is the one where he kills Voldie, bops around for a while as a badass Auror, then stumbles across living Dumbledore, James, Lily, and a couple of younger siblings born after Halloween 1981. He realizes that his entire life was orchestrated, so he travels to the past to do it over.

Because he's a time traveller he does well in all his classes. He made sure he came in 1st place at the end of second year but doesn't ask to take all the electives until the beginning of third year. That way Dumbledore has already approved it for the Gryffindor in 2nd place and has to allow it for the Slytherin in 1st place, but Harry was sure that if he asked at the same time as Hermione, then Dumbledore would have denied them both.

Each time turner has just enough time sand for classes so the kids can't abuse it. Harry convinces Hermione to take him back with her instead of two separate trips; she doesn't realize he's using the sand he saves to break school rules.

At some point he does a ritual in the Forbidden Forest naked in the snow. Snape feels the ritual energy and comes to bawl him out.

...all this and I can't remember the name! I hope someone else does because now I wanna reread it.

*** The beginning of that sounds like linkffn(Travel Secrets: First by E4mj). I don't know if the rest matches up because I dropped it after a few chapters, possibly because I noticed that the series appears to have been abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
