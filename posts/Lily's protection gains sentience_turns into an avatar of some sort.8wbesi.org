There are a couple of fics where the Horcrux in Harry's head converses with him in his mindscape or projects a shape/ghost of some sort, but are there any stories where the same happens to Lily's protection?

For example, Lily "returning" as a Cortana-esque avatar which helps Harry out or her ghost hanging around her son all the time. I am not looking for a full revival like for example in "Rune Stone Path".

No slash or Death Eater revisionism, please.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

**** No Fay Dunbar. Master Jedi Fay. Lily is a ghost tied to Harry, and well Fay and Lily more or less raise Harry and they begin to have a very interesting relationship. A bit platonic and more than anything in the spiritual and intellectual, especially due to the circutancias of Lily for its incorporeal form. At least for now...

** I had an idea where lilys soul latched onto harry instead if Voldemorts and she became a spirit of vengence. When voldemort trys to possess harry in order of the phoenix lillys spirit fully manifests and forces harry to transform into the ghost rider. It was going to be like a one off crossover but i never got around to writing it.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** Well, there's 2 that I can remember, one is extremely smutty, but the other is ok-ish. The problem with second one is the ending, which I hated, but maybe you'll like. Its not only Lily's protection, is the mixture between it and the Horcrux that creates the "other".

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't!

** Linkffn(brutal harry), but much more in the serial linkffn(hero harry) it happens at the very end of the first but you definitely need the context for the second. Also, be aware that the sequel includes a couple sections of very religious soap boxing.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.
