Cue mass panic as everyone who read the books realize that the sequence of events that started Harry's descent into darkness has already begun (say, summer before 5th Year with the Dementor attack in Little Whinging), and they begin what they think is a desperate race against time to prevent Harry's fall (even though the reality they're in was a carbon-copy of canon up until their collective freakout).


** Oh i would read that.

To see everyone's reaction on Dark Lord Harry would be insane

*** If I were to write it, I would probably start the story with Sirius talking about the books with his fellow Order members, make mention to what a 'harrowing tale' the books told, followed up with a joking comment about how the sheer unlikelyhood of Dementors attacking Harry when he's staying with his muggle relatives. Only for the news that Harry had been attacked by Dementors while he was staying with his muggle relatives to come immediately after Sirius finished talking.

**** "I know Harry, he probably wasn't happy to be forced to stay with the Dursley but everything will be fine now that he is here".Sound of Harry yelling at Ron and Hermione above them.

"This Harry lost all trust in the Ministry after Fudge summoned the whole Winzengamot for his minor infraction and made everything in his power to make him condemned? Even Fudge isn't /that/ stupid"Sound of Harry just coming back from his trial.

"The Ministry used the lack of applicants for the Defense position to place of their spy inside Hogwarts, and this spy is using Detentions to torture students. Nice imagination but it can't be real".\\
Sound of Ron's Owl bringing a letter explaining Harry first detention that he refuses to talk about, and saying that Harry seems to have hurt his hand there?

â€‹

Sirius start to be very worried, especially since, according to the book, his own death is the final straw that push Harry into darkness.

***** Well I hope this makes Sirius wiser and he actually explains to Harry how the two-way mirror works rather than just wrap it up in a package and give it to him.

** Wow! Make it extra complicated by not taking existing fanfics but writing an entirely new fanfic. It's basically a 2 for 1 fanfic.

** lmao. Though it would be interesting to see people make him happy but also afraid that it'll still happen.

And poor Harry is over here being all kind of confused.
