We know that you don't have to be in possession of the Elder Wand to /lose/ "ownership" of it. For it to choose another Master.

So why would Harry simply put it back with Dumbledore's grave? Is his plan simply to /hope/ that nobody ever disarms him /ever again/?

Or rather, is he hoping that someone /may possibly/ be able to physically trace the wand to Dumbledore but, should they retrieve it, it would be impossible to trace the /ownership/ of the wand, because no one after Dumbledore ever carried the wand?

Either way, I had a thought which may be a better alternative, if anyone wants to give me their own opinions on it.

Find someone you can trust who will soon be dying of natural causes. Disease or old age, or whatever. Duel them over and over and over until, eventually, they best you on their own merit. Or hell, just duel Hermione and Ron until you're exhausted and that someone you found can finish you off. Then when they're the MoD, they die soon after of natural causes. Problem solved (?).


** Pretty sure prodding it with the sword of Gryffindor enough times would be the most simple and effective method of stopping it.

** Wand ownership is the stupidest thing that Rowling has included in the last book. First of all how can wand ownership not be one of the biggest topics ever, if a single expelliarmus is apparently possible to transfer ownership? People must have noticed that as soon as they lost their wand once, they never got it back 100%. It just boggles my mind how she thought that it's a good idea. Granted, it makes for a nice plot what with Snape and Draco and Voldemort, but it just makes no sense in-universe.

*** I think you're misinterpreting it, slightly. It's never stated that someone's wand would never work for them, should they ever lose it. Just that it would also work for the other person.

She uses the unfortunate phrasing that Draco's wand had "shifted allegiance" to Harry, but it's never explicitly stated that Draco would never have been able to use his own wand again.

The issue with regards to Voldemort is that he had /never/ owned the Elder Wand. At any point.

**** IMHO it implies that you at least won't get the full 100% anymore if you don't have the full loyalty of the wand.

And even if it's true that the Wand fairly shares its loyalties (whatever that means) it seems pretty weird that it's presented as some kind of secret/esoteric knowledge. Everyone would know about these mechanics. But JKR really wanted a "twist" in the end. Would have been better if the heroes did all of it on purpose.

***** I don't disagree that it feels like a weird addition. I wouldn't have minded, at least, had the concept only applied to the Elder Wand. I think the fact that wands can share loyalty is a fairly unknown concept, though, kind of just proves my point that it doesn't affect how they treat their original owner.

**** I think the true issue with this one is that, other than the Ollivander-level theatrics, we /never ever before the 7th book/ actually saw that this in any way matters. Oh, certainly, Ollivander did (theatrics!) say that it's the wand that chooses the wizard and blah blah and we saw the magicky fireworks at his store, but that was it. And then we got hit, from the other side, by Ron using someone else's wand and nobody caring, Neville using someone else's wand and nobody caring, Quirrelmort doing no-wand bullshit, Lockhart using Ron's wand without any wand-ownership--related problems, Black using other people's wands with no issues, Pettigrew using other people's wads with no issues, and so on, and so on.

It's only in the seventh book that wand ownership starts mattering at all, and it's first demonstrated with Bellatrix's wand not being a good fit for Hermione (the wand looks unique as fuck so it can easily be justified by thinking it simply hard to handle for that reason, what with wand movements being harder to do correctly when the wand is that different), Harry not being able to use someone else's wand after his own broke (at this point we know Harry is in a somewhat bad emotional place, and his own wand got broken, so the difficulties can be thrown onto that, as showcased with Nymphadora losing control of her metamorphmagic because of being emotionally troubled), Draco's wand explicitly being said to shift allegiances (gets drowned in the nonsense that is the triple spell, because /seriously/, whatever it actually means that the wand did this), and then the elder wand.

I'm not saying I'm against the concept of wand allegiances and all. No, I think it's a cool thing that has a lot of potential and lore-wise could be built upon greatly. But, as a plot element, is was set up very poorly.

**** Wand ownership rules are weird and dumb, but it is worth pointing out that Draco's wand has a unicorn hair core, a core that resists dark magic. After two years of being a Death Eater, Draco's wand sort of lost the connection it once had to him and officially broke with Harry's ""defeat"" of Draco. I seriously don't think normal wands would shift so easily, but there's more to the context of the situation rather than just a simple change for no reason.

** I always thought putting it back without snapping it would be asking for trouble. But then again I find myself wondering how Harry getting hit with the killing curse in the forest didn't cause a change in ownership. At some point I'm going to have to go back and reread the 7th book.

*** The explanation for that was setup in HBP.

Dumbledore wanted the Elder Wand's power to die with him. He would have gone to his death undefeated, by having Snape kill him. He wouldn't have been defeated - he welcomed his own death.

Malfoy ruined that.

Similarly to Dumbledore, Harry wasn't defeated by Voldemort. He wasn't defeated - he welcomed his own death. /Unlike/ Dumbledore, Harry didn't have a "Malfoy" to ruin the plan.

**** I think JKR's logic was running thin when she came up with that. And given that Harry wanted to become an auror, it seems like putting it back is a really stupid risk for the future.

*** I agree but would like to expand a bit- the Elder Wand has probably never been renounced by someone. It's whole thing is that everyone covets it (yes, this includes Dumbledore. Even if Dumbledore didn't want to use the wand against others, he wanted and used that wand). Harry giving that up has probably broken the power the Elder Want has anyway.

**** Power-lust is, canonically, his besetting sin that he tries - and fails, repeatedly - to avoid giving in to. So he /accepts/ positions of political responsibility outside Hogwarts and /keeps/ the Elder Wand, exercises an autocratic, opaque "leadership" of his side in the civil war and so on.

If you try and consider him as a man and not a plot device, he's a /deeply/ flawed human being. (And quite a dim one in some important ways: not spotting that Gellert Grindelwald was a wrong 'un from the off, for instance.)

** It is determined that you don't have to be disarmed with the wand to pass the ownership.

So I guess the idea is that it will just pass on and on without anyone knowing who owns it.

Like if you imagine, Harry will definitely be disarmed during his auror training. Then that person may get disarmed by someone else. It will go on and on but it will be impossible to track at some point. So unless the person who wants to own it kills everyone on the UK or even the world, the probability of the ownership is passed to the person who has the wand is really low.
