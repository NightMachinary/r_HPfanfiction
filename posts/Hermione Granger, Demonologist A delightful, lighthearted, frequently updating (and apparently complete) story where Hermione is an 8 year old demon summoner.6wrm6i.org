** It's a good start, but I am looking forward to Hogwarts with a bit of trepidation. Lots of recent otherwise well-written Hermione-in-Slytherin fics have taken place in a Bizarro Hogwarts where Slytherins are nice and accepting (even of outspoken Muggleborns), Draco is friendly and supportive, and Narcissa sees Hermione as the daughter she never had, whereas Gryffindors (particularly Ron) are throwing "Mudblood" around like no tomorrow, and Dumbledore persecutes the poor Slytherins at every opportunity. (See /Green Girl/ and /Mudsnake/ for recent popular examples. Or don't.)

I hope that this fic portrays Slytherin as something more canon-consistent, and Hermione will actually have to deal with the fact that a good fraction of her house are children of Death Eaters who have no reason to question their parents' views (as in /Applied Cultural Anthropology/).

On the other hand, we can't get away from the fact that Hermione will be sleeping in the same room as Slytherins about whom canon is silent or nearly silent.

#+begin_quote
  Hello Reddit mouthpiece minion o' mine! :D Someone asked in the thread about their concerns about "Bizarro Hogwarts". (I wonder what's up with their FFN PMs? I haven't noticed any problems.)

  You can assure them that: I expect my Slytherins will meet with your approval, as they will most certainly not be universally welcoming, and their canonical blood prejudices will for the most part remain intact. Do give the story a little time to develop, however, to fully see what I mean. Rest assured that my story will definitely not contain good!Slytherins. (That can be a fun trope for a fic, but this isn't that kind of story.)

  Dumbledore will be almost entirely absent from the story, and won't pick on Slytherins outside of strictly canonical actions.
