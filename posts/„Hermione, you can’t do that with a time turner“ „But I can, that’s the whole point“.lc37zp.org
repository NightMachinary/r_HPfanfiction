Time travel. But hear me out: Hermione acquires a time turner to save people from the past, but obviously it's not possible to change the past... except if you fool everybody that said people have actually died, no one in the past would notice.

Hilarity ensues as Hermione plus accomplices try to fake a lot of deaths.

All of the saved people need to disappear, so they hide their magic with a ritual and go undercover in the muggle world.

** Doesn't the incident with buckbeak prove the observer effect applies to time travel, ergo if the people time traveling don't directly witness an incident occur with 100% certainty, it therefore can exist with a state similar to Shodingers cat, both having and not having transpired. Therefore it is possible to change time. It doesn't even have to be a long term difference, since the only people that will remember the two timelines are the time traveler, you could for example have this occur: after the battle of hogwarts harry uses the remaining timeturner to go back before the battle, after having run away and telling people not to tell him who has died. He is able to use a combination of the invisibility cloak, a number of stunners, obliviations and confundus, and some quick transfigurations on downed death eaters and is basically able to save everyone that "died" and after having them hide out until after the battle where he reveals the "dead" doubles

**** But they never traveled back in time, nor tell the time travelers whether buckbeak was actually executed or not, harry and hermione just assume it happens due to the thunk of the axe and hagrids wail, but don't actually see it occur. Even dumbledore later says they have a chance to save two lives.

This gives uncertainty principal. Hermione now has all the info she needs to realize as long as they can save buckbeak, thier past future selves will still think it has happened, this is further proved when they see events play out from the actual perspective.

Let's say Ron was present at hagrids hut and "saw" it happen and then tells Harry and Hermione it happened, as long as Ron isn't the one to travel back in time, and harry and hermione can arrange events to make Ron think it happened, then the paradox rule of the time turner has not been broken, and no alternative time line has occurred.

***** You're just... overthinking things. In PoA, the time travel worked as a closed loop. There was no true 'changes' or uncertainty. H and H went back, and did the actions their future selves had already done.

Dumbledore /already/ knew that Buckbeak was not dead, because he never saw Buckbeak die. However, at the point where he sent H + H back, they had not yet saved /Sirius/, who was still stuck in the tower. That's why "chance to save two lives"- he knew they'd saved one (Buckbeak) but didn't know they'd save Sirius as well. (In fact it was their future selves a moment later who informed him of success).

Now this is separate from the idea the OP raised or your Ron example, which is that events could be faked. There's no reason to bring in alternate timelines or anything, just that what Ron believed he saw was in fact, /not the truth/- just like how when the trio heard the axe and wail, they made a wrong assumption. This really doesn't actually have anything to do inherently with time travel, though it (and future knowledge) would definitely help pull it off.

In addition, your premise has a contradiction- let's say in one timeline Buckbeak is truly executed, and the trio hear the thunk of the ax. Isn't this observing the event? So H + H can't change it, because they observed it. There's zero reason to think that observation by sound is different than by sight (or touch or whatever). So 'time travelers can't have observed the event they want to change' falls apart.

No. It's only an indirect observation. They don't know the true origin of the sound because they didn't observe the event that produced the sound. So long as H + H ensure that their past selfs hear the same sound they heard they can in fact "change" the past.

******* See, but that's the thing. Read the paragraph above that one. They didn't actually change the events, they just revealed that what was assumed to have happened was, in fact, false.

You could get the same effect with visual observation by... polyjuice potion, or illusions, or elaborate paper-mache, or whatever.

Like, I'll say that your idea is a neat one, for fanfic or an original work. But it's not the way time travel in HP works (at least for PoA, not getting into CC).

Time travel in HP works in closed loop- you don't truly make changes. However, the 'past' versions of the characters lack information, so they make incorrect assumptions. It is /not/ the case where Buckbeak was dead, and they /changed/ it so that he was alive. It /is/ the case where Buckbeak was alive but presumed dead by the Trio (though Dumbledore knew him to be alive) and this fact was /revealed/ to the Trio.

Like, you've got the pieces, you're just overcomplicating it. Like the Ron seeing Buckbeak die example- your solution is "actually, no, Ron didn't see Buckbeak die, he just thought he did", which is exactly what I'm saying. You can stop there, there's no need to bring in paradox uncertainty or alternate timelines or anything like that. Or the limitation that Ron couldn't be the one to go back, because that's directly refuted by canon, when Harry used the patronus to save his past self.

Past Harry observed the event, and was positive that it was James Potter. He was wrong, of course, but by your rules this situation would be impossible, as future Harry went and 'changed' an event that past Harry had observed. But the solution is just the simple case of, no, you're wrong about this.

******** Mate, I'm afraid you're the one overcomplicating things. I know HP time travel is a closed loop and I know that they aren't changing things, which is why I put the word in paranthesis. They aren't changing events, they aren't even rearranging them, they're arranging them, acting then out for the first time despite the fact the that from their pov they already took place.

The only point I was trying to make with my comment was about direct and indirect observation and the effect this might have on time travel.

Even then, even with direct observation, if they saw Buckbeak get his head chopped off they could still save him. As long as they can transfigure a pumpkin into a perfect Buckbeak replica or something similar that is.

The only things that a time traveler knows about the past is what they observed, whether directly or indirectly. Whatever actions their future self took in the past they won't find out until they have traveled back themselves. And while their actions in the past can't contradict what has already happened (it already happened after all), it can contradict the things they only assumed that happened. Even if that something is seeing Buckbeak getting executed.

Edit: btw, I never brought up alternate timelines or anything, I was only responding to a single part of your comment. (check usernames)

** Well, wouldn't they only have to go into hiding until the point she used the time turner? And since the cannon rules are going back only an hour, the hiding wouldn't really be necessary.

Of course, it might be necessary as a strategic measure: If Hermione was known to save people with the time turner, Death eaters would start arranging deaths that couldn't easily be faked, and there wouldn't be much reason to hide the ability.

"Oh, Hermione, you are here, and with your time turner. They are gonna hit me in an hour eh? Ok, lets set up the fake"

But of course, you could tweak it slightly. If you couple it with the ability to do a far time travel and return (ie, go back to the first war), thus making it so the people she saves have to hide until her departure point, you can get a lot of what you want.

** Would also be fun if she had to conceal them with only her resources (because if someone started drawing from their bank account after dying, the Goblins would get suspicious and the timeline would break - so no Black Fortune to help her out in rescuing Sirius from the DoM) and thus had to convince, cajole, and otherwise cavort with reality on a student's budget to keep them hidden/disguised and maintain the integrity of the timeline until some Magic-McGuffin criterion is met and she can release them without unravelling Everything.

And the only person she can talk to about all of this?

Luna.

Because while Hermione's mind is the only one that can keep all these reality changes straight and separate and neatly categorised in her mental library, Luna's mind is the only one that can believe four different things at the same time and still think things make sense, so she's insulated from the Reality Collapse that would happen if, say, Harry had to get his head around the idea of his Godfather being both dead and alive at the same time.
