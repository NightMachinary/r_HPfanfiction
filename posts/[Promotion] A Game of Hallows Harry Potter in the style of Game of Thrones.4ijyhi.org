Hey all,

So I wrote a Harry Potter fanfiction that supposes what it would be like if George R. R. Martin wrote Harry Potter. It started out in [[/r/Writingprompts]] as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/44mrmg/euif_george_r_r_martin_wrote_harry_potter/][this post]] and I continued it for like thirty parts. A lot of people seemed to like it, so I thought I would post it here since I'm finishing it in the next few days. The basic premise is this: Harry was killed by Voldemort fifteen years ago, as a child. Most of our favorite characters are scattered around the world, looking for a solution to end Voldemort's rule once and for all. I won't give much more than that because I don't want to spoil anything. But I promise a good long read with twists, original characters, romance, murder, magic, etc. I hope you give it a read at my subreddit [[/r/Tomteller]]. Alternatively the first few chapters are available in a single doc [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1131HRUBYOgHwxB0dUjiIimch1VGKTQsmInvNEESQvRM/edit][here]].

Happy reading,

Tom


** Just so I'm not too hasty in judging this harshly I have to ask, did you misspell the characters' names on purpose? If yes, what's the purpose?

** I read the chapters contained in the google doc---and wow, this is a refreshingly original work. Ron's arc is especially wild, and your applications of magic are a lot of fun. You definitely share GRRM's knack for heightened drama and exciting twists, and I look forward to reading the remaining chapters.

That said, I sometimes wish you would slow down the pace---events often feel driven by the demands of plot rather than by the progression of character. [[/spoiler][The circumstances around Hermione's fate are not particularly convincing, and the wheelings and dealings in America feel flimsy and shallow]]. There are also a distracting number of spelling and mechanical flaws that will cause many re. Several names are incorrect (off the top of my head, "Grainger" should read "Granger"; "Weasly" should read "Weasley"; "Olympe Maxine" and "Maxine Olympe" should read "Olympe Maxime"; "Godric's Hallow" should read "Godric's Hollow"), and you mangle the punctuation around dialogue for long stretches. A second round of proofreading would definitely help retain readership.

** You might get more readers if you put it on fanfiction. I dont like reading stories on reddit, and so although the first few paragraphs looked interesting, ultimately, i am passing on the story.

*** I agree. I tend to pass on even popular books that are not on fanfiction because I can't favorite it. lol...I know. I'm weird.

However, I think once you are completed (and fix up things?) you should put it onto fanfiction. You'll hit a wider range of audience that way.

*** Yep. I like to read things in book format. I'm not at all interested in reading a story over reddit. I don't like the idea of opening up a million tabs or keep going back to the subreddit or username to find the next installment. I just want chapters in an accessible and easy to read format.

[[/u/tom_teller_writes]], I would love to read this over fanfiction.net though.
