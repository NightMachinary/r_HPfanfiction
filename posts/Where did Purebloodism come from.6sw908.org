It has been commented on, even by JK herself, that Purebloods are basically Nazis. She even pointed out how she had unintentionally copied the Nazi guidelines for how to be 'Aryan enough' into how the Purebloods decide who is 'Pure enough'.

The things is though, the Nazi hatred for Jews and non-Aryans had /a basis/, a stupid, irrational basis, but they didn't just decide out of the blue one day to start hating on Jews. Germany was in the middle of a truly massive economic depression, as was much of the rest of the world; it was so bad that their paper money was essentially worthless, people would paper their walls with banknotes and needed to take wheelbarrows full of currency to buy even a loaf of bread. So who did they blame? Jews, who happened to be major parts of banks and other financial institutions. It wasn't their fault, of course, but it was a simple connection to make, and people like simple explanations, not long complicated ones they can't understand about over-investing and market forces. So they blamed the Jews, the small, isolated, outsider group who was involved heavily in money.

But, so far as I know, we aren't really given a /reason/ for why the Purebloods dislike Muggles and Muggleborns. They say things like 'Muggleborns are stealing our magic', but where did that /come/ from? It doesn't need to have much of a basis, or course, but someone, somewhere, had to think that "My magic is getting weaker, I bet it's those bloody muggle's fault" and have a cause for their thinking that, even if it was just because it happened to coincide with a muggle family moving in across the street.

There are lots of plausible reasons I can think of, actually. If we start way back to when the Statute of Secrecy was created in 1692, maybe that was the point. Maybe [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wendelin_the_Weird][Wendelin the Weird]] was kind of an asshole, taunting all those children who /didn't/ have wands and got burnt at the stake for real due to their accidental magic. Thinking of it from a Wizarding perspective, the Statute was basically a massive white flag of surrender, the magical world ceding their right to most of the planet, being forced into hiding to keep themselves safe from the ravening hordes of muggles. If that was the time when traditionalist wizarding views on Muggles arose and calcified, it even makes sense that they call Muggleborns Mudbloods. Wizards would have been /leagues/ more hygienic due to simple ease; they would look at the muggles, living in filth with open sewers running down the sides of the street, and shudder in horror. Did you know they actually bury their dead in great big pits? They have special muggles who walk down the street every morning and just collect the corpses on a carriage, like cords of wood to be chucked into a convenient hole. It's disgusting! And have you smelled that one mudblood in Gyrfindor? Apparently, washing is 'unmanly', he's afraid he'll catch some repulsive muggle disease if he so much as touches a bar of soap!

Now people like Arthur Weasley, with their fascination with muggles and muggle things, are tantamount to treason against magical society! Every time he walks into the hardware store looking for plugs, he risks starting the witch hunts up all over again! Has he no shame? Does he not care for the children?

Of course that would be utter rubbish; Muggles have advanced a lot since then. But most of the Purebloods, who keep themselves very deliberately isolated from the muggle world thankyouverymuch don't really know any of that, and don't care to learn.

More recently, maybe the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution][Industrial Revolution]] and concurrent population explosion is to blame. The consistent, but tiny population growth of the wizarding world, which hasn't changed much in centuries, was now flooded with a surge of muggleborns. Instead of being something like 1/40 of the population, now they were 1/10, or even 1/5! Jobs and companies owned and run by old families were now being replaced and outcompeted by these newcomers. Who even are they, really? I don't know their families, I don't know where they came from. I don't trust them, why are we even letting all of them in? Those filthy muggles took our jobs!

Even more recently, perhaps it really started with WW2. If Wizards were *really* oblivious of Muggle goings on, then they very well might not have known about airplanes and bombs until it was too late. Diagon Alley might be shielded from muggle eyes and attention, but that won't save it from carpet bombing during the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz][London Blitz]]. Imagine being a wizard, walking along the alley one day, confident in your isolation from the hardships of the mundanes, when all of a sudden, do you hear that? That sort of, sort of a whistling sou-

The casualties could have been quite severe, and the devastation of the countryside might have inadvertently steamrolled right over ancient magical communities. The fear and new hatred would be easy for someone like Voldemort to capitalize on, doing the same thing Hitler did and using that fear to rise to power.

It should be noted, all of the above reasons for Purebloodism are bad reasons. They might be plausible reasons, they might be reasons you could understand if you were living there, but they are all false and irrational. But people need a reason. No one walks up to a stranger on the street and says 'fuck you in particular, and your family too.' Everything starts somewhere and so did Pureblood propoganda, and I'd like to know where.


** As far as I recall, no one says that their magic is getting weaker, but rather there are fewer Pureblood families. It's not the magic so much that's being diminished, but the bloodlines themselves. For some, that may translate to weaker magic, but that's clearly not the case as McGonagall herself is half-blood and is an accomplished Animagus and can cast three corporeal Patronuses at a pop.

It could be a case of the Pureblood community fearing the end of their way of life. /We have to have plumbing now! I can't just have a poo wherever I want and then Vanish the evidence! If those terrible Muggle-borns hadn't come along, I could still poo in the street like a true wizard!/ Or something along those lines.

*** It's made pretty clear that bloodlines have no effect on magic whatsoever: being a "pureblood" is not an actual thing, it's a made up social construct. Their magical abilities are in no way different than anyone else's, and it's highly unlikely that any of the major families would actually have only magical ancestors - they just have an incentive to maintain this perception.

#+begin_quote
  The expressions ‘pure-blood', ‘half-blood' and ‘Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudice. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as ‘bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only ‘half' wizard, because of his mother's parents. If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted ‘Aryan' or ‘Jewish' blood...the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent ‘polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.

Pureblood/magical community is another thing entirely, since their social status is dependant on maintaining the importance of their customs.

*** Well, I mean, that would actually be a /legitimate and real reason/ then. If purebloods hate muggleborns because muggleborns are erasing wizarding culture and turning it all into just more muggle culture, that is a 100% actual reason not to want more muggleborns in your society. I mean, doesn't France have laws about not incorporating words from other languages into French? They come up with /french/ word for the thing instead, so that their language doesn't turn into English, where half the things we say are ripped form other cultures.

If that was the case, Purebloods are basically in the right. Your example of taking a poo wherever you like sounds weird to our sensibilities, but lots of things from other cultures sound weird to our sensibilities; that doesn't make it /bad/, and neither does wanting to keep your cultural identity intact.

** The rise of beliefs in blood superiority in canon has its reasons. The division between wizarding world and the muggle one existed before ISOS as proven by things like Wizard's Council rules on playing Quidditch afar from Muggles (Quidditch Through Ages), The Tales of Beedle the Bard being written in runes in XV century (DH), the various cases of Muggles not knowing that people living near them are Wizards (ex. Pottermore: Potter Family, Pottermore: Hogwart's Ghosts). In Early Modern Europe, came the waves of witch hunts, which created hostility to Muggles. The Wizard and the Hopping Pot had new, anti-muggle version created (The Tales of Beedle the Bard). In the end "the widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for muggle ends", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic", "increasing numbers of witch-burnings", "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches" and "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (W.O.M.B.A.T.) led to creation of International Statutes of Secrecy in which British side played significant role (W.O.M.B.A.T.).

"The International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.

Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles. Increasing numbers of wizards now preached that marriage with a Muggle did not merely risk a possible breach of the new Statute, but that it was shameful, unnatural and would lead to 'contamination' of magical blood.

As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent ('I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.

Several works of dubious scholarship, published around the early eighteenth century and drawing partly on the writings of Salazar Slytherin himself, make reference to supposed indicators of pure-blood status, aside from the family tree. (...)

Successive studies produced by the Department of Mysteries have proven that these supposed hallmarks of pure-blood status have no basis in fact. Nevertheless, many pure-bloods continue to cite them as evidence of their own higher status within the wizarding community.

In the early 1930s, a 'Pure-Blood Directory' was published anonymously in Britain, which listed the twenty-eight truly pure-blood families, as judged by the unknown authority who had written the book, with 'the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines'." (lazy quote from Pottermore: Pure-Blood)

This provides certain background for existence of Muggle-hating (and by proxy muggleborn-hating) part of society, but what led to the support Voldemort got for his rebellion?

Let's look at the political situation

"Ignatius Tuft 1959 - 1962 Son of the above. A hard-liner who capitalised on his mother's popularity to gain election. Promised to institute a controversial and dangerous Dementor breeding program and was forced from office.

Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest. Has always denied having anything to do with England's 1966 World Cup Win. Left office after contracting mysterious illness (conspiracy theories abound).

Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, but was soon confronted with the first rise of Lord Voldemort. Jenkins was soon ousted from office as inadequate to the challenge." (Pottermore: Ministers for Magic)

First we had two Ministers that resigned before getting full seven years. One was generally controversial and was forced officially, the second one was controversial among pure-blood faction which may have had something to do with his resignation. Then we had Squib Rights marches, which were met with rioting and are another indicator of the general social mood being against opinions supported by pure-blood faction.

So we have pure-bloods for whom the world is falling apart. Muggleborns get elected, squibs demand rights. And here arrives Voldemort with promises of making Britain pure again. He perfectly capitalised on the feelings of then marginalised group and used them as their followers. The moods and events in timeframe of original books are just follow-up to the first rebellion, so the sides are already clearly marked.

Also there is "immigrant" part in the books which I forgot to mention. Draco says in PS "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families".

** Purebloods do not hate Muggles and Muggleborns because of a sensible reason - they have artificially constructed a hierarchy based on the purity of magical lineage (it's heavily implied that no one is actually pureblood, as in no one only has magical ancestors - the entire concept of 'Pureblood' is well-established magical propaganda, meant to further the status of the Sacred 28 and other everyone else, implying that they are less worthy). Nothing in the canon implies that magical lineage would affect one's magical skills - it's just made-up nonsense. It's all about hierarchical class structure and safeguarding one's interests against another's: they're safeguarding their own power base and denying upward social mobility, just like Victorian Muggle aristocrats did.

The reasons for going underground circa the Statute of Secrecy might have been legit (European witch hunts had been going on for ages by the late 17th century, and they were absolutely vile - an enormous amount of people were killed during the multiple waves of witch hunts) but this reason obviously became redundant later on. I don't think it's a surrender in the current context - while a single witch or a wizard would be more powerful than a Muggle, the numbers just work against them (what are thousands of wizards against tens of millions of Muggles in the UK?), and they have lost a lot of their strategical advantage when Muggle science has advanced throughout the years.

Tl;dr: the concept of Purebloods is just hierarchical class structure that mirrors the way the upper classes of Victorian England tried to maintain their status at the expense of others.

I read this opinion again and again and again, but I just don't get it. We have a scene where an 18 year old /imbecile/ casts a spell that conjures a flame that /cannot/ be extinguishes by simple water. Now take one smart wizard and give him good reason to burn down the centers of human civilization. How many fire departments do you need to extinguish a flame that cannot be extinguishes by anything but magic, or a lack of material to feed it? And we're still talking about *one* wizard. Now imagine a thousand wizards going into war, with all restrictions off. Fiendfyre, the Unforgiveables - the entire arsenal of spells at their disposal. Muggles would be straight up fucked.

IMO it comes down to how smart magicals are. If they understand the muggle military and government hierarchy, then magicals can win very readily with a decapitating blow. If wizards just start throwing curses into a crowded population center... how well will Hogwarts' wards stand up to nukes? I'm thinking not very well.

It would probably be absolutely horrific to begin with, massive civilian casualties on the muggle side as major populations centers became massive pyres, but then the muggle counter strike would virtually obliterate the wizards, annihilating all their unplottable locations, and eventually developing counters for magical attacks, potentially with the aid of muggleborn magicals.

Which are all *within* the biggest amalgamations of muggles. Diagon Alley and the Ministry are right in the center of London. the MACUSA is in downtown New York. Yes, Hogsmeade is gone after such a strike. But thats how much of the british wizarding society? 20%? 40%? And then you just managed to kill their children and a bunch of people they loved. Welp. Here, have some thousands of really angry, absolutely raging, fabric-of-reality controlling demigods to fight against. Good luck.

Nuking a castle-ruin somewhere in Scotland is one thing. Still utter and complete political suicide, if you can't 1000% prove that the enemy is hidden in a broken down castle ruin in Scotland (and you better keep to yourself that thats a school for eleven year olds and up). Because if your population doubts you, you just nuked your own nation. Have fun in prison, you maniac. But that may be forgiven - if you can sell it. Nuking London, however. Thats not gonna fly. And how exactly is the SAS supposed to storm the Ministry, if they can't even find it? How would they aim at the Leaky Cauldron, if their eyes keep wandering to the stores to its left and right? How would they follow orders, if they forget them the moment they get to the Area of Operations?

And then its too late. Your window for second strike is as long as it takes for the Obliviators to notice you and keep you in check. And if we, by now, know one thing, its that the magical world has some real experience when it comes to making muggles forget about magic.

You said it.

The only chance the muggles have. The only chance they ever had, is that the wizards who want to kill/subjugate them, have to fight other wizards to do so.

I read a few of those fics where muggles won this war and it always is one of two scenarios. One, the muggleborns help the muggles. Technology and magic combined packs quite a punch. Two, the author hands out the idiot-stick to every wizard on the planet, and acts as if every wizard in the magical world has an IQ around 70. The first scenario is alright, I guess. It really depends on execution. The second makes me roll my eyes and close the tab.

**** What would be their end goal though? Even if a single witch or wizards could cause massive damage, there would be no benefit in exposing the wizarding world. Grindelwald's plan to rule Muggles was megalomaniac and imo he overestimated his power - while a witch or a wizard could escape Muggle witch hunts or overpower a small amount of Muggles, there's no way they could overrule them the way Grindelwald wanted.

True Blood explores somewhat of a similar premise - vampires choosing to reveal themselves to the mainstream society. The main difference there is that while the vampires are way more powerful than normal people (they can persuade people and are considerably stronger), they do have a major weakness (daylight) which non-magical people are quick to weaponize. On the other hand, witches and wizards do not have any major weaknesses when compared to Muggles (unless you count their subpar education and lack of access to modern technology).

***** The only reason why wizards and witches would need to go to war is purely defensive in nature. And it wouldn't be a war for superiority on the planet, it would be a war for /exclusivity/. The Statute gets broken all the time. But most of these times, Obliviators go out, erase some muggle memories and its all good again. A war would need a big breach first - and we know that even city-wide is no problem for Obliviators. So something broadcasted on several channels would be needed, and even then some well placed Obliviate may swing the global opinion towards believing that anyone who claims that this [event] was magic is delusional and a conspiracy theorist.

Frankly, the only reason why wizards as a whole would go to war against muggles is if the Statute goes truly, and utterly FUBAR. In a war of destruction, wizards are so beyond overpowered compared to muggles, in their positions, skills and tools, that there's really no discussion in who would win.

And even if it was a war of superiority. Wizards don't need electricity. Wizards don't need plumbing, agricultural-industry, oil and fuel. Them not having technology is not a disadvantage. Their education is not subpar - because they do not need to learn the laws of nature - they simply change them at their pleasure. It only takes a bit of research beforehand to effectively cripple modern society in a way that shoots it back to the middle ages. Target infrastructure (powerplants, traintracks, public transport,...), refineries and big logistics centers like Shanghai or Rotterdam. One or two weeks later, muggle society starts to crumble. Two months later, muggles start to eat themselves up because they fight for the last bit of food in the stores of the warehouses. In the meanwhile your Aurors secured atomic bunkers, imperio'd Presidents and Generals and a contingent of volunteer fighters burn the wheat fields. Now you have a starving, rebelling muggle population, non-functioning headless militaries and a destroyed global market. And if you did it in a smart way, the muggles didn't even begin to suspect magic.

  Frankly, the only reason why wizards as a whole would go to war against muggles is if the Statute goes truly, and utterly FUBAR.

don't really work together though. Turning Earth into a postapocalyptic wasteland (which would possibly require major reconstruction effort) would serve nothing, especially as you'd end in a situation with both magical and non-magical people after a few generations anyway: the only difference would be that the eventual squibs and their descendants would know about magic (at least for a while - eventually you might end up with a society that resembles the pre-Statute of Secrecy situation).

Any war effort between Muggles and wizards would have sort of a civil war vibe, given that at least some of the wizards are somewhat integrated into the Muggle society or have significant ties to it.

******* If you noticed, the second paragraph was about

#+begin_quote
  a war of superiority.
#+end_quote

while the paragraph above is about an extermination war. Meaning that you can scorch the earth if your goal is to destroy the muggles at all cost. Any rebuilding would be child's play with magic. And for all the descendants without magic there are - ahem - spartan ways of managing that.

A war of superiority only asks of you to get control over food, infrastructure and government. Which is an easy task with magic.

The only problem, as I've stated before and in other comments, is if to rule the muggles, you have to first fight wizards. But the foundation of what i'm saying stays the same. The only thing that can stop wizards, are other wizards

*** See, I find that explanation mostly plausible, save for one thing. The aristocrats never launched a terrorism campaign against the peasantry when their position was threatened. They might pass restrictive laws, and exploit there position to try and beat down the uppity yokels, but they'd never actually decide the best solution to the loss of power was a pogrom against the serfs.

That explanation also doesn't posit the tipping point, the thing which pushed the Purebloods too far, the sudden drop in power that switched them from 'keep the muggleborns in their place' to 'exterminate the mudbloods'. Was it something like muggleborns getting the right to vote? What was the thing, *the thing*, that separated out the purebloods into traditionalists vs blood-traitors?

**** But "exterminate the mudbloods" wasn't ever a Pureblood stance - this line of thinking only seemed to arise with the first wizarding war, and it seemed to be more for inspiring terror than executing all of them. Getting rid of all the Muggle-borns was never the end goal, maintaining the dominance of the Sacred 28 was.

***** I dunno about that; the big ol' statue in the Ministry seems pretty explicit about how Muggles were inferior and needed magical domination. Some of the Pureblood faction probably did just want their families to maintain a pseudo-noble position in society, but some of them pretty clearly thought that muggles and muggleborns had no right to live.

** I think you've essentially hit the nail on the head there with those reasons. And it wouldn't be just one of them, but probably some mix of all of the above.

There's likely also some good old fashioned classism mixed in since most muggles were dirt poor up until the very recent expansion of the middle class (and is still the case in many places worldwide), whereas even the 'poor' Weasley family has a standard of living that your average muggle would seriously consider killing for, not just in terms of hygiene but in having enough food to support a large family, home-ownership, steady employment, and minor luxuries like magical clocks, multiple flying brooms, a private workshop full of tools, and even a car with enough time off work to tinker around with it for fun. The only truly destitute wizarding family we see is the Gaunts, who are so off-their-rocker and magically weak as to be essentially unemployable, yet they still manage to get by.

*** As I recall, while you can't transfigure a rock into a potato, you can replicate a potato indefinitely and still have an edible potato. Similarly, something like a stasis charm (which is definitely prominent in the fandom, but I'm not sure if it's canon) means that food never goes bad. The Weasley family always really puzzled me, because the cost of living with magic in the mix should be like, pennies. Especially if you're really good at things like transfiguration to make all your own clothes etc. The only reason the Weasleys are poor is because they suck at money management. They do what all poor people do: they don't save because they can't afford to, so they end up living month-to-month and paycheck-to-paycheck, and then when they do get money, they blow it all on luxury items that they don't normally get (like, say, trips to Eygpt for the whole family), leaving them in the same penniless bout as before.

** Personally I think it has more to do with tradition than anything. Look at any instance of immigration in the world and you see the "natives" complain about mixing races and the immigrants injecting their own culture into the country occasionally at the expense of long standing native traditions.

*** Yep. But it genrally coincides with something; like anti-Irish sentiment in the US really became a 'thing' when the US got a flood of Irish immigrants during a famine I think it was? So, where before the US probably didn't particularly like the Irish, now they were putting up signs saying Irish need not apply.

**** Sure, but then why is he talking about Nazis so much... Pureblood-racism probably developed in a similar fashion as anti-semitism did in medieval Europe. I don't really understand why he requires some kind of elaborate explanation why tribalism and in-/outgroup behaviour develops in a society - especially when it's so obvious if muggleborns constantly join without respecting and understanding their culture - in comparison to that the unreasonable hatred towards Jews should be much more confusing.

*** No. Anti-semitism has been around for as long as there have been Jews to hate on; it is a natural human reflex to discriminate between Us vs Them. And eugenics have been around since at least as long as we had a decent grasp on inheritance. The Nazis were just the first to go from shunning and ostracizing the Jews to formally rounding them up for extermination... or at least the big famous incident anyway. Humans are awful.

** My backstory (in progress).

Magic slowly waxes and wanes with a period of several thousand to tens of thousands of years.

We have been in a wane period for the last three thousand years or so (hence the disappearance of pagan deities and major miracles and stuff- they are all in hibernation until the magic gets strong enough again).

All of the non-Homo Sapiens humanoid sentient beings are actually the result of certain rituals that combined humans with various creatures. There was some kind of massive backlash against such beings because of some terrible disaster or series of unfortunate events. 'Pureblood' ideology was originally exactly against those people.

Anti-mundane sentiment arose with the collapse of the magical civilizations attached to the Roman Empire because of a number of TL;DR reasons. It made less headway in the Far East and other regions relatively untouched by the West, until the last few hundred years.

Over time, Purebloodism became conflated with antimundanism. Compare to how Nazi ideology combined and conflated religious antisemitism with race-based antisemitism and anti-various-other-groups racisms.
