I'm looking for fics with a competent Ministry of Magic. The more world building, the better. Espionage is fun, and so is the Department of Mysteries.

Any ideas?


** linkffn(Unspeakable Things) is a story I enjoyed featuring Department of Mysteries training and operation. There's H/G and a lot of Luna's presence.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** I haven't seen many fics delve into espionage, that also have a competent ministry, but I do remember linkffn(Death Shall Have No Dominion) being a very good read about the DoM, even if it's been abandoned.

** One issue is that when someone writes a competent Ministry, they suddenly turn Voldemort into a babbling idiot that's defeated the moment the Ministry decides to.

What's the point, then?

If anyone has a fic with both a competent ministry /and/ a Voldemort that isn't defeated at a whim, do share.

  I'm revising this. Look for "The Death Eaters of Hogwarts." Changes to Harry's summer routine get him better prepared for his 5th year at school. Students by day, Death Eaters by night, the halls are no longer safe to wander when its dark.
