Magical Relations has Petunia leaving and the Dudley Dursley series has Vernon dropping them like hot potatoes, but are there any fics where both adults can't handle the possibilty that their precious Dudders is exactly like the freak and throw both boys out on the streets/wilderness/volcano pit?

Into the Fire by beastofthesea is the only one I have found so far where the Dursleys decide to treat Dudley with the same contempt but is only a single chapter long.

So yea, Dudley and Harry bonding, Dudley losing his parents, learning not to be a prat and Harry getting to be a big sibling, are there any stories like that out there? Give me some heartwarming Christmas miracles! Or heartburn...

** Oooh. This sounds nice, actually. I like the idea. Dropping a comment to check back.

Merry Christmas!
