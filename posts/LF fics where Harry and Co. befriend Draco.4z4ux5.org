I'm looking for fics where Harry, Ron and Hermione wind up making friends with Draco, preferably early on in the series. Bonus points if Lucius disowns him because of their friendship.


** Linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) has a gryffindor!Draco subplot. The main focus, though, is Sirius' early escape from Azkaban. Currently passed a million words, but it's in there.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** linkao3(the pure and simple truth by lettered)

(this is part implicit slash, part gen. I think it's gen enough that you can overlook the slash. although this isn't early on the series nor did Lucius disowns him, it's one of my favorites.)

faithwood explains it best.

#+begin_quote
  It's like this: Draco wants to atone for what he has done; he's trying really hard to make things better, to make sure nothing like Voldemort and Death Eaters happens again. He's mostly trying to do that by making everyone else try to do that. His Slytherin friends, first and foremost.

  Befriending Harry is a part of that. So Harry and Draco end up going to a pub together occasionally. And then, one by one, their friends join them.

  There are sort of two storylines here. One, the gen one, that reads almost meta-ish to me. Because, see, this is a large group of people, and some terrible things have happened. The kind you might forgive and the kind it's difficult to forget, but friendship, between all of them, that's a hard sell. And this wouldn't work for me if I felt like the author was trying to sell it. It felt more like an exploration of a possibility that isn't really likely to happen in real life, but hey, what if it could? What if you could actually make all these people sit down and have them make a conscious effort to understand another's point of view? What if you could make them accept that they can't understand another's point of view but accept the person as they are, anyway? If that could happen, the world really would be a better place. Especially if that could happen with this particular group of people. This line of thought leads to some insightful and interesting discussions, and you're free to disagree and agree with everyone or no one, which I have done, many times while reading. I've laughed and nodded, and ranted and shaken my fist at every single character at some point. And it's amazing when a story can make you do that.

  The other storyline, which is not as prominent as the gen one, but is certainly there, is the story of Harry and Draco falling in love. There's no sex, but the love story is there. The author makes it easy for you to follow its progression. It's easy to see Harry's growing affection, it's easy to see Draco's feelings, even though we don't get his PoV. The longing is there, the slow build-up is there. So the whole story is not really gen, even though it is a story about friendship, more than anything else.

  This is a very engaging read. It felt much shorter than 70K. It's very dialogue heavy, and it's snappy, highly entertaining, clever dialogue, which makes you laugh, think and even grips your heart sometimes.

  I'd urge you not to miss something so fascinating and unique.

  Harry, Draco, and Hermione go to a pub. Harry, Draco, and Pansy go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Hermione go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Hermione and Ron go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Pansy―you guessed it―go to a pub. I could go on. In fact, I did. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Pansy, Ron, Blaise, Luna, Goyle, Neville, and Theodore Nott go to a pub. In various combinations.

*** Sorry, I'm having a stressful-day-at-work brainfart. What do you mean when you say "gen" in this context? I always thought of "gen" meaning next-gen ie their kids.

Thanks (:

**** It's fine, mate.

I used "gen" when I mean general. As in fanfics for general audiences without romance, het or slash.

** it's not really my bag,

so there's only two I can think of,

the whole again series by Leila b. it focuses on the adults, but the kids are background throughout and become friends with malfoy for a bizarre reason. FYI this was written before the original series was finished so it's not cannon.

--------------

murder of crows by hogwarts91 includes a close friendship between DM & HG. its set in the "future" though, so they're adult. there is a lot of lucious being evil too

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.
