Please yes see the title, because I was very upset in Deathly Hallows how he was just wasted for one scene and killed by Voldemort, considering all that history. :( I would have loved to see that LOVE between them spur Grindelwald into breaking out and joining the fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters! Which would ALSO still keep JK Rowling's theme that love conquers all and is more powerful than any magic! :)

Grindelwald and Dumbledore were said to be about equally skilled and powerful, and Grindelwald's prior history AS a Dark Lord would still set him apart from Dumbledore as a character, and he could still use "dark" magic and harsher tactics to further set him apart! Plus his interactions with McGonagall and Hagrid, who were closest to Dumbledore as an adult would be pretty amazing right? :)

It would be a battle between a reformed dark lord and an unrepentant dark lord, which could be a theme of the story all its own.

PS: Yes if no one has any stories like this anywhere, then I'll go full THANOS and say "Fine! I'll do it myself!" :)


** I only got the prologue so far, and a few possible snips:

*Red - Returned, Extremely Dangerous*

Contrary to what others might have thought, he had long ago accepted his fate. For his unforgivable sins, he deserved to die in prison, despised by everyone. The things he had done, in his rage, in his hubris... it had taken him a long time to accept that he had been wrong, and even longer to come to terms with his guilt, but he had done it. Too late, far too late, but he had managed. He hadn't been able to do much but think. Think and remember.

And, all things considered, things could have been worse. His cell was not large, and certainly not comfortable - he had designed the prison for his own enemies, after all - but it was tolerable. Not that he deserved it, but his friend had been more merciful than he had deserved.

But his last, best friend was now dead. Murdered. The guards had told him. Not to taunt him, no - that sort of thing had stopped decades ago. Simply to tell him, so he'd not expect a visit. And, maybe, so he'd finally let himself die, and this shameful chapter of history could be closed.

Yet he wouldn't. Couldn't. With his friend gone, too many were left defenseless. Helpless. At the mercy of an enemy who might be worse than he had ever been. There was no one to replace his friend, no one to continue the fight, no one to stand for the cause they once had shared.

No one but him.

He knew the prison, better than anyone. He knew its weaknesses, and its guards. He had been working on a way to escape, right after he had been imprisoned. And he had continued to work on this, even after he had accepted his fate - both since there was not much else to do than plan and think, and because to stay in prison while he might escape proved, to himself, that he had changed. Had become the man he should have been, and stayed, long ago.

The man who might yet save his friend's country, and maybe atone a tiny bit for his own sins. He wouldn't be alone, he knew that. There were some of his old allies left. They hadn't found everyone. And others still remembered him fondly. Old, like him, but still dangerous. They might be misguided, had been misled, just as he had lost his way, but they would still follow him, if he called them. When he called them.

He stood up from where he had been sitting on his cot, and faced the door to his cell. He had no wand, but that was no bar to magic. Not for someone who had studied magic as he had. And had had decades to hone his skill.

For a moment, he hesitated. He could still stop. Wait until he died in this cell and were reunited with his friend. He shook his head. How could he face him, knowing he could have saved his friends, but had chosen not to? Had chosen to do nothing?

It was time to do what was right, not what was easy.

It took a dozen spells to force the door open. It took just half that number to subdue the guards. And after he had picked up their wands, just one spell to blow the gates open, and leave the prison.

After decades, Gellert Grindelwald was free again. And this time, he would make Albus proud!

--------------

*Snippets:*

"Mister Potter! I've come to save Britain from Voldemort, and I certainly wouldn't be saving anything by sending children to war! No, you just stay safe while we cleanse Britain of those stains on Albus's legacy. Err... only those who do not surrender, of course."

"Natürlich!" bellowed a dozen of wizards and witches clad in black leather coats standing behind him, though Harry could see a few of them whisper to each other afterwards, and then one excused himself and hurried out of the room.

Before he could say anything though Hermione stood up, and to Harry's horror, she wore what he had dubbed her "crusader face".

"Mister Grindelwald, you cannot exclude us! Dumbledore personally selected us three for this task! There's a prophecy involved as well!"

The most feared Dark Lord of Europe blinked. "He did?"

"Yes. He even addressed us in his will."

"Oh. In that case, welcome to the Storm Wizards! Hans!"

"Hier, Kommandant Grindelwald!"

"You have three new recruits. Train them so they may fulfill Albus's last orders!"

"Jawohl!"

Hermione beamed while Ron slapped his forehead. Harry had a bad feeling about this.

Meanwhile, the other Storm Wizard who had left had returned, and more whispering followed. Harry saw a female Storm Wizard hand the man a Skele-Gro Potion before he left again.

--------------

"I'm not supporting Grindelwald blindly, Harry! Did you know that he was the first influential wizard to promote equality for muggleborns?"

"You told us so several times," Harry Potter muttered under his breath.

"And leather coats are far more practical for fighting than robes. Sturdier too. Plus, they do look stylish!"

Harry couldn't argue that.

"And they make Malfoy wet himself."

He couldn't argue that either.

"And for jumping into things... we're just following Dumbledore's plan. You trust him, don't you?"

"Dumbledore didn't plan to take over Diagon Alley and lay siege to Gringotts!"

"Well, he wouldn't have known his friend would return. But with the Storm Wizards available, we have to adjust some of his plans."

"And looting Flourish and Blotts is also following Dumbledore's plans?"

"Don't be silly! That location was perfect for the command post. I simply evacuated the books so they'd not be damaged in the fighting."

"That's your fault, mate," Ron cut in. "If you had supported me, the command post would have been in 'Quidditch Supplies', and we'd have new brooms.

"Ron! Don't you care that we're wearing the uniform of the personal guard of the worst Dark Lord in history?" Harry stared at his best friend.

"He vowed to avenge Dumbledore's death by bringing Snape to justice, and he promised we get to watch!"

Well... Grindelwald obviously had changed for the better, Harry decided.

--------------

“Clever!” Gellert nodded, interrupting the wizard. It was a bit rude, but the man's voice grated on his nerves, and he had understood the plan already. “We use a double of Harry Potter as a decoy, and then we ambush and massacre the Death Eaters when they attack the double!” It was a fine plan indeed - he was glad to see that Albus hadn't lost his touch. The assembled members of Albus's Order were staring at him, but pretty much everyone did that these days, so he was getting used to it. “But where is the prisoner we will imperius and use as a decoy?” Had they turned the basement of the muggle house into a dungeon?

“We don't have a prisoner,” the scarred Auror said.

Gellert blinked. “You don't take prisoners?” Albus had certainly grown more radical in his old age, he thought, but then, if the Death Eaters were all magically protected from interrogation, it would make no sense to take them prisoners only to kill them afterwards without having anything to show for all the effort.

“No. We currently do not have a prisoner,” the other Auror said. He sounded quite defensively - maybe he had had an interrogation go wrong? Such things happened.

“I see.” Gellert nodded. “Do we have time to procure one? It doesn't have to be a Death Eater, any other criminal will do.” If the decoy survived, they could pardon them for their crimes. That had worked very well for Gellert, in his day.

Everyone turned towards the wizard who had relied Albus's plan.

Gellert smiled. “A volunteer? Excellent!” Now he understood why Albus had chosen such an annoying man as his messenger. His old love always had had a knack for hitting two targets with a single curse. A criminal risking his life for the Greater Good in an attempt to find redemption for his crimes was something Albus would have loved!

“Now wait a minute, governor...”

Sometimes, a volunteer's nerves had to be steadied, though. Gellert's wand flicked, and the man - Fletcher or something - stopped talking. It was for the best, really - the man would be remembered as a hero, and Gellert wouldn't be tempted to do something about his annoying voice and disgusting smell any more.

The various historical Dark Wizards we hear about (Salazar Slytherin, Morgana, Ekrizdis, Raczidian) all seem like they acted on their own or through creatures. Grindelwald is, in fact, the earliest canon example of what we would recognize as a Dark Lord, and if it was just him, then it's not implausible at all that no one might have thought up of a suitable name for what he was until another one of these (Voldemort) came around, and it became clear he was not a one-time thing.

I'm pretty sure Rowling said somewhere that Grindelwald didn't actually like Dumbledore like THAT, so the one-sided romantic love would also be a cool angle for the story.

  Draco Malfoy, like all his family before him, has looked forward to meeting the person behind the name that will eventually appear. Provided they are a Pureblood, of course. But for some absurd reason, she doesn't seem to like him. Even worse she appeared to be friends with Potter's group. This of course leads to hijinks. Not to mention, Potter's somewhat more annoying than usual with his constant retorts and somehow, someway, Ginny Weasley acquired a basilisk. (Draco honestly was not going to ask.)-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Harry Potter, for his part, was pulled headfirst into the confusing world of the Slytherins when Draco Malfoy decided (for whatever Malfoy-ish reason) that they were friends. It doesn't help that somehow, Malfoy wasn't actually the most insane of the Slytherins. How will Harry face the scion of Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Gellert Grindelwald, and whatever else the world (and author) throws at him this time around?
