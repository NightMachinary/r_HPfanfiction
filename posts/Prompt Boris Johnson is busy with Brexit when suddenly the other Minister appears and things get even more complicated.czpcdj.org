Edit: Isn't it fanon that the Greengrass family is big in the import / export business and has some influence in the government, although nowhere near what Malfoy had? They might do business with muggle suppliers for some things and in that case they probably would want to use some of their influence on shaping Brexit...


** There was recently thread about this situation: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/chz54t/prompt_boris_johnson_sits_down_in_downing_street/]]

I liked this one, by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/chz54t/prompt_boris_johnson_sits_down_in_downing_street/euzmice/][link]] ):

  "Let me make sure I understand you," Boris said to Minister Granger. "Magical Britain is a member of this International Confederation of Wizards? An organisation which imposes laws on Britain, not least the Statute of Secrecy?"

  "That's right, Prime Minister," Hermione said.

  Boris shook his head. "Unacceptable, my dear. Brexit means Brexit. Britain has had enough of these so-called experts at the ICW dictating cauldron thickness."

*** That's libel ... Mrs. Thatcher was very clever and serious lady. You may think her ideas were foolish, harmful, etc., but she was serious about what she was doing, and I guess at least mostly she believed she is doing the best for UK. This clown can let UK f*k itself as long as he is in power.

**** Say what you want about Thatcher. She KNEW she was f-ing the miners in the a-. Johnson thinks ruining the country is the best for everyone.
