** Harry went quiet.

That scared the hell right out of Ron and Hermione, who had turned to see his reaction to what had just been said. While Sirius and Mrs. Weasley continued to bicker childishly, Ron grabbed Hermione and backed away from the table. As they did so, Harry rose from his seat. Sirius saw the movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to look at his godson, his angry retort dying in his mouth as soon as he did so. Then, Harry spoke, and Sirius felt as if a Dementor had entered the room (in fact, he involuntarily scanned the window and door just to be sure). Harry looked, acted, and sounded exactly like his father on the verge of a murderous rage.

Now, James was a very boisterous boy and a strong-willed man. In both cases, it wasn't hard to ruffle his feathers, so episodes of violent yelling and stomping around weren't unheard of in his youth. He usually got over it just as quickly and easily as it came. However, sometimes things happened that would push James well beyond that point, and he wouldn't yell or stomp; he'd go silent and ice cold, and his response would be measured, ruthless, and utterly terrifying in a way that yells and swear words could never manage. And Harry looked just like his father, only with his mother's eyes.

"Mrs. Weasley." Harry said calmly. Mrs. Weasley turned to him. "I'm sorry, but I don't believe I heard you right. Would you please repeat your objection to me not learning more, or being a member of the Order?" Harry asked coolly, almost professionally. Mrs. Weasley blinked; likely, she had been expecting an explosion, not a calm inquiry. "You're too young, Harry dear. Being an Order member, knowing all the things we talk about, you're not ready for it." Mrs. Weasley replied. Harry hummed and tilted his head curiously, and with an awful certainty, Hermione was absolutely sure of what Harry was about to say. She gripped Ron's hand tightly.

"I see. Do you think that, at 14, I was old enough to watch someone die?" asked Harry, still calm. There were gasps that seemed to suck the air from the room (Sirius checked the window and door again), and Mrs. Weasley choked. "Funny, Voldemort didn't seem to think I was too young. Let's go back a bit further." Harry proposed idly, and this time it was Ron who knew. Ignoring the urge to shudder at the evil name, Ron returned Hermione's rock-solid grip. ""Harry..." Sirius tried to interrupt, despite knowing it was fruitless. Sure enough, a raised finger and silent look was enough to silence the older man.

"If I was too young to see Death as a 14 year old, then I was almost certainly too young to fight a 60 foot snake and the shade of a schoolboy Voldemort at 12. For your daughter, no less." Harry said coldly. Mrs. Weasley stumbled back as if slapped. "How dare you!" she hissed. "How dare I? I dare for the same reason as you. I'm holding you to the same standard as you obviously hold me. Despite my affection, hell let's call it love, for you and your family, I'm not treating you with the respect you expect. I'm not treating you like you deserve it, despite everything you've done to the contrary." Harry told her.
