Yet another "Slytherin wasn't really evil" idea, but I think this is a bit different: take his placement of the Basilisk's lair in the mouth of his statue being a pun and run with it, say he loved puns and wordplays to distraction, and at some point he made a joke about muggleborns (or "[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/magbob/][magbobs]]" as I think they were called back then, yes that's a [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][real canonical thing]]) but nobody got the punchline and he either never got a chance to explain or nobody listened to him, resulting in everyone assuming from that one comment that he was a blood purist, when he in fact wasn't.

Can anyone think of a good possibility of what the joke could have been? I love puns and wordplays but I'm not a genius at coming up with them...


** No, no, no. Salazar didn't care about Blood Purity, he wanted the elves to serve Blood Pudding with breakfast, but no one else in the castle liked it.

History remembers the reason the Founders broke up differently because the real reason was stupid.

*** They broke up because no one else liked blood pudding. Being as how it was Salazar's favorite, he left to find other people who enjoyed it.
