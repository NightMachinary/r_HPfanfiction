** It's not schizophrenia, but linkffn(Gryffon Reborn by Yrtria) has a Harry who comes out of Azkaban with multiple-personality disorder. I don't remember much about it other than I thought it was ok, but not particularly good.

** linkffn(Psychosis by SnowWhiteOwl)

When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?
