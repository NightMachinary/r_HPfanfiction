** AFAIK, Request would be a better flair for your post, rather than fic search.

**** linkffn(11027125) and linkffn(9238861) have Slytherin Hermione, but they are different in tone, and only the green girl is finished.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

Fem!Slytherin!Harry. No romance yet. 2 complete sequels for second and third year, fourth year ongoing. Awesome worldbuilding. Amazingly well-written OCs. Not abandoned, but slow to update (though latest chapters have been around 30000 words, so well worth the wait).

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** linkffn(Mary Potter 1: the Call to Adventure by LeighaGreene) - Has a Slytherin female Harry. Good story with a snarky Harry, very long though, the first 2 books are both 150k and the 3rd is 300k and counting. 3rd book of the series is currently in progress

linkao3(Harriet Potter Is by setepenre_set) - Complete oneshot with Slytherin Harry. Really well written, Slytherins are actually good people for once instead of all death eaters.

linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House by Belial666) - Slytherin, dark, Hermione-ish OC. Also very long, a read it a long time ago so don't remember much. The first book is finished, and the second is in progress

linkffn(When In Doubt, Obliviate by Sarah1281) - Slytherin Harry raised by Gilderoy Lockhart. Really funny and very unique. The first ~ 1/3 is pre-hogwarts, however. Complete story.
