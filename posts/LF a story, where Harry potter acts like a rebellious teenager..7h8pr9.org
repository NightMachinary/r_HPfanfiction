Including, but not limited to a cocky, devil may care attitude, not listening to authority figures, because 1, the dursley's don't care, 2, he knows Dumbledore needs him, and therefore won't expel him, neither does he wish to make an enemy out of him, because of the prophecy.

The only requirement is that he isn't just some bully, or a jerk. I still want to like him. Just don't want him being a doormat.

Thanks,

Warryn.

** linkffn(Not The Only Redhead) has a very very argumentative Harry. He gets too much leeway from those on his side most of the time. Complete, I think.
