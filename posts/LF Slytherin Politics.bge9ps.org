  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

******* First of all is Daphne Greengrass, who, when I stopped reading, just underwent the fertility ritual to make more babies. More power to people who want to start big families but it left a really sour taste in my mouth when the child decided to undergo a ritual to be more fertile, instead of any number of other rituals which could boost her own self. (We dont even know the options but there should be some interesting ones, like more magical ability maybe? More intelligence? More nature attunement? Anything worthwhile I think). The whole thing is basically Harem pitfalls 101: Harem characters cease to be their own characters and instead turn into tropes and stop all character progression. Which leads to my second biggest pet peeve. Alexandra Black. She crushed on Lord Slytherin and was disgusted by Harry Potter (or at least his Persona), one quick submission fight later and she is now one of his biggest supporters and in his Harem. And the whole "She cast a crucio, now she is ours and now Harry can trust her". And dont get me started on Hermione, Ginny or Luna. All just reduced to their respective tropes.

And if a reader just rolls his eyes at half of the cast with no hope of redemption then you know that the story is lost. All the characters stood the same and will be the same. The Matron, head of family, his first and foremost, the tomboy, the nerdy but stubborn one, the dangerous and "grey" femme-fatale.

And I havent even started on the whole "Gray!" issue that just feels plain wrong.

******** In my opinion, the only "saving" of this fic is that Harry is conscientiously an asshole. He doesn't try to hide the truth by saying he loved them before or it's to protect them. Man wants his harem and will get it.

Sadly, I find it to be the only saving grace in a story that use a lot of tropes that I dislike (the whole 11 years old politicians for example, or the whole "respect" they get by older students just on the basis their dad are politicians).

********* At first Harry did not like to have a harem. He only considered marriing Alex at first, but things got out of his controll. He only liked to bring Luna, Hermione and Ginny on his side, but he went with the flow.

Secondly, you have to consider that the WW is a good 100/200 years backwards from our time. In this time it was normal to respect the chilldren from powerful men, even when they are younger then yourself. Futhermore they belonge to families who founded their goverment with Merlin. And the Albion magic gives this few families even more power so it is not strange that the children from this families are so respected.

And because of hoe backwards they are it is normal to rais they children so that they politic in school as training for they later life.

********** This is where our opinion diverge.

I find the "at first" funny considering Harry is currently physically 12 in the story. The only "harem" member that is not totally his fault would be Luna since the familly pushed very hard for it first (but since Luna is a confirmed Seer, and a lot of hints point toward her as another time traveler). For all the other girls, he is litterally raising them to be harem member (from the start the objective was to steal the affection they had for Harry).Their is a difference between giving some respect to the son of someone powerful and the whole "I'm 11 and already the leader and the voice of a faction at school. Children are children and adults are adults, you limit the importance of the children because at this age they are able to end a political alliance just because the other heir refused to let them copy their homeworl).And, without talking about the whole "heir" thing (since almost every children in Harry year is either a muggleborn and the heir of a big familly, wonder where are the peasants of this world), the whole "11 years old master Occulumens" is a bit riddiculous.

I know some people like this story, but in my opinion, the fact that the author gave some half assed explications to justify the cliches in his story doesn't change the fact that they are still cliches.

*********** I like to know what you think funny about the "at first", because I cannot see something funny there and secondly, Harry did not plan t build a harem, but I agree that he tried to steal the girls from his brothers side, but only as friends or followers at first not as loveinterrests. He may be 12 in apperence but he is much older in mind so this point of yours is mute.

​

I think you compare the behavior of the children in this story too much with modern standards.

If you would compare them with the standards from 100-200 years back, then you would realise that it is not as strange as you might think. In the 18/19th centuary the education of children was very different, specially for children from noble or rich families. They had to learn at an early age to be polite and disciplined and to respect their "betters". Since the WW is stuck in this age it is completly normal for the heirs to act like that.

And to your point of everyone in Harry`syear being a heir or a muggleborn, well it was stated at the sorting in his first year that his year was special with so many heirs in it, but there are still more "peasants", like you called them, in his year then heirs. And the 11yo are not "master" occulumens like you put it, since a lot of them suffered from magical toxin after the train ride. They are simply thought from an early age, so that they can do better and protect their family secrets. When you are thought a skill for maybe 6-7 years, deppening when your parents started, then you are relative godd in this skill. If you are playing piano for so long then you´ll be able to play really good, because you traind your skill. The same goes for occulumency.

​

And to your last point. I think LVE did a better job at explaining the "cliches" in his story better than most authors do. And I would really like to know about what cliches you are speaking.

******** The girls are not reduced and if you would read the rest of the story then you would realise that, because the story is for the most part about character development. Not only from Harry but about his girls too.

To the topic of the submission fight and Alex being disgusted by Harry. Well, Alex was not disgusted by Harry, rather she did not like it that he did nothing while beinge so powerful. Luna explained it really good :"Alex respectes the rock(Lord S), who smacks everything in it way, more then the river(Harry), who is as strong as the rock but does nothing to something when it is droped inside" or something like that.

And to the whole "She cast a crucio, now she is ours and now Harry can trust her", the meaning of that is that Alex trustes them enough not to tell on her using an unforgivable on Harry. That means that Harry can trust her with him being LS and that she would not tell about his secret. So a complet reasonable statment.

​

And to your opinion that the story is lost. Well, how can that be when the story is still climbing higher up in the raiting of best fanficion on the different sides where it is posted? And if you do not like the cast I like to ask what exactly you do not like about it for each person.

​

Last but not least, the ritual Daphne went through. If you would have read, I think the next chapter, then you would have understood why she used this particular ritual and not another one. And the main effect of the ritual is that her firstborn is a boy, the other things are only side-effects which she accepted, because the WW is a patriachal? world, because of the albion magic casted by Merlin.

Befor I forget it I would like to know what you do not like about the Grey, before I wirte back on that.

  Forced to be the fourth champion in the Triwizard Tournament and shunned by Hogwarts and the rest of the Wizarding World, Harry finds comfort in the silence of the Chambers of Secrets. Explorations of the Chambers turns up more rooms and information than he expected. One of which is a ritual that is called 'Slytherin Binding Ritual'. Thinking it meant binding Salazar Slytherin's ghost to him and thinking 'meh, not like I'm gonna lose anything', Harry performs the ritual without even thinking of researching more about it.He forgot one of the most important thing in the world.He's Fate's personal chew toy.
