** I think I'm missing something as well. Your post is a bit hard for me to decipher, so correct me if I'm wrong. Your other post was the "Pairings?" one, correct? I'm not sure what the problem is. Your post is sitting positive, and you have a number of responses in that thread. How do you know it was downvoted and not simply not-upvoted?

I would not downvote a thread myself, unless it was spam or something similar. I cannot speak for other people. My advice would be to try again or move on. Making a rant post about such a small thing is not likely to endear people to you either.

** It's Snape. He's taking points from you because he's a dick. : )

Every community has haters and spoilers. Some people decide they'll just downvote every post in a subreddit for a couple years because someone was sarcastic to them once there.

It's reddit. The points are meaningless. If you had a conversation you enjoyed then you won.

** The surest way to get more downvotes is to complain about the ones you already have.

You aren't the first to whinge about it. Several of the regular contriutors are infamous for it.
