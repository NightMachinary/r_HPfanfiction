It's a long shot but years ago I read a fic where an ofc HP reader gets transported to the HP universe. Unfortunately, the author died of cancer before she was able to finish the story (from what I can remember). If anybody remembers what I'm talking about I would love a title. It was the best fanfic I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

Thankyou!!


** That's called a self-insert fic and there are thousands of those. You'll need to be more specific for us to be able to find it.
