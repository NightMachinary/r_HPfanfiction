  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

**** If I recall correctly there are mentions of rape but most of those are concerning the destroyed universe world that Harry leaves (voldemort and he fought to a draw each killing everyone else). There is also a rape discussed in the new universe and Harry is pretty brutal in achieving justice. The story is 288K+ words but it's been a while and I don't recall/think any of them were descriptive instead I think they were just statements that it happened.
