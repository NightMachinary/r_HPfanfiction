I'm currently writing a Dark Lord Harry fic, and it's actually a lot harder than I thought. Most fics with this premise have Harry's start of darkness be him sent to Wool's Orphanage, where he basically becomes Tom Riddle Jr 2.0. That, or they have the Dursley's beating the ever loving shit out of him every day for his entire childhood.

I've seen a few where he's raised by Voldemort and/or Death Eaters, but those aren't really Dark Lord Harry fics and he somehow becomes friends with Hermione for some reason.

I'm trying to do something different. Dark Magic /is/ horribly addictive, and changes the user to use Dark Magic more often (even when a peaceful solution is available, and often /more practical/). Dark Magic being considered Dark just because of politics is just a lie that Harry falls for.

He sees muggles as savages, but ultimately weak. He hates Muggleborns for several reasons. Since most, if not all, were raised in the Muggle world, Harry thinks they desire to change the Magical World too much. He's not /entirely/ wrong on this subject (i.e existence of SPEW, calls for the Wizengamot to eradicate family seats, tentative proposals for Muggle integration) but he's definitely not right. He doesn't see these changes as for the better, since they will bring the Wizarding World to be more like the Muggle World, which he wants to fully escape from.

He also considers Muggleborns dangerous because their 'muggle blood' makes them savage and their magic actually makes them dangerous. Also Hermione keeps opposing him and fucking up his plans.

Like any good Dark Lord, Harry is a massive hypocrite. He preaches that freedom is the most important quality in the Wizarding World; he doesn't mention that he only means his /own/ freedom, and desires to keep everyone subjugated under him to keep it that way. He claims that one can't be faulted for having a muggle/born parent so long as the other parent is magical, yet he basically rewrites history to make it seem as though Lily is descended from a Squib line of Salazar Syltherin and thus is not /really/ a muggleborn.

So now, honest opinion time. Is any of this too edgy? What pitfalls should I avoid? What should I change?


** You said you don't want a Voldemort rehash, and yet your outline showed him exactly as Voldemort 2.0.

On the other hand. I have yet to read a fic that has him leveraging Muggle men power to wipe out his magical competition, very much like how Palpatine exterminated his Force rivals with lowly clone troopers. An Order 66 in the HP universe is long overdue.

*** Yeah, I see that now.

I wanted to write a racist Harry, but I guess I basically just made him into a normal Voldemort. I'll have to change some things around, focusing less on the hatred for muggleborns and more on Harry's idea of a strong Wizarding World.

I actually have something similar to an Order 66 situation in mind.

**** If you want racist Harry to not be Voldemort 2 then make his attitude more entitlement than hatred. He thinks about muggles the same way he thinks about garden gnomes.

Advocating for muggle rights is like advocating for the rights of pet rocks. It's beyond stupid and why would anything think this is worth time and attention?

***** About to head to work rn, I'll write down what I've got so far.

-Harry's backstory is generally close to canon. No massive beatings or anything super crazy. He learns to look out for Numero Uno.

-He winds up learning a lot from the Dursleys, he sees how the Dursley's never seem to fight each other because they have Harry to belittle, Dudley can get away with pretty much anything because his parents adore him, Dudley basically rules the playground with fear, and how Dudley doesn't really have friends-he has mooks that just follow his lead.

-Harry refuses Draco's offer on the train because he sees that Draco has Crabbe and Goyle; Harry wants his own crew, like Dudley had, so that Harry can be the one in charge for once. He'd rather hedge his bets with Ron as his lackey instead of joining Draco and risking being a follower.

-I might have Harry wind up in Slytherin, in which case Ron will follow him. Ron wants to be different from his brothers, no matter what. Also I'm not gonna sugar coat the shit the Twins pulled on Ron when they were kids what with the spider teddy bear and the attempted unbreakable vow

-Harry never goes after the Stone. Voldemort is trapped in the mirror at the end of First Year. Haven't decided when he eventually escapes, sometime during the last three years.

-Dumbledore notices Harry is acting similar to Tom Riddle. Knowing he has to prevent the emergence of another Voldemort, and with Voldemort luckily locked away, Dumbledore decides that it's safe to let Harry leave the Dursley's. Harry moves in with Lupin where he learns more about his parents, and the unjust legislation against werewolves.

-During second year, Harry actually takes Lockhart's fame tips to heart, and does photo ops and such. This brings him further into the public spotlight, so he meets with important people in the Ministry like Fudge and Umbridge. Harry gets to see the incompetence of the Ministry first hand, thinking "/these/ are the people running the wizarding world?"

-some canon events will happen. The Troll attack occurs, but lol Harry doesn't give two craps about Granger. Hermione lives, but becomes more withdrawn. The other Gryffindors stop being dicks to her.

-Chamber of secrets is still opened. Might make Ginny a Slytherin, Harry uses Tom's diary a bit more. Muggleborn might die. Ministry takes action after the situation is resolved, arrest Ginny despite Dumbledore's and Harry's protests. Further incites Harry's disgust with the Ministry, also raises tensions between muggleborns and purebloods. The Weasley's distance themselves more from Ron.

-Sirius doesn't escape.

-Ever.

Pretty much all the normal canon situations, like Harry being the fourth champion in the TriWizard tournament, or Umbridge coming to Hogwarts don't happen since Voldemort is locked in the mirror.

****** It looks pretty good, but for the following:

- Get rid of Troll attack on Hermione, especially if Ron ended up in Slytherin. It was a very low probability event that required a series of preceding things to happen.

- If Harry, Ron, and Ginny were all in Slytherin, the Diary plot would be solved after the first attack. IMHO, canon CoS had by far the worst plot because it assumed adults to be utterly incompetent. Please don't fall into that trap.

- If your Voldemort was trapped in the mirror, no one would ever free Barty Jr, and there was NO WAY Harry would enter as the 4th champion. Furthermore, the Barty impersonating Moody plot was ridiculous to begin with because it again assumed an idiot Dumbledore. Also, if Harry didn't burn up Quirrellmort in PS, Voldemort had no way of knowing Harry's protection, and using someone else's blood for his resurrection had much lower risk.

******* But, you miss a crucial detail. Nothing says that the magical nations have to follow the same alliance lines as the muggle ones. Magical Russia could fight on the side of the Axis, if they wanted to, and you could justify that with something about how since Stalin took power violently, no one in the previous regime could tell him anything about the magical world, nor did they want to. So magical Russia is not socialist like the USSR. Perhaps they want to fight with the Nazis to bring an end to the Stalin regime. The reason Stalin needs so much aid from his allies, is because Russian wizards just vanish his supplies, or something.

I'll change the conflict around so it's less about blood status (though this will still be a minor part) and more about politics. When the Statute falls, the Ministry falls with it, and now Britain is descended into Anarchy. So now you'll have wizards and muggles not knowing what the hell to do with each other, with some on both sides calling for blood and some calling for a united government.

** The title of a Dark Lord is given too freely in HP fanfic in my opinion. That title should be given to those who are willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING to their own ends. There is a difference between Dark lord and a Dark wizard.

Do you plan to make him dark only in his views about a society or will he train and use dark magic ? I have yet to read a good story where Harry is actually training and using dark magics likes of blood magic, soul magic etc. You should also make a balance between magic and politics.

Will he have a teacher ? Or will he be just a lone wolf, trying and studying just by himself ?

You should ask yourself if you're going for Chaotic Evil likes of Voldemort or more Neutral Evil like Darth Sidious was.

What will be his goal ? Domination ? A new order ? Power only for himself ? Will he care about consequences or just kill everyone who stands in his way without a second thought ? Or will he be manipulative and fight only when he's completely assured of his victory ?

There shouldn't be any relationships purely out of love. Passion, lust, desire, greed is the way.

These are just a few questions you should ask yourself if you're going to write Dark Lord Potter story. Your summed up Dark Harry who is like a second Voldemort.

Also you shouldn't make him super-powerful 11 years old. There should be some build up, trails and errors etc.

An interesting story should have interesting choices. An interesting protagonist should make dark choices because of character flaws, untenable situations, lack of options, etc., not because they're simply /addicted/ (i.e., I exagerate, but: /mindlessly/ addicted).

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] is probably a good example of a "good" character making dark choices. She starts off wanting to be a hero, but gets sucked into being a villain because the authorities are so messed up she finds (or at least feels) she can do more good as a villain than as a hero (and other reasons).

The Harry Potter verse could easily be a similar setting with an inept/corrupt Ministry where becoming a "Dark Lord" is (as Harry sees it, because Dumbledore was a failure) the only real way to effect change (which doesn't necessarily mean Voldemort was a good guy -- you don't need two good Dark Lords in your story), even if that means truly resorting to actual dark magic. Harry becoming a Dark Lord to help muggleborns/werewolves/etc., opposed by the Ministry, opposed by Voldemort, /and/ opposed by Hermione who is also fighting for muggleborns/werewolves/etc. but denounces his methods? That could be interesting.

**** Have you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/][The Never-ending Road]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3117309/][Iaventadorn]]? Plot aside, the way the author describes Dark Magic is pretty interesting. You get a magical backlash proportionate to power of the spell/ritual, which causes mild/immense pain for seconds to weeks. The pull of Dark Magic is how much more powerful they are, even at the lowest. The backlash isn't immediate either. It seems to kick in a few hours later.

For example, a locating spell that tells you precisely where someone is, and gives apparation coordinates is on the low-level to middling side of Dark Magic, causing what amounts to muscle cramps and a headache for an hour or so. Pretty damn powerful if you ask me.

If you use the same spell, but it also binds the target in place (until you choose to release them), will give a much worse backlash that lasts a day or so.

The limiter is pain, so most sane practicioners don't try the more powerful spells. Being an occlumens helps immensely with it, or having undergone rituals to alter how your brain reacts to pain (also risky). Bellatrix was a certified masochist, which explains her position and reputation.

Only throwing it out there. I'm not a fan of simple explanations on either side of the coin. If the only thing bad about Dark Magic is the legality and addiction, it makes it seem like heroin, and that's kinda boring.

Nobody wants to read about someone shooting up all the time either. It gets tiring after the first few descriptions. It was kind of my only problem with the Denarian Renegade series, tbh.

I'm really digging your concept though. I've never read a Dark Lord Potter that I really enjoyed. They're in the 'WWE' category for me as far as entertainment goes. Not a bad thing, mind, just campy and a bit ridiculous.

I've seen that a few times. You have to be careful with it so it's not debilitating -- your protagonist has to be a Lord and attract followers.

Voldemort is all about tearing down the Ministry, infiltrating it, and consuming it from the inside. You could make your Dark Lord's faction be about building up, offering an alternative to the Ministry's way. One that brings him in quick and direct conflict with the Ministry, though they'd probably have to make the first move.

Voldemort is sadistic and cruel, cackling in delight over torturing Muggles. Harry might instead be cold and callous, destroying whole towns because they were in the way.

I would suggest changing their goals, though. You're giving them a lot of similarities; the more differences you can add, the better. For instance, maybe Harry's goal is to steal away all the Muggleborns, incorporate them into society fully, have them as a solid backbone of society. This contrasts with Voldemort's goal of eradicating them or stuffing them into an underclass. Whatever it is, make sure there's something compelling about it.

** Harry as a true dark lord would be more in line with B/W than Voldemort's B/R. This is using the magic color wheel, where black is selfish and self interested and is willing to attain power by any means (which is sort of a prerequisite for a dark lord). Red is a passionate color that rides high on emotions. It loves destruction, often so that what is left behind can be used to create something new. White on the other hand favors order, puts the good of the many over that of the individual, and often is more reactive in nature.

Voldemort was very much B/R, also known as Rakdos. The cult of Rakdos is a hedonistic group that is in favor of gaining power by inflicting pain, spreading madness, and forcing all to bow to their dark master or be sacrificed. Voldemort is a very passionate and highly selfish individual who enjoys inflicting pain on others, often simply because he derives pleasure from it. Voldemort has no interest in anything greater than his own power. He leaves no lasting memorials, has no true cause of his own, and really is in it just to reign supreme over all while taking delight in the suffering of his foes.

Harry's difference would be that he would be very interested in maintaining some sort of order, especially to protect his friends and family. He would acquire power not inflict harm or destroy, but to protect and build. Where Voldemort would burn the world just to watch, Harry would try to freeze everything in perfect stasis. He wouldn't hesitate to destroy his enemies, but he would wait for just cause. Harry going down the Dark Path wouldn't be for his own gain: he would likely lose someone close to him (Ginny or Ron would be the best candidates) and go on the warpath with the rallying cry of "Never Again!"

** There is one element that is key to a good villain story-corruption. How the character goes from being a random nobody to a major villain rarely starts with them waking up one morning with a suddenly good evil laugh and ridiculous schemes.

Riddle's a good example of this-he starts out just stealing objects and scaring kids. Over the course of six/seven years, he manages to build himself up to committing murder in the name of his own immortality. And 25 years later, when he bursts onto the scene, he's batshit insane.

From A to B to C, you see the gradual escalation occurring. Riddle didn't start out as an insane supervillain. He was a sadist, yes, but so are a lot of other kids Riddle's age (though not to the degree he took it, bullies are unforunately common). Being sadistic didn't make him a murderer. Being a sociopath didn't make him a villain.

It wasn't his nature that turned Tom Riddle into Voldemort. What made Riddle Voldemort was the choices he made. And the choices he made were influenced by the environments and circumstances he was exposed to.

It's easy to forget that he was in London during World War 2. He was likely there during the Blitz and the Battle of Britain, which meant that he experienced rationing, bombing attacks and much more firsthand.

It's also easy to forget that Riddle did, at some point, make his way to Albania to recover Ravenclaw's diadem. He most probably did such a thing during a time when Albania was better known as the People's Socialist Republic of Albania and part of the communist bloc.

Which meant that he would have probably travelled across post-war Eastern Europe to get there. Thing was that Eastern Europe continued being a merry little slice of Hell for a long time after Berlin fell, given that the communists turned out to be just as bloodthirsty as the Nazis in the end.

What I think happened is that Riddle's innate paranoia and disregard of others certainly motivated him, but it was the events he witnessed that pushed him over the edge. Those would have definitely played a part in his fall and the rise of Voldemort.

Dark Lords are all about the journey. Getting Harry Potter to become a Dark Lord requires a gradual slide over time-a little willingness to inflict pain here, a desire for more advanced magical abilities there, add a little motivation and voila!

You can play canon events that way. Harry being a little more traumatized, scared, angry and willing to play fast & loose with some of the more dangerous magics around in order to better protect himself would, if obeying the stations of canon, naturally lead to a vastly darker mindset come the middle of book five.

Being tortured for months on end with nobody but his friends willing to step in to help him very nearly pushes Harry over the edge in canon-and definitely marks the point where Hermione goes 'fuck it, I'll just lure the Toad into a centaur den and let them figure out what to do with the bitch', which has all kinds of 'fun' implications thanks to Greek mythology.

I found the part where she hung around the hospital wing to bang coconuts together out of Umbridge's sight to be satisfyingly sadistic too.

But yeah, Harry. You can have him playing by much more violent and murderhappy rules by book seven if you simply allow corruption to actually be a thing he's susceptible to.

I swear, with the amount of shit he's seen, violent insanity is a more than plausible outcome.

I would love a fic like that if it doesn't take itself seriously. Imagine this, Harry is smart for his age. His teachers shower him with accolades, he skips grades all over the place. The Dursleys are loving and supportive. Now he gets his Hogwarts' letter. A whole new world to explore. Excitement and stuff. Blah blah blah he's at Hogwarts ravenclaw blah blah bullying Weasley pranks blah blah. The teachers are awful. They refuse to acknowledge his ideas. No, you can't test those theories Harry. That's not what the answer in book gives Harry. Pupils at Hogwarts School must remain in the year they were sorted Harry. Those spells aren't safe for a first year Harry. That book is outlawed everywhere but the DMZ in between Magical Texas and the Aztecs Harry. Meanwhile he sees Hermione constantly rewarded and praised for her repetitive, /arrogant/ *useless* */memorization/*. He gets fed up with Hermione's lack of thought and the whole world's utter incompetence sometime second or third year and snaps. Maybe Lockhart is what finally does it. Maybe it's the dementors.

So, he has lots of ideas, all of which have already been considered, tested, and disconfirmed --- something he'd know if he'd spent a few hours in the library; his other theories would be extremely time-consuming and/or dangerous to test, and while he is free to do so so when he's an adult and can cast the relevant spells, no one is obligated to do it for him.

And, what he see as Hermione's lack of thought is just a reflection of the fact that up until the OWLs, all the answers /are/, in fact, in the textbook.

**** Interesting. So. Doom had a tragic past (And here Voldemort acts kinda the same so we're ok there.)

So now Hermione has to show him up in a key class where her memorization ends up being superior and Harry can't reconcile that. So he takes the summer (as opposed to running away from NYU and scarring his face in Tibet) and obsesses over that and blames her.

Like. The its the straw that breaks him. Lockhart. The education process. Dementors. Maybe the Tri Wizard.

Wait. It would need to be After HBP that this occurs.

He'd find a kindred spirit in the HBP and hoard it and learn from it, drink it in. End of year happens and Hermione shows him up even after all the HBP book helps. Summer to concoct his plan and let the world now to his whim.

That would make a lot of sense. Have a snippet.

*Background:* Harry, Ron, and Hermione never became friends. Ron and Hermione are both in Gryffindor, but they aren't really on each other's radars. Hermione doesn't have very close friends, but she's friendly with some older students (starting with Percy) and some Hufflepuffs. Harry and Hermione have a sort of a one-sided rivalry, as described upthread.

Harry has finally managed to start beating Hermione in Potions due to the HBP's textbook. She somehow learned of it, and so she went to Slughorn to report Harry for what she sees as cheating. Which brings us to...

*Horace Slughorn and the Socratic Method*

"Thank you for your report, Miss Granger; I've been wondering myself why Mister Potter has been outperforming everyone by such a margin. Is there anything else?"

"May I ask what will happen?"

"If you are asking what I intend to do, Miss Granger, the answer is nothing, at this point."

"But Professor, isn't that unfair to the rest of us?"

Hermione saw Slughorn's normally jovial demeanour dissipate, as he perused her for a few long seconds, before relenting.

"Miss Granger, I try to be friendly, and easygoing, but that does not give you license to question my disciplinary decisions. However, as I seem to have a weakness for inquisitive Muggleborn Gryffindors, perhaps I will explain myself. Come, sit."

Hermione complied.

"Miss Granger, have you heard the saying 'Never do any enemy a small injury'?"

Hermione searched her memory. "Niccolo Machiavelli, /The Prince/, right?"

Slughorn raised an eyebrow. "Salazar Slytherin. Anyway, consider how it applies to the present situation."

"You... think that punishing him would give him a grudge against you, and whatever punishment you could administer would not weaken his ability to retaliate."

"Indeed. I try not to have any more enemies than I absolutely have to; but in Mister Potter's case, I don't think he'll really understand why he is being punished, is known to be particularly vindictive, and his name as the Boy-Who-Lived still caries weight for some powerful people."

"If I may," Hermione hesitated, before deciding to press ahead with the question, "does that mean that Harry will get away with cheating because he is vindictive?"

"I never said that, Miss Granger. Actions have consequences. Consider which outcomes Mister Potter attains by cheating, and how those relate to outcomes that matter in the long run."

Hermione thought out loud. "Harry is getting better marks, and he is getting praised for how smart he is... But only for this year, and NEWT is the only mark that matters in the long run... And he isn't understanding things any better, just learning some tips for specific potions."

"So you see, Miss Granger, I don't need to punish Harry, because Harry will punish himself. In my experience, Gryffindors tend think in principles, whereas Slytherins tend to think in consequences. Each could stand to learn from the other."

"But why do you encourage him? It seems... manipulative."

"I encourage all my NEWT students to experiment, Miss Granger. In fact, I've been a bit surprised about how timid you've been this year."

Hermione thought back to the classes, how there either wasn't quite enough time to finish the potion, or missing ingredients... "If we had gone off-recipe in Professor Snape's class, he'd have used a Permanent Sticking Charm to glue our hands together," she remarked. "But, this is NEWT-level?"

Slughorn nodded. "Now, how do you think was Mister Potter able to brew Amortentia in the allotted time?"

Hermione frowned. "He probably used the book. I hadn't been watching him just then."

"Certainly, but what do you think the book might have told him to do?"

With a concrete problem to solve, things were simpler. Mentally went over that lesson, thinking out loud. "Well, /I/ got held up cutting the Sopophorous Bean, but you couldn't prepare it in advance, since the juice evaporates too quickly... But you just need to get at the juice, so you can just squeeze it out... But wouldn't crushing it... Unless you crushed it with a pestle made of a noble metal, maybe?

"OK, but juice without pulp would make the reaction too fast. What if you stir it slower? No, too subjective: it couldn't have been an instruction in the book. Lower the temperature? But that would weaken the potion. OK, how about the reverse stirring trick? You'd have to do it once every... Three... No, you don't want to slow it down all the way; seven for balance. Or is it every six for a cycle of seven? No, you want them to partially counteract each other. So, one clockwise stir for every seven anticlockwise?" She resumed eye contact with Slughorn, who had been nodding along.

"That may well work, Miss Granger. A potion recipe you see in a book is a delicate balance, trading off safety, potency, simplicity, economy of ingredients, and economy of time against each other. There is usually a straightforward way to improve on any one of these characteristics, but it almost always comes with a cost in terms of the others. A lot of what a potioneer does is compensate for the undesirable side-effects of the modifications made to produced the desired effects.

"Any other matters you would like to discuss?"

"No, thank you, sir. I'll try to do better in the future."

"Always happy to help an interested student. Oh, and Miss Granger... You are one of those fortunate people for whom hard work is its own reward, but how about a little extra incentive? As it happens, I do have another philtre of Felix Felicis. Beat Mister Potter's Potions marks for the remainder of the year, and it's yours. I'm sure you could find an interesting use for it."

--------------

I don't think Slughorn is too OOC. One way to look at it is that we only see his interactions with Harry, and those are laden with guilt over Tom Riddle and fear that Harry might follow in his footsteps, so he deflects with his bumbling, jovial persona. Around someone like Hermione --- an eager, intelligent student --- he might be more clear-headed and professorial.

But clearly there are smarter people than Doom (though in Dooms case not many) so Harry thinks he's smarter than everyone, been catered too to some extent, and is now destroying his NEWT level potions, so his 'betters' need to do something) arrogance fuels him to be more brazen or what have you.

** My biggest peeve about Dark Lord Harry is how so many authors tries to make him into a "good" character and try to justify whatever horror he does. "They deserve it, It's justified, I'm right, [x] is not terrible, because [y]" Look. At best it diminish the whole goal of the character if you try to justify his actions and remove the whole 'dark' aspect. It makes everything stale and bland.

A good Dark Lord is, possibly not a villain, but certainly someone that is ready to commit unjustifiable horrors to achieve his goal. A goal that can be acceptable, believable (like the one you have), but the distinction between "Dark Lord" and patriot or revolutionist would certainly be in the actions he does and what he is ready to sacrifice to achieve it.

Think LONG AND HARD how Dark Lord Harry would achieve his goal and, then, think even harder about justifying his actions because he's the MC.

** It would be far easier to write a Dark Lord/Viligante Harry that does a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge][Great Purge]] on the Ministry since they watched how thousands of innocents died under Voldemort and then let his supporters go with a slap on the wrist. So Harry adopts a "if you are not with me you are against me" mentality and sees everyone not oppenly supporting his fight against Voldemort as one of his hidden supporters.

Throw in some Harry/Katie Bell romance and then let the first half of 6th year play out as it did (with Katie nearly dying in Malfoy's plot and no one caring) and then he decides to get shit done on his own. At first, the public supports him since he is THE CHOSEN ONE and the average wizard does not care about Malfoy and his bribes. The ministry wants to arrest him, causing a massive shitstorm and then Harry turns on them ("They try to stop my justice? Well, pureblood supremacists, the whole lot of them"). What started as a righteous crusade turns into a killing spree.

*** *Great Purge*

The Great Purge or the Great Terror (Russian: Большо́й терро́р) was a campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union which occurred from 1936 to 1938. It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials, repression of peasants and the Red Army leadership, widespread police surveillance, suspicion of "saboteurs", "counter-revolutionaries", imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. In Russian historiography, the period of the most intense purge, 1937--1938, is called Yezhovshchina (Russian: Ежовщина; literally, "Yezhov phenomenon", commonly translated as "times of Yezhov" or "doings of Yezhov"), after Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, who was later killed in the purge. It has been estimated that 600,000 people died at the hands of the Soviet government during the Purge.

** I think it depends whether you want to maintain as much as possible the 'canon' of Harry as a character. I don't think he can be pushed to a limit where he would discard human life if it furthered his goals. He finds it difficult enough that others sacrifice themselves to save him. That's why I think the 'Dark Lord Harry' idea is too much. However, if you don't have any canon-like aspirations, you could make this realistic. I would recommend not having him hate Muggleborns. But perhaps go for the 'precious magic' angle where he becomes so enamoured with magic itself that he will do much to protect it. That way he will also see Purebloods as noble protectors of the old magical world.

Personally, I am trying to figure out how to spoil our lovely hero, exploit his 'grey' side, while staying as close to the 'canon' Harry as possible. I think linkffn(4745329) is one of the few who pulled that off convincingly. (Which is why I'm aching for an update. I recently reread that one even though I knew I shouldn't. The author says it is not abandoned but still, it might take ages...) And I felt so alive from it! Because it nails the character so precisely while at the same time confronting Harry with a moral slippery slope. I find that the most exhilarating thing fanfiction can offer.

** I'm currently writing a fic about something very similar. Please note my Reddit name and if you're reading any fics under the same name, it's probably me and spoilers are inbound so I can contribute to this post. :) Sorry! However, if you want to spoil my own story that I'll never link, feel free.

The Harry in my fic is different to almost every other dark Harry fic that I have read. He grew up loved, had his parents, was punished just like a normal person. Sometimes his parents messed up and he was ignored, but he was not abused at all. His hatred comes from the fact that someone else (the BWL) was famous, popular, and well-known and he wasn't. It seems so petty, doesn't it? All Harry wanted to be was well-known, famous, and what everyone talked about.

However, that's the start of his darker personality. What he didn't get, he took. He threw himself into reading, books, scrolls, anything he could find to prove he was better. There is a massive lead up to him becoming a dark wizard and then it's as a Death Eater. But little Harry didn't want to be a slave, so he works from within to pull apart the Death Eaters, turning against Voldemort and trying to kill him. However, while he has his fingers in everything, he's starting his own little empire, using Muggles.

I don't want to just post my plot, but he eventually starts a world war, taking over almost the entire world before he's stopped. His goal was to end up being the only magical person, becoming a God in the eyes of Muggles and he succeeded. To wizards, he was the greatest dark lord to ever lived, beating Voldemort, who was alive to witness this, to Muggles, he was a benevolent saviour.

This may not be what you asked for, but there's more to creating a baddie than just a tragic past and blood-purity. You need a build up. What I listed is about 7 books worth. It's a lot, but it stops Harry from becoming powerful overnight. The innate ability is there, but it's not just instant

** I really liked the DLP from The Sum Of Their Parts. Maybe you can read that and infuse your idea with some of that characterisation?
