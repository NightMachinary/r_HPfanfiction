In many James/Lily fics I have read, the author seems to make it perfectly normal for Lily to slap James or hex him whenever he does something stupid or even verbally abuse him. If the genders were reversed everyone would scream abuse.


** The fandom has taken the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentingTheHusband][Parenting the Husband]] trope to the extreme in the case of Lily and James, so I don't think authors realize just how stupid and abusive they make the relationship to be.

It's most certainly not a healthy relationship, but it's the easiest thing to write for authors instead of actually coming up with personalities for Lily and James. We already know James used to be a massive prankster (though it's made clear he matured a lot even as a teenager), and that Lily has no issue making her objections to his behavior known. They just ratcheted it up a few notches and called it marriage, probably because modern media has drummed it into children's minds that that is what marriage is.

** Yes, it's a terrible anime trope, often applied to Ginny and Hermione as well. Just for once I'd like to see them getting turned into a toad the second they threaten to hex their friends for voicing an opinion they don't like.

*** Well, in the movie, when Hermione warned Harry that Romilda Vane tried to does him with love potion, Harry cheekily answered that 'he was the chosen one', whereas Hermione slapped him with a piece of parchment.

Earlier in the same movie, when Harry went missing due to being stunned by Draco, Hermione slapped Ron hard with her books.

In the Books, when Ron returned from his absence, Hermione beat the crap out of him, much more violently than in the movie.

Did I mention already that I hate the movies and the way they ruined the characters?

Now there's a slight difference between the Hermione/Ron confrontation in DH and hexing your friend because he joked about something you don't find funny, or voiced an opinion you don't like, like we often see in fanfiction. And the thing is, it actually makes the characters who do this look like stupid bullies who can't listen to something they don't like without resorting to violence.

This was obviously for fun, like the stuff that happens between friends and it's very different than beating someone seriously and out of anger.

** Yes. It's not even just Lily, any story that has a main female character who behaves that way irks me. It's not only abusive but also immature. It's one of the things that made me slow down on Anime, too. I've grown up and roll my eyes at that predictable behavior. Sometimes I'll ignore it, but if it's paired with bad writing I'll consider reading something else.

**** People could extrapolate from that event.

Lily slapping or hexing James was not that out of place.

For example, Ginny hexed Zach Smith just because he asked a few questions about the DoM battle. I have no doubt that if Zach dared to ask Ginny out, he would be hexed beyond recognition.

I think Lily almost had the same fierce temper as Ginny, and that she despised James even more before their year 7. So I wouldn't be surprised if she hexed him for asking her out, and it's equally not surprising many other readers imagine the same.

****** I mostly look past Ginny hexing Zach for asking about the DoM battle. For one, we don't know what he was asking, it could have been that he was being an ass-hat; saying that Harry got his godfather killed, that Ginny wasn't actually there, etc. And two, the DoM battle was likely a traumatic event for her, and she may have over-reacted to something he did during the conversation.

I'm just extrapolating this from my high school experiences, but whenever someone got into a serious event, it was like it was some rite of passage for dumbasses to do something to get a reaction out of the person. I could easily imagine Zach whipping his wand out like he was going to attack her, and getting hexed into a pile of mush for his trouble.
