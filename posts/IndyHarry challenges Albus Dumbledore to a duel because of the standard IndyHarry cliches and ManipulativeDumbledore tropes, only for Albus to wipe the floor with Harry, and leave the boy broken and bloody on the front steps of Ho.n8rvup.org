It turns out that Albus was testing Harry... to be his successor. But Harry's rather spectacularly childish temper tantrum (which contained an utterly ludicrous laundry list of imagined slights) before the duel ruined that possibility irrevocably. Bonus points if Albus starts up a rant of his own after thrashing Harry with "Why did you make me do this?!".

This seems a bit... overly violent for Dumbledore if he's supposed to be the good guy here, especially if he's just reacting to a childish tantrum.

**** Yeah, thinking on it it kinda does seem a bit too far; though in my defense I did just finish binging Invincible before I made the post, so maybe I was a bit bloodlusted because of that.

That said, I kinda had the idea that Dumbledore started out the fight just trying to restrain Harry, but Harry kept hitting all the wrong buttons with a ceaceless tirade throughout the fight, culminating in all but accusing Albus of murdering Ariana, leading to Dumbledore's last nerve snapping.

****** I was under the impression that who it was that ultimately dealt the fatal spell to her was unknown; due to the chaotic nature of the three-way duel between Albus, Aberforth, and Gellart. All I know for certain is that Aberforth blames Albus, Albus blames himself, and Gellart didn't really care. Also I suspect that her death was a tragic accident that came about because two or more spells collided together, and went ricocheting off in random directions; thereby meaning that all three combatants would technically be the cause for her death, because it happened as a direct result of them choosing violence over words.

All that said, part of the idea would be Harry phrasing his taunts in such a way as to imply that Albus went out of his way to murder his own sister, possibly alluding to a bunch of fictional reasons that seem consistant with the deluded picture of "Albus Dumbledore" Harry has conjured in his mind.

******* Yes it is technically unknown, but an equally strong argument can be made that it was him that did it as it could be that he didn't that's the point lol

** I'm also imagining the idea of it being a somewhat canon verse, with the Harry of that world telling the Indy one what he did wrong or that he's lost his mind.

** During the Indy Harry Rant

Harry: You used my Money to enrich yourself under the guise of the betterment of Hogwarts!

Dumbledore: Yes I used the Potter money to help fund Hogwarts for muggle-borns and some of the Poorer wizarding family students as was agreed upon with your Parents Harry.

Lord Potter Griffindor Peverell god almighty I'm too lazy for this just imagine 50 more titles in your head, also known as Harry Potter: My parents would have never agreed to such a thing I am from a proud Pureblood family who would never agree to such a thing.

Dumbledore: You are aware that your mother was one of the people that benefited from that agreement when I struck the same with your Grandfather Harry.

Harry: Stopp calling me Harry you old bumbling Lemondrop sucking fool you shall address me with my Propper titles!!!

Dumbledore: Tiles what tiles? The Potters are now a, with your, 5th generation Wizarding family that due to their generally Powerful Wizards were highly revered throughout the wizarding world.

Harry: You're lying the goblins have told me the truth!

Dumbledore: The goblins! You are trusting the goblins who only care about money and the downfall of the Wizarding World! Harry please I'm begging you open your eyes you have been lied to by the same beings who tell you everything you want to hear.

Harry: LIAR! Fires of a crucio...
