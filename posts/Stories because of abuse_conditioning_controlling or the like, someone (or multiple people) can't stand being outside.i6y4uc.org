Maybe they're not used to being outside (If it's Harry, maybe the Dursley's kept him inside), if it's someone else, some other reason.

It can be a major thing in the story or a minor thing.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site, can be any length, anyone can be the main character.

I'd rather not have Weasley bashing (if at all possible).
