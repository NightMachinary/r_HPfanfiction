:END:
So yeah, I was recommending some well written oneshots to a friend and I couldn't recall the name of one of them. And then I couldn't find it on any lists. I hope I didn't dream it up. Here's what I recall:

-it is a very dark oneshot

-it opens with a morose older Harry getting wasted at a muggle bar and getting picked up by Percy

-the main person Harry interacts with is Daphne Greengrass(she is like half blaming him for her sister's death and half appreciative that he avenged her)

-it has some memory modification in it, similar to the movie "Eternal Sunshine...."
