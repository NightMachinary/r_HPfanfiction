** Dobby, Mundungus Fletcher, Pettigrew and Draco fucking Malfoy ahead of Ron? Sounds like BS.

There isn't any evidence that the Founders were more powerful than Grindelwald. There isn't enough evidence to say anything, really.

Also, Harry>Hermione.

** What are the numbers? Their power level or what? I mean various people have their strengths and weaknesses. For example Hagrid is ranked quite lowly because he doesn't have a formal education... however he can cast a few spells, he has strong resistance to spells and he can snap a normal human in two without a problem. Not to mention his ability to keep under control dangerous beasts.

Other than the fact that we're told that Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard alive and Voldemort is the second, everything else is up for interpretation.

** Your video is based on nothing, the rankings are meaningless, and yet you're still probably wrong about almost everything. So basically, it's really bad.

The video also does not fit even the loosest definition of fanfiction, so it shouldn't be here.
