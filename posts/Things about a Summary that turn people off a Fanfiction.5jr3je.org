** Leading questions annoy me like: Will Harry's massive Diagon Alley shopping trip give him the power to beat Moldyshorts? Will his marriage contracts lead to true love or true love with smut? Can Harry take control of his life from the master manipulator, Ronald 'the cannon' Weasley?

I don't know but these questions only ever have one spoiler-packed answer and it's almost always the obvious one.

*** I simply apply the 'headline question' reasoning to it: if a headline of an article is a question, the answer is always 'no'. In fanfiction summaries, it's 'yes'. Yes, thanks, that's your entire story, moving on now. They're annoying, tabloid-y and make me skip over your fic instantly if overused.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

**** Because it feels a bit like begging to do it before someone's even read the story and if it's on FF, you're wasting characters you could be using to actually tell me what your story is about.

If you want to ask people to review, leave it for an A/N inside the fic. Sometimes, I think even that's too much. Everyone knows (most) writers want reviews, so saying it somewhere in your fic or in the summary just seems a redundant thing to do. If a person plans to/wants to review, they'll do so with or without prompting from the writer.

***** When I was in high school writing fanfiction, I thought asking for reviews was something every writer did, sort of like including a disclaimer, so I just did stuff like jokingly threaten my readers with an STD. It got me several reviews (mentioning the threat as the reason they reviewed), so...

I kind of agree with you now, though. People are either going to review or not, and the author isn't in much of a position to demand it.

***** "Everyone knows writers want reviews" honestly I... don't think that's true? From my perspective (as a writer) I think it's pretty understandable that since we are giving something for free to you, it feels pretty reasonable to remind people to review? I can see why it might come off as needy but also if you think of it from our perspective, it can be really demoralising to know people are reading but not have them say they like it at all? It's like screaming into a void sometimes. Why keep writing and posting it if no one cares, you know?

Fun example: my fic with the most hits (on ao3) has 3400ish. It has 70 kudos and ONE comment. Which... is really sad. It's a one shot and only about 500 words but it's for a very popular ship. To be fair, my ongoing WIP (5 chapters posted - nearly 20k now) has only about 1600 hits but 77 kudos and 30ish comments (if you discount my replies - I respond to everyone who comments so the number looks a lot higher) - but even still, most of those are from the same 4-5 people. Same pairing. So, I dunno. I guess I can see both sides but I can't fault someone for asking for something in return for their time and effort!

****** I'm a writer too. Very little of my stuff gets reviewed. I don't think it's because my readers don't know that I want them, there are thousands, millions, of others telling them they do in their stories. If they don't realize that the majority of writers are looking for feedback on their fics with or without the prompt after reading their first dozen or so fanfics, then, sorry, but they're dense and aren't likely to ever catch on.

I think a lot of writers, if they stay in the game long enough, know most of the time they will be screaming into a void if they aren't writing exactly what the masses want (i.e. romance, pairings like Dramione, and tropes such as Powerful!Harry). Part of the fanfic game is accepting that and finding ways to get feedback other ways (review games/exchanges, building a repertoire with the reviewers you do get) or conforming to the want of the masses and writing decent fics that fulfill the criteria the majority of readers are looking for.

P.S. I don't hate people who have author's notes that say "please review!", or even those who have it their summary (though, I refuse to read their stories), I just think what they're doing is pointless overall.

Wow. This isn't the first time I've seen this viewpoint expressed but it's so polarised from my own view I can't really get my head round it. For me, writing is a compulsion; writing fanfiction is an indulgence. If somebody actually reads what I have written I am beyond grateful. Yes, it's frustrating not to know if readers actually like what you have written and reviews are rare, precious things to be cherished, but I have never, not ever felt I was doing someone a /favour/ by writing fanfiction. The readers are doing me the favour.

******* It's funny because a lot of the time I feel the same way - I'm thankful anyone would even bother to read my stuff and glad that people support the strange things I write about. (Which is good, because this subreddit particularly always makes me feel the opposite - what I write is not what is popular here.) I too often feel like my writing is a compulsion - but that said, my touching it up and polishing it and posting it online at the end of the day IS free entertainment. Youtube creators have ads to make money, comic artists have donation pages. I don't really want money, I like that this is a free time hobby. But, I also think it's not unreasonable that after spending a lot of my time creating something that other people consumer, I would want to hear their thoughts on it?

My favourite reviews are ones about what's happening. Mostly I want to talk about my stories, my motivations. I dunno. My main point here was that it seems a bit odd to write off a story completely just because the author reminded readers to review.

** Thinking on summaries that make me quickly scroll past and look at the next stories...

- Summaries that don't summarize, and instead are direct quotes from the story itself, either dialog or prose, that make no sense out of the context of the chapter. This doesn't grab me, it just makes me confused.

- Outlandish premises that make me go "...but why?" I get that some people write fun, ridiculous stories, but when your summary starts with "Harry and Draco, living as female narwhals on the international space station, get into an argument about how to save farm land to feed their cult..." I just - how is this even considered HP fan fiction at this point? But I guess that has more to do with that actually sorry plot than the summary itself

- Personal author reflections instead of story description such as "I hate Ginny and think she's whiny and terrible and she's bad in this story" or "I just loved the scene in the movie when Hermione cast the bird spell at Ron..." Keep those thoughts in an author note if you want to share.

** My biggest gripe is the "promise of the premise" that then fails to get delivered. The summary actually does its job of hooking me in and making me want to read the story. But then the actual story abandons the very hook that got me interested.

I saw a summary that had Ron performing a curse that made all the Weasleys slowly hate Harry. Ok, that would be interesting to see the dynamic slowly change between Harry and the Weasleys, and perhaps see if some stronger type of magic could bring them all back together. Except the actual story covered about one chapter of it and then moved on to a far different story.

If you're going to write a summary, have it actually summarize what happens in the story. Don't tease a promising premise and then not deliver on it.

** Not necessarily just a summary-only pet-peeve, but I can't stand it when people use accent instead of an apostrophe. (/Harry´s gold/ instead of /Harry's gold/) It's even more visible in the ffnet font. Another ffnet thing I hate is when people don't tag the pairing. They just put in the two characters without pairing them, and when you are trying to find fics with that particular pairing, it won't find that one.
