I start reading and look at reviews after a few chapters. Specially true if they are long fics where I would be spending a lot of time reading for them to go bust halfway through.

Also, if you are reading this post, I hope you are doing well!


** No. I read decently fast and it's not like a standard book where I'd have to buy or borrow from the library to try it out. I can generally tell within a chapter or two if I'm going to like it, but I don't trust people's reviews to give me an accurate picture of whether I'll like something or consider it good.

** Yes absolutely I do. If I see more than one comment about bad spelling/grammar/confusion about the plot, I'm out.

I'm watching shark tank and this made me laugh.

Honestly, I have found some really good fics with really really bad spellings which have been so awesome. But I understand, its really hard to stick with a story if its saying "desecrated" when it really wants to say "restricted".

** I read the last (current) page of reviews/comments, and then I skip to the middle of the pack when the last chapter released.

The first one is to check the grammar/spelling/plot/etc, and the second one is to see if the ending was good or the fic was still good. Too many times have I read a fic and the ending was crap.

THEN! I check the last chapter to see if it is legitimately the final chapter, or the author abandoned the fic and marked it as complete.

FFNet really needs to add an "Abandoned" tag for status.

Honestly, all the site functionality is not on the app, and all the app filters are not on the website. Seriously, its very sad.

*** Thats an interesting idea. So if reviews say the fics are good or something, you DON'T read them? Why so?

Edit:

is it only comments like "so awesome blah blah"?

*** I have a fic in both ff.net and ao3. I don't really get much reviews in general, but:

In ff.net the reviews are similar to what you describe as a sign of being a bad fic.

While in Ao3 the reviews are about what happened in the chapter and engaging enough for me to answer to them and talk a little about the characters or events.

Is my fic good or bad?

***** I guess the threads thing is true about ff.net. Maybe I should advertise my Ao3 account in ff.net

***** Im a slow burn author, normally they don't have many points for discussion in the first few chapters, but when I put in my twist there's always a good chunk of them that start a discussion,

Is that good or bad?

** I don't seek out the reviews. If I'm on the ffn app when I'm pulling up a fic for the first time I'll end up looking at the most recent comments just because they are right there in your face. If I'm reading on AO3 I often start to look at comments a couple of chapters in just to see what other people are thinking of the story so far.

** I used to when I mainly used FF. These days I mainly use ao3 and use tags to filter out the deal breakers. If the grammar sucks then I just stop reading. The main exception is if it's a long fic where I'm unsure if there is a satisfactory ending, I'll jump to the last chapter comments to check the overall mood.

** i only read the current reviews if the pairing is not mentioned (so frustrating) Dont waste my time with a tantalising summary that turns out to be a bashing of my fave character and endgame is something I def dont want to read.

** Not really since I also often read oneshots that have just come out and there aren't that much reviews yet and for longer fics - after a few chapters I mostley know if I like the style of the fic

** I read on my phone, and with the fanfiction app the way it is I struggle not to have a peak at the reviews before reading. It's good to get a feel for the book, but sometimes I'll catch a spoiler. Or I'll find out nothing because one of this shit tier reviewers who responds to EVERY chapter as though they are in a private conversation with the Author has clogged the review tab with a hundred shitty 'reviews'.
