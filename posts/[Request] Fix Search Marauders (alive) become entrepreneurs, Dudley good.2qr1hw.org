I remember a few details or specific scenes but for the life of me I can't remember even the title or the author.

The marauders are alive and end up making this great business that eventually gets something like a television in markets so that they can televise Quid ditch matches.

Dudley visits and ends up making Draco Malfoy looking like a fool.

Lightsaber made for the kids that everyone wants but is decided it may be too dangerous.

Muggles (Dudley, Hermione's parents?) Get pranked by Fred and George without the twins realizing that this is really bad idea. It causes them pain, etc.

Thanks

**** Yeah, its the right fic for sure. The author does H/Hr only, people seem to either like his work a lot or call it the worst cliche ridden mess they have ever read.
