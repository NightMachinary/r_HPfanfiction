I just finished the Alexandra Quick Series and loved it. Looking for similarly totally different but still in the same world books. Different time period is fine too. No Maurader era stories though, theyre boring me now.

  The school stood long before the boy with the unusual scar arrived. Each year new students enter, and old leave. 1835 featured its own triumphs and tragedies as students in the houses contend with each other for recognition as the best house at Hogwarts.

*** Seconding this as well. Starnlicht is criminally underrated. You have to feel for the authors who pen something out of the norm and are completely ignored by the fandom since most people seem to be far more interested in bland indy!Harry bashing fics.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

******* Why the passive-agressivity? Username mentions like this are going to notify the person. You could just message me with your concerns, I answer PMs.

A mod is not the top submitter. A mod is a janitor.

Anyway I created the space, because I thought it would be great if there was a subreddit for that discussion. I expect it will take off more once the new book come out. Until then we will all have to be patient.

Modernisation requires change, and some things must be swept aside in the name of progress. Buildings can be demolished and statues, even statues of deceased heroes like Harry Potter, can be relocated. Can't they? Hubert Dalrymple has a problem./

Some people don't like the format of the interviews, but it works very well for me.
