Stuff that made you laugh, that you thought was profound, great quotes, what're your favorites?

Personally, I quite enjoy this from linkffn(heart and soul by philosophize):

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, yes, you're quite right," Voldemort reassured his potions master. Sighing deeply, he moved his hand to his face as if to rub the bridge of his nose... but then he remembered that he didn't have a nose, which just worsened his mood. "I'll speak to them."

  "I've been thinking about what you said."

  "Thinking Weasel? Mind you don't hurt yourself. You know that's not your forte."

** Fanfics generally don't get very profound, unless in VERY rare cases... and most of the quotes where I know the author means for me to go "YEAH! HOW BADASS!" or "YEAH! THAT'S TELLING THE BASTARD!" I just roll my eyes at....

But there have been a few funny quotes. I liked this one from Harry Potter and the Natural 20, where Dumbledore (who's just a massive troll in this story) shows up to save Milo from being tortured in the Ministry of Magic, while pretending to be a tour guide who took a wrong turn:

"And here we have the famous third lower janitorial closet, considered enormously significant among janitorial historians due to its --- oh, pardon me. This isn't the third lower janitorial closet at all. In fact, unless I am quite mistaken, these are the long-unused Department of Magical Law Enforcement interrogation cells. Not to be re-opened except in times of war. Clearly, there has been some misunderstanding."

  "Awesome?" offered Harry.

  "/Utterly and completely out of hand/ would say it better," said Dumbledore. "I am not sure there has ever been a time in the whole history of this school when things have become so, so... I don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have never become like this before, and so no one has ever needed to invent a word for it."

  Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply complimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to speak.

"Hermione, not the broom” cried Oliver Wood.

“Yes, the broom too. Who knows what can be in the straw?”

“They are called bristles, you heathen.”

Oliver managed to save Harry's broom from the boiling pile. He spent the rest of the evening in a corner of the common room, clutching it with both arms and legs.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** From Madam Umbridge Home for Wayward Girls by A.Lovely.Villain

#+begin_quote
  Sirius released him, eyes darting to the figure leaning against the carriage in careless repose.

  “You recruited Draco as well?" He arched a dark brow, glancing between them. "Lucius is going to shit a brick."

  “Potter and I crossed paths while looking for Granger, and my father has no idea where I am. It's best to let sleeping dogs lie."

  A low moan sounded at Draco's back.

  Both young men pretended not to hear.

  Sirius took a slow step back.

  “Bloody hell. What have you done?"

  Harry held himself with such forced ease it made Sirius tense further.

  “It looks a lot worse than it is."

  "Harry James Potter. Who's in the carriage?"

  Before his godson could respond Draco pushed away from the paneling and opened the door.

  A rope bound body toppled out, landing on the packed earth with a dull thud, a muffled shriek of pain emanating from behind the gag.

  Harry exchanged a brief but loaded glance with the blonde before looking to his godfather, silently bracing himself.

  For several moments Sirius merely blinked.

  And then he found his voice.

  "Thank god. I thought you'd gone and kidnapped someone, but obviously, Avery is here of his own free will."

  More muffled screaming filled the air.

  Draco stepped forward, using the toe of his boot to roll the man to his back.

  “I wanted to kill him."

  Sirius nodded. "Fantastic, that makes me feel so much better."

  "Have you tried asking politely?" Luna's question came with a kind of earnestness that temporarily locked Harry's mental gears in place as he tried to process it.

  Without waiting for an answer, Luna knelt at the river's edge, bent forward, and stuck her head under the water. A small but steady stream of bubbles broke the surface downstream.

  Harry and Cedric sat there.

** Remus says, "Is the Veritaserum still working?'

"Yes." The answer is out before Sirius has had a chance to think about it. "Thought it'd be over by now."

"Alcohol prolongs its effects, genius," says Remus. "Thought someone with an 'Outstanding' Potions N.E.W.T. might know."

"Wasn't thinking."

"You're generally not," says Remus. He sighs.

Well, Sirius has certainly expected more sympathy and less disappointment.

In fact, the whole conversation doesn't go like he's imagined, pretty much like the wretched interview, but how could it, when he doesn't even know what he's going to say until he says it, with Veritaserum seeping around in his brain, creating voids that suck up words and explode them out of his mouth. No, not creating voids. Creating truths that somehow come into existence because he says them out loud.

Until today, he hasn't even known what a panic attack is. He's just sort of assumed that it is normal to curl up and hyperventilate on the Hogwarts Express when it's chugging towards London, given what's waiting for him there.

Maybe he is more like Remus after all, destined to try twice as hard as everyone else and still never catch a break. Or maybe he's like Peter, destined to be pathetic.

He doesn't realise he's expressing all this out loud until he sees the look on Remus's face. "We can just stop talking until it wears off," offers Remus.

** Sorry I'm late to the party, but here is my favorite quote, from my favorite fanfic, /Faith and Understanding,/ which chronicles Luna and Ginny's friendship, and Ginny's musings therein.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

It goes something like this. "Voldemort sat in his armchair and ran his pale fingers over his bald head. While he certainly enjoyed the benefits this body gave him, if there was one thing he missed it was having hair. It gave him something to play with while he was thinking. Not only did his hair give him something to play with, but it also insulated his head. In the winter months his death eaters assumed that he wore his hood all the time because it made him more intimidating, while the simple truth was that his head was cold"

(Sirius) “What happened to six months ago, eh? The ‘she actually talks to me Padfoot‘ bollocks! You said that was enough.“ It used to be, was the honest answer to that one. When he had said it at the time, James Potter had honestly meant it. Her talking to him was like Dumbledore walking straight up to Voldemort and bitch slapping him. Entirely awesome, but really quite unlikely.

“Oh dear,” said Ronnie, as she watched the Mooncalves blow large whistles in time to the music, “we've stumbled in on a rave.” Draco nodded. “No wonder this has never been reported,” he said. “Scamander probably thought he was hallucinating.” [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3194880/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Cliches-Of-Doom][Harry Potter And The Cliches Of Doom]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/885490/Tabesco-Lamnia-Lammina-Lamna][Tabesco Lamnia Lammina Lamna]]

** Some of the most memorable quotes for me come from brilliant fanfiction *“One way or another”* by *RosevalleyNB*. I originally found it on Archive of our Own, but the author seems to have pulled it out from Internet as people were stealing her work and posting as their own (as she explained it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4371863/Rosevalleynb][here]]). It's an amazing Katie Bell/Marcus Flint story with mystery elements.

First being,

#+begin_quote
  “Just before the beginning of the year, she had promised herself that her little obsession of hers had to end. He wasn't a prince charming or even ordinary looking. His rough features hardly classified him as handsome and his crooked teeth only added to that statement. Aside from his looks, he was downright mean and a cheat during games. She knew this. Merlin, the whole school knew this. Only, it was somewhat difficult to switch off that fluttering feeling in the pit of her stomach each time she laid eyes on him.”
#+end_quote

And second one,

#+begin_quote
  “Marcus knew he wasn't any prize. That came with the territory of being a Flint his father had once told him. The crooked teeth and hulky build rarely, never really, had girls fancy him. Nevertheless, here she was, little Bell, looking at him as if he was some sort of prince charming. Whereas he would have scoffed at the idea in the past, he found himself wanting to be just that for once. He just had to figure how to become one.”
#+end_quote

I still hope that maybe one day she will decide to finish the fic and publish it again!

** From “Sirius Black Is Sick of Your Parenting Advice”

So Narcissa won the battle about what to name the kid, huh? He watched as a pale little boy came strolling to Narcissa's side. He was trying to hold his nose up and look accomplished and adult. He mostly succeeded in looking pointy.

"He's very...blond."

"You're Harry Potter," Draco said, a vibration of awe in his voice.

"He's also very Slytherin," Sirius whispered to Narcissa.

She glared at him, but Harry answered before she could say anything. "Yeah, I get that a lot. It's the fringe, isn't it?"

I actually laughed out loud for like five minutes the first time I read the line about just looking pointy.

I roll down my window, stick my head out, cast a silencing charm on Sally-Anne, and scream obscenities at the saggy, brain dead cunt that just skipped across four lanes of traffic to cut me off.

Snape smiles

#+begin_quote
  Severus gives me a long look, before performing the most grotesque and terrifying action I have ever seen Severus Snape perform. It was a thing of horror, an event to make baby Jesus, and all small children everywhere cry. Nearby fish died, and floated belly-up. I felt the fabric of space and time twist and churn, as an abomination against nature and all that is Right and Good with the world occurred.

  Severus Snape grinned.

  His face contorted, wrinkled creases forming in it from obvious disuse. His hook nose seemed to shift upwards, becoming even more ponderous and jutting. His lips cracked and bled as dry skin was stretched in a manner that had never before been used. Blackened and crooked teeth were placed on display, and the good Doctors Granger would have cringed.

  "Very well. The question is in three parts, answer each and you may pass, fail to answer any of them and pay..." the huge lioness with a woman's face smiled, "a price. Your first question; what is your name?" "I am Viktor Krum." "What is you quest?" she asked. "I seek the Triwizard Cup." Viktor confirmed. "And what," the sphinx asked with a wry grin, "is your favorite color?" "Blue!" Viktor answered before his eyes went wide after realizing what he had said. "No! I meant green!" "Sorry," the sphinx laughed. "Your first answer was wrong. Goodbye Viktor Krum" Harry watched in amazement as the sphinx waved her left front paw and Viktor was launched into the air

  One could only handle so much cloak and dagger for so long before worrying about just where that dagger might really be pointed.

  Returning to the Dursley's wasn't like ripping off a Band-Aid, it was like getting your fingers caught in a wood chipper and slowly being dragged in.

  One could only handle so much cloak and dagger for so long before worrying about just where that dagger might really be pointed.

  The Gower Peninsula had decided to demonstrate why it was most often described as ‘exposed', ‘wet', and ‘windy'.

  The days turned into leaves, plucked away by the autumn breeze.

  Cassandra Trelawney's house was just as he remembered it. Full of things he couldn't imagine on his own, with colours and constant movement.

  The poignant silence from before was back, along with its friends Awkward and Holy Fuck.

  You just called him short.  If not small.  You are the biggest moron in the Commonwealth.  Your lack of sexual interest is a Darwinian measure against your breeding, so that the species won't be tainted by your inferior DNA.

** From Put Your Gins Away, Its Tea Time by frombluetored. The Weasleys are camping on Shell Island, going 'muggle' for Arthurs birthday. Ginny and Molly are struggling to start a fire.

"I just don't understand why this won't stay," her mum growled. She gave the flimsy campfire spit a cross shake; it collapsed immediately for the tenth time. It couldn't hold up to the pressure of their hands, much less the pressure of the heavy kettle that was supposed to hang from it. "Sodding---portable---Muggle---shite!" It just cracks me up to think of Molly saying this. Great fic for the Hinny and Scorbus fans.

"Do you really think I wouldn't need a love potion?" Luna asked as they reached the grand staircase.

"Harry said you wouldn't, didn't he?" Hermione said frowning not wanting to return to this topic.

"I wasn't thinking about Harry...more this witch I met recently," Luna said winking at Hermione smiling and giggling at the look on the girls face.

Hermione felt her heart miss a beat, despite this she stepped forward and brushed a strand of dirty blonde hair from Luna's face.

"No you wouldn't need it for her either," Hermione said softly taking hold of Luna's hand grinning and leading her up the stairs her heart ready to burst.

so cute!! lol

also from the same fic is this Bellatrix line

"My dear? Whom do you think you are addressing? I'm Bellatrix Black you dizzy bitch! I could best old Bonebag with my wand arm tied behind my back and eyes shut!" Bellatrix cackled again then kissed Isabeau on the forehead and looked at her if she was looking at some slow-witted child.

  “Exactly. That's precisely what I just told you.”

  “And it's something you'd do?” Harrison asked uncertainly

  “Without a doubt.”

  “And you thought I took the right course of action?”

  “Absolutely.”

  “/Damn/.” Harrison deflated, brushing his hand over his fringe. The tip of yet another scar peeked out from underneath, white and substantial.

  “Yes?” Riddle asked eagerly, face alight with excitement.

  “It's Dumbledore,” Harry revealed in a distant voice. “He clasps you tight to his chest, his eyes filling with tears. ‘Tom,' he murmurs softly. ‘Tom, I am your father'.”
