** I can't help but find it interesting that it apparently only takes 15 hours of turn around for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6a1r6b/lf_harry_has_an_older_sister_fic/][LF Harry has an older sister]] to Harry x Older Sister.

*** 15 hours? That was slow. Why, back in my day that kind of thing only took 15 minutes. AND came with an additional request for 'older sister is actually a polyjuiced Voldemort in at least one romance/'fun' scene' when the floor opened for comments.

C'mon you bloody youngsters, kick it up a notch.

Not to imply that it can't be done, but I /really/ don't want to kick it a notch higher than that.

*** That's hilarious. It's a difficult request, though. I've seen Harry x sister, but IIRC it's usually his twin, sometimes younger one.
