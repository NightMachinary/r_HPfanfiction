** Hmm... not sure. I recall JKR mentioning that homosexuality probably wouldn't bother someone like Lucius, but I don't recall a broader exploration of that subject. Incest (or near enough to be such on most accounts) is at least legal, given Sirius's parents were second cousins and purebloods intermarried quite a bit.

** There's nothing in canon to support the idea that incest between parents or siblings is acceptable, but beyond that it enters a bit of a grey area. Just look at some of the family trees.

As for homosexuality, well, I would think not. Pureblood supremacy, in canon, is certain a problem but doesn't seem to be as widespread as fanon makes it out to be. Most people seem to be against it and the government, while not under the control of a Dark Lord, don't seem to support it.

The pureblood bigots are likely to frown heavily on homosexuality because of their desire to spread their own lines. At the same time, casual homosexuality has been recorded throughout history as something that the born-into-royalty types indulge in more easily. I imagine that, due to their perceived superiority, they felt above the "social stigmas of the plebians" and thus were more likely to do whatever they wanted.

However, outside of that particular sect, there's nothing that really indicates that the canonical world of Harry Potter was anymore socially advanced than anyone else of their time. So if the story took place in a period where homosexuality was frowned upon, it's likely they shared those beliefs.

The only example to the contrary seems to be that no one gave a damn about skin color.

** As accepted as it is in the non-wizarding world I would assume.

That is, in some parts yes and in some parts no.
