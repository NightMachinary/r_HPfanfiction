So they still use wands and spells but to effectively use their magical powers everyone has to work out and keep themselves in shape. I guess I should have said physical fitness not strength.

For example Hermione spends two hours everyday doing lots of cardio, stretching, strength and aerobics. Harry himself does strength and cardio at least three times a week. Dumbledore has a body that looks like [[https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.wallpapersafari.com%2Ftablet%2F768%2F1024%2F96%2F27%2FoRNASl.jpg&f=1&nofb=1][Zeus]] and Voldemort looks like [[https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4fV9VzGq6lo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1][this]]

Now onto fanon pairings:

Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass spends an hour everyday doing two of the following [[https://www.cdn.spotebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/30-minute-ab-workout-routine-for-women-spotebi-736x2220.jpg][workouts]].

Luna Lovegood has a five day workout plan which she follows [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6d/19/2b/6d192b7ea21def955e25a59e1951cb2f.jpg][strictly]].

Fleur Delacour workout to a rotating [[https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/359162139024696562/][twelve week]] workout plan.

And so on and so forth.

So basically everyone at Hogwarts workouts, stay in shape and are really healthy for their age. Even the teachers. Snape looks like [[https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F5f%2F7e%2F84%2F5f7e84bfa5a99b8211ea64da644246ef.jpg&f=1&nofb=1][he wouldn't be out of place as a male model.]] .

** I've talked about it before and I'm not sure I could find it again now, but I fondly remember a Harry Potter tabletop rpg that accidentally made this real. There were two optimal builds, one of which took advantage of the fact that casting ability was the sum of the Power and Intelligence stats. Since Int gave you casting power and bonus experience gain, while Power gave you casting power, physical strength, and health, Power was the better stat over a long enough game. Therefore, the strongest wizards were all muscle wizards. The theoretical stat blocks for dumbledore and Voldemort made them champion powerlifters with supersonic reflexes.

Look, dude, the fangirls are bad enough with Snape played by Alan Rickman. I don't have enough paddles to wade through this subreddit with that guy as Snape.
