#+begin_quote
  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

** Draco in the Muggle world. Where he has to live among muggles as his community service for his actions in the war. No wand. No house elves. He hasn't got a clue what he's doing.

Obviously in 99% of these fics one of the golden trio (usually Harry or Hermione) will find him and develop a friendship/romance, but that's not essential. What is essential is seeing Draco struggling with a microwave, or discovering the Rolling Stones, or learning about Muggle sports and so on.

** My guilty pleasure are soulmate/soul-bond fanfics. Bonus points if there's smut and (mutual) pining.

I simply enjoy all of the additions that come along with the soul-bonding rules. This varies from telepathy to creature fics to mind-blowing sex. I love it all.

If there's pinning, you know they're going to get together (cause it's a soul-bonding fic), but the agony of the wait makes the ending much more fulfilling. It's all that unresolved tension.

Now excuse me while I go find another one.

** - Pureblood culture.

Not the sort where eleven year olds are politically savvy, but the sort where the adults take pride in their traditions and have various cliques and circles in which they mingle.

- Grey Dumbledore

I like thinking of Dumbledore as similar to Hobbit-era Gandalf the Grey where he makes some questionable decisions and meddles in things. He's got his own agenda but it's generally a good one. Yet he always self-restrains his power because he is wise enough to know how easily he could be corrupted by it.

- Creative magical smut.

Harry Potter is a magical world, one where passion has an effect on magic. It therefore makes sense that the sex is probably magical in some ways as well. I'm not talking kinky necessarily, and I'm certainly not talking about "engorgio penisus" or whatever, but I enjoy a fic that imbues magic into the smut.

**** For me stupid as it sounds only works as a possible multi paring fix. My head cannon is the purpose would be to limit 1 family getting to much Political power. Basically within 2 or 3 generations the families would not be tied together. If you're going with each lordship getting a seat in the wizarding parliament your not going to want some guy owning like 10 seats. My thoughts is that the kids maybe close but the grandchildren will drift apart.

If in this lordship fanfic you have him marrying for 1 house a heiress like Daphne,Susan or Hannah then show the potential fallout Politically with Harry picking up 2 more seats. Maybe have it that Daphne passes the seat to Astoria for a increase in the inheritance. (I think all are members of the sacred 28) the 28 makes it easy to have as some sort of nobility. I think the Peverell family was on there and the Potter family gains it status from that family.

The political situation might want to promote Harry with someone like a Katie bell or a Parvati. Maybe they come from prominent middle class magical families. Ginny Weasley would be favored as she's the only daughter of 2 sacred 28 families. This could be a interesting sub story of why Lucious couldn't directly get Arthur fired from the ministry. Surely he would have the money to get Arthur fired. Maybe the Weasley are land rich but cash poor. Most of their money is tied up in the land.

Basically set up common sense rules that might make sense in a wizarding politics. Maybe in the past they had the third child killing the heir's of the houses his father was Lord of. This could be why most wizarding families seem small compared to the Weasley family. Maybe after the Hogwarts years maybe have the main characters to focus on changing the wizarding world.

** Properly fleshed out magic systems, not necessarily setting everything in stone but trying to apply some sense of a system to magic that makes it... semi-logical? Meta-logical? You get my point.

Time travel fics, my god do I love those... We need more cracky time travel fics, not enough of those out there.

Anything that puts a new twist on an old trope - Harry attempts time travel to fix his mistakes? Hop-skip-and-jump to 20 years in the future! Snape adopts Harry? Horrible guardian, sure he's better than the Dursleys but... well... not by much, he's still Snape and Harry still looks too much like both James and Lily.

MOD fics - seriously guilty pleasure of mine, you can do ANYTHING with that trope. Harry becomes death, goes insane and Alt-Universe Dumbledore summons him to do what their Harry can't? Yup, that fic exists and it's hilarious. No such thing as MOD but the holder of all 3 becomes death and the paperwork is hell? Yeah, also a thing, with SEQUELS and also hilarious. Suffice to say, MOD fics with humour count as a weakness for me.

Good smut scenes in longer fics, not smut-fics but when an author has the balls to add smut to a 100k+ fic with a focus on plot and character development, I take note of it. Though if the fic just devolves into pure smut, I'm gone faster than you can say Quidditch.

Grey or Evil Harry has a special place in my heart, just for how realistic they can be - no way in hell Harry grew up well-adjusted with the way the Dursleys treated him. Starvation, emotional abuse and, at the very least, slight physical abuse doth not a healthy adult maketh without many a therapy session.

  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle.

  Revised! Harry has found out that the light has been keeping many of secrets from him that push him over the edge. He returns to Hogwarts after the death of his godfather seemingly unaware of the light's manipulations, but in the shadows the notorious assassin Sang Lys has arose. Dark!Evil!Harry. Major OOC!

Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

I think the other would be Tomarry/Harrymort for the same reason. Also because I am obsessed with enemies to lovers and toxic relationships are interesting in a kind of emotionally detached way. However, I do usually have some conditions to the ship so it isn't totally jailbait.

His two best friends set out to find him, and hire a competent but unlikely companion - investigative reporter Pansy Parkinson. Pansy finds him in a Muggle pub and brings Hermione and Ron there to retrieve him...or so she thinks. Harry/Pansy, background Hermione/Ron

If anyone has any fic recs (also happy to read m/m/m as well as m/m/f) I would love to check them out.

No, I don't hate Hermione, as I also like to read trio pairings, I just sometimes like to think about Harry and his gf (not Ginny) taking Ron into their relationship because Hermione is emotionally negligent to his needs (or some other reason), leading to a depressed Ron who needs their comfort.

I might stop reading partway into it if the fic is bad enough, but very little of my typical reservations apply for whether or not I pickup a fic. The simple reason for this is: I've read them all.
