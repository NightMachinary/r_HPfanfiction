:END:

** The guard raced down the corridor of the fortress/prison, desperately Transfiguring parts of the floor into pitch and setting them alight as he went. Another earthshaking BOOM echoed from the front gates as the unexpected assault began anew. Wiping cold sweat from his brow, he slammed the door to the corridor shut; it was a monstrosity of a door, made of a three inch slab of magical live oak and straps of goblin iron, reinforced with numerous spells for durability and Ancient Egyptian curses spelled out in hieroglyphs set in gold. A prototype of the door had been secretly placed on the testing range for the first A-bomb, and had survived with minimal damage. The Warden stood further down the long room that led to The Cell, helping to Transfigure cover for the fight to come. Seeing him come in, she marched over.

"Captain Schmidt, report." she ordered calmly. "Alpha squad was wiped out. Beta squad was engaging him, but they won't hold out long. We don't know how the old goat got through the wards, but nothing we're doing is slowing him down much." Schmidt told her. She swore violently, barely keeping her feet as another tremor shook dust from the ceiling. "Alright, get on the Mirror and call the GSG-9 Magical Emergency Response Team. We need some serious fire power." she said. "Yes, ma'am!" Schmidt replied, saluting. She returned the salute, going back to her work as he raced to the mirror mounted near the back of the room.

"Nurmengard Prison calling GSG-9 MERT team! Come in! This is Captain Schmidt, requesting immediate reinforcements! We are under attack, have already lost 40% of our forces! GSG-9, come in!" Schmidt called, his face turning white as the mirror failed to respond. "Commandant Bones, he must have disabled the Mirror Relay System! I can't get through to GSG-9!" he reported, fear coloring his voice. "Well, that's just wonderful!" Amelia Bones replied sarcastically. Immediately, she began conjuring an army of spears and swords, sticking the shaft of the spears into the ground at an angle that allowed them to impale anyone who tried to rush them. The swords were enchanted and set to fly at anyone that wasn't a guard.

Another blast, this one much closer, made the lights flicker and eventually fail. All that remained were the small red lensed lanterns that were left on at night. "Everyone, take cover! He's not far away now!" she ordered. Everyone went into cover, wands pointed at the door. From the distance, they could hear a periodic whooshing sound; Dumbledore was extinguishing the pitch fires Schmidt had set up. The sounds stopped, and all strained to hear.

Without warning, the hieroglyphs on the door began to glow, and the sound of spellfire could be heard as the inventions of the Pharaohs' personal priests went to work, casting magic that would disfigure, rend, disintegrate, and shatter bones, amongst other things. And then, much to their collective horror, there was a sharp POP, and one of the hieroglyphs winked out, glowing dully from heat. And then another, and another, one at a time until the door was once more dark. "Steady now, everyone." Bones called out for the benefit of the younger guardsmen, who were quaking in terror. To everyone's surprise, a knock sounded, barely audible through the heavy door.

"Amelia? I don't suppose you'll be a dear and invite me in?" the cheery voice asked. Several of the men suggested what he could do with himself in lew of that. "I'm not entirely sure that's anatomically possible, Private, even with magic. Ah, not to worry. I'll let myself in." he announced. Schmidt's eyes widened. Surely he couldn't get through that thing?

His answer turned out to be "sort of". The door was quite impressive, but the frame was... not. With a single blast, he shattered the stones around the massive door, and with a groan, the whole thing crashed to the ground in a cloud of dust. The intruder stepped over the door, whistling cheerfully. "Open fire!" Amelia shouted. Immediately, the room was lit by a variety of spells, ranging from a mundane Stunner to a rather exotic Aztec Heart-Puller Curse.

Dumbledore blocked, deflected, and dodged everything. Then, it was his turn. A blast of wandless magic shattered the spear shafts, and the heads went to work pinning the swords in place so they could not attack him. He lashed out with powerful Stunners that could knock out a troll, powerful Petrification hexes that were second only to a reflected basilisk's gaze, and any number of even more esoteric spells that no one had seen in decades and to which the only known counter was "don't get hit". Captain Schmidt was tossed into a wall when he heroically tried to rush Dumbledore to physically assault him. The private who had made the anatomically unlikely suggestion turned into a yapping Chihuahua, and was forced to run away to avoid being crushed.

It didn't take long at all before the only person standing was Amelia. "Albus, stop this! This isn't like you!" Amelia shouted, throwing a deadly Entrails-Expelling Curse at him. "Actually, it is. You see, this will kill two birds with one stone." Albus said, firing a blast of golden light that she barely ducked. "You see, I plan to tell Gellert all about Voldemort. You know how prideful both of them are. Now, this will end one of two ways; either Gellert will take care of Voldemort, and I will recapture him, or Voldemort will kill Gellert. While I do not wish harm on my old friend, I am confident he can make Voldemort pay dearly for that victory, if indeed he is actually capable of prevailing.".

Amelia gaped at the audacity of his plan. That moment of distraction was enough for him to claim her wand with a well placed Expelliarmus. "Albus, that's... well, insane. Why are you doing this?" Amelia asked again, keeping herself between him and the door. "Ah, I forget how difficult it is to get a copy of the Daily Prophet out here. I thought you might want to know, though." Dumbledore said. Without warning, he seized her with a spell and stuck her to a wall, leaving only her arms free. "This will explain everything, dear. I will only say that I feel like I earned my accomplishments, and it hurts to see my people turn on me. Now, I must be off." Albus told her, handing her a bound collection of Daily Prophet articles.

Having nothing else to do as Dumbledore broke through the door to The Cell, Amelia looked at the bundle. The first article was scandalous; "Dumbledore stripped of OoM 1st Class". Eyes wide, she began to read. She barely noticed when Dumbledore came back into the room, his old enemy in tow, and she barely reacted as she was rescued. "My God... what have we done?"

** It would be interesting to see it, it would be a great Fuck You to the Wizarding World, but a little outside of Dumbledore's character. I think he would only do it if he thought it would be beneficial to his cause and maybe they would overthrow Voldemort together.

*** Could potentially work by Dumbledore playing on the ideology of Grindlewald, could point out how much magical blood has been spilled in Riddle's pointless and hypocritical pursuit of Pure Blood Society & how much of the Magical World has been lost as a result

Given Gellert is well known for his belief in Magical Superiority, the idea that this arrogant upstart has not only taken his title but also perverted Gellert's own ideology to gain more followers in a crusade based on hypocrisy that is only crippling the Magical World and destroying their way of life would definitely be seen as an insult to both himself and what he views as his legacy, possibly an insult that Gellert could not ignore

Gellert is also often seen as a Warrior type figure in most topics that I have seen mention him, as a result I could also see this as a potential "die forgotten and alone or on your feet fighting for your beliefs" type of choice for him too,

a last blaze of glory so to speak, and who better to see it through with then his greatest friend/rival/foe and the man that he (once) may have loved

** I love the idea.

Though, since the "free him directly" has been done already... Let's do an alternative path!

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Even as the owls soared through the air to deliver the news, even as the ministry flunkies congratulated each other, as Cornelius Fudge helped himself to some expensive wine and raised a glass in toast, the consequences of their actions were already happening elsewhere. Not a single one of them ever spared a thought as to why Dumbledore never wore his badge of honour.

Somewhere, in the hidden location in the Alps, was a dark castle. Nurmengard, the black fortress looking as if cut from a single stone, with towers piercing the skies and magic still crackling along it's walls occasionally was almost empty.

Originally designed as a pricon for those who would oppose Grindelwald, it now housed the man himself, and only him. When it was first conquered, it was bustling with wizards, of course. Every nook and cranny were searched, and every bit of hidden wealth removed. In the first few years of Grindelwald's sentence, there were guards in front of his cell.

Now, the only thing guarding the prison, and the prisoner, was a small trinket, stuck to the wall opposite Grindewald's cell and a powerful enchantment anchored to it that would confine both the man and his magic to the inside of the room.

After years of probing, Gellert Grindewald was quite resigned to his confinement. The magic caging him was powerful, with very visible signs of the immense intellect that had managed to best him and even now prevented escape.

Because of this, there was no man more surprised when the glow of magic over the mythril star of the Order of Merlin, First Class dimmed and died moments after Albus Dumbledore's ownership of it had been revoked. The spell, the power he left behind to control the enchantments around the Nurmengard Castle no longer able to find purchase on the powerful magical conductor that was mythril, dispersed harmlessly into the air.

For the first time in years, the full might of his magic was returned to the Scourge of Europe. Grindelwald was free...
