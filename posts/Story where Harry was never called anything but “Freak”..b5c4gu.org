Would like to request a fanfic where Harry has never been called anything but Freak so he forgets his name is Harry.

Like maybe the Dursleys homeschooled both Harry and Dudley. Harry still got better marks than Dudley, but his aunt submitted his work as Dudley's and vice versa. And because they are homeschooled, Harry is never called anything but Freak so he thinks that is his name.

And first year, at roll call for classes or even the sorting, they call his name a few times before he responds.

And maybe the first potions class, Snape does the Snape thing but doesn't get a response from Harry. And actually has to call his name a few times or even walk over to him and Harry is all ‚Äúoh yeah. I keep forgetting that's my name.‚Äù And Snape thinks it's a joke and is sarcastic. And it takes a few weeks before he doesn't cut Harry off with a sarcastic response and Harry just casually drops the fact that he's only had his name since school started and that he likes it better than Freak. Kinda clueless like because to him that is normal.

And at some point in potions it comes out that Harry slept on the floor for the first few weeks until he had gotten a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù from at least half his professors because that was the rule with the Dursleys. That half the teachers had to approve of his work and tell him it was good before he deserved a room or a bed. But since he was homeschooled and Petunia was the only teacher, he was never good enough. And Harry knew he would never get Snape's approval but it's ok he'll keep trying.

I feel like Hagrid (or, indeed, the Hogwarts Letter) would be the more likely point where he discovers his true name.

*** Yeah. He knows that's his name, but after 10 years of being only called Freak, he just isn't used to it so it doesn't catch his attention. Like if your name was Sally and I was trying to get your attention by calling Maria. You don't know that name or respond to it. Harry would ‚Äúknow‚Äù his name is actually Harry, but he isn't used to it and so doesn't respond. Or at least takes a few minutes/calls for him to remember ‚Äúoh yeah, that's me!‚Äù

**** As a trans guy who changed his name, it does take some getting used to if you're being called something entirely different than what you're used to, even if you want the new name. There were a few weeks where it would take me a couple times to remember that "Noah" was my name and to not respond to my old name (which a friend of mine coincidentally had as her name).

***** Yeah lol. Hell, I picked my name by making a shortlist and going to starbucks and seeing which name I actually responsed to instead of letting my drink get cold.

Still, 3 years later I respond to my old name. Which, since I moved to a place where my old name is more neutral, my partners dad has my old name and man was that weird

****** It helped for me that my old name belonged to a friend I regularly hung out with as well, so I got used to not responding.

I picked my name by going through my family tree and finding a currently unused name that I liked (I thought it would be easier on my parents if the name was still a family name like my old name had been). Currently going through the process to legally change my name!

***** I kinda have the reverse of this. I think more of myself as Mercy than my name because any video game or phone game character I have is named Mercy or Mercy Rose. And my family has a million and one pet names for me, so sometimes hearing my given name makes my brain stall.

****** Lol, I feel. My old name was a nickname for my given name too, so whenever I was in high school and we had a substitute teacher who didn't know, I kept getting marked absent because I didn't respond to my given name.

****** I fell so hard into the WoW hole for like a solid 2 years that I legitimately started thinking of myself as my character's name. Like I'd be making coffee in the morning and forget to put the filter in and I'd mutter to myself "c'mon [avatar name], fucking hell..."

*** Same boat. I want to write it, but no time to do anything other than copy this to a google doc and hope that it will write itself.

Maybe if I force myself to keep it short......

** I vaguely recall reading a fic where the Dursleys actually tell him about magic ahead of time, but convince him that its evil etc. I think it had a concept similar to this premise, but I can't remember the name of it.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP
