Repost because no one answered.

I am looking for a certain fic that I read years ago and suddenly remembered about a 2 months ago and would like to reread.

I have looked for a few good hours and couldn't for the life of me find it. So I created a Reddit account in the hopes you lovely people might be able to find it.

I read a lot of fanfics so sometimes I get plot points mixed up so I will start with the ones I am a 100% sure are in the fic I am looking for.

- Harry uses Computers.
- Harry lives somewhere in Diagon Alley.
- Harry sets up security cameras in the Alley.

Ones I am not sure about but believe are in it.

- Harry can scan books into his computer system.
- Harry builds an AI
- Harry uses his computer to do Arithmancy to find new spells

The ones I am least sure about.

- Harry uses his ability to scan books on the library (or records) within the ministry while he is on a tour.

I can't remember if this fic is good or bad it is just bothering me that I cant find it and that it is stuck in my head.


** I have a memory of something like this.

I will have a look for it in the morning. It is 1:30am and I will have to go to work later

Edit: I can't seem to find it, I must not have favourited it or I hadn't made my account when I read it.

Is there a chance it is linkffn(8551180), as my memory of your plot point has a SlightlyCrazy!Harry. Sorry I couldn't help further.

** I just thought of an idea:

A post-Canon story where Harry does exactly that in his spare time. Ginny somehow finds it, and it ends with Harry needing a new computer, for obvious reasons.

** ok so none that i can remember off hand have all of it in one fic. All of the ones im thinking of have 2 or more of these points in them.

Harry Potter - Alteran linkffn(12369075) uses computers, scans books, has an AI think some Arithmancy as well.

Oma's Choice linkffn(5931066) has computers, creates an AI, uses computer to compute new spells through Arithmancy.

Isis's Bane and the Goblet of Fire linkffn(6562075) this is the 3rd part to the Isis's Bane series. he scans all the book in Hogwarts, uses a computer nano bots.

In all the ones ive read i havent seen him living in Diagon Alley or having Security cameras. id be interested in something like that if you figure it out.

  The rebirth of an entire race and society is a tall order when this and other galaxies are not safe. What is Harry to do? What he does best, jump in feet first. Rating T for some language and mentions of nudity later on. Pairings HP/HG/LL/other
