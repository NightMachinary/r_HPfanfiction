Hello I am looking for a Harry Potter fic that I read a while ago on ff.net.

It was a story where Hermione volunteered to become a death eater to save Snape. Dumbledore didn't want her to at first and neither did Snape. I think dumbles gave in though and went along with it. I think Snape was pretending to be dead to hide from Voldemort if I'm not mistaken. But Hermione ended up becoming like a great assassin and she was kinda ruthless.

Pretty sure its a Hermione x Snape fic

I remember a few small things like Snape had a tapestry to get into his quarters instead of a door. It had cool wards like retina scanning maybe, and there was a training room in a tower that Harry and Draco would use. Harry and Draco ended up becoming not enemies I believe.

Please please please I hope you can help me :)

** Was it *Sin & Vice*? I don't remember all the details of the story but I definitely remember she was Dumbledore's assassin there.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
