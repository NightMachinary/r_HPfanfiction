:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fanfiction a while ago, but cant remember the title. It had harry being wrongly convicted to azkaban and then getting him out, they get him to go to hogwarts again. He refuses to buy stuff that they burned with his money and has him wearing a lot of attitude tshirts. He makes a staff as a wand is not suitable anymore.

Can someone who gets the fic please give me a title or link


** Aside from the staff, that's basically every Azkaban Harry fic.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

*** Wow, this is painful to read. The author clearly wants to write a BAMF Harry, but it comes across as a petulant child. Add to that the completely disproportionate "punishments" and it ticks all the boxes for a bashfic.

**** Honestly I get what harry is saying I would be mad too. But most of the time when he is trying to be cool hes comes off as a whiny little baby. Its very pathetic tbh but other than that its a pretty good story imho.

***** We sadly only have a few archetypal Harrys in this community, and most of them are garbage:

- Edgy Petulant Child Harry

- Whipping Boy Harry

- Crying Softie Harry

- "Sarcastic" Powerful Harry

** The mention of stuff that was burned reminds me of linkffn(2205019) The Azkaban Parody.\\
Don't expect realistic dialogue (or behavior) from the characters, though, it's making fun of every other Harry-is-sent-to-Azkaban story there is, I think.

  Azkaban Story! After reading so many Azkaban stories, I have decided to write a parody of my own. This is about how everyone is demanding that Harry forgive them for betraying him without actually asking. I am going for humor more than anything

  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?
