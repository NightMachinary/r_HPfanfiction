:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where harry travels back to the past and is an unspeakable. What I remember from it is harry training percy and checks what's in the forbidden forest. Oh, and he destroyed the the death eaters using something everyone hates. I don't remember the name. If someone could find it based on the description that I gave, I'd thank you and reread it.
