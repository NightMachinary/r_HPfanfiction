:END:
Everyone around him is promptly atomized by his super powerful, yet entirely uncontrollable magic. Covered in a fine mist of blood, he realizes maybe it was blocked for a reason.


** He probably should have suspected something at the sky grins going around. If not there then perhaps when the goblins appeared to be taking odds on the timing and severity of the occurrence of some apparently nigh- inevitable event. But he had been so sure, what right did they have to put a block on his power anyways, maybe he could have saved them with his accidental magic. It must have been Dumbledore's infernal meddling that caused his parents to put a block on his magic. He was probably scared at the prospect of someone with a "power the dark lord knew not," after all it was hard enough for Dumbledore to keep his respect and positions with riddle himself running around. With someone of significantly more power? They would all run to bow at his feet leaving Dumbledore as little more than a historical afterthought; the man who valiantly if a bit ineffectually held off the dark lord until their true savior arrived. What other explanation could there be for complicated block that went fifteen levels deep?

/The day of the third task/

"Yes, get rid of it"

"All at once Mr. Potter? Are you sure you don't want to take it more slowly"

"Of course I'm sure. Voldemort's out there and even if Dumbledore keeps him in check, he's not much better. Right now I have nothing on either, I need access to serious power and now!"

"As you wish Mr. Potter, there will of course be a substantial fee involved for such a complicated ritual but of course with access to all of your various inheritances you'll barely notice it missing"

/A few hours later/

"It is done. Oh and Mr. Potter, one more thing."

"Yes"

"Do not cast any magic around Gringotts itself or around any goblins until you are certain that you have full control, the contract which you signed before you underwent the ritual.....well, let's just say that the outcome would not be desirable for either of us"

"Of course and thank you for the warning"

/At the task/

Harry went in with his head start but quickly fell behind in the footrace due to, in addition to generally being on the shorter side, also being a full 3 years younger than his fellow competitors. He though of how nice it would be to be able to cast a spell to make himself run faster when he realized something: he may not be able to run at a speed of 150 miles per hour, he had something that could, moreover, the first task proved he was permitted to bring this item into the game.

"Accio firebolt"

A split second later he died impaled by literally every firebolt that had ever been produced and burnt by everything that existed at that moment that could be called a firebolt

/Alternative third task/

Harry flew through the maze with ease, it seemed almost as if someone outside the maze was eliminating the obstacles before he could even reach them, he had only really run into the mist of gravity inversion and handily righted his world when he took a step and the sphinx whose riddle he solved with only moderate difficulty, alas he approached the cup and saw acromantula come around the bend. Remembering his last fiasco with aragog he didn't bother with any spells and tried to just run away after grabbing the cup. Trouble was the moment he gripped the cup he felt a familiar jerk from behind his navel

The graveyard was dark as he landed. He couldn't see and wanted to know what was going on

"Lumos"

Suddenly a few things happened in rapid succession

"Shite, I'm blind, since when did lumos do *that*"

/Thump/

A high cold voice, "Wormtail you utter imbecile, pick me up right now before I feed you to Nagini"

A rather nasal voice joiner those already present "master where are you"

"Right where you dropped me at the foot of my father's grave you fool"

Harry, by now had surmised to whom these voices belonged and it didn't bode well for him. He still couldn't see but he had to try something.

"Expelliarmus"

Harry heard some painful sounding cracks and thunks and figured he best get put before Voldemort and Wormtail regained their footing, he was sure a simple disarming spell wouldn't stop them for long

He reached around trying to feel for the cup, hopefully it would take him back. Groping in the mud he finally something smooth and metallic. He grasped and once more felt that familiar hook behind his navel

He got back to the tournament and told them what had happened, Dumbledore looked very concerned (not that Harry could see it what with being blind and all) disappeared to somewhere and reappeared some minutes later

"Harry..."

"Yes professor?"

"You used only lumos and expelliarmus, nobody else cast any other spells, correct?"

"Yes, shall I show.."

*NO* Harry I beg of you if you at all value your own safety or that of anyone in your immediate vicinity do not cast anymore spells until we can figure this out.

"What do you mean professor?"

"Harry my dear boy, you may not know this but when you were born your magic was extraordinarily powerful, when you wanted cookies from the cabinet the most secure locking charms could not keep them safe, your parents once even had me put all of the sugary treats and dangerous items in your house under a fidelius charm with myself as the secret keeper and still you summoner whatever you wanted at a whim. The only solution they could think of was to find a ritual to bind a significant portion of your magic until such time as it could be safely released and you could be trained in it's usage. They set it up so that it would very gradually unlock only after you had finished going through puberty and were a full grown adult. It would seem that somehow, someone has convinced that ritual that you have grown up and your magic should come unbound all at once. It seems that whatever spells you cast are now absurdly overpowered and will do their intended job to the nth degree, your lumos summoned a light so bright that everything in a kilometer radius of where you cast it is completely sun-bleached, you only likely saved yourself from being totally evaporated with some instinctual magical shield you threw up as you though to protect yourself from the light that was blinding you, when you cast that disarming charm it literally destroyed any portion of Voldemort and Wormtail that could be used as a weapon against you, their wands are shattered, their bodies atomized and Voldemort's soul fragment which he could use to possess you and cause pain has been literally wiped out of existence- every dark mark is fading. The war is finally ended, permanently."

"But headmaster, why am I so uniquely powerful? Is it something my parents did or just how I was happened to be born or something else?"

"I suppose I truly cannot withhold anything from you any longer. Do you know why Voldemort targeted you as a baby?"

"No sir, why is that?"

"There was a prophecy about the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord. At first it seemed it could either refer to you or Neville but given you're frankly ridiculous aptitude for literally all kinds of magic it became clear that you were the referent. It appears that these powers were part of your destiny with which you were meant to defeat the dark lord. Of course your parents didn't want you to be raised as a child soldier and to have the nation suffer and put the burden of saviorship on your shoulders so alleviating that burden was a secondary consideration in binding your magic. I'm sorry, I know this is a lot to take in at once, do you need a moment?"

"No thank you sir, it would probably be different if I knew I had to kill Voldemort in the future but seeing as it's already done it's not quite so intimidating"

"Very well then, now we need to address the question of how to move forward"

"What are you talking about sure?"

"At this point your full power is released and there is no known way to contain it, the binding ritual worked once but now that you are cognizant of it you may instinctually push back as you feel your magic being suppressed again and kill whoever is doing the ritual, sadly of those for whom their lives are an acceptable risk for us to take, they would likely try to use the opportunity to kill you or at least turn you into a squib to the point that even potions and magical artifacts would have no effect on you."

"So what do I do now?"

"For now, at least since Voldemort is gone you may leave the Dursleys as you no longer need the blood protection and move to someplace more comfortable, however I would recommend getting a house elf to do all of your magic for you as it will not be safe for you or anyone in your immediate vicinity to have you perform any magic at any point in the foreseeable future"

"So that's what the goblins were laughing about then. Crap."

  This story occurs in the universe of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, diverging in Ch. 101. It contains spoilers for that story through that chapter, and is unlikely to make much sense without having read the same. It's intended to be a darker, more pessimistic interpretation of the story.

***** The magic blocks and helpful goblins is a major cliche trope at this point. My prompt is intended as a subversion of it where the blocks aren't there to make him easily controlled, but to prevent him from accidentally killing everyone around him. So when the helpful goblins break the blocks, his magic lashes out and renders everyone but him into a pretty red mist in the air.
