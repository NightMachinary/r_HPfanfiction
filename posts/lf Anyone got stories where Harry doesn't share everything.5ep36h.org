I'm quite a selfish person so could never understand why Harry, a boy who never had anything is so keen to share. I often flinch when Harry discovers something and instantly shares it with everyone, never keeping something back as an advantage for himself especially in stories where they shoehorn in characters. So many Slytherin Harry stories are ruined because he randomly becomes friends with Hermione to tick the box. Give me stories of a selfish Harry trying to get himself to the top please.


** I think I get what you're looking for. I had five siblings growing up, and so was always expected to share by default and never had anything that was just "mine." I grew up to not be selfish, but more possessive? Like, I'll buy something for me and no you cannot have any because it is mine but I'm perfectly happy helping you get your own.

This is probably why I like Harry to have a bit of an edge in stories. It always seemed unhealthy to me when Harry goes into full martyr mode and automatically puts everyone's else's needs and wants before his own.

**** Oh so more along the lines of

Dumbledore: Harry, I am entrusting you with this Orb of Magicness. It is extremely rare and powerful. Only a few in history have been able to wield its power safely, and you have been shown to have this ability.

Harry: Oh, cool. /turns around/ Here Hermione. Why don't you go play with this for a while. Grab Luna and Ernie Macmillon too while you're at it. They'll probably get a kick out of it.

Edit: I now want someone to write a story called Harry Potter and the Orb of Magicness

***** Hermione immediately explodes into a gory shower of blood and viscera, she wasn't capable of wielding it. Cue horror on Harry's face, Dumbledore's brief 'what have you done you stupid boy' look as Hermione's pancreas drips off his pointy hat. Next 100k words spent on an M-rated, angst-filled story of Harry closing himself off, his thoughtless selflessness causing the death of his closest friend. Harry becomes a loner, depressed, and we get to see all of his loyal friends slowly get pushed away. Ends with him getting killed by Voldemort, and choosing not to come back to life once the horcrux in him is destroyed. He has no-one he wants to go back and save. For even more darkness, he is hunted down by Voldemort breaking into whatever safe house/country he's in, due to him not participating in the horcrux hunt (due to having no-one he wants to fight for). Harry dies, magical Britain is defeated and subjugated, Voldemort wins and goes even more insane. The (unhappy) end.

Now I want a fanfic of either Dad's Army as the Hogwarts staff, or with Hogwarts staff as the Homeguard. Actually, both would be hilarious. Wilson as deputy head and Ravenclaw Head, Jones as Filius/Gryffindor Head, Fraser as Slytherin Head, Godfrey the Hufflepuff. Walker is the groundskeeper, expelled for smuggling as a kid, and the Verger as caretaker. Umbridge becomes Hodges, the Vicar is Minister of Magic.

*** Wow this is quite the shitty story. It hits all the wrong buttons - I have a weakness for the Peggy Sue (Harry sending his memories back) - but this takes the cake: characterization is all over the place, everyone hates Harry (to provide easy reader sympathy), mustache twirling manipulative Dumbledore, atrocious grammar and spelling, Harry is afraid to change things... but the coup d'etat is that despite Harry discovering his parents faked their deaths (and abandoned him to the Dursleys) he does FUCK ALL about it.

Why even throw such a plot-bomb in the first couple chapters, only to have Harry ignore the fact and spend the next three years wanking it at Hogwarts. The icing on the cake is that the author presents Dumbledore as an accomplish, but Harry is passive in that front too.

I want to bitch-slap the author so badly.

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!

Harry's definitely quite selfish in this one. Lots of secrets, lots of distrust of basically everyone. The tone changes significantly about halfway through. Some people continue to like it, others dropped it after that.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
