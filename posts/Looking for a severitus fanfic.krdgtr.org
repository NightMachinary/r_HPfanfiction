Some time ago I read this fanfic where harry got deaged in 5th and Snape has to take care of him, and then he discovers that he is Harry biological father. I also remember him teaching Unbridge a lesson ( because no one messes with his son) and he also defeats Voldemort with a potion the Harry messed up well that's what I remember, if anyone could help I'll be very grateful. I also accept severitus or drarry suggestions. ( English is not my first language so, sorry if something's wrong
