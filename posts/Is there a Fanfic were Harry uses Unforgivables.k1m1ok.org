Searching for a ff were Harry uses unforgivables without a doubt against death eaters. Dont care if he's Light Grey or Dark pairings can be whatever you want as long as it isn't Slash Yaoi, please not genderbent Reason of me searching this kind of story: I mean i get really mad when we have a good independent Harry that kills death eaters cause they are the bad guys, and he isn't a fool like dumbledoor but never uses unforgivables i mean what's more efficient than an AK? We have gray or even a little dark Harry that uses excuses like The killing curse was invented for mercy killing for when animals are injured Or The cruciatus is to wake up coma pacients so Dark magic doesn't exist because it's about intent but then when someone important for Harry gets injured and probably Dead and with the Temper of Harry he gets mad but starts throwing “cutting curses” i get super mad and think “why do you what to cut him... unless he gets hit on the neck or the head he will be ok, i mean even if you cut his arm it can be reattached because it's not a dark curse, just start using the killing curse and get the job done” i was reading a ff were Harry is Lord Hogwarts, and heir of perevel,potter and Blacks, then he's allied with Neville,Susan, and Daphne, with all their votes and minor houses together has 75% of the wizagmot votes, but they still have fudge as minister, dumbledoor as headmaster (here is manipulative) and they haven't put a Law that is legal to take lethal action against death eaters... i got like... “Why?”


** Canon Harry used two of three Unforgivables and nobody bat an eyelid. In fact, Professor McGonagall added her own after Harry's Cruciatus on Amycus Carrow.

Fiendfyre and Unforgivables are all Harry's preferred spells in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]]

*** Harry also uses Fiendfyre and Unforgivables against Death Eaters towards the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13631582/1/Teleology][Teleology]].

I'm sure there are other such fanfics that I can't remember off the top of my head
