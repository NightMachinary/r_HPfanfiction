One of my favorite tropes in fiction is the “bad guy/rival turns good.” Vegeta being one of my favorite characters I would like a story where Draco and Harry have a similar dynamic as vegeta and goku. But I still want Harry to be the main focus.


** No idea what Vageta and Gokus dynamic is but linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool) is Harry centric/Draco redemption.

*** They have a friendly rivalry, and a friendship based on respect for each other's skill.

**** Hmm. I guess you could say Draco grows a healthy respect for Harry's power. I'm only half way through the fic however and Harry has grown friendly towards Draco but I haven't seen anything yet showing Harry taking regard of Draco's qualities.

They're forced into a situation of mutual compliance but through it they are growing friendly.
