#+TITLE: LF Good romance fics where only Harry is Tagged on ffn(considering I don't usually read gen, I would've skipped those by default). No Slash, no H/Hr nor H/G. 50k+ if possible.

FemHarry is cool, but only if paired with Ron, Neville or its femSlash, or a crossover. No Star wars, RWBY or Naruto though.
