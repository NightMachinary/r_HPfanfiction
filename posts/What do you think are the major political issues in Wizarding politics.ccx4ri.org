HP's greatest antagonists are a political terrorist (Lord Voldemort) and a politican (Umbridge). The Ministry is a major player in books 5 and 7. And yet we know nothing about the details: who are the major players and what are they fighting over? What are the major political flashpoints?

What we know from the books:

- The major conflicts seem to be over Muggle rights and Muggleborn rights. (The line blurs somewhat between them.) Grindelwald opposed the former and Voldemort opposed both, but they were both considered extremists.

  - Outright abolishment the Statute of Secrecy comes in here somwhere too, but is probably a very fringe position.

- Muggle Protection Act introduced in 1992, banning enchantments on muggle goods, amongst other things. Backed by Arthur Weasley, who had been trying to pass it for a while. (We don't know if that's because it was actually controversial or simply e.g. a private members bill.)

  - Under a separate law, magic carpets are illegal in Britain, despite diplomatic pressure from overseas. This seems to have bipartisan support.

- Umbridge opposes rights for werewolves, centaurs and 'half-breeds'. She mentions some laws on the books, but it's unclear whether they have any political opposition. Overall, while this is presented as an injustice in the books, there's no evidence of any modern political effort to overturn or tighten existing laws.

- Dumbledore, Fudge, Scrimgeour, Crouch and Voldemort all wield significant political influence at various points. But it's unclear if there's any political spectrum/diamond or where they would lie on it.

- Restriction on Underage Sorcery, Ban on Experimental Breeding, Laws Against Unforgivables have been on the books a long time and are probably settled law.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic][Pottermore]] mentions a few more points:

- Conditions at Azkaban and dementor breeding

- Squib Rights marches in the 1960's (a nod to the real-life 1968 protests)

- Goblin relations

** Very comprehensive summary. But just to add one more thing, i'd say that the independence of Hogwarts from the ministry is an ongoing dispute as the academic and administrative autonomy of Hogwarts has been challenged in a few of the books.

** It's the lack of depth that makes the political stuff feel so hollow. It's a government -- economic issues, trade, jobs, etc, should be front and center. Lucius Malfoy should be concerned about taxes instead of the rights of Muggleborns. We don't really see why those things matter -- how do Muggleborns impact one side of the political spectrum? Why do the others . support them? It's pretty much just that one side is bad! They're bigots! And the others are the good guys! It's all just childish.

*** IMO people like Lucius don't really care one way or another, it's just that supporting "pure" wizards over muggleborns gains them supporters for whatever other stuff they want passed.

Because I can see how the run on the mill pureblood that isn't insanely rich thanks to inheritance could be worried that an influx of muggleborns could, for example, cost him his job, or be pissed that his taxes go on paying for the education of such muggleborns when they didn't pay a knut of tax in their whole family history.

But we rarely if ever see such stuff in fics, sadly

***** It's not exactly flooded, it's about 2 or 3 people per year tops. And most of them adapt and assimilate more or less.

TBH The only difference between purebloods and the blood-traitors or muggleborns is that the latter live in denial about their feelings of magical supremacy.

**** Yes! I mentioned a few examples in another comment, but there's plenty of ways that muggleborns could have been scapegoated by purebloods. Maybe they're pushing for an inheritance tax, or maybe tuition for Hogwarts is covered by tax and that's rising. Maybe there are quotas in place for government jobs (highly unlikely from what we see in canon but you never know). So many ways to "rationalize" that fear. We just get that very generic "they're stealing our magic!" without explaining how or why that was a fear to be exploited.

*** Lucius Malfoy gave a 10 year old girl a cursed diary, and had a slave who he beat up. Maybe he is a garbage human being, without looking at the policies.

And policies? He supports Voldemort. Voldemort's actions include, within a year of gaining power, fun laws like the Muggleborn registration act, compulsory government education where little mugglborns are tortured, and mock trials with presumed guilt - over birth, not actions. Oh, and if you lose the that farce of a trial, the best outcome we know of is that you lose the power to support yourself and family (i.e. your wand)

You can say "but there is no policy behind this, this is done just to be spiteful!"

Well, good on you for critical thinking, but please refer to 1933-1945 and see that that's pretty much history. The Voldemort-supporters are obviously stand-ins for the nazi party of 1933.

The Nazi party didn't imprison and attempt genocide for tax reasons, or because they secretly wanted to push an unrelated law through. They were the Nazis, and there is no way around this: The policies were evil in nature, and mostly done out of spite or because a scape-goat was needed.

Yes, Germany was in economic shambles, but whoever the Nazis chose as scapegoat wasn't at fault.

  how do Muggleborns impact one side of the political spectrum?
#+end_quote

Let's rewrite this: "How d√Ød Jews impact one side of the political spectrum?"\\
The answer is, of course: It doesn't matter, because at one point the action taken agains the group of people does not matter, and even if there were individuals who did things that can be construed as unfair to the "other side", the actions are against the collective and plainly unjust.

Just because someone else has done a crime, you shoud never be punished -- but that is exactly what happens once you limit the rights of Muggleborns. And that's assuming they ever did something, and aren't just a full scapegoat.

And the books specifically says that many of the others are /not/ blankly "the good guys" (e.g. Scrimgour still politicing) - buy it does say that yes, Nazis are bad.

Maybe all that is boring to you, or maybe you wanted more twisted reasoning of why the +Jews+ Muggleborns are a menace to society that needs to be eradicated. But hey, they're stealing our +jobs and money+ magic is given as a reason in canon.

**** You're actually proving my point here.

The historical context of World War 2 and the Holocaust is so important here. The global depression, the reparations, the rise of a radical party willing to provide a scapegoat, and the move to a totalitarian government are all huge parts of what happened. Obviously, the Nazis were fucking evil. But their rise to power is a good example of how humanity can lose its morals in the face of fear -- horrific, horrible, but it's something that has a progression that's demarcated through history. Anti-semitism has a perverse history in Europe from well before the Nazis, and it still exists. I understand the parallels being drawn to Muggleborns. But the rise of the Nazi Party and the radicalization of Germany was caused by more than just anti-semitism. It gave anti-semites the ability to act on their feelings, and it was a huge part of the Nazi platform, but the overall devastation of Germany is what incited that radicalization.

But what happens in canon, as far as we know, isn't really spurred by anything other than pure hatred of Muggleborns. Life in the Wizarding World is good, except for fear of the death eaters! And then the death eaters win over the ministry, and all of sudden Voldemort goes into extreme Muggleborn killing mode, and that's what everyone wants. If you think that's analogous to the Holocaust, you're missing out on the fundamentals of that situation. Plenty of fanfic writers have expanded on this -- about the impact of Christianity on the Wizarding World as it would have been brought by Muggleborns, restrictions on magic that was considered dark, an increase in squibs, more people voting for the ministry, a shift away from feudalism -- there are so many ways to explain why rich purebloods were unhappy, and why Voldemort found blaming muggleborns the best way to radicalize the population. The books do not consider politics or political circumstance in depth.
