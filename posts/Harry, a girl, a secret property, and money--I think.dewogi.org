:END:
I vaguely remember reading a fic that started off similarly to Jeconais' "Modest, Too" (found at fanficauthors.net). Harry was in the center of trouble at Diagon/Gringotts and bounces to some secret property he now owns with some girl accompanying him--Tracy or Pansy, IIRC--probably with lots of money and they start rebuilding lives. I think it was more than one chapter, unlike Jeconais' story.

I did find on ff.net a story that expands upon the original tale by Luan Mao, same title, but nothing I recognize.

Thanks in advance if you can prove I didn't make this up!
