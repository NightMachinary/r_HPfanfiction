I'm looking for fics where breaking someone out of Azkaban very difficult, but Harry has a plan and follows it through with minimal difficulties because he's just that good.

I imagine this would be in some kind of time travel fic.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45994729]] - Harry succeeds in breaking Sirius out of Azkaban because of inside knowledge of security and future magic.

*** Thanks.

This fic is probably the closest fit that I've read, but it's still not quite there.

This Harry apparates to Azkaban more or less on a whim, without even having a wand, basically completely wings it, would've failed if not for Sirius, and doesn't have anywhere to take Sirius afterwards. He is a kind of competent, but it's a sort of.. bumbling competence.

**** "Bumbling competence" kind of sums up Harry in a phrase - at least for the first three books.

** Prince of Slytherin: not exactly Harry who breaks him out, but the plan takes a long time to come to fruition, the guards and prison authorities are competent, and the plan had high chances of failing.

** Harry and his trusted friend Professor Quirrell break, um, someone out of Azkaban in [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.]] It's an entertainingly complicated plan that goes haywire, so Harry has to improvise.

**** Yeah, you have to enjoy reading about unlikeable characters to enjoy the story. I find the contrast between his arrogance and the really serious mistakes he makes to be hilarious.
