I've started to struggle to find material lately, and was wondering if anybody knew some good HP fanfic authors. I would prefer no slash, but other than that I just need some good stories.

Lots of excellent one shots. Cauterize is amazing, and Stars Fall is one of my absolute favorites.

** Newcomb has aready been mentioned - I'll second his name - and additionally point out that he wrote his [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/edit][own list]] of stories/authors he considered 'good'.

Authors I have enjoyed lately/am currently enjoying include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/NoahPhantom][NoahPhantom]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6772486/SGTwhiskeyjack][SGTWhiskeyjack.]] Fair warning, they are both mainly next-gen authors. That may or may not be your cup of tea
