*** I remember reading a crack fic where the sorting hat would put the really evil people into hufflepuff since that had the highest chance of reform. "There's not a Dark Lord that didn't come from Hufflepuff".

***** Well, their hat being loyalty above all is unsettlingly similar to the Waffen SS's motto, "Mein Ehre heisst Treue" - "my honour is loyalty". And you can't say the boys in black weren't hard workers either.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
