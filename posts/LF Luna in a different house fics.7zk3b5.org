** Definitely the Under the Moon series. I absolutely love Luna's characterization in this series. It's a MCU crossover and Luna has such an astounding journey. Where she was sorted was not all surprising considering what she had went through in the story, but I find that the house actually suited due to this Luna's circumstances.

  "But Loki decided that only the other moon was really worth mentioning." Luna sees too little(none at all) and then too much. Loki needs a hug. But if you close your eyes (does it almost feel like nothing's changed at all? PART ONE of the Under the Moon Series.

** "Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past" has Luna Sorted into Hufflepuff. She's not part of the main gang (who are all Gryffindors), but she shows up to be quirky every so often and ends up playing a crucial role in the later chapters.

Being in Hufflepuff hasn't changed her much... if anything, eleven-year-old Luna is a even little weirder than the fourteen-year-old we first meet in canon... but she does seem less lonely and the Hufflepuffs seem overall more accepting of her than the Ravenclaws.

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one. Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.
