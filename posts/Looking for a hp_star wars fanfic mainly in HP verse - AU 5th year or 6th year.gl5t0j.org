I thought I saw this particular fanfic a while back. Harry has an advanced mindscape. Basically his mind has planets and stuff from Star Wars. He's able to 'pull' clones from the clone wars through his mindscape and the clones become 'real.' Harry's power is growing. His core has bindings that Dumbledoor has transferred to Harry to maintain because Harry's getting too powerful for Dumbledoor to maintain. Harry's love interests are Fleur, Nym Tonks, and Hermione, but he's had to watch them get romanced by other people and his emotions get the better of him. when his emotions get beyond his control different 'Armor' pieces appear on him as his power spikes.

The fic starts as Harry goes to the Weasley's home, beds down in the living room, breaks out a guitar and starts singing.

I can't remember where I saw this fanfic.

Thanks for the help. -Docdrago


** if you find it let me know it sounds like a fun read.
