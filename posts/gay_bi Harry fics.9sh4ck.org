hey! I'm looking for any good fics where harry is gay/bi and it's a part of the story and obviously is done well (so no fics clearly written by straight girls where harry starts embodying a bunch of homophobic tropes. you know the types) Stories where he realises he's gay/bi and deals with it are ideal. either where his sexuality is the main focus or one part of the plot is fine, as long as it's not glossed over or treated badly. no miserable torture-porn stories where everyone is evil and completely hates him though (conversely, I'm not keen on stories where everyone is unexplainably completely pro LGBT as I'm looking for realism mostly) No creepy pairings like adult/teen (so no snarry obvs) and I'm not super keen on drarry but ik it's the most popular so I don't mind recs with it. Ideally I'd prefer no pairings or background pairings but anything is fine as long as it's not abusive/disturbing & they're the same age. no m/f obviously. and no sex scenes between kids, please. I prefer Hogwarts era fics (I don't rly read post-DH) & don't rly like wild character bashing. I know that's quite particular, but does anyone know of any fics like this? For posterity, my favourite (pretty much the only fic I know of like this) is Blood by the_lord_of_chaos (which is massive and recently completed so if you're interested it's worth the read!)

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

*** Uh, no? There are no explicitly lgbt characters in Harry Potter and it's literally fanfiction. There's nothing wrong w interpreting a character as gay or writing about that.

******* you commented on my thread complaining that me saying homophobes being homophobic is ‘hate' so I think you're the inflammatory one, mate. maybe rethink why you're so sensitive & eager to find fault in ppl complaining abt homophobia
