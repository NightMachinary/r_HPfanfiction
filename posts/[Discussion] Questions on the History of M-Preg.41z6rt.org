** Here you go: [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Mpreg]]

So the earliest fanwork example is from 1983, the idea itself is obviously as old as time. There are a few different gods in different cultures born by some variation of two guys getting it on.

** As a slash reader, I can say many authors and readers think mpreg is weird. Many times even gross. But it can also be pretty hot and steamy. Lots of mpreg is awful, true. However, we have our 11-year-old writers and you have yours.

Mpreg is a trope used to get characters in interesting situations. To add on to TheBlueMenance's list:

- It's a reason for sex and relationships to happen (arranged marriages, reproductive goals)
- It can get angsty or happy depending on the world
- Authors can explore what an mpreg world is like (cultural systems, politics)
- How it would affect the character (physically, emotionally)
- Delving into imagined biologies (trans, hermaphrodite, A/B/O dynamics, agender)

*** I agree, you don't see people jumping up and down on SI anywhere near as much as mpreg, and the level of crap is about the same. Even harem share about the same level of horrible (I don't identify as a feminist, but I really hate the characterization of females in these fics, and very very few have a plot which makes any sense at all). But as people actually like harem here, harem isn't subjected to snark and doesn't appear in the discussions of worst/hated/rants.

I like your list too. There is a lot of really good articles out there about why mpreg occurs, but fewer about why we see it so much in HP as opposed to any other fandom. I mean, is there more, or it a perspective/volume fallacy? I'm not sure.

**** Harem is probably not taken seriously because it's usually porn. It's not a "serious" fic so people don't treat it as such.

SI is not necessarily terrible, but it's a potential warning sign of a badfic. I don't know if there are good SI fics out there because of my own reading preferences: I rarely read anything that is not Harry-centric.

Do any good MPreg fics exist? I've never read a MPreg fic, and I never will (because slash). I always hear they are unequivocally terrible, however.

***** Just like SI, there are good mpreg out there, even if there is also a lot of crap (the ratio may in fact be better, depending on your definition of a good fic). But almost all of it is very heavy romance, rather then the focus being mpreg. In a way, these stories /are/ porn, ie emotional porn for women. The audience is not intended to be men at all, just like the audience of harem is not meant to be women. The demographic of this sub is very much male dominated (or at least, males tend to post more), and so the sub hates on mpreg, while being accepting of harem.

** In a world where mandrakes are plant people that "we" butcher for potions ingredients, I could see where "magic" would provide an easy answer and allow male pregnancy. If I squinted and turned my head sideways, I mean.

But I can't get behind natural childbirth. Cesarean or bust (literally, I guess).

**** Even something like engorgio during labor to help the birth dilation would ease a lot of pain and stop complications. Or vanishing the pelvic bones during and then growing them back later maybe?

For mpreg, the Entrail-Expelling Curse has been around a while, there has got to be a either a treatment or a minor (non fatal) version around by now.

******** ... So... as is often the case with Potterverse magic, it occurs to me that Wizards have easy access to the answers to questions we muggles struggle with so vigorously.

Example: Do we have souls? YES. (And also Dementors eat them.)

Which makes me wonder... If side-along apparating requires conscious intent to bring the other person with you... and a baby is a separate person... could magical childbirth simply be a matter of the mother apparating out of the hospital bed? If so, then they can also answer the "When does a baby count as a person" question pretty readily too.

****** During the vanishing bones Harry doesn't appear to be in any pain at all, and I don't remember in the books him mentioning pain either. Sure, the muscles would no longer be anchored to anything, but the rubbery floppiness of Harry's arm makes me think that it isn't just the bones which are changed. This makes this idea not as a bad idea as it first appears. Sure, you may need to hold open the vagina to allow the baby to slide out, but there is no danger of torn muscles, and because the pelvis is not there, there is no rigid constriction to past through.

Of course, I'm not a OB GYN, nor have I ever given birth so I may be completely wrong....

Harry's arm is rubbery and floppy because its muscles no longer work.

** This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2r69eu/but_why_mpreg/][sub]] has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ymftp/whats_the_strangest_most_disturbing_use_of_magic/][bias]] against [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3tge6z/is_it_just_me_who_wants_a_ffn_slash_or_not_slash/][Mpreg]]. Male pregnancy [[http://imgur.com/nGMErwH][is older then dirt]]. So asking what fanfiction it was found in first is.... well, I have no doubt there is Kirk/Spock fanfiction back in the 1970s with one of them getting pregnant. TVtropes has a reasonable [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse][article on it]].

For the most part, mpreg is widespread in HPFF vs other FFs due to a few things:

- magic provides an easy explanation as to how
- many of the most interesting characters are male
- JKR has somewhat endorsed gay relationships by making Dumbledore gay
- there is just a lot of HPFF out there, meaning for niche subjects like mpreg are still a lot of fics, all still under [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][Sturgeon's law]].
- many writers want to see their in love characters have biological children (for various reasons)

***** As of this time on FFN alone (and a good source for the pulse of things since it started early) HP has over 750k fics. The next closest don't actually come close to its numbers.

So you'll naturally see more of the tropes and in greater numbers.

**** I haven't actually read any mpreg where the explanation is a trans man. I've seen:

- aliens with alien biology
- gods (aliens by any other names) with godly biology
- Future science ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws][Clarke's third law]])
- Mutants (whether spontaneous or by evil organizations).
- Omega verse (or other gender changes, where men are no longer really male)
- Meyerism (Vampires, werewolves, other fantasy creatures are special or else known as /fails at biology forever/)
- Bio-Augmentation/deliberate self alterations
- Transhumanism and energy babies
- Half-Human Hybrid Whatevers (with Meyerism above).

So that I haven't seen trans men is actually surprising to me.

  Did M-preg exist before Harry Potter
#+end_quote

I'm guessing you're asking if Mpreg was an theme/trope/motif in other fanfictions before HP. My answer is yes, because 'male pregnancy' is an established theme in literature/folklore. As a theme that has been around for thousands of years, it's possible/probably that it would pop up in fanfiction.

For a scholarly look at the subject, see this paper: [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwjZ9MGIlbvKAhXkr4MKHeicC70QFggvMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dlib.si%2Fstream%2FURN%3ANBN%3ASI%3Adoc-WLFEOMOQ%2F4a0eae9b-7dfa-4281-9db1-4a15ddb3475d%2FPDF&usg=AFQjCNFPiHV7KiltbxYx-svMgat1bUbZug&cad=rja][The Motif of a Pregnant Man in our Knowledge]].

There is a great reference material called the /Motif-index of Folk-literature/ by S. Thompson. If you can access a copy, an analysis of "Male pregnancy" in folk literature is given (index item T578).

That is... wow ok. I understand that a male to female person may still like women, and the other way, but for a male to female to like a female to male /and the other way around/ has got to be a rare occurrence. Unless they weren't together, but had a child anyway?

I agree with you about it being rare... but then I had a thought which makes me wonder. How much overlap is there in the two procedures? /Could/ +they+ two such people possibly meet in the clinic or one of the various activities that go along with it and then bonded over shared experiences?

Now I almost wonder if its surprising it doesn't happen more often. Granted, the actual populations are tiny so it's unlikely the overlap would happen much but still.
