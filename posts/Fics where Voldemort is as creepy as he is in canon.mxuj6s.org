Tired of fics that make Voldemort some hot dude with crimson eyes, and Harry falls in love with him or someone else. Would rather see an authentic Voldemort, true to canon. Don't care what the genre is though I really love horror or angst. Any recommendations would be awesome :)


** He is a creepy psychopath in mine but isn't in part 1 too much as Bella takes the creep for him. You can put a bookmark on the series if you're interested. Let me know.

***** May as well join in. May I offer my [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El]] series where Voldie keeps returning and since he uses a technique that lets him shred his victims souls and use the bits to fill in the gaps in his own, each time he returns, he's closer to sane and even more cunning.

Voldie even manages to team up with Grindlewald ^{in Book 3} and together, they recruit several Obscurials to act as their elite forces.

Oddly, due to a completely logical mistake with regard to a scrying spell that they used, Voldie and Grindle reach the conclusion that Harry is the Last Son of /Atlantis/...

** Voldemort from the Prince of Slytherin is /scary/, physically and otherwise. He's magically changed his appearance to be more snakelike, but even if he looked normal he'd still be terrifying for other reasons.

Oh also some notes on the fic:\\
* A lot of people (myself included) dislike the prologue\\
* James and Jim start out kinda shitty, but they do get better\\
* the story is /long/. Over a million words and we're only at the Quidditch World Cup before the start of Fourth Year

*** That's a really cool fic. But I doubt I have the patience to read a fic that long. Amazing what people can write

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
