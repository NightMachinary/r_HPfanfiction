Preferably no romance, and Sirius raises Harry while it deals with the psychological damage he's gone through as he's trying to look out for him.


** I'd love to actually read a fic like this. Just: one, single point of divergence here, with Sirius/Harry figuring out how to be family and getting over their issues. No AU elements, no romance, no extra crap. Just total canon compliant, just this.

*** It is going to be AU from that point though. And I don't think you can put all that much "figuring out how to be a family" into the few month of holidays.

**** AU is changes before the story starts, it can still be canon divergence if they start it at the scene in the Shrieking Shack and move on from there with the only other changes being the results of Pettigrew's capture.

Plus figuring out how to be a family would take years, so you've got an ongoing story for the remaining four books.

***** I always thought that "AU" description is unnecessary. FF is always AU, whether the point of divergence is years before the story starts or in the first chapter doesn't really matter.

That it would take years is exactly whats going to make such a story probably boring. The only real difference from the books would be that they live together for a few weeks every year and letter exchange is a easier.

****** The AU tag is very important! It's the difference between a magicless coffee shop fic and a slice of life fic where they visit a coffee shop. AU changes something fundamental about the world and/or it's set up. Divergence typically only changes the events but tries to keep the characters close to their canon characterization.

As for the difference between AU and divergence, whether it happens before the story or in the first chapter (or even later) really matters. A lot. Some people want to see the change happen. In shorter fics the change could be the whole point of the fic. But some people want to explore the results. And just because it's not /your/ cup of tea does not make it boring. A lot of us are fascinated by the idea of Harry's psychology being handled differently.

******* The Problem is that "fundamental change" is subjective, just like me saying such a story would be boring ( I thought that was obvious btw.). Is smart!Harry a fundamental change? Blue eyes Harry? Magic can only be cast with long incanations? Hogwarts had 5 founders? At least the last one would probably be a "yes" for you, yet that story could otherwise stay completely true to canon.

I meant it does not matter in order to define "AU", not in terms of story telling.

P.s. Currently on phone which tries to autocorrect everything to german. :P
