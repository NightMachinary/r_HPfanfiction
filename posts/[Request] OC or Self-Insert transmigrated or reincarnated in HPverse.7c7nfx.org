I just read this: linkffn(12614626) and I liked it a lot I read a couple of self-insert that awaken in the body of Harry Potter but they are not so good.

Does anyone know of any similar facfic? with male mc and no slash.

If you have not read that fanfic, read it, you will like it. Also the author has a fanfic of Fem!Voldemort that is incredible. I have only seen others two Fem!Voldy in FFN but this is the best of all :3 linkffn(Aggressive Love)


** Your second link is not working. Anyway, linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) is a very nonstandard take on this sort of story and I really like it. Rather than "possessing" the character's body, the 'self-insert' character materializes as a voice in their head.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** I recently recommend a few of them [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7bc5ef/how_would_you_survive_in_the_harry_potter_world/dpguscm/][here]], but you are right: There aren't that many good SIs.

There's one with a male!Voldie /and/ a reincarnated fem!Voldie at the same time. Sadly unfinished, I found it interesting. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11373351/1/Warning-Past-Soul-Bind-Performance-Not-Indicative-of-Future-Prophets]])

Also, as to your question, check this one out over at SB [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wand-hp-si.260414/]]\\
This is unfinished but very good. The SI isn't reincarnated as Harry, though, he's reincarnated as himself.

  The Master of Death brings his 130,000 years of experience to slam down on the unsuspecting head of his biggest and most entertaining challenge yet. Voldemort brings all her cunning and guile to rip open the mystery that is Harry Potter. And Dumbledore, Fudge, and the rest of the Wizarding world, scrabble to make sense of what in Merlin's name is going on. - On Hiatus

  This is the story of a person who died. It's OK though, he got better. Through some kind of cosmic coincidence he wakes up in the body of an 11 year old Severus Snape. What would someone in his position, with knowledge of the future and what can be accomplished with magic do? Liberally abuse it and live like a king of course! Snape!Harem SI-OC as Snape NO SLASH.
