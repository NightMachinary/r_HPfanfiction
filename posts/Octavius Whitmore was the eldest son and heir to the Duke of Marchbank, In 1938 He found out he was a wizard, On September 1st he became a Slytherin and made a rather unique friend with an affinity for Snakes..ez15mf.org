What would have Tom Riddle's life been like , if instead of being the orphan Halfblood in Slytherin, he had an ally from day one, An aristocrat Muggleborn who bank rolled both of them.

Tom Riddle is still a psychopathic little shit, but instead of dominating the purebloods he finds another way to make a power play in Slytherin, instead of Promoting pure blood Ideology, Tom comes of age a proud Halfblood Spending his days plotting with a lord's son . Who's father just so happened To be familiar with another Riddle From his days as a Etonian.


** I'm wondering if young Octavius would have stooped to befriend some ragamuffin when there were wizards from important families he could try to impress instead. I guess maybe after he tried and failed to befriend the purebloods, he might settle for the nobody.

**** I doubt Riddle would actually befriend him. I mean, change his rhetoric when Octavius is around, try to manipulate him to thinking they're friends, sure. But canon Riddle seems dead set on being the top dog, as well as being a "psychopathic little shit". I have a feeling Octavius would be his friend for exactly as long as it took for Riddle to upgrade, and being a rich muggleborn doesn't quite compare socially to be a rich pureblood, who Riddle could impress instead like he did in canon.

Edit: Not to mention, being openly friends with this muggleborn would hurt his reputation with the rest of slytherin, and it's a hell of a lot easier to change friends then it would be for Riddle to single handedly create tolerance and acceptance of muggleborns in Slytherin.

***** At least this particular scenario, Tom Riddle isn't the only ridiculously intelligent 11-year-old, Think of Octavius is a cross between Hermione Granger And Mycroft Holmes. Tom and Octavius recognize a potential ally In one another. Tom is still obsessed with being top dog, He just works a different angle to get his way, He might also choose this path Because his first and strongest ally Octavius Drags Tom home with him at every opportunity. A mutually beneficial arrangement as Tom gets to avoid the orphanage and Octavius gets to alleviate his parents worries about him not making any friends. The two boys are using each other In a symbiotic relationship like some species of fungus, They become allies , then Tolerable acquaintances, And before either of them realizes it somehow friends. Brought together by a mutual lust for power And the sheer joy of World domination. They're not quite sure about the division of power as of yet, One cannot be both The Minister of Magic and Chief Warlock.

****** I mean, we have so little canon characterization for Riddle in his early years this is perfectly plausible. I'm just saying, its exactly as plausible that it goes the exact opposite way ; Riddle meets useful tool, finds out tools functions can be replicated by other, less politically damaging tools, that also don't have any chance to threaten his position as top dog by being intelligent. And when you're the dictator of a country, you can in fact be both The Minister of Magic and Chief Warlock.

****** Both, emphasizing the one that seems to be the most dominant socially. Which would be the pure bloods. I'm just saying, if you want power you dont befriend the little guys and work to change the entire hierarchy. The much faster way is to fit into the hierarchy that already exists and make your way to the top, ideally with the help of friends who are already at the top. IE exactly what Riddle did in canon.

Edit: If i was writing this fanfic and wanted to make it work, I'd open by having Riddle make his first impression with the purebloods by shoving a foot in his mouth. Just really screw it up hardcore, to the point where changing opinions of muggleborns themselves becomes easier than fixing his reputation. That or make the Slytherins much more racist, super hardcore blood supremacists that won't even look at Tom. Just something to make the easy way of "make friends with the elite" impossible.

** That's an interesting one, you could pull them together by playing up the idea that the Duke went to Eton with Riddle Sr. Maybe they were close friends at school. Then the Duke sees Tom at Kings Cross and recognises him, speaks to him, finds out he's an orphan etc. The boys sit together on the train, both are...cold and distant, unused to the idea of friends, socially competent but better at superficial charm than friendliness. But at the end of the day they're 11 year old boys off to learn magic, so that breaks the ice and 8 hours later, when they arrive in Hogsmeade, they're fast friends.

#+end_quote

Tom Riddle does something similar in the series /There is nothing (to fear)./ Tom Riddle gets sorted to Gryffindor. He makes a power play by claiming to champion the downtrodden of wizarding society. In spite of this, Tom Riddle is still Tom Riddle and just as scary as his canon counterpart. It's a 5-part series of one shots and shorts. First work is Having the Right Enemies, which takes place after Tom graduates. My favorites are the parts where Tom is at Hogwarts: parts 2, /Men who are Resolved/ and 5, /According to his own nature/ (The series isn't linear, but part 5 takes place immediately after part 2).

Part 1, Having the Right Enemies: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145]])

Part 2, Men Who Are Resolved: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15607950]])

** It's a nice idea but Riddle would never 'befriend' him. At best he'd be considered a useful tool to bankroll him through the Muggle world.

Or at worst he'd be a threat (and with your description as part Mycroft/ part Hermione) I don't see either of them logically getting close to one another, especially if they first meet at Hogwarts (if they bonded from a young age however...) The two would see right through each other, Octavius would represent everything Tom wanted: money, status and power, thus he would envy Octavius and likely lash out that a mere-Muggleborn made him feel so insecure (especially after learning his heritage). And if Octavius was as smart as you want him to be, I doubt he'd see him any differently than Dumbledore did, he wouldn't be pulled in by the false charm, especially when Tom was 11/12 and wouldn't have mastered it just yet.

Overall, Marchbanks would have been ostracized by Slytherin House for his blood status and may have taken the heat off of Tom's back a bit in that department, thus he wouldn't have risked drawing attention to himself by openly befriending him. And Marchbanks would have undoubtedly seen right through any attempts to butter him up in private by Tom.

They'd dance an awkward, wary dance of suspicion and almost open disdain before Tom finally just stripped Octavius of everything useful and murdered him and his family.
