I hate everything about that sport. It's badly written, boring and predictable because the author's can't bring themselves to have their precious OC!Harry ruined by a loss.


** Lots of fics ditch quidditch. Lots of fics focus on other areas of the world so it doesn't make an appearance one way other the other. If I were you, I'd look at Hermione centric fics. Since she's not a quidditch player, anything she starring her isn't going to have huge amounts of quidditch. Things like linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine), linkffn(the arithmancer) and linkffn(applied anthropology) (which are all goods fics) would fit the bill. There are tons of harry centric fics where he decides he's too busy to play quidditch, but none of them spring to mind right now except hpmor (already rec'd) and linkffn(the art of self fashioning).

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

So it's not OC at all :( (also: I'd love to know what you hate about the sport (I myself only think that the seeker is too powerful (to many points for the snitch) so it doesn't matter much what the other players do in most cases - other than that?
