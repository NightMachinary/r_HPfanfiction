** So wait....

I can have the honor of writing a multi chapter fic features your various wish-fulfillment self inserts and if you like it enough you'll post the story on your own platforms for your own benefit?

Hard Pass.

** Honestly, given those "ideas" you may as well save time, name your character Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, and just read My Immortal instead. Good grief.
