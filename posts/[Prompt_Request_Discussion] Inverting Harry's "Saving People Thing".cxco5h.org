In which Harry always ends up the distressed damsel.

Could be played straight (changing situations) or comedically (Harry is still trying to save people, but fails hilariously).

- Hermione saves Harry from troll in the boys restroom.
- Harry gets left behind in a body bind for the fight with Quarrelmorte
- Ginny and Ron save Harry from the chamber
- Sirius and Hermione have to use the time tuner to save Harry from Fudge
- Harry faints and has to be rescued by Ron/Gabby in second task.
- Cedric duels voldemort and sacrifices himself to let Harry get away.
- Sirius dies after receiving a vision of Harry being tortured. Harry sleeps through it all.

I doubt this exists already, /but it should/

Edit: The one thing I don't want is to gender bend Harry and then do this. That would be a little too much social commentary for a lighthearted idea...


** There is /an element/ of this phenomenon in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

Harry does end up lost, kidnapped or generally in the need of rescue /a lot/ in this fic

** And why would you want to read that? Seriously, the "damsel in distress" thing isn't even cool when it is women who are panicking and are safed by the hero!

Frankly I prefer protagonists who can shove fear, doubt and other irrational things aside while in combat (you can have a panick attack later or grief for lost friends etc.)

*** I'm going to assume you are asking this seriously instead of condescendingly.

As I stated in the OP, there are two ways it could go. The more traditional one would be comedic. This isn't even that uncommon. There are plenty of stories that have a 'brave knight' who, despite all his efforts, always ends up having to be rescued.

There are even several tropes related to this. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero][Failure Hero]] would fit. As would the related [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessProtagonist][Useless Protagonist]]

As for taking it as a serious angle, it would be a fun way to expand the supporting characters in the HP universe. Plus you get to play with the whole 'fate said you were the hero'. What happens when the designated +whipping boy+ Boy Hero turned out to be really, really, really bad at his job?

You would end with a very exasperated Harry, being told by Dumbledore he has to save the day, saying he would just screw it up and all he wants to do is study blast-ended newts. And pointing out that Hermione, Ron, Neville, /lavender/ are all more heroic (and proven hero) than he is. Eh, it has some potential.
