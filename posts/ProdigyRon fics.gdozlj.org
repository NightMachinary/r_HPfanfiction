Yeah, one does tire of the same tropey "Hermione and/or Harry are wandless magic/runes/political/arithmancy//insert edgy magic/ prodigies at age 11 and Ron, uh, plays chess?" Any fics where Ron gets to DO something? Tests early into an elective early The Arithmancer style? Be years ahead in a cool subject? It literally does not have to be well written I will read garbage to avoid Weasley bashing. (Romance is welcomed, slash doubly so, assuming nothing's underage or inc*st-y.)


** Ron is quite good at chess in my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). The series is an AU where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all sorted into Slytherin, and has a good dose of politics and world building.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** linkffn(Speed by Clell65619). It's a crossover with The Flash. Or, maybe with the DC comics rather than the TV show. I'm not familiar enough with it to know for sure. It's well-written, and I like the author, but it didn't appeal to me.

linkffn(Little Swimmers by canoncansodoff) has a Ron who's a sort of physical prodigy, in a crackish way.

And, perhaps not quite what you're looking for, but a feel-good story about Ron is linkao3(Better Than He Knew by Just_Tatty).

  Louis' not sure whether Harry ever really noticed how sad he was, but Louis knew. He saw it every time his eyes flickered over to him. The air around him was so delicate and breakable, icy to the touch and acidic in taste. Two boys, broken and hurting, but clinging on to the world and each other. This is a story of pain and desperation, of hope and an amazing strength to keep on going, to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** Ron's a hero able to pull his weight next to Harry in most of my stories.

To name just the stories where he's a POV character:

He's a spy for Dumbledore in a Wizarding Britain ruled by Malfoy in "The Dark Lord Never Died", a Curse-breaker (and heartbreaker) in "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", and a military prodigy (and the war hero of the story) in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution". In "Divided and Entwined", he's on par with Harry when it comes to fighting Death Eaters and in the Harry-Hermione-Ron love triangle, he wins Hermione's heart. In "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked On Water", he's as good an Auror as Harry. "Uncle Quentin's Spy" has him hold down the fort at Hogwarts, and foil one of Voldemort's attacks. And in my current story, "The Granger Principle", muggle Ron's the main character.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
