You know. We need suggestions! We changed a great many things for the next release. But now is the last chance to request anything before we release the new version of the bot.

It can be anything from new sites to new commands to literally anything.

Please make only one request per comment.


** First, love the bot!

An enhancement I've been wishing for a while now is a more prominent display of a fic status (whether it is complete or not). Currently one has to find the status amongst a string of other metadata, and it's never in the same bloody place!

** Would be nice to be able to put in the fandom to narrow down the fics. I know a few times people have put in linkffn(Insert The Fic Title Here) and gotten some random fic from a different fandom with the same name. I know we can put in the ID# in the URL, but it would be nice to be able to put in the title.

So: linkffn(Harry Potter; Insert The Fic Title Here)

Or something like that.

Also being able to pick up on comments where another link is edited into the comment later. Not sure it's possible.

*** A new feature of the bot is ffnbot!refresh with should do quite nicely for updating the bot on edits. [[/u/tusing]] and I are currently thinking about automating this process (at least for sufficiently new comments). ([[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/issues/89][Click Issue Link Here]])

As for narrowing down the fics: The bot just googles everything that does not look like a link or a number. Narrowing down should be easy by adding additional things to the query like

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(30 Minutes in Harry Potter by Radaslab)\\
  linkffn(Harry Potter 30 Minutes that changed everything)
#+end_quote

** A download mobi link next to the epub option, please.

I tend to email mobi files to read on kindle.

** Not a feature, but a bugfix: when the bot prints the notes section after a call to linkao3(), extra backslashes end up being inserted before every fullstop and dash.

** Slimffn()

Gives a smaller return: just the title, wordcount, complete/incomplete, and summary. Like so:

slimffn(The One He Feared by Taure)

*** *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]]* (Incomplete, 42,225)

Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Sorting of the results, if there are multiple requests.

If I link three fics, for example, I could want them sorted based on number of reviews, on which was updated most recently, etc.

** A ffnbot!fichunt for people looking for fics.

Someone can attach it to a comment with a fic link and the bot would suggest fics that have been linked with it before, by popularity.

** A way of linking to a author's profile. You'd probably have to skip their biography, but showing what stories they've written shouldn't be too hard, right?

*** No it isn't and more importamtly it's coming for sure.

We just need some refinements in some requirements for this feature.
