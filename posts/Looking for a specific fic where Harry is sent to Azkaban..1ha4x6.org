Hey all, I've noticed that you've been helpful to others when finding lost fics, so I'm hoping you can help me too.

Harry is sent to Azkaban, and while he's there he finds a genie who lets him make three wishes. I remember one wish is the magic/knowledge to defeat Voldemort, and the third wish is a place to stay, or a home, or something like that. I remember that once he's free/once he kills Voldemort, Remus and Sirius pledge themselves to do whatever Harry tells them to do using some ancient spell, and Harry brings both of them to some super-secret ancient mansion that he got from his third wish.

Something like that. Anybody know what I'm talking about? I thought I read it on fanfiction.net, but I looked through my favorites and it's not there. :(


** The story you're thinking about is Redempiton (at least i hope it is so I don't look stupid.) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1480438/1/Redemption]]

**** I've read it twice now and the second time it took me 2 and a half hours of googling and perusing Fanfiction lists to find.

****** The beginning is just so bad ass that I had to read it again. I'm not even sure what sparked the interest to find it that second time.

******* I think my favorite part is when Sirius and Remus are arguing in the basement right before the full moon. Actually, no, I really like the part where Harry is knocked out for two weeks and Sirius and Remus get huge headaches just trying to nurse him back to health. Ack, I don't know. I love this fic. I have a soft spot for people trying to redeem themselves.
