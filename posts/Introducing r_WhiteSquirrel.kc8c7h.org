** Well, I don't know if it will get much traffic myself, but I did put up a list of my WIPs with potential collaborations and adoptions: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteSquirrel/comments/kghie8/list_of_wip_stories_and_status/]]

There seems to be periodic interest in adoptable fics on this sub, so I thought it might be worth having them listed out somewhere.
