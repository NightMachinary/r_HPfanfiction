** I don't know the one you're referencing, but (and this is a bit of a spoiler since there's some /drama/ prior to them getting together) linkffn(Innocent) eventually pairs them together. (But it's very much in the background with lots of other stuff going on)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

**** I'm in the process of reading this! It's sort of huge though, and I've gotten through about an eighth. Glad to know Sirius and Marlene actually do get together at some point though.

** Not exactly what you are looking for but linkffn(Honour thy blood) has that relationship (even if it's late into the fic)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** I just read the first chapter because the premise sounds super interesting, but the writing quality is...rather lacking. Does the writing improve? Or will it be 300k words of this?
