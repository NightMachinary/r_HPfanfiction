History of Magic Professor Hagrid

Potions Mistress Trelawney.

Flying Instructor Umbridge.

Harry & Co arein for an interesting several years


** Imagine Hagrid teaching history of magic Harry's second year. Hermione asks about the chamber of secrets and he awkwardly tries to change topic.

"And that's the goblin rebellion of 1462. Any questions?" "Hagrid what's the Chamber of Secrets?" "Er... any other questions?"

** Divination Professor McGonnagall was not impressed with her lot this year, Fuck it, she thought, I'm teaching these wizards logic. The irritated professor proceeded to fully ignore the curriculum of Divination and instead taught the dunderheads as much logical reasoning as she could squeeze into their brains.
