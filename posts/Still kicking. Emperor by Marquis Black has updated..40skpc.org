[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/43/Emperor][Link to most recent chapter]]. From the Author's Note, it sounds like he is planning on finishing the story.

** Are there any other comments on this? Since starting to read this subreddit, I've already added at least 10M words to my reading list, and I don't want to add another 630K for a story when the summary doesn't exactly grab me.

And since I'm here... I don't know Nobunaga or T'sao T'sao, but there's nothing in common between the "rise" of Napoleon and Augustus.

*** Nobunaga was a Japanese ruler without whom Japan would likely look very, very differently. He was one of three people who together ended a period that is commonly referred to as the Warring States Period, where every Daimyo in Japan was essentially independent, leading to the unified state that would eventually dominate much of Asia.

But I would (and have, several times on this subreddit) recommend that you read it. It's rather unique, in that Harry never really attends Hogwarts and actively works against Magical Britain, but it has the intrigue, politics, and war is so rarely seen in fanfics.

**** Thanks (and to tusing too). I'll add it to the list.

I searched the other two after I posted and I still don't see a connection. I await enlightenment.

I didn't see your other recommendations for this story - I only went back a few weeks. I apologise for the implication there weren't any at all.

*** If I had to write a (spoiler-free) summary:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter hated fame, hated politics, hated intrigues and hated the moral ambiguity that politicians use to justify their ways. But in an alternative universe his parents lived and a constant state of war engulfed the world, a war of dirty tactics and deeply grey morals, that couldn't be won by childlike ideals and noble dreams. And so Harry embraced the spotlight of flames, the politics, the shades of grey, and started to march towards the future he wanted to live in, even if that meant to dirty his feet with the ash of scorched earth.
#+end_quote

Tl;dr: an extreme AU with heaps of interesting ideas, great politics and battlescenes which tend to lean towards the darker side of things, without ever getting comically grimdark. Recommended!

*** I haven't read it but I am considering it based on the comments. However, since I have so much other fanfic to get through, I think I will wait and see if this gets completed in the time it takes me to get through the rest :P

**** You should do more than consider it! You should drop everything you have and jump straight into it. Well, unless you're reading Worm, in which case you should finish that, read Emperor, and then proceed to get lost in the treasure-trope that is Worm fanfics.

But seriously, Emperor is plain amazing. It has one of the best badass portrayals of Harry without making him stupidly overpowered. At the same time, he is just another human, he makes mistakes, but he rises above them and grows stronger than ever.

****** Oooh, Worm has so many fics that can easily rival the best of Harry Potter fics. Cenotaph is flat-out the best fanfic ever written in any fandom, closely rivaled by Dire Worm, both of which are, you guessed it, Worm fics. I cannot recommend it enough, although the start can be rather tough to get through.

** Love the story but I decided a long time ago that I'd simply wait until it was completed before finishing it. The large gap between updates means I usually forget a lot of what happened (my memory isn't /amazing/, but its more to do with how much FF I read, lol).

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
