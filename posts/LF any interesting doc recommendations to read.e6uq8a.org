Recently I l've been cursed with the inability to find anything interesting to read. As such, I have come to reddit to seek a cure for my ailment.

I prefer not to read slash but If it takes a back seat to the plot and it is well written then I'm happy to read it.

I do like the pairings harry/daphne and harry/fleur

Preferably Hogwarts era but I'm happy to read other time frames.

What have you got for me?

Damn you autocorrect

** Some of these fics I've read quite a long time ago, so I remember that I enjoyed them, but I can't give too much of a description.

Linkffn(7038840) The sequel is WIP. What if Harry met Daphne Greengrass instead of Ron Weasley on platform 9 and 3/4?

Linkffn(12388283) This was a very dark and interesting read.

Linkffn(9469064) Sirius escaped from Azkaban early (Harry is 8 or 7), Draco has a very interesting sub-plot. I think the sequels are in the middle of 5th year atm.

Linkffn(11591125) Another au Harry, very much worth reading. The author is currently writing the 6th part.

Linkffn(2580283) The first in the sacrifices arc. It has everything (and over 2 million words!!!), Pureblood culture - check, Slytherin Harry - check, original wbwl plot - check! *It has slash as the main pairing (which I have a hard time reading), but it was just too interesting to put down.

Linkffn(3964606) The story of a witch in the USA, it was written before Illvermony was introduced. Very original, very well written, although the main character can be a bit annoying (but hey, she IS a 3-dimensional character!). Last I checked, the author was writing the 5th book (for quite a long time).

Linkffn(8629685) Oh, the Firebird trilogy, my love. Dark, dystopian au. Original and unique, wonderful plot, my description abilities cannot do it justice in any way. **When I say dark and dystopian, I mean DARK and DYSTOPIAN. Also, includes underage sex and rape (but it is required to further the plot and world creation).

I feel I've bombarded you, so I'll add just 3 more.

Linkffn(10070079), linkffn(9863146) and everything else written by this author. The first is a complete work based on the question; "what if Hermione was a math Wiz instead of a book worm?" The second is WIP in which Harry becomes an animagus at 5yo by mistake. I'll say something unpopular - I personally prefer "The Accidental Animagus". I love this author, everything they write is unique, well written, original, interesting and funny where it's meant to be.

Linkffn(11191235) WIP. A Slytherin Harry with a dash of wbwl, but it's like nothing you've read before. Highly recommended. ***Last I've read, they didn't reach 4th year yet.

Edit: The bot doesn't like me. I hope he will decide to make an appearance eventually...

*** Thank you!

I'll definitely have something to read over the weekend. After skimming through your summaries and the the fic's summaries, it was nice to see a definitive lack of manipulative Dumbledore (makes me want to tear my hair out in frustration.)

I've read most of the WBWL Slytherin Harry fic, and I've seen the Alexandra quick and firebird trilogy recommended before, but the rest are unknown to me.

They all look to be interesting reads so I can't wait to get started!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
