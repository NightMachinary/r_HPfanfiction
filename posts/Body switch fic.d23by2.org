I'm looking for fics in the category of another character or person waking up in someone else's body similar to linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly)


** Six Pomegranate Seeds

The author is clearly keen on the /snobby pure-blood, arranged-marriages, chaperones, weird-antediluvian-pureblood-etiquette, magical-Downton-Abbey-turned-up-to-eleven/, sort of thing. Hermione gets thrown into this milieu by a spot of time-travel and being put her in the body of a pure-blood girl who's one of the sacred twenty-eight Rosiers.

It's a genre that's /not/ to my taste. And Hermione/Cathal Rosier is a bit Mary Sue-ish. Yet I was surprised how long I kept with it, simply because it's so very well written.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

**** You make a great point.

When I was first thinking about that, the only thing I was focused on was counting Rs in the names, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger both have 3 Rs in them... (and 2 out of 3 Rs are in Harry's first name.)

Really the main question is why it isn't HG. The only thing I can think of is it might resemble the notation for a Hinny (H/G) fic.

But good point.

****** That would be an interesting crackfic...

Reminds me of the story that takes the idea of strong magic disrupting electricity and makes the inverse true, strong electromagnetic fields (though only the ones around 3 phase transformers) disrupt magic.

  Albus and Scorpius return from the past and continue their school year and everything slowly seems to go back to normal again. After some time however, Scorpius notices that there is something seriously wrong with his best friend. Meanwhile Albus wakes up in a place he doesn't know and inside a body that certainly doesn't belong to him.

  A new body. A new prophecy. And worst of all: a new war with an old enemy. As the Dark Lord, the Order, and the ministry form an unlikely alliance to protect Britain, Harry wonders at the difference between Voldemort and Tom Riddle, and why it is that the latter seems infinitely more dangerous than the former.
