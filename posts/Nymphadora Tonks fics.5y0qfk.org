**** Yeah. I like the whole getting to know each other and training bit, but everything from when they get back to the UK onward is fairly meh. Harry hiding his identity is generally only entertaining when there is a major reveal, and that story trivializes Voldemort in a pretty boring way.

#+begin_quote
  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

** linkffn(Willoway by GreenWood Elf) - Tonks is sent on an investigation as a graduation exercise. Story based on the movie 'the Wicker Man', so it's a suspense/horror thing. Great for the mood and action but incomplete, which for unresolved horror/mysteries is more frustrating than normal.

  The situation, Tonks surmised, was indeed bleak. She had no wand, no contact with the Ministry and no way off the remote Scottish island that held her prisoner. If things went according to plan, she'd be dead within the hour.

First off, this isn't helpful at all. Removed Harry, because they are unlikely to be centered on Tonks. Removed Lupin as well for similar reasons, as they only knew each other briefly, and to avoid angsty romances that may not be centered on her. Adjust if you want those.

linkffn(2337231) linkffn(3435122)

These two are centred on Tonks, and are complete, and decently written(grammar etc). I haven't finished them. Deconstruction is slightly more focused on Percy than on Tonks.
