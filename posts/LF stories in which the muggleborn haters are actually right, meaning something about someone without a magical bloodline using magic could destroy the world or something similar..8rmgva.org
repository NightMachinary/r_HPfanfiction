I am pretty sure I have read something like this ages ago. Is there a name for that type of fic? I tried to look, but "the good side is the bad side and the bad side is the good side" usually just means Dumbledore bashing.

Thank you!


** They're not /actually/ right, but there's a bit of justification surprisingly similar to your reasoning given in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). In that heavy AU, "ancient lore" is a big thing: knowledge of magic has been steadily deteriorating as time goes on, but pureblood family hoard secrets they pass on to their children (hence the belief that Muggle-borns are less "powerful", simply because they more rarely have the opportunity to /learn/ truly powerful rituals and spells).

Now the point is that along with this lore, the pure-bloods also pass on the wisdom to go along with it --- the caution, if you will --- because with powerful magic it's insanely easy to destroy the world or close enough. So Muggle-borns are seen as a danger by some of the pure-blood supremacists because "someday a fourteen-year-old Muggleborn who's never been told Transfiguration is dangerous to meddle with will try to transfigure antimatter, and then where will /we/ be?"

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
