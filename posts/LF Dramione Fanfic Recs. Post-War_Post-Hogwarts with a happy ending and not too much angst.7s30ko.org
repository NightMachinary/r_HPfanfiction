I have run out of Dramione and I desperately need more good ones. Lol. Heart is currently broken so I would appreciate happy endings. I don't mind Ron bashing and adult content is welcome but not ones where Draco or Hermione is cheating. I've reread Aurelian several times at this point and is one of my favorites. I've read many one shots too but would like a longer fic.


** Have you tried the dramioneasks tumblr? That place is a gold mine of recommendations with the tag cloud they have set up Currently reading The Request and it's good, also recommend The Deadline and Hunted

** Are there some authors you've already gone through? Cuz, man there are so many good ones.

I loved Rebuilding, by Colubrina, for example. Love Colubrina fics. That's one of my favorites. Didn't let the number of chapters scare you, they're short as she was trying to post daily, iirc. Also from her, Roofies, or In Vino, Veritas. And a more recently written one, The Wrong Strain. That last one is an interesting Veela fic. I'm normally not one to click on those, but... Colubrina. :D It's awesome.

Another favorite is redhead414's The Request. Lots of feels in that one. Family centric fic. It's All Uncharted is also excellent, but the sequel's beginning starts me off with heartache. Hahaha. So I tend to stick with The Request.

Galfoy's Thirty Times Lucky and The Malaria Visions were awesome. Um, those might be a little smutty iirc.

Bex-Chan's Love Me Twice.

Each of these authors have other brilliant stories. These are just a few of my favorites from them to start you out if you haven't read these yet. :)

Happy reading!

** An oldy but goody author is AnneMOliver. She's on FF.net. I always found her to be the queen of Dramione romcoms! They always have happy endings!

** OKAY. IT MIGHT BE MY FIRST POST BUT..... WHAT THE ROOM REQUIRES IS A really good book,,, and it really shows how hermione started to care for him during 6th grade and that Draco didn't want any help. It happens most of the time in the room. which i won't tell you where :) but if you're a real hp fan u might find it out. It has an emotional and happy ending It is a must if you are a hard core shipper because there will be a lot of tears rollling down. It is well written and you might like it because is quite long if you enjoy long chapters and numerous one of them in it.
