I'm considering writing a fanfic where Harry finds some independence but realizes that he is way out of his depths. He has to start paying taxes, assign a substitute in the Wizengamot, and then he ends up living at a house he buys with the money he has from sales of the basilisk part.

What I am looking for is a little advice on what to and what not to do. I know some people don't like him being in control of all his assets instantly, which doesn't make sense when he hasn't been taught about his responsibilities.

One thing that will be certain is that this is going to be a Harry Potter-x-Hermione Granger pairing.


** I would definitely suggest some sort of lawyer or financial adviser helping him. Maybe have him make some mistakes with his money by either overspending or investing in something stupid (he is 14/15) before he gets one and realizes he needs help? If you don't want him gaining all of his wealth maybe he's considered an adult but his parents will has an age stipulation that gives him a percentage each year?

*** That's exactly what I mean.

Though they have an expectation that he would grow up used to money with Sirius and decided to give him a bigger purse than most children each year. In one year, without overspending, James would have around 800 galleons worth of stuff he actually used, though most would be recreational stuff. So maybe about 850-1,000 gp as I thought, but it depends on how much a rich muggle would spend in the same time. Though part of James' money went toward investments.

Harry finding out such decides to invest a little and puts about 1,400 galleons more into the weasley wizarding wheezes to support his friends and has them try to write an agreement of how much they will send to him each month. Sort of like in Batman when Wayne Company sold 70% to his actual person so 70% of all income might go to him or something. I forget what it is called but I think it is something like an investors contract. So that would be why Harry decides to hire a lawyer combined with the twins suggesting it.

In addition, I plan on having him think of a creative way to keep money flowing into his trust vault, which is now same type of vault his father had. (Father was money waster later in life [donated most to the war] and so Fleamont [Harry's grandad] decides to cut him away from the family wealth and give to harry at either Lily's approval or age 21.

My options for extra money are as follows...

1. Sell the Basilisk Skins and the corpse (likely to be many skins with how old it is and the majority of the intact skins should be large.)
2. Start a house elf production line (Elves are probably really creative when let loose with supplies. So maybe having a group making high quality potions after studying the Potter Family records. or some similar books, though maybe make protective items for the wizards and witches and other things for Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes.)
3. Make a cookbook to talk about how he cooks the muggle way. Maybe have a house elf take pictures while he has a dictaquill write down any explanations that he is giving while cooking. Or write other books about himself.
4. Sell extra things in the Potter Vaults to the goblins for an agreed upon amount. Most of it may be that of his ancestors, but for all he knows it might just have historic value and he might hire the goblins to sell it to the correct people. However, stipulations and all that says 40% to Harry's Vault, 40% to Potter Vault and 20% to Goblins.

** Remember that this means he's extremely at risk, Voldemort is back and there's no Blood protection to keep him out.

**** The protection on Privet drive still worked, they couldn't attack Harry there until he turned 17

***** Did anybody actually test it? Or is it just a self-fulfilling expectation (they were not attacked, because Voldemort believed he couldn't attack)?
