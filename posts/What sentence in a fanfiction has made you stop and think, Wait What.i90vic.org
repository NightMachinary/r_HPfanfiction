"Magic itself has aknowledged my claim and made Severus Tobias Snape a slave of House Potter"

** Theoretically feasible...

Harry is famous. If Harry empties his vault, that strongly implies that he does not trust the goblins with his money.\\
If The-Boy-Who-Lived cannot trust the Goblins, then there must be a reason, meaning that no-one else can trust Goblins, causing a run on the bank and vaults being emptied/closed left, right and center.\\
Word of the bank-rush would spread overseas, leading people to assume that the Brits must have discovered something, therefore following suit is the correct thing to do.

Cue multiple bank-rushes, each reinforcing the belief that getting the money away from the goblins is the only sane thing to do. With everyone hoarding their own money, retail etc would plummet and... boom! Worldwide depression.

***** Well, it's called a /BANK,/ it does money exchange and employs curse breakers to retrieve artifacts, they are also crafters. The exchange alone makes it more than a deposit box.

About inheritance tests, how else are people gonna have Harry find out about his ancestors or introduce him to other stuff? He's practically never told shit in the books. Most people only know one side of the family, and very little at that.

I think people go: Gringotts is a Bank. Banks need to validate identity. Magic can validate identities. We are shown Wills in the books. There must be some way to validate that or people would get rich with polyjuice. Blood Tests. Blood can lead to genealogy. Old Families. Finding out your family tree is a bit different than you thought.

Wizards don't trust wizards. Evil wizards would fake and/or fumble tests to get money. Need someone neutral. Goblins seem to only care about money. Goblins are neutral. Old Magical race, secret knowledge

It`s a very easy and even logical conclusion. YES, it`s not supported by canon, but lots of of logical things aren't because JKR couldn't bother with those. And then who cares, it's fanfiction. As long as it's well written...

"Oh, but wizards don't trust goblins!" True, yet, the most racist of families still leave all their gold with them. The whole family was arrested, but the Ministry never seized their assets, meaning maybe they simply can`t.

There's a reason why and that's there's nothing to claim.

***** The ancient Greeks used their temples as depositories for their treasure. Combined with record keeping and financial transactions, its one of the earliest forms of banking that we know of. They dealt with deposits, currency exchange, and validation of coins, and loans.

That level of sophistication could be Gringotts from what we know. They have guarded vaults filled with treasure, they exchange muggle currency for goblin coins, they mint Galleons and can tell them apart from Leprechaun gold, and they finance treasure hunting/relic expeditions.

Fanon often has Harry talking to bankers that are making cutting edge Wall Street bets and always coming out on top, but they're a lot less sophisticated and a lot more .... well, goblin! in canon, I think.

****** In anything I write involving goblins they tend to be old fashioned banks not investors. You want them to invest you come to them with one hell of a plan and a willingness to hand over a fair bit of shares or collateral.

They are not out buying shares of stuff. So when anyone deals with that side it's usually for the extra services they offer.

Banks were great information services back in the day if you had the money to afford them.

So it's usually having them act as cut outs or introductions more than anything.

For wealthy characters they offer to sell any shares they own as a bank. If they can make a decent profit from those shares, and get the interest/return of their initial investment. Well that's a win.

**** I would agree. It seems that witches and wizards store their gold their because it's safer than keeping at home. I would think that there is some level of investment since goblins accept to exchange pounds for gold (as in the case of the Grangers) and also the richer account holders got the highly secure vaults (although those might be assigned on a fee basis)

Speaking of which, Harry might have been richer than the Weasleys, but at least until Sirius makes him his heir, the Potters were nothing compared to the Lestranges or the Malfoy since his vault doesn't even get a dragon.
