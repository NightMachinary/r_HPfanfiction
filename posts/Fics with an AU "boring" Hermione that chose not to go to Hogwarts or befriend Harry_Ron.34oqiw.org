A Black Comedy has a cool bit with a boring Hermione, but I want to see a bit more. I read another fic where Hermione was a wizard hunter, can't remember the name, Harry had come from an alternate universe.

Ideally interacting with people who know Canon Hermione, or with canon Hermione herself.

** I've read the one you're talking about, can't recall the name atm tho. Could have been one of the 'another universe' set born out of Silverfawkes' fic?

Edit: GDI... now i'm rereading the whole set. Curse you and your sudden but inev... meh, this is my own brains fault.

There's one where Harry is a squib and never goes to Hogwarts. He meets a Hermione who withdrew from Hogwarts after the Troll nearly killed her. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4771879/1/A-Squib-Worth][A Squib Worth]]
