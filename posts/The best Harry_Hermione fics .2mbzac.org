So many Harmony-centric stories fail so bad on these counts (and casual sexism, Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-FlyingMonkeys-OtherTitlesBecauseWhyNot, and so on) that I gave up on that pairing unless I get repeated recommendations from trusted sources.

Edit: oh, the question! So, could you make a list without those things? Or is that list free of these?

**** Second [[/u/flame7926]]'s rec for Unlike a Sister - it's free of all these issues. It's actually technically canon-compliant (takes place after the epilogue) too. I don't read H/Hr at all, but I saw this one rec'd here and loved it. Thought the author did a very good job of realistic relationship development with well-rounded, true-to-canon characters.

Fair warning: it's not finished yet!

I think Survivor is also free of everything you mentioned, although it's not exactly a happy romance...but it's very moving.

***** I dislike Survivor. While in the minority here, I will never get the melodramatic "my life is over because my high school sweetheart died". If they were decades together, that's different. It's more of a stretch than Snape still loving Lily - even in that case, some people are survivors and just keep going. Someone as resilient as Harry would never completely break like that. He might be broken, but he'd choose the hard path and live for her rather than die.

Going on a tangent: I'm a firm believer that Snape got over any romantic feelings he had for Lily prior to Harry entering Hogwarts. She may have been his best formative memory and the reason he dedicated himself to bringing Voldemort down, but anything else would just cheapen it, be unrealistic, and makes Dumbledore seem incredibly cruel. I think it's also a better explanation for canon (DH specifically).

A first love can be a great love. But life doesn't end when it does, even though you might never experience the naive wonder of it ever again. Preaching anything else just reeks of overly romanticized melodrama. Call it what it is: angst for the sake of it. Shakespeare was clever enough to avoid this trap in Romeo&Juliet by making the suicide a reaction to the shock of seeing the loved one dead instead of running away with them... and he basically set the modern cliche for the larger than life romance in that play.

tl;dr: I find Survivor over the top, and not in the awesome self-aware way.

****** I agree with you that it's a bit over the top; I liked Survivor but didn't love it. But I also felt that the characters had undergone a different arc in Survivor than in canon - like [[/u/Awesomeguyandbob]] said, Survivor is trying to tell a different story. While I agree that Harry in canon is not the kind of person who would commit suicide, I can easily envision a slightly darker version of Harry with different life experiences (and who reacted differently to his earlier life experiences, ie abuse and neglect, than in canon) who would be the person that he is in Survivor.

I'm willing to forgive deviations from JKR's canon characterizations if (a) they are not too aggressively different and (b) the story is well-written. I think Survivor is well-written and the characters are believably possible. For me, this story is more about the beauty in the description of their breakdown than about it being a faithful portrayal of how canonHarry would have reacted.

Anyhow, agree with you that it's a bit over the top - it's not my favorite fic of all or anything, but it was just one off the list that met your basic criteria above :)

******* If I'm looking for tragedy or angst, Slytherin characters tend to fit the bill far better. Lets get this out of the way: Suicide is anathema to Gryffindor ideals. It's the easy (and from a Gryffindor perspective cowardly) way out. It's a self-centered action at its core, with blatant disregard to others. I could see Cho or Draco in certain circumstances be pushed to it, but never Harry - he had one year where he was kinda angsty in the books, which is quite subdued for a teen.

I think the problem is that in fan fiction people are influenced by the movies a bit more than they care to admit... the direction which they took Harry in the movies is far less emotionally tough than in the books. The shining example for me was the "how dare you" speech, which in the books was Harry being a total badass, and in the movies borderline emo.

******** I think those are all fair criticisms - it just doesn't bother me. Call it AU, then? But I'm perfectly happy with a fic that flips the script and takes some liberty with the characters, if it's well-done. And I think Harry can easily be re-portrayed as darker than he was in canon. I'm basically always looking for tragedy / angst and willing to accept some lenient interpretations of the characters to get there :)

I also just don't think that the fact that suicide is anathema to Gryffindor ideals means that a Gryffindor would never commit suicide. Being put in Gryffindor says something about the qualities you value most, but that doesn't mean you're brave or loyal all the time - eg Pettigrew... (as a total aside, you seem to have thought a lot about characters' motivations and backstory - have you happened to come across any good fics on the dynamics behind Pettigrew's betrayal?)

At any rate, I only suggested Survivor because I thought it avoided the cliches in your original post. Not meant as an 'omg this is the best story ever' endorsement :)

****** Think of it this way though; this isn't just a scenario of losing your first love. This is Harry losing /Hermione/: the only person who has stuck with him since the very beginning, his best friend, and now fiancé. Take a look at how he completely falls apart when she gets hit at the department of mysteries. Add on to that the fact that, in Survivor, she's his lover and main source of companionship and comfort. To any other person, the reaction may be melodramatic, but to orphan and neglected child Harry Potter, I think it works perfectly.

******* Reducing Harry to a neglected child is wrong - he has nearly none of the symptoms of heavy neglect or abuse in canon. The point of Harry is that he is The Boy Who Lived, even if he hated that fact and would never admit it; he /can't/ die. This isn't because of prophecy or how he was educated. It is because that is who he really is. He finally became the Boy Who Lived strictly on his own merits in DH. He had help, but it was him that took the final step.

His strength is in his will to carry on no matter the hardship, no matter how much the world is against him. It isn't his brains, skills, heritage, or charisma that set him apart. It is the will to do what needs to be done whatever the cost without breaking. He perhaps isn't unique in that way^{1,} but suicide doesn't fit that mold at all... even if he would want it, just doing it goes against that nature.

^{[1]} A case can be made for Snape also fitting that mold. Snape gave up his lifelong mission of protecting Harry for Lily's sake in order to bring down Voldemort, despite that he had the easy out of telling Voldemort "Dumbledore told me that as long as Harry lives you are immortal" - in essence, giving up his soul more completely than when he killed Dumbledore. He was hinted as neglected and raised in poverty, and in canon only has two and a half friends in all his years (Lily, Charity, and Dumbledore who deserves half - because we have no evidence of him being friendly towards Snape, yet they were at least somewhat close). He outlived them all because he had the same basic drive that Harry does. In this context - Harry would have become another Snape before he'd kill himself.

******** I'm not saying the story /reduces/ him to a neglected child; he is clearly very much more than that. It is just a character trait that helps explain the reaction he had in this story. Harry lets very few people get close to him in canon, and no one to the level that he does with Hermione in Survivor.

Also, being the Boy Who Lived doesn't restrict him from being human. I understand that you're trying to say that him being the archetype of the resilient hero makes his suicide seem out of character, and I can see why you'd think that. But you also have to realize that that archetype doesn't work in the story that Survivor is trying to tell. You're right in saying that in story Rowling was telling to tell, Harry couldn't have killed himself, because it goes against the theme of persistence in the face of adversity. You can't neglect /character/ though. The circumstances that he goes through in Survivor lead to his utter resignation, and that's what makes it a tragedy. I'm not saying that it was the right choice, but it almost makes sense when you consider how much Hermione means to him. This Harry is an empty person with absolutely nothing to keep him going--in his perspective. The tragedy of the story /is/ that Hermione's death broke him. That's what makes it so hard to read. Ron even makes a comment similar to what you said about it: that Harry shouldn't be doing this. In canon, we've never seen him face such an all-consuming soul-crushing loss. Sirius and Dumbledore are the closest, but not up to the level in this story.

You're also forgetting that Harry did all that he needed to do in the story. It's not like he left the world to burn under the reign of Voldemort. He died very early in the story. In fact, Harry only does the deed /after/ he has finished off Bellatrix and Lucius.

********* All right, accepting all the circumstances up to his suicide as being absolutely the most soul-crushing possible, /and/ that he wasn't canon-Harry... he wasn't isolated. Hermione wasn't all his world. He still had a surrogate family that did support him. And Hermione wouldn't have wanted him to do that.

In light of all that, I think it's over the top. I also think that DAYD tries too hard to be grim and dark and ends up over the top as well. So, obviously, my opinion is far from the norm in HP fandom.

***** One of the first fics I read HPMOR when its last chapter was the troll scene. After having flung my laptop across the couch... Harry Crow was the next fix I read and I found it very cathartic.

It had a similar lack of glaring typos, and the sentences read like english rather than pidgin. I would only later discover that this wasn't the norm in all fan fictions /sigh/

That said... after reading a /lot/ more. I noticed that Crow had been marked as complete, and reread it before reading the last 5-6 chapters... It was... too easy? I felt like Harry was never in any danger of not just winning but blowing his competition out of the water. Certainly a lot of the concepts were interesting... but it kind of became the example in my mind of what happens when you scale up Harry's abilities without adjusting Dumbledore's or Voldemort's to match. I feel like this is a common issue, but Harry Crow happened to be the first fic that I had both read early on and reread later enough to notice.

**** I like how it depicts a strong and powerful harry. After all, it was a nice break from the "harry must struggle and overcome his ineptitude." If that was the only piece of ffn, I wouldn't recommend it, but it is novel and an enjoyable read. Why don't you like it?

And saying low quality is merely matter of opinion. I thought it was decent. I don't completely follow how you are degrading it so much based upon your knowledge and argument of it....
