So, i really have problems choosing who should be the new gen teachers. The list I've got is here: The Headmaster - ( insert name here)" Transfiguration: Astronomy: Flying: Care of magical creatures: Divination: History of Magic: Arithmancy:


** Why are Sinistra, Hooch, and Vector gone/replaced? Did Binns move on (otherwise he'd still be teaching)?

Also, depending on if you're doing new gen or /next/ generation, Minerva was headmistress until at least 2008 according to the Wiki. The new headmaster is likely to be someone who had extensive teaching experience, so not someone younger than 50 most likely.

*** I feel like Hooch was way too old to teach flying anymore. Those other ones just felt so blank. I was thinking about making the Headmaster someone who has not been mentioned in the books or the movies but i don't really know. And by new gen i mean like harry's kids etc. etc.

**** That's fair about Hooch, at least with how old she looks in the movies (I don't recall her canon character description).

Original character headmaster could certainly be a fun way to do it. Why not take a look through a list of Potter surnames and choose an older sibling/cousin/aunt for one or two of the professor spots? That's kinda what Rowling did with Amelia/Susan Bones. Could pull in some older era names, like McKinnon, MacDonald, Cresswell.

** Headmaster: Flitwick would interesting

Transfiguration: Andromeda Tonks? Maybe she wants something to do now that Teddy's grown up.

Astronomy: Sinistra, if not, maybe some interesting OC for some extra intrigue. A Lestrange, or Dolohov, or someone. Or a minor character, like Gemma Farley (Slytherin)

Care: Rolf Scamander

Divination: Lavender Brown/Parvati Patil (I think Lavender would be more interesting in this case since she's been mutilated by a werewolf)

History of Magic: Sanguini (vampire would know a lot, having lived through it. also +1 for magical being)

Arithmancy: If not Vector, Bill Weasley maybe? He's kinda old now, maybe he doesn't want to live such a 'glamorous' life as a curse-breaker.
