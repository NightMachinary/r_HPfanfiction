** In the spirit of this post having a point, rec me some fics where Draco behaves like canon Draco. But he either gets his just desserts or has an actual redemption arc (which for God's sake does NOT mean you hook him up with Hermione; in fact it probably means he dies); in canon his character is in such a nebulous state at the end. I don't know if I'm supposed to be angry he didn't die or feel like he redeemed himself. It doesn't feel like either.

*** Sorry, of the two good Draco redemptions that spring to mind, one starts with him slightly OOC and goes from there, and the other starts his redemption arc pre-Hogwarts, so he never really acts like canon (although his older brother tends to fill that role). Both are great stories, but not quite what you asked for.

***** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has a decent Draco redemption arc, overshadowed by a /great/ Snape redemption.

linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) has Draco with an older brother. So, their father decides that Draco is a spare, and puts him through behavioral conditioning to make him suited to Gryffindor, in order to hedge his bets and get a foot in the door if Harry turns out to be important. And he doesn't tell Draco he's doing it.

*** Precisely because it didn't feel like either, it makes for such a good starting point for fanfictions. You can take Draco in that nebulous state and go anywhere with him in a fanfiction. There's quite a bit of creative freedom there, while other characters are more restricted by canon.

I like to read fanfictions about Draco because he's a gray character that has some very deep flaws and is in a lot of trouble. I don't mind him being paired up with someone if it's done well, but I'd just as well read genfic about him.

** Snape is the same.

Book Snape is an ugly piece of shit. Hooked nose, greasy hair, ugly face, and a seriously messed up, creepy obsession on Lily, et cetera.

The late Alan Rickman was a decent-looking guy. He's the primary reason why, uh, "Snape Wives" are a thing. If they had made Mr. Rickman look like Book Snape more accurately, let's just say the amount of slash and unconventional pairings, like Snape/Hermione, would be a tiny minority compared to what they are now.

And speaking of the lovely Miss. Granger? She's a similar case.

Hermione is supposed to be an (initially) buck-toothed "Plain Jane" with unmanageable hair that slowly grew into being a pretty woman (after she basically dolls herself up a bit).

The rabid Hermione/Harry shipping's underlying motivations can be excused/understood a little because of JKR's initial plan of their hooking up eventually, the terribly shoe-horned Ginny romance, and the actual friendship/relationship they had over the course of the series (she's a primary protagonist, after all) compared to other ships, though.

Emma Watson, when she was young, initially fit the role ideally. She looked like a plain, average kid -- just like Hermione. They even tried the buck-teeth prosthetic with her, though it was canned due to impracticality.

And then puberty and the time lapse between filming hit like a freight train, and eventually Hermione had a beautiful girl/woman (yes, Emma Watson is goddamn attractive physically), years older than her character (DHp2 had her at 21 playing a 17 year old, for example), playing her in the films.

That no doubt dumped petrol on the Harry/Hermione fire for fan-fic writers, too.

Just to add an additional reason, there isn't really any other character that fits her archetype (perhaps because she was a primary protagonist, thus not having any background characters trod similar ground.)

Although there is supposed to be an entire house that exemplifies this, there is really no other character that really represents thirst for knowledge. The Ravenclaws we do get tend to be defined by other primary qualities.

They weren't really given a chance to have any qualities like that shown to the readers. Same could be said for the Slytherins, outside of the antagonists being mostly childish dicks (though, Malfoy was a bit cunning in the last two books), and the Hufflepuffs, who acted like they did in canon for understandable, though flawed, reasonings (angry at Harry for the Goblet thing, scared at Harry because they thought he was the Heir and had it out for one of their number, et cetera, though I suppose the latter did exemplify their 'loyalty to each other' thing).

  The rabid Hermione/Harry shipping's underlying motivations
#+end_quote

Not to mention that a Ron/Hermione relationship would be difficult at best, they're a match made in Hell.

I'm at a loss to find anything they have in common, except Harry as a friend. He belittles her with all his "mental" comments, he's lazy while she's studious, he's obsessed with Quidditch while she only cares about it because Harry plays it. I know that opposites attract, but Ron/Hermione is beyond believable.

My major difficulties with the canon pairings is that Ron/Hermione can't possibly work, and with Harry/Ginny is that Ginny is at best distant fangirl. She's mostly not there, and then suddenly she's Harry's main love interest. The "chest monster" or whatever Harry feels isn't love, it's raw jealousy.

It doesn't have to be Harry/Hermione, it just has to be something that's /not/ Ron/Hermione.

**** JKR based the main love interests on her own life experiences, IIRC (correct me if I'm wrong?).

Ron and Hermione were her first marriage that actually succeeded (instead of divorcing), and Harry/Ginny was meant to represent her "happily ever after" with her current hubby.

Only...

1. The Harry/Ginny romance was terribly-written and shoe-horned.
2. Ron/Hermione was terribly-written, even though she tried to lay subtle seeds of it in the early books (like Ron blowing up at the Yule Ball) and her actively trying to improve on it in the films.
3. The series organically outgrew her overall outline, and I think she panicked a bit near the end (HBP onward), and instead of changing things, she tried to force it back on track. This is one of the big no-nos in fiction-writing, and as a result... yeah.
4. The movies pushed Harry and Hermione, partly because the writers/directors both shipped the two and wanted to give Emma Watson more screen prominence.

Still, JKR, years after DH, admitted she was mistaken to go with the canon ships, but it's too late now (unless she writes another book exploring parallel timelines and different outcomes, but that's unlikely).

(I mean I pretty much avoid anything that says Joffrey pairings because they are almost always abuse,!fics, you sickos, but they do exist).

Interestingly, one of the better ASoIaF fics I read was the time loop Joffrey one, where he kept reliving his death until he grew as a person/character. Sadily that fic eventually went off the rails into weird military unit stuff then space aliens, but before that it was really good, especially the Joffery/Tirion interactions.

Sadily, if there is a good Draco redemption fic out there, I haven't read it as it is drowned in the shitty whitewashing of the character. They don't usually leave him as much of a evil got as he was in canon. I think I recall one he was reborn as a girl where he was still his scummy self before, but the author had him be redeemed/grow offscreen before his death.

***** Have read the books but so long ago I've conflated the two in my head. From memory the show definitely upped the sadism side of Joffrey, but he was still an irredeemable little psycho even in the books alone.

Draco took glee in the thought of torture before he'd ever witnessed it, and certainly can't imagine him inflicting it after he understood the reality of it. I work with teenage boys. They want to shoot and kill and torture everyone who does anything they don't like, and relish in it. But in 99.9% of cases it's because they don't have the maturity to grasp what torturing and murdering actually is in real life.

Rich/aristocrat, dark past as a result of affiliation with Death Eaters, possible redemption by end of series, and I can see where the Draco in leather pants would come into play. Only bad boy trope he's missing is the badass one in canon, he's not shown as an alpha male who flexes his power.

Canon Malfoy is an annoying brat but canon Malfoy is basically an OC that can be anything you want. A lot of people really like the rival dynamic and the whole “different House forbidden romance”. And since Slytherin!Harry stories are popular it makes sense that Draco ships are popular especially within slash.

The same thing can also be said about Draco/Hermione ships as well

** Fandom in general has a bit of an obsession with attractive "bad boy" characters and pairing them with the main character. Cold take but I'm pretty sure it's because a lot of teenage girls use the main character as a self insert/ like the idea of being courted by a hot bad boy.

My issue with this is that so many fanfic authors just ignore all the bad things that make them a "bad boy". Like you said Draco is a cowardly, racist douche bag through much of the books who has a somewhat sympathetic upbringing to explain this but fanfic authors like either ignoring all the shitty things he did or wave it off as "poor misunderstood Draco". If only he could get a nice muggle born girl like Hermione to explain to him why being a bigoted piece of shit is bad in a nice gentle way because she's desperately in love with him. Bleargh.

Not to do with HP fandom but the BNHA fandom suffers from something very similar with the character of Bakugo Katsuki. And to be fair to fanfiction authors the actual Mangaka ignores a lot of the issues he first presented with Bakugo's character (he was an arrogant child like Draco who was raised to believe he was superior to others BC he had a strong quirk, as opposed to the main character Deku who was quirkless. Because of this Bakugo was a massive bully to Deku and an overall cunt but it's just...glossed over later on. Bakugo faces no repercussions despite multiple events of abuse/bullying and he never even loses like Draco does to have a moment of realisation that what he did as a child was wrong.) Because of all this Bakugo is loved very similarly to Draco in the HP fandom and he often gets paired with the main character Deku or Uraraka in much the same way Draco gets shipped with Harry and Hermione. So yeah I think it's just fandom being comprised of a large percentage of teenage girls who love the misunderstood bad boy trope, especially when they've been protracted by attractive actors or are just handsome in the source material.

*** I just started looking at BNHA stuff and one of my favorite ships to sort by is Bakugo/Consequences or Karma. Relative to Draco though, he is better at the start compared to Bakugo, he's insulting and spouts threats, but nothing truly actionable until maybe book 4 telling Hermione she might get caught up by the DE's at the world cup. Bakugo at the start of the story is using his quirk to hurt people and throws out threats that he very much intends to follow through on.

Bakugo's situation can then lead to very satisfying consequences, but usually it seems to be dealt with quickly. That's fine, there seems to be legal president to deal with him in pleasing ways. Starting a fic with the canon beginning makes it a bit harder for a natural and realistic redemption to occur without taking him away for some jail time(I also just favor him getting stomped on and then if needed, Deku getting help in seeing Bakugo for the asshole he is). With Draco, its the opposite until book 6. Draco while an unrepentant asshole, has plenty of time for a slow intervention to change his views, which I think lends itself for SI's to help change their bad boy crush. By the time book 6 with him joining a terrorist organization and plotting murder, he can be dealt with swiftly; maybe book 5 if he did questionable things while part of the inquisitorial squad.

**** I 100% agree with you, and admittedly draco is one of my least favourite characters so I avoid fics with him as a central focus so I may be wrong here, but don't a large amount of Draco fics occur post canon? I have no issue with Draco being redeemed pre book 6 but imo once he actively starts making attempts on Dumbledore's life and in the process almost kills Katie he's gone too far. He's not past redemption but it's considerably harder for me to empathise with him without him facing serious consequences, consequences he never had to face in canon which adds to my distaste towards his character.

Do you have any recs for Bakugo/consequences BC on ao3 there are depressingly few fics with that tag, something like only 50 or so. I really dislike how in canon Bakugo and Endeavour are both given a free pass for their shitty past behaviour, as if them wishing to be better without truly apolosing to this victims or making ammends/ facing any consequences makes their previous actions ok. it's really gross to read because it's almost victim blaming in the way it excuses their abusers. Deku holds Bakugo as his "image of victory" so it's ok that Bakugo bullied and belittled him for years with no consequences. Endeavour used his wife as a breeding factory for his fucked up eugenics experiment but it's ok now BC he said that "he wants to be a hero shouto can be proud of". Get the fuck outta here with this pussy ass redemption. They aren't getting redeemed, their crappy behaviour is being washed away and their victims suffering is made to be lesser than their personal epiphany.

So yeahhhhh I have issues with BNHA and unlike HP fandom where Draco seems to be somewhat evenly loved/hated everyone else seems to love Bakugo and while that's fine I want him to face some serious consequences and actually acknowledge what he did as an adolescent was wrong. If u have any recs I would love them.

** Part of me thinks that the reason fans (esp. female fans) are drawn to "bad boy" characters within their fandom is because there are so many people who purposefully write bad boy characters as charming.

I'm reminded of Zuko from A:TLA. Genuinely a dick at first, though most of that was related to being the scapegoat child of a narcissistic, abusive asshole. (Not a professional diagnosis, just a personality descriptor.) But the writers had 1) always planned a redemption arc for him, so we are consistently given little moments where we are shown that he isn't what he seems; 2) many of us remember Rufio from Hook with great fondness, and 3) besides redemption arc moments, Zukois s also more relatable than the true villains of A:TLA. He's awkward and shy and impatient. Since Zuko does, in the end, join the good guys, it's understandable that people are rooting for him.

I think we're optimistic, as human beings; and I'd like to think most fans of Draco wanted him to be... well, Zuko. It's possible to write Draco like this if you remove him from his canon bad influences very early on in his development, but that's an AU type that very few people have done well. The Dangerverse manages it, but there are a host of other factors involved as well in that one. (I'd be interested in other fics that remove Draco from his racist upbringing early on, if any of you have them. 👀)

My conclusion in this observation is that it's possible to take a bad boy character and redeem him without changing his fundamental personality; but I agree with you that the majority of ficwriters do it very poorly. If you want to do it well, watch A:TLA. Also because it's the best TV show ever written, but that's besuee the point.

** Like others have noted, Draco was a popular ship well before Tom Felton was of the age to be considered attractive non-pedophilically and even before the movies came out. Of course, Tom Felton being attractive certainly doesn't help later on. Draco is enough of a "bad" boy but isn't downright evil like Joffrey, so he can be redeemed. Though the fact that Draco in Leather Pants started at about GoF or a bit before when he was just mostly a sniveling coward without any of the cool bad boy traits yet astounds me that fandom decided to dream up everything about him.

For an actor that really carried a character though, that would have to be Alan Rickman. Snape in the books really isn't redeemable until more like book 5, he could be redeemable but he's such an asshole throughout with not much backstory, so you don't want to redeem him. But then Rickman steps in and he's handsome and really sells Snape as a cool character, and the rest is fandom history.

I'm just a sucker for bad characters because I like writing and reading redemption arcs. Sue me.

And yes, it's unrealistic for Draco to get a redemption arc while still at Hogwarts (not that that should stop anyone from writing it if they want to) but considering he's 17-18 when the books end - a /kid/ - and he's just gone through a pretty traumatic war, imagining him getting a redemption arc after that isn't really all that outlandish.

** Agree with you on the fact he's an atrocious person and the only possible redemption (maybe) comes from his being so young that he didn't know better.

That being said, my favourite stories are about shoving together two characters who don't fit in canon and seeing what happens. Unfortunately, most stories based on these sorts of pairings (I.e Dramione, since I've read a lot) make them attracted to each other “for some reason she didn't understand” from chapter 1 and then they're fucking and basking in each other's love by chapter 6. Which like, if that's your thing then go for it, but I think it should be acknowledged that that's ooc, wildly implausible, and potentially unhealthy.

I wish more authors wrote gritty stories. Give me redemptions that are long and excruciating. Or maybe they aren't redeemed at all, and corrupt the “good” character until they're just as bad. Maybe they meet somewhere in the middle. I don't even care if it's explicitly romantic (I'm really not into fluff---I have a whole rant about how shipping isn't necessarily about romance but that's another issue entirely.)

These kinds of stories are difficult to write, though, and aren't what a lot of people are looking for. I'm trying to write one and it's 40-50k before they even think of each other even remotely romantically. Hope there are people willing stick around that long when I finally post it D:

Seeing as I sent you my first ever fic this is my latest. Was my go at a Draco redemption arc. Not super happy with the first two chapters or so in retrospect but overall I don't think I gave him too much of an easy time. No real ships in this one either.

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy accepted Dumbledore's offer of help at the top of the Astronomy Tower too late to prevent what he had started. Given shelter with his Mother's sister he finds himself facing up to the true nature of the cause he once pledged himself to. As the war worsens he is forced to confront his worst fears and decide what kind of Wizard he wants to be.

** I think I made a mistake in going on a tangent about attractiveness. Ultimately, my main point is that Draco should not be romanticized and I wish the majority of the fandom shared this view. (And they don't, no matter how much of a cold take this is: Draco is the 3rd most tagged character in FFnet, and the top-rated story is a Dramione fic; on AO3 ALL the stories at the top are Harry/Draco slash.)

*** I get your point but other than Ron what other male characters with the same age as Harry and Hermione do we get as much screen time? Neville?

If JKR had given another Slytherin like Blaise or Nott as much screen time as Draco I swear the number of ships involving them would be insane.

I just don't get this whole “canon Draco is an ass writers shouldn't write about him” thing

It's fanfiction. Most ships involving Draco will alter his background or personality to make him more palatable. It might not fit canon but within that fanfiction's universe the pairing makes sense

Draco the character is just a very convenient template that is used.

Of course I do understand that it can be annoying when people mistake fanon Draco with canon Draco

** I think it has more to do with the fanon than anything. Snape in the movie was not a good looking man (unlike the actor that played him) and while he was trying to protect Harry, he was still a very cruel and despicable man, then there was Voldemort and his noseless self. Yet, I have seen a lot of fics that ship both of these people.
