** - AO3 is now serious competition to FFN. I find it superior to FFN, and there's a separate culture developing there that's way more engaging. AO3 caters toward authors, while FFN caters toward readers.

- Most of the fanfic hosts have consolidated to two or three sites, when there were once hundreds of geocities communities dedicated to individual characters and ships. There are a lot of good fics that have been lost in the void in recent years, RIP.

- Readerbase is now aging up. There are fewer readers than in the heydey of 2002-2007, but the average age of each reader is more mature, resulting in a gradual shift in story themes, complexity, and explicit content, if you're into that. There are way fewer shitty OC Mary Sue fics than there used to be, and the ones that exist are often deliberate parodies of classics like "My Immortal".

- Fanfic authors and readers are used to throwing canon to the wind, but in the last 2-3 years, respect for JKR herself has been tossed aside. Her fall from grace is a weird trainwreck to look back on in retrospect.

- Certain trends have fallen out of favor due to the clarification of laws regarding copyright infringement. No more elaborate disclaimers, no more songfics, but now people can attach shitty photoshopped cover images to their FFN fics.

**** I really liked linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox). It is certainly not a songfic in the proper meaning of the word, but I really like it introduced some arts to the wizarding world (also, there is a bit of music in linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot)). I remember my teenage years (and I am certain not the only one in this regard) were completely saturated in music (I liked “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” for this), and wizarding world feels empty without anything. Also, linkao3(2146464) (and yes, I dislike Dramione most from all straight ships).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  “I can't tell anyone”, he repeated over and over again.Hermione helplessly stroked his back a couple of times.“Then don't”, she said.He stared at her with a bewildered expression.“Don't say anything”, she repeated. “Just play. I will stay and listen, if you want me to.”This is a bit of an AU. I was always a bit disappointed by the almost complete lack of music in the Harry Potter books. In my world, music is such an important thing... so I decided I would deviate from canon and make this a possible thing. I'm trying to stay as close to the original as possible though. It's mostly set in the sixth year and it's going to be pretty short. I'm planning on about 6 chapters total.

I can't argue, but it's odd, isn't it? I think it's a combination of factors, but boiling down to: it feels like she hasn't stayed true to her own world. Ron the Death Eater may have been an interesting concept to explore in a fanfic, but making Cedric the Death Eater /canon/ - yeah, no. Likewise the Fantastic Beasts movies would make great fanfics, but they are terrible canon. And so on, with many other examples of things that, while they might not strictly contradict the text of the original seven books, are clearly at odds with it, like poo-vanishing.

This. I hate FFN cover image, most of them are awful and add nothing to the story. Some story in AO3 even add some awful banner that makes reading AO3 on mobile broken. I think author should use their time to create a better summary than wasting time creating those awful cover images. On the other hand, I can see that they're new at graphic design and they're putting a lot of time on those image. I really don't want to be that person who doesn't appreciate their effort.

To be fair, there are some good ones I see here and there.

But please, if you're one of those authors; just spent your time creating a good summary, edit your new chapter, or even watch a youtube video on graphic design instead.

**** Oh gosh, where do I start?

For starters, I never had a blog dedicated to my own fanfics or fanfiction in general. Nothing happened to me on Tumblr for that reason, but I did feel the results in the comment section on FFN. I write about Snape, which we all know is a super controversial character in the HP universe. There are a lot of people out there who don't like Snape, and I get why. He's mean, a bully, and he spends most of his days trying to correct his wrongdoings of his past. The problems started when heated discussions started rise up on Tumblr to the point where it felt like Harry and Voldy standing across from each other at the battle of Hogwarts. Pro-Snape bloggers started attacking anti-Snape blogs and visa versa. A lot of backstabbing got involved. Entire groups clogged together and attacked certain authors for writing controversial stuff. Bloggers had to abandon their blogs due to all the bullying. Authors have taken down their stories because they couldn't handle the hatemail they received anymore. Snape is just one example, but this can also be applied to a lot of of characters and happenings in the books (and other fandoms as well, but HP is still the biggest one out there).

Tumblr was/is basically the breeding ground for the anonymous hatemail, and unfortunately I fell victim to it as well. After receiving my umptieth death thread I went on a hiatus. I returned to my fic after having abandoned it for nearly two years because I grew more of a backbone and I can handle the bullshit much more easily now. That being said, the bullshit has also significantly gone down. I still get an occasional anonymous message telling me my story sucks, but at least it's no longer a daily happening.

I will stand by my opinion that Tumblr is nothing more than a platform for extremism. Tumblr recently banned all porn-blogs, but they haven't banned pro-Antifa blogs, neo-nazi blogs, pro-anorexia blogs...the list goes on. The site got its priorities backwards and it shows. I can't emphasise enough to people that they really shouldn't post their fanfics on Tumblr because they'll be at risk for some severe online bullying, especially if you write stuff that isn't the default popular thing to write about.

I have nothing against BLM on basic principles, I do think there is still some racial inequality, but I still didn't like how they were advocating for the deaths of people who were just doing their jobs (trying to keep peace in the protest/riot) and might not have been racist.. so I said that and I got multiple death threats, and was told I was racist and a bunch of other shit... But ya Tumblr was toxic as hell and way to extreme about a lot of things, there could never be a middle ground.

** This, I have thought about this so many times. I first found fanfic in 2003, during the Long Summer before OotP, and during that time the fanfic landscape was super different. FFN was still requesting bloody HTML files in order to preserve your formatting. A lot of people were, understandably, trying to continue the HP story, usually from book 5 and on (guilty!), and most stories that I came across were adventure, "case fics" I suppose, and most ended up being Hinny and Romione, as everyone was trying their best to guess what was coming. It was a really exciting time. So I wrote fanfic for a while, lost interest, and then found it again in 2017. People kept recommending Debt of Time in my HP group, and I read it, and then I started reading and writing fanfic again. Now... finding canon compliant fanfics is a challenge. Finding Romione or Hinny, even, is hard. Canon pairings seem to get a lot of hate, at least in fanfic --- not sure if this is representative of the entire HP community. Romance fics make up probably something like 90% of all fanfics... and adventure stories in the style and feel of the original books are almost impossible to find. I just found an amazing one, actually, but it was written pre-DH, so that doesn't count. And all the tropes, all the new tropes! They were not things before AT ALL! All the wizengamot politics. Daphne Greengrass. All the new HP information available has done a lot to change it. And Ao3, of course. And now lemons are "smut." Haha. And back then, fanfics were something people did not really talk about, outside the community. Now... now, most fanfics don't even have disclaimers anymore! I still put them. Old habits. /shrug

​

The fanfic community is super amazing now, and it's awesome how much more mainstream and acceptable fanfic has become. Though admittedly --- and at risk of sounding bloody old --- I kind of miss the feel of the fanfics from before, where there was so much less bashing and less focus on romance, and on pairing Hermione with literally everyone ever. I feel like fanfics before were about the love of HP, and exploring the story more, and growing the world, and a fair amount (not all, of course) of fanfics now are about fixing it. Re-writing the story. Pointing out things JKR did "wrong." Canon-compliant fanfics are still my fave, so I have a little more trouble finding them now, and I end up reading a hell of a lot more AU things. And it's a bit harder to find readers for them too. But there is room for everything now, and either way I'm glad to see how much its grown! It's pretty amazing. :)

Action scenes are hard, I think no matter how good they get, they can always get better. But the only way to really get better is to keep working on it, and to read (and watch, I guess) a lot of other action scenes for inspiration as well. For example, I don't know if you read The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher (amazing book series) but it is full of amazing, mind-blowing action scenes which are ALL incredibly unique and exciting. And they get more and more exciting with each book. I can hardly wrap my mind around how he's doing them. But I also think reading them has inspired me to improve my own, so I would definitely recommend doing that. Research! And hands on research is great too, not that we can get into a wand battle, of course, but for example in one of my stories I stuck in a bit of Muggle kickboxing, and I had taken a lot of kickboxing classes (just the cardio kind), and I thought that helped a bit to frame them.

  but I'd much rather know where the good authors have gone to write...what is the new hot fanfic topic?
#+end_quote

The answer is: everywhere. Loads of authors got their first taste of fanfiction reading HP fics, but weren't exactly diehard fans themselves. So they eventually moved on towards other books, movies, anime, etc. to jumpstart their own communities there. There hasn't been a migration of authors from one fandom to another as much as there has been a diaspora, and it'll take another story on the level of HP viral enough for a decent % of the world to read it for there to be another concentration of fanfiction at the level that Harry Potter created.

I think that the closest thing there's ever been is Naruto, which had the similar kind of freeform worldbuilding that made it so easy for fanfiction to explore the story and the wild (if not quite as mainstream) popularity to inspire a huge body of work about it.

*** Mostly agree, but still I see so many ideas which were never written REALLY well, and so many tropes are kind-of-almost, but never really well executed and completed:

- repentance/conversion of Severus Snape (or Dursleys). There are few Severitus stories which are half-decent, but I have almost always feeling the repentance/conversion is almost always half-baked. Petunia stories like that are even fewer and usually a way worse.
- Related to it, really well done and humanly understandable Dursleys are really far few and between. That obviously started in the canon, where they are just caricatures of human beings (yes, sixteen year old abused narrator is per definition unreliable).
- Related to the above, some stories where Snape comes to the conclusion that there are more fish in the sea (or from my native Czech: “Sun doesn't shine just for one flower”), and starts dating somebody. Of course, I would like to see some good Snape/Petunia story ... those which are there are usually most horribly written pieces of trash ever written. Or they are unfinished (“[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=9931566][Terms of Matrimony]]” by Galad Estel, “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078809][Unexpected Universe]]” by flibbertygigget).
- Related to that, stories of the Hogwarts life from the point of view of professors. Yes, linkffn(3124159) is good, but it is very time limited and there are very few well written professors POV stories like that.
- Post-War stories dealing with better execution of the realistic life of wizards among Muggles (Northumbrian has some stories like that, but they are usually either unfinished or just one-shots). linkao3(1623053;8402590) are probably best attempts of this kind of story, but I have [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][a lot of objections]] about the execution of the former, and the latter has not been finished yet (and given the past history of the author, I don't think it will be ever finished).

Taure's recent post about indy!Harry stories touched on this for me.

Even though the indie genre is one of the more popular ones in the fandom, and even though there are dozens of /super/ popular indie stories, it's entirely possible that there hasn't been a capital 'G' GREAT indy!Harry fic that's been written yet. Same with the examples you have listed.

I think as the fandom ages, I think there is potential for newer authors to perfect what's come before and improve upon the past.

***** Yeah, and it is exactly the story I meant when I said there is nothing relevant about her coming in terms with her past actions. First, it is AU, and she is not that bad towards Harry. Second, there is not much development in the relationship between her and Harry. Third, it is a crackfic, so not much serious happens there.

Was a never ending trope of the moment for quite awhile, since inception of HP FF. You would see the Harry/Ginny relationship years, super Harry years, super trunk years, super bashing years, super goblin years, slytherin Harry years etc

It feels like we're now at a place where the majority of authors are all trying to be original without leaning heavily on any tropes of the moment. Good authors that is, and it feels like there's been a fresh of breath air in the content and stories being delivered over the last 2 years.

Honestly, I can't even remember the last time I found an interesting fic in the wild on FFN or AO3. It's all about "trope subversions" which don't succeed, character pieces that bore me to tears, and the same old shit that was out of flavor in 2009 but is now being read by a new audience who doesn't give a shit.

** I'll come back to this and write a longer comment off mobile, but broadly gender demographics have shifted intensely to more...i would hazard to say, parity nowadays from the definitively mass female space it was both early on and for, I would say the first decade.

Ironically given the hammering it gets on this community, I feel like HPMOR was a big shifter in how fanfic was perceived and brought a lot of new male writers into the fold.

Slash was incredibly dominant in the early years which likely brought a lot of older LGBT fans into the HP world as a fandom, as well as cementing its popularity with fangirls like in other big fandoms (Sherlock, Supernatural etc.), as was Harmony. Canon pairings fluctuate in and out of popularity but Harry/Ginny has always been fairly popular.

Predictably a lot of the now-common or at least well known fandom tropes (Marriage Law, harem etc.) only really found their way in after the influx of male writers, and are so different to the earlier spirit of the fandom subculture that they tend to provoke a strong reaction, perhaps understandably.

I feel like racebending or imagining the characters as nonwhite is relatively new as a controversial topic. That is to say...go back ten or 15 years and it may not have been a /common/ story element, but I also feel there was less anger as a response to people reimagining or imagining the characters that way. I feel like socially people were less angry in general at that time and if you were a black writer who always imagined Hermione as black, then fine, cool, we're here for the ride.

Wolfstar was much more popular and Bellatrix as a love interest was much LESS popular before the later movies. Also McGonagall/Dumbledore was tacitly assumed to be canon for a long time. I'll have a think what else I recall from ye olde days!

I'd say that there's a difference between saying "In this fic Hermione is black/Harry is Desi/Hispanic" and saying "Well actually if you look at the text, Hermione is canonically black/Harry is canonically Desi/Hispanic". Also insinuating that you are bigoted for disagreeing is pretty much guarantee for drama in the discussion. IMHO, J K Rowling wrote both characters as white and to pretend otherwise is to give her credit she frankly doesn't deserve.

Instead of trying to squeeze representation from a dry stone that was mostly written and set in the early 90's UK, it would be better for people passionate about representation to support more diverse works from younger and more diverse authors.

I mean, I think a lot of people are going to feel that. They really want to see it. I met a really clever reader the other day, and this is what's wonderful about books; she said to me, I really know what Neville looks like And I said, Describe Neville for me. And she said, `Well, he's short and he's black, and he's got dreadlocks.' Now, to me, Neville's short and plump and blond, but that's what's great about books. You know, she's just seeing something different. People bring their own imagination to it. They have to collaborate with the author on creating the world.

I'm definitely not /opposed/ to what they're doing, and have read several excellent fics with this sort of racebending going on. My contention is that when an author does this, they've created this nice little world that they and their readers enjoy, and then that's it. Whereas if a fanfic author engages with a franchise that is more diverse from the outset, they are engaging with a much wider audience and have less work to do to set up their work as representative.

Here's a wonderful example of this sort of Desi Harry integrated into an excellent fic. I really just like linking this fic for any reason I can justify even tangentially. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]])

** I think I got into HP fanfiction sometime around 2001?

The fic wars were insane. Hundreds of pages of threads debating them, especially Harry/Hermione vs Ron/Hermione. Just about everyone had a side, and they could get vicious.

There used to be such an emphasis on being canon compliant. Sure, you were writing about what would happen in the future, but there was an obsession with not changing anything that had already happened. Whole archives wouldn't accept AUs at all.

I feel like there was so much more anticipation and magic and optimism in the fics that came out then, because we didn't know how it ended. Anything could be possible! Now we know how it ends, and that leads to a very different feeling in the stories. Not that the fics coming out now are bad, of course. They just have a different feel. More dystopian, maybe? Less blind wonder at the magical world, more pointing out its flaws?
