I avoid most slash because I like a strong independent Harry where he takes charge of his life. I find most slash where he is dominated (not always sexually) or has no clue and the other male I the relationship must teach him everything


** I've read several good fics with Sirius Black and Remus Lupin in a romantic relationship, but I've never found any good Harry slash fics.

I have nothing against slash, but I can't stand the dom/sub stuff, and the concept of mpreg definitely turns me off. And that's the problem, because most slashfics go all out on the weird (to me) stuff. It's like the authors think that since they've crossed one or two lines, /all/ the lines should be crossed. That just turns slash into crackfic territory.

And the pairings should at least be /believable/. Harry with Snape or either of the Malfoys? Or even Voldemort? Please.

*** I just want to say that I completely agree with you on the believe that pairings should be believable. So many fics are written with the goal of just putting two characters together because the actors who played the characters were sexy or whatever. I've never read a fic that I liked where harry is paired with the Malfoys or Snape either.

However, I do want to say that there are some slash fics that I do enjoy because they don't fall into this trap. And if I would recommend any of them to you, I would recommend Aorist Subjuctive by Minisinoo. Absolutely fantastic, and the pairing is completely believable from my point of view. It's not on ff.net, but if you just search in google it should be in the first few links.

** Snakes and Lions by GatewayGirl is mild slash but I didnt think he was a sub in that, just some naivety. It has been a while since i've read it however.\\

** Can't help you with the gender politics, but if you sort by favs every third or fourth fic is slash. I assume that if you stay clear of the ones featuring Snape or Malfoy you'll find the stories where Harry is on top.

*Edit*: also Voldemort, but fanfiction.net only lets you filter out two characters at a time.

** It's been awhile since I've read it, but I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7337825/1/Parsimony][Parsimony]] to be similar to what you are looking for. It's Harry/Draco, mostly Pre-Slash, and from what I remember he is independent/doesn't let others boss him around.

** Try to track down some of [[http://fuckyeah-drarry.tumblr.com/post/40443518591/the-complete-works-of-maya][Maya's stuff]]. Her characterization of Harry was always so complicated and nuanced (really, all the characters were well served by her writing). I suggest Drop Dead Gorgeous, If You've a Ready Mind (not from Harry's POV), and Underwater Light in particular. I hate pretty much all Drarry slash except hers.

In the three I mentioned above, they have to develop a friendship and trust before anything beyond that happens. It's all very critical of JKR's treatments of the characters (and DDG is actually a satire of bad slash).

If you get nothing else out of it, they're fucking hilarious. I always giggle audibly when reading them.

EDIT: I feel I should mention that this stuff is pretty old. She stopped writing in 2008 and most of her stuff is only current through the 6th book
