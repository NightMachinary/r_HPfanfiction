Do you love when Harry has a dragon animagus form? What about a lion? Or seven different forms? Or does it grind your gears?

Follow-up: If you so like animagus transformations as part (central or otherwise) of a fic, what are some of your favorites?


** I like when Harry has a form, as long as it isn't easily found and mastered. I also don't like when he's a damn bird either. I mean, yeah he loves flying, but so did his dad and he was a fucking deer.

** I don't object to the general idea of Animagus!Harry, but I do dislike the idea of his form being a stunning magical creature like a dragon, or him having multiple forms. It reeks too much of unnecessarily powerful and the author's desire to show how ~super speshul~ he is. It should be a mundane animal that reflects the personality of Harry as written in the fic. Also, I tend to feel disdainful of him as a snake Animagus. It feels too much like the easy option chosen just because he's a Parselmouth.

** I don't read a ton of Harry-centric fic, and rarely ever read Powerful!Harry, but I think I'd be OK with him being an Animagus if it was done well and meshed with what we already know about Animagi from canon.

I wouldn't like it if he had multiple forms. I mean, if Professor McGonagall, who undoubtedly possesses more Transfiguration skill than any other character in the series (except Dumbledore, perhaps, but as far as we know he never chose to become an Animagus), only has one Animagus form (that we know of, but it's a real stretch to think that she had more than one), it's silly to think that Harry, who is skilled at Transfiguration but not /nearly/ as skilled as McGonagall or Dumbledore or even Hermione, could somehow bend the rules of magic and have multiple Animagus forms. I just couldn't buy that. It doesn't even really make any sense. The Animagus form is determined by personality and stuff like that, so multiple Animagus forms would indicate that the Animagi has multiple personalities or something along those lines. I'm not sure how that could be explained. Perhaps it could work in a shameless Powerful!Harry crack fic.

I think I could see Harry having pretty much any non-magical Animagus form as long as it was justified. I'm sure a good author could make him into a lion, perhaps as symbolic of Gryffindor or something. Not sure about the dragon, though... I'm unsure about the idea of people having magical creatures as their Animagus forms. There are many questions that could be dragged up. Do Animagi in magical creature forms gain the magical abilities of the creature? That would be incredibly dangerous. Imagine if a criminal found out that his Animagus form was, like, a basilisk. And would the Ministry seriously allow Harry to register as a /dragon/ Animagus? He could devastate a dozen villages if he wanted to and survive just fine. He'd be extremely overpowered. It would be very difficult for a writer to make that convincing, I think, especially when there are many, many non-magical animals to choose from that can work just as well. Then again, I'm not the target audience of Powerful!Harry fics, and being overpowered doesn't seem to be much of a concern in those... anyway.

I feel like I could most easily buy Harry taking the form of some kind of bird. I've read a few fics where he becomes an eagle, and I think that's fair... the flying thing obviously makes sense, since he's so talented at Quidditch and enjoys flying, but when I think "eagle" I think majestic, independent, fierce... and when I think "Harry" I think loyal, stubborn, with a bit of a temper. Maybe some kind of hawk or falcon? I don't know shit about birds, so whatever. It's an easy out (kind of like "snake" or "stag" or "lion") but as long as it's justified in some way, it's preferable to something like "dragon." I haven't read any fics that I can remember that have Harry turning into something other than those creatures. I'm trying to think of something that fits better, but I'm not getting any ideas.

It's a tricky line to tread. I've seen some fics where it was obvious that the author was just like "What's the most powerful, badass creature I can think of...? Oh, I know! a phoenix/dragon/griffin/Hippogriff/etc.!" and the only way the Animagus form is reminiscent of Harry is because it's /cool/ just like Harry is /just so cool/ and it makes me question whether the author knows anything about Harry Potter beyond his reputation. A good story would give a solid justification for a reasonable and fitting Animagus form which does a good job of representing Harry's personality. And that can be hard, which is why I don't really have any good answers myself. You don't want to make Harry out to be some flawless superhero by giving him an epic and unstoppable Animagus form, but you still want it to be respectable -- not, like, a goldfish or a hamster.

** There was a ridiculous fic I read recently that had Harry as a GHOST animagus. Nobody thought his form was more ridiculous than Harry himself.

I don't mind Harry as an animagus, so long as it's something he actually has to work for... and, hopefully, struggles to attain.

** It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Canon indicates that the ability is very rare and takes a powerful witch or wizard to accomplish, which makes sense. However, I also find it problematic that people like Peter and Rita were animagi. They don't seem particularly powerful to me.

I definitely understand the dislike for magical beast animagi, as it also seems to go against canon/logic. With the exception of two stories, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem With Purity]] by Phoenix.Writing and The Phoenix Trilogy by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1760628/grangerous][grangerous]], I tend to agree.
