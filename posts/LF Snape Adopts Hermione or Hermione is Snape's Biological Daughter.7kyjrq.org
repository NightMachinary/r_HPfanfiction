** linkffn(looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconis)

It's not an immediate kind of thing, from what I remember it's more of a mentorship turned into a familial relationship. But it's been a bit since I've read it, might have to put it on my reread soon list.

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.
