** I think some fanfics are definitely good enough to be taught at school. These fics are IMHO significantly better than what Hollywood is coming up with these days, or at least a lot better than “The Cursed Child”. It could inspire more kids to write.

Since you insist on canon compliant short stories, good choices are kind limited, but here are some I can come up with:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]], linkffn(4152700): a very emotional piece in 1652 words

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/][An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley]], linkffn(4798208): what other people did while the Trio were on the run

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal, Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595): Dudley had a witch daughter, and he was calling Harry for advice

The author [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]] has written a big collection of postwar, canon compliant short fics.
