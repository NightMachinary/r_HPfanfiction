Yes i know he is modest in canon, but i want to read where he is the genius behind the scenes and has hired someone to be the "face" of his operations

** Not exactly the same but Make a Wish is super fun. Harry runs away from the Dursleys to live because he knows about the profecy. He hides his face.Everywhere he goes he does amazing things, solving crimes and destroying Death Eaters. Eventually becoming the mysterious Mr Black. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed this one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.
