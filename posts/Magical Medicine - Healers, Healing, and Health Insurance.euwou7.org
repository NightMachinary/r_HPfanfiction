Any fics with Magical Healing playing a significant role? Could be a character becoming a healer, a character being a healer, a character regularly needing healing (eg. Harry becomes a Quidditch Player and gets injured a lot).


** That's the direction my fic is going in, but it's more business than strictly magical healing. Fem!Harry and her Muggle friend will work to bring medical potions to the non-magical world. linkffn(13382072)

My other favourite is linkffn(6585807).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
