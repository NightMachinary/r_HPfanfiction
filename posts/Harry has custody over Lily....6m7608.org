So, as far as I can remember, Harry is some Lord of an obscure family and has somehow time travelled. His relation to Lily and the green eyes means, when coupled with his age, that he's, well, head over the family. They then proceed to talk with Dumbledore about Harry's influence over her, Dumbledore thinking that Harry is using her...It gets weird quickly.

I remember being satisfied when I read this...so it's been bugging me.


** "Passageways", maybe?

**** It's honestly a bit rough at first, but the idea is original and it's done pretty well. Shame it's abandoned

***** We were getting a rebuild of it for a few chapters which cleaned up the beginning. Iirc the author thought their original idea was getting too off the rails and wanted to refocus, but yeah, abandoned both.

  The perfect weather however was a stark contrast to the dark and tempestuous ruminations of Harry Potter.
