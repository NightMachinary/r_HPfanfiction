Where Harry became a vigilante fighting pureblood oppression and Dumbledore while understanding tries his best to 'redeem' Harry from the path of 'darkness'.\\
Would be amazing if it was gradual with the whole disappointment and a conflict between Harry's desire to make Dumbledore proud and his revulsion to oppression.
