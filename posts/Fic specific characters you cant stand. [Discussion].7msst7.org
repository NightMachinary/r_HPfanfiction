Do you have a specific character in a specific fic that drives you mad? I don't mean like "Oh so and so is my least favorite HP character of all time!" I mean more like "This fic I read is great but I found pleasant Umbridge hard to swallow"

The reason I thought of this is because I've been reading linkffn(12096051) the Put Your Guns Away it's Tea Time series and holy cow I want to smack Lily Luna so hard. It's almost funny but it reminds me of all the reasons why children are awful and instead of being called out on her bad behavior the author is trying to convince me she's full of life, and Harry and Ginny bend to her every whim. If it didn't hurt me to think of what the other characters would go through, I'd be okay with Lily Luna tragic accidenting herself out of this series.

She reminds me of Quin from Daria, and every time her character opens her mouth I think Even Lavander Brown at her very worst was less narcissistic and off putting then this girl. At 13 I've written her off as the kind of person who will grow up to be rude to cashiers and waiters just to feel power over someone else. She is an awful brat and seems to be taking more and more of the center stage in the fic.

He is obnoxious, annoying, arrogant little brat. I've read like 10 or 12 Chapters and I've had enough.

EDIT: He is rude too.

** So this isn't a specific fic because I don't exactly stay long enough to take this kind of fic down, but nice!Lucius. I don't mind him not being horrible to his family or anything, but he's still a blood supremacist and willing Death Eater. I can't see him being an incredibly mushy cuddly person, it's just not him at all!

What if he was killed? Draco's now fatherless --- though, that probably would have done him some good. What if the people actually found out he was a Death Eater? Boom, Malfoy reputation ruined. Have fun, Narcissa. Dude brought a Dark Lord who likes throwing Cruciatus Curses around near his family. Fuck him. If I was Harry, I would definitely make sure he made his way into Azkaban.

Wouldn't that sentence apply for any Pureblood Light side characters? It feels like the sentiment only really applies because we're all agreed that Blood Supremacy is a negative thing.

If you put some other positive ideal there (equality) but still apply the fact that fighting for it endangers your family, would that make all parents who fought against Voldemort as bad as Lucius in that regard?

***** No, because it's fighting for equality. If you're having to fight for that, your family likely isn't safe either way. And even if they are safe, it's still fighting for a good cause. Lucius was part of a group that killed innocents. He didn't fight his cause to protect his family. He did it to kill and enslave those he considered beneath him.

****** See, saying it's fine because it's a good cause kind of misses the point I think.

In your opinion it's a good cause. In Malfoy's opinion, an opinion based on blood supremacy, his cause is the good one.

And for us, viewing these characters from a 3rd person lense, it doesn't seem like a good critique to criticize Malfoy as a father on the basis of him risking his family, cause that is exactly what others like Arthur Weasley did.

******* Just because Malfoy thinks it's a good cause doesn't mean it has any chance of being so. It's not even a subjective thing. It's pretty much objective. Voldemort's side is bad. Harry's side is not. JK Rowling went out of her way to make this very clear. There's hardly any gray area.

Just because someone thinks they're doing something good does not absolve them of the shit things that they actually do. Malfoy wasn't fighting out of self defense, he was fighting to kill those he thought inferior. That's really it.

******** It's not objective. Killing someone *for no reason at all* isn't objectively bad. It's bad only because we decided it's bad based on our moral world view. That is a world view I share by the way.

But /from Malfoy's perspective/, his side is good.

#+begin_quote
  The man willingly put him and his family in danger for his ideals
#+end_quote

That is what you said that sparked my initial reply. That statement applies to all fathers in this conflict. It's dishonest to say that only Malfoy is bad based on that statement.

If you add the qualifier, which is what you've subsequently done, that

#+begin_quote
  The man willingly put him and his family in danger for his ideals. *Ideals which are wrong, thus making his putting his family in danger a bad thing.*
#+end_quote

But then your initial statement is pretty much pointless. You may as well have said Malfoy is a bad father because he's a villain.

My simple question, which I should have put in my first reply, is "is someone a bad father because they put their children at risk for their cause?"

It's a yes or no question. If the answer is yes, then Malfoy *and* Weasley are bad fathers.

If the answer is no, then neither is a bad father *as far as that specific statement is concerned.*

Look here big fella. You can't just stop reading once it gets to a part you don't like and assume you got all the relevant information. Thing is, to fully understand someone (and thus properly write them) you have to see things from their perspective - not that you have to /share/ that view.

Malfoy thought he was doing the right thing, from his point of view. Weasley thought /he/ was doing the right thing, from /his/ point of view.

I will not argue that Malfoy's Point of View wasn't heavily flawed. It really was. Yes, Malfoy is a terrible person - /FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW/.

Pretty sure that Draco Malfoy thinks Weasley is the terrible person. EVERYONE. HAS. BIAS.

Total Mary Sue and was a garbage person. I think the author had to have been an angsty "my parents don't get me" teenager. At least I hope so. Harry/Ginny are pretty much assholes, but the thing that got me was that when they were really concerned with Lily's attention whore ways (because parenting) but the author handled it like "lolparents" instead of it being parental concern. (Pretty sure Lily was drinking/smoking/having sex/partying at like 14. But ohmygodparents amiright?) Lily ends up running away and living with that Malfoys (who, in a twist, "got her". They also got her a modeling contract with a wizarding lingerie company at the ripe old age of 15. So yeah.)

** I have to say all those OOC Lunas where she either:

- has her whole personality as a cover
- is blatantly a seer with little to no drawbacks
- is all 'woe is me' over her "quirkiness", without even really being all that quirky.
- or uses 'nargles' and 'wrackspurts' as codewords for magic or bullies or whatever

I mean there are always exceptions - if its well written, it works for me. Its just almost impossible imo to pull one of those off without sounding terribly cliche or entirely ruining her character's charm.
