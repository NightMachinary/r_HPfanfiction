This is the story I'm talking about: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8875846/chapters/20349061]]

It looks really good, but it says it's on indefinite hiatus, but the author also orphaned their account? So I assume they abandoned the story completely. Does anyone know of an adoption/continuation where the story is finished?
