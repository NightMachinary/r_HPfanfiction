I really liked OotP Ginny. She had so much potential. Her character development could've shown how James matured, as they're a lot alike. Then in HBP and DH she just became a Mary Sue. I think there could have been an animated cardboard cut-out of her and there wouldn't be much difference. Despite knowing that she and Harry would end up together (it was rather obvious), I never felt chemistry between them. I can easily see how their relationship in CC happened because it's more of a content partnership between friends than actually loving. The only reason I ship them together is because I like the idea of Harry actually being a part of the Weasley family and James and Lily (not Albus, though. Never him, unless his name is Arnold Rubeus).


** This is basically a mash-up of some of my previous posts regarding Ginny as a character and her relationship with Harry.

As characters they clearly fit together: through their shared sense of humour, their love for Quidditch, their similar experiences regarding Voldemort, their physical attraction, as well as their individualist and anti-authoritarian personalities (in contrast to Ron and Hermione). And no, Ginny is not a Mary Sue. In the books, she can be mean and spiteful; is openly jealous and a little childish; is not always forgiving, especially toward her family members; is stubborn to the point of recklessness; and she can be too trusting. Also, the only thing Ginny can be said to be "perfect" at is Quidditch. If anything, Ginny having a "niche" is definitely more believable than Hermione who excels at almost everything, apart from Quidditch and Defense Against the Dark Arts.

So even until the end of /Half-Blood Prince/, I would say that Ginny's character development was perfectly fine, but with a few extra scenes perhaps needed. For example, another scene in /Order of the Phoenix/ where they talk more in depth about their "connections" to Voldemort, for example after a nightmare. And a scene where they are just joking and laughing around. Add those two scenes, and you highlight even more their compatibility, Ginny is developed further, and there would clearly not have been as many complaints about the pairing (since the primary complaint of H/G is not about compatibility but about development).

The biggest problem with Ginny's character development is /Deathly Hallows/. No, not in terms of being a Mary Sue, but simply a distinct lack of exposure and a "grand finale"/a resolution of her character arc. Ginny seems somewhat downgraded, particularly during the battle. For example: Ginny should definitely have destroyed one of the Horcruxes (Nagini or the Diadem most likely). I mean why Crabbe, of all people, rather than Ginny? That's a missed opportunity! Think of it, she avenges her possession by Tom Riddle through a Horcrux by destroying one herself. It is made clear to everyone, both to the characters and the fans of the series that "size is no guarantee of power" and that "anything's possible if you've got enough nerve" by explicitly showing, not only telling. Character arc resolved. Easy!

*** Hermione is the obvious Mary Sue, but at least her flaws are pointed out, whereas Ginny's own are glossed over. Slughorn goes so far as to reward Ginny when he catches her hexing another student.

(Incidentally, Slughorn was the teacher when the Marauders were in school... I wonder if they were in the Slug Club, too?)

**** The series are from Harry's perspective, so it makes sense that Ginny would be viewed more positively, flaws and all. And there are clear examples for each of these. In fact a faction of people who hate Ginny is because of some of these flaws.

Also, I'd say that's more telling of Slughorn's character, not Ginny's. Remember, when Ginny crashes into Smith for that Quidditch commentary, McGonagall certainly doesn't treat her the same way, despite being the Gryffindor Head of House.

** I don't really see Ginny as similar to James at all, actually. I think she's a lot kinder - sometimes more so than Harry & Hermione. You see that in her interactions with Neville and Luna. Also, I think she did mature early after almost dying her first year? Except JK Rowling didn't really show her trauma or how that affected her that much, but I thought you got a hint of it when she asks Harry why he didn't even think to ask her about what it was like to be possessed in Order of the Phoenix. But I do agree that she isn't developed that well as a character - I think mostly because Rowling just didn't want to take the focus off Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

*** But then James also befriended Sirius, Remus, and Peter, all of whom were outcasts like Luna and Neville. Ginny also hexed people who annoyed her, and I think we can mostly agree that a lot of them deserved it... Which leads to the question if the same thing happened to James. There's just so much potential there and it was never explored. (Instead we get the Ode to Snape: Nazi, Controlling Abuser, and Mostly a Bad Guy.)

***** How much flack do you think Sirius got for being a Black in Gryffindor? Most of the fights James had probably occurred because someone was attacking Sirius, for as we learned in PoA and DH, James was loyal to a fault to his friends, like Harry, but unlike Lily, who knew when to walk away from a friendship that could end up in her death.

I could also go into Remus, a shy boy with a tragic history like Neville. People didn't know he was a werewolf at the time but I'm sure they noticed he was sickly...

Not much? We see his schooldays and hear people talk about his schooldays. He was immensely popular. Your headcanon might be that Blacks in Gryffindor got flack but unfortunately nothing in canon really supports that

Again, making up headcanons. Also what fights was James getting into all the time (apart from with Severus and/or other Slytherins)?

What? Remus was bookish, but shy? Where on earth are you getting that from? In the brief glimpse we get in OotP and as an adult he's perfectly sociable if mildly acerbic. And sickly? Harry notes that he looked a bit peaky during their OWLs, but how does that translate to him being /sickly/?

This just sounds like you're trying to force the current generation's dynamics on their parents to be honest. Like, Luna had literally no friends besides Ginny. People stole her belongings, down to her damn /shoes/ on the regular and no-one did a thing about it. People nicknamed her /Loony/. I'm sorry, but nothing in canon points to any child at Hogwarts in Harry's or the previous generation being treated that badly by their peers.

******* Um... There's this handy tool called a thesaurus. In that, you might note: peaky, as in sickly.

Also, who do you think would be attacking Sirius the most? Why, /Slytherins/, of course. Maybe it's headcanon, but it fits in exactly with their characters.

People not being treated badly by their peers? Did you read the books? If not, let me point you at least to CoS the movie, where Harry was ostracized for being a Parselmouth, or perhaps GoF, where everyone wore Potter Stinks badges.

Seeing as Ginny was the one who introduced her as Loony, I don't think she became friends with Luna either until OotP. Also did Harry not count as Luna's friend?

**** The only person I recall her hexing is Zacharias Smith for being a douchebag & not minding his own business? And that was just a bat bogey hex...nothing permanently disfiguring. But you literally see her standing up for Luna & Neville back when even Harry thought they were lame & didn't want to be seen with them. In contrast to - as an example - Hermione, who is repeatedly condescending to Luna & even puts that cruel hex on Marietta Edgecomb (and gets praised for it?).

Because Ginny named him after her pet +tribble+ pygmy puffskein?

I don't see Ginny as a Mary Sue. She doesn't solve all problems or draw the attention of all the boys, nor does she accomplish with ease the feats that others struggle to do.

My biggest contention with Ginny is that canon doesn't prove her worth to Harry. Aside from his sudden and uncharacteristic obsession with her, we have no idea why Harry favors Ginny above any other attractive girl. She's the 'acceptable, logical choice'. If canon had Harry hook up with any other girl at the end, the question from the fans would have been 'Why not Ginny?' Except Hermione, for which the fans would probably say, 'You poor, poor, lad. Have a pint on me, Potter.'

I don't fault Ginny. The author failed to sell the pairing, and took unusual effort to nullify her in the story.

*** Tribble? Wrong fandom, methinks :p

She isn't a total Mary Sue, but she does hit a lot of the points quite well.

Arnold also comes from GoF (I think?) where Arthur was misquoted as Arnold Weasley in the Daily Prophet. So it would be a name honoring a man who meant something to both Harry and Ginny.

I just want to clarify that my point wasn't to say that Hermione was better. She's too much like a sister to Harry, whereas Ginny is a little more believable since she's more like a friend.

Edit: Found the quote

"'...the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.'

Malfoy looked up.

'Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It's almost as though he's a complete nonentity, isn't it?' he crowed."

*** I think the biggest issue with canon pairings is that we are supposed to believe they are in undying love while the onscreen evidence suggests nothing like that. If you just read the books without the battle/epilogue, Ron/Hermione would probably end with murder while Harry/Ginny is just a passing crush. "But they fight all the time, that's a clear case of UST" doesn't work for longterm relationships. Rowling really dropped the ball with the last few chapters, regarding character portrayals and relationships without proper build-up.

**** That's the problem with DH as a whole. Despite the numerous fight scenes, it felt fairly slow, and then everything was packed into about three chapters and wrapped in duct tape so we're not able to get any more out of it until CC came along (which I don't count as canon, but then, I obviously don't like the Epilogue, so that's no surprise). It was just so forced in the end, even though I was expecting Snape to be redeemed (although in my own opinion he wasn't) and Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione to be happening. Romance obviously isn't Rowling's forte.

***** Yeah, the only "healthy" relationship we see is Cedric/Cho and maybe Ron/Lavender. Everything else has something rather disturbing or unhealthy about it, from Molly joking about rape drugs and Cho using Harry as a rebound to Ron/Hermione having far too much water under the bridge (and clashing personalities) and Bill being far too passive about his family's treatment of Fleur in "An excess of Phlegm".

****** Cedric/Cho, though we don't see much of it, seems fairly sweet. Ron/Lavender are your typical first time dating and easily relatable. Also I can understand Cho's reasoning, although I definitely wouldn't have used Harry as the rebound.

I think JKR said in an interview that Ron and Hermione would need marriage counseling, but personally, once they got it all hashed out, I think they would make an adequate couple. He would help her to relax and Hermione would help him to mature (another reason I don't like the Epilogue is because this /didn't/ happen).

As for Molly dosing her husband? Yeah, I have no defense for that.

** That the fangirl (she can't even talk to him at first damned!) gets the boy! Not to mention that Ginny is a non-person (lacks development, is not involved much in the main story for the most part, does almost nothing to ultimately win against Voldemort etc.)!

Those are all part of it for me, but my main problem is that there are a ton of more interesting options! Pairing Harry with a Slytherin (and them having to sneak around during the war or him having to bring her on the Horcrux-Hunt because the secret got out and she isn't save anywhere in Britain anyway? Yes! That would have spiced it all up especially since a Slytherin would end Hermione bossing everybody around, despite the fact that she doesn't really have a great plan (or any plan!) herself, quite quickly and she would probably encourage Harry to think for himself more and be more sneaky instead of brash and out loud and proud! (why use a hammer if a screwdriver works way better? Why try to hex somebody if spreading a nasty rumor hurts them way more? etc. etc.)) would have made much more sense IMHO (Ginny is just such a safe option (which makes this boring as fuck!) and she kind of looks like his mother, too -.-) or pairing him with an older student or something (I am a fan of Harry/Fleur and Harry/older student in general)...Hell, even Hermione would have IMHO been better, not because they necessarily are the most compatible, but because they make sense! Hermione and Ron don't (at least not to me! I know love isn't governed by logic, but Ron should IMHO be the last person Hermione would think of romantically because he's basically her antithesis! Mater to her anti-mater! He's lazy, she's academically inclined. She's smart, he's dumb. He's into quidditch, Hermione dislikes flying - etc. etc. Not to mention that Ron looks down on muggles and Hermione is muggle born and does not and neither does Harry, so he scores big time here IMHO because of their shared background of growing up in the muggle world! Not to mention that they bring out the best in each other. Not to mention that literally everybody is IMHO (I know that I am biased!) better than his Weasleyness/Weasley is our king :( )
