Hey guys I have exhausted my reading list and can't find any so do any of you know of any decent fics where Harry is a Vampire or maybe even another creature.

--------------

Requests:

No Slash

No Severitus (I think that's what it's called) anyway I don't like Snape and I don't want to read about him being a friend or parental figure or God forbid a lover to Harry

No Harry/Hermione

Bashing is allowed

Crossovers are allowed

I would prefer an older Harry. The earliest I read nowadays is GoF because I am fed up with the generic early years rehash of canon in which Harry suddenly acts way OOC for a generic reason such as Goblins or Lords etc and acts like an adult when he's 11.

--------------

If anyone does know of any within my requests please tell me. Or any decent fics within those parameters. I have read pretty much all the top favourites and follows on FF.net and never really have tried any other websites.

Severitus refers to a particular kind of fic that pretends that Snape was actually Harry's father. There's not really a particular name for very Snape-centric fics.

** I've got two good ones, both by the same author, one complete, the other a darker rewrite, but not complete.
