I'm looking for any completed fics about Hermione in her 20s, 30s, older that you really liked and can recommend. I don't really care who she's paired with. Just well written who she becomes. Extra points for cool novel academic achievements. For example, Dumbledore was famous for the x uses of dragon blood, and I thought she might have something famous like that attached to her name eventually.


** Proximate is pretty good (she's a healer and does some cool work in that capacity: linkffn(12571695)

The Red Door --- it's not well known/super popular but I love it. Hermione is a little OOC in that she goes into law enforcement/becomes good at thinking on her feet/under duress which canonically is not her strength, but it's still really fun --- linkffn(13005475)

There are definitely a lot of others but those two come to mind first.

  Following a tumultuous break-up with Ron, Hermione finds herself intoxicated and relatively prone to poor decision making after she runs into Draco Malfoy in a club, having been years since she has seen him. Upon seeking to escape the following morning, she realizes he is her new neighbour and is quite insatiable. Winner of best Healer!Hermione in the Granger Enchanted Awards 2018.

  Hermione's life plan after the war was changed drastically when Kingsley Shacklebolt came to visit her one afternoon with a special request. Draco's life however took a surprising turn with a slap across the face and a snide comment from Hermione. Draco's determined to change how the world views the Malfoy Name, while Hermione is determined to see what she is truly capable of.
