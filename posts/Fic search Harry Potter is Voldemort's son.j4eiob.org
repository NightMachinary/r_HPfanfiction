Hi everyone! So basically a while back I read this specific fic where as Voldemort's son, Harry originally went to Hogwarts and then at some point he ended up starting his own school with four houses: Draco and Daphne helped design the uniform. I remember that Hermione and Ron were antagonists as was Dumbledore but for the life of me I cannot remember the fic name.

It was definitely on either AO3 or ffnet since those are the only two sites I read.

Sorry for the obscure question!


** Little update: found it! It's Carpe Omnia by Noctem31
