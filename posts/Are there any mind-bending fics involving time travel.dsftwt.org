I like time travel as a subplot or the driving force of a plot. Especially when the plot includes paradoxes and twists. I was wondering if anybody is aware of any good piece of fic that involving such a thing. Doesn't exclusively have to be Harry it can be any other character aswell. Thanks.


** Mind-bending time-travel fics coming up. I will try to not spoil anything too important, or put it behind spoiler tags:

- linkffn(A Long Journey Home): imagine what if the time-travel wasn't controlled, and that you had to go and live all the way from 6000 years to the present in order to return to your former time. This is the best iteration of the live-back-to-present idea, and its sold totally on its awesome characterization and world-building. Highly recommend.
- linkffn(Realignment): you ever see Terminator 2? Well, this fic is basically that, but the catch is 1943 Tom Riddle is John Connor. This fic really takes the action and magical show-offness up to 11, and I can highly recommend it for its unique spin on several characters as well.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw): since it happens in the first chapter, I'm spoiling this. Imagine what would happen if, unlike most fics, Harry or the MC died and was sent back, but they were not the only one who had been back. Now imagine what would happen if the time-travelers were working at a cross-purpose as well. That is a fairly important part of this fic.
- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): full disclosure, I love everything about this fic, short as it is. Its got one of the most original premises I have ever encountered in the fandom, is filled with incredible magic and OPness, and oozes personality in a way that few fics have really been able to emulate. Highly recommend this one, especially since its only a 20k read.
- linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter): ever see Groundhog Day? Or more accurately, Re:Zero if you're more into anime. This fic is basically that premise but with Harry Potter. Its interesting to explore how the constant repetition has such an emotional impact on Harry and how it shapes his behavior.

I can come up with a few more, but I hope that will satisfy your interests for now. Give a shout out if you want something else.

** linkffn(Anticlockwise) a time traveling fic from the perspective of a non-traveler. Sadly unfinished, but what's there is pretty nifty.

This one doesn't quite have time travel (does realizing that everybody you know has been lying about the world, year included, count?) but has a lot of mind-bending and twists involved. The one and only Harry Potter/Matrix crossover: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality)

  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.

** How to solve P=NP and revolutionize computer science and mathematics using a time turner:

You should have received a note from your future self. Don't open it yet, as long as you have not observed it you can freely choose what to send to your past self.

Let p be the product of two unknown primes.

If the note you received turns out to be empty, write 1*1 on a new note and send it back.

If the note contains two primes whose product equals p, you solved the problem. Copy the exact message and send it back.

If the note contains two numbers that don't result in p and the first number is less than p, increment the first number by one and send that back.

If the first number has reached p, reset it to 1 and increment the second number.

Each possibility except for the correct solution should cause a change in history, looping through all possibilities simultaneously until you reach the stable state of having the correct prime factors.

Got it?

Let's open the note and see if it works!
