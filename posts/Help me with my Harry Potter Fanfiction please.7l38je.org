I'm here to reach out to other fans to help me with my first Fanfiction. I haven't read the Harry Potter series as much as most people and I also want to make sure I don't end up filling my story with cliches and tropes. Anyway I'm still in the early planning stages but I want it to take place after second year, in a third year au of sorts. It's going to be a Harry and Hermione story and I want Neville to end up in the trio instead of Ron but I don't know how to do that without bashing his character or making him ooc. I don't want to kill off his character either. I thought about bringing in a weeping angel from Doctor Who and have it send Ron into the past and he becomes Dumbledore but is that too crazy? I also want to redeem Draco but again I have no idea how to do that while trying to stick to canon. So can anyone give me some advice on what to do and not do?


** First and foremost, you need to first figure it what story you are trying to tell. Who is the story about? What is the conflict? You want to make sure you aren't just regurgitating the canon story with a trio change.

If you want to make Neville part of the trio in 2nd/3rd year, you don't have to write a reason for Ron not being there. It could just be that Harry sat with Neville and Hermione on the train rather than Ron first year and he became friends with him instead of Ron. Maybe make Ron be good friends with Seamus and that could make a plausible change.

Now for the other portions. So my advice is to pick a coupe of these ideas, and throw out the others. You are trying to do too much with one story. If you want to do a Draco redemption, he needs to be a large focus of the story and it would have to be long (simply because you would have to make the change gradual). For a redemption, you have to show Draco figuring out his worldview is messed up, struggle to get over the prejudices written into his personality, and make it believable. You want to avoid the “leather pants Draco trope”. It sounds like your focus is the trio, so a Draco redemption where I'm he is not the MC is doable, but extremely difficult to deal believably. It might be worth doing a second fic if this is something you truly want to do.

Now for the weeping angels. Unless you are bringing other elements of Doctor Who into this, I would abandon that plan completely because you are simply trying to find an easy solution to a complex problem. It's kind of lazy to just bring one element of another show in to fix a possible plot hole.

Good luck and welcome ! Hope your story goes well!

*** I see we independently had similar thoughts.

Your comment about plot holes is a good one. No good story invokes a higher power to fill in a plot hole.

*** Well I didn't exactly give out the full plot for fear of people stealing it but basically I'm fixing all the things that bugged me about the series while adding in things I think would be cool if it happened. It'll start out with Harry, Hermione and Neville as the trio but Draco will become part of it later and they will all become animagus and reform the next generation of marauders. I know that at least is probably cliche but I really like the idea. But the main plot is that Voldemort finds a way to recreate the philosophers stone and comes back to life that way, and there are no horcruxes. So they have to find a different way to destroy him and the war happens much sooner than fourth year. The only problem with them befriending Neville on the train instead is then I would have to rewrite the first two books in order for the rest of story to make sense. I still want the events of the first two years to go mostly the same. I also considered making Draco a werewolf, but that's a cliche also. It's so hard to find non cliche original ideas for stories.

Thanks for your advice!

**** Sounds cool!

And never worry if the idea has been done before because you will always bring something new to it!

It sounds like you are taking in a large story for your first go, so I would like to give you just a tie but if advice I wish I would have been told early on (been writing fanfic for 11 years). Just some things that tend to happen with new fanfic writers so I hope I'm not overstepping.

- Outline outline outline. You done have to stick to it if the story naturally deviates, but it is a lot easier to not hit a road block if you have the bare bones planned out. Also helps you not burn out.

- write a good summary and don't include any self bashing in your notes or summary

- Avoid epithets like the plague.

- Get a beta if you can. They will help you develope as a writer more than you can know. They can help with continuity, characterization, and grammar that a writer can easily miss.

- Don't over describe things. No one likes a paragraph of description of someone's outfit that doesn't advance the plot.

- Always remember to show not tell if you can help it.

I'm excited for you to start this. Let us know if you end up posting it!

** There are no bad ideas, only bad execution.

One of the interesting things about writing fanfiction is that you don't need to justify your decisions. While the characters and the canon belong to another, the story you write is wholly yours. Make Neville the third in the trio if that's your aim; there's no need to bash Ron to achieve this, just make a storyline where Neville's inclusion is consistent and believable. If your fic is a crossover with Dr Who, then write it well enough and the reviews will come. Write it badly and your fic will sink into obscurity.

Any villain can be redeemed, and Draco is no exception. There are stages to redemption: the self-realisation that what the one is doing is wrong, guilt, self-introspection, remorse, acceptance, compensation / aid to former enemies / self-sacrifice. I would personally be interested in a well-written fic that has Draco's redemption as the major sub-plot, even though he's not a favoured character for me.

Ideas are easy, writing is hard. Above all, write for yourself and have fun. Send me a PM when you get your first chapter out. :)

** if you want to remove Ron without bashing you could simply have his parents remove him and his siblings from Hogwarts. Think about it, They just almost lost Ginny because of Voldemort and now his most devoted follower Sirius Black escaped, and because he is targeting Hogwarts more than a hundred Dementors are stationed their. Considering they just won a decent amount of money you could simply have them use it to place their children at some other magic school to ensure that they do not risk losing another child again. But you would have to adapt Sirius behavior accordingly.

If you want to redeem Draco a easy way to do it would be having his father be arrested for what happens in Hogwarts and owning Dark objects. When Ron and Harry pretended to be Crabbe and Goyle they found out that the Malfoy have a secret chamber filled with objects of the dark arts hidden under their drawing room. Ron said he wanted to write his father about it, but we never found out what happend. You could simply have them find Dark objects there, the Aurors connect it to the chamber incident he is arrested. And like in Half-Blood Prince Draco finds out that many People dont want to associate with him because his fathers fall from grace. Him becoming a pariah because he doesn't have anything to going for him except the influence of his family they just lost can be used to explain character development.

*** Wow! I really love the idea about Draco, I think I'll go ahead and use it. I was planning on giving him a little sister who befriends a muggleborn to help him with his prejudice by seeing what ‘mudbloods' are really like which should also help.

I can't have the Weasleys removed from Hogwarts however, because Ginny is going to end up with Neville and play a bigger role than she does in the books. I may just have to kill Ron off, since I really don't want to bash him but need him out of the story.

Thanks for the tips!

**** If you want to kill Ron you can do that, but it will be hard to write how the characters deal with him being dead because how young they are and you still have a plot for them to deal with.

Another simple way would be to give Ron a girlfriend( it doesn't really matter who) and have him spend a lot of time with her and her friends, Harry being bored without Rons starts spending more time with Neville and maybe Ginny. And over a short time Harry and Ron would be a less closer because they start develop their own circles of friends and only barely spend any time together. So you could simply have them remain friends but in asimilar way Harry and Ron were friends with Neville in canon prior to the fight in the ministry. Like they would still occasionally talk with each other, maybe sit in the same compartment in the train and still offer each other support.

***** I like that idea much better. I'm really averse to killing off main characters especially kids. This has been the hardest part to figure out in my fanfic because I really wanted Ron out of the picture. I've read so many Harmony fics that bash him and he acts ooc. I wanted to do something different. I tried to find a way he could unintentionally betray them but that probably counts as bashing and I wouldn't know how to do that. But him being friends with Dean and Seamus always made more sense anyway. For someone who is constantly overshadowed by others, befriending the boy who lived wasn't really the best choice.

Thank you so much for the idea!
