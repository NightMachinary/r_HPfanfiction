** If I understand right (english is not my first language), a "Fair-Weather Friend" is someone who is only a Friend when everything is fine right?

If this is the case, there is nobody among the "main cast" that fit the persona. I guess Ron would be the closest to it, since he actually left at some points, but considering all the other things he did (coming back, following Harry to Aragog and the Chamber of Secrets, standing in front of Sirius Black with a broken leg . . .), it would be extremely unfair to call him that.

On the Slytherin side, there is Crabbe who kinda left Draco when his family lost its authority. But to be honest, I think the most "fair-weathered friend" would be one these characters that only makes some short apparition. I'm split between Cormac McLaggen (seems to be the type), Romilda Vane (only approched Harry when he became popular), and Zacharias Smith (he seems to have all the possible faults, so what's one more?).

I mean, literally all of those things happened when they were really young, so I don't think that really counts - it's honestly more attributable to them being brash and not fully cognizant of the dangers or their options... For a couple of those he had no choice or there were other factors involved, eg threat to his pet or sister (standing in front of Sirius, Chamber of Secrets). He didn't go down there for Harry's sake, he did it for his sister. With Aragog, correct my memory, but weren't both of them completely caught off guard by who Aragog was? He didn't bravely follow his friend to confront his greatest fear, he stumbled into it and rejected going into the forest at later scenes

As for him coming back in the later books - is that really a point in his favor, when he left in the first place? It's like that parable about wounding an animal so you can heal it back up, that shouldn't be a plus.

Out of everyone, it's definitely Ron, and I don't think it's unfair at all

This entire series happens before they are of legal age in the Muggle world. Don't take away Ron's redeemable moments because he was too young. I'm certain he knew the risks to find the giant spiders in the dark and dangerous forest as a 12 year old, but he still did it. He didn't stand in front of the infamous murderer for his rat that he hated, he did it when Sirius seemed like he was threatening Harry. He was offered the choice of not coming with Harry into the CoS, but did it anyways. Ron leaving is a point where you could say he was being a fair weather friend, but he left because he thought Harry was being cavalier about the safety of his family. Ron was a complicated character, but definitely Harry's most loyal friend.

***** The had no idea the spiders were giant, they didn't know where they were going.

Also, of course the series took place when they were underage, but legal definitions aside, there is a big difference between a 12-year old and a 17-year old, which is how old they were in book 7... And which, coincidentally, is the age at which he also abandoned them.

This is your rebuttal? That the preteen with crippling arachnophobia didn't know the spiders were the size of cars?

Again, ron left them because he:

A. Was disproportionately affected by Horcruxes B. Didn't.like that Harry didn't seem to care too much about the safety of the Weasleys(obviously untrue, but understable why he thought that) C. Didn't know what the gameplan was to stop the worst Dark Lord ever

He also tried to return instantly, but wasn't able to. I don't see how a moment of anger compounded by unfortunate circumstances erases all the loyalty Ron had, and the friendship he had with Harry. Your arguments read like something majorly influenced by the movies and their negative portrayal of Ron

Yes, my rebuttal is saying that knowingly walking into *hundreds of giant, man-eating spiders* is not the same thing as vaguely going in the direction of other spiders.

If you're saying the two are comparable, you're just being intentionally dishonest.

As for your other Ron stuff, that's a whole lot of rationalization, which I reject. Your point about about the necklace? They were all wearing them. It only exacerbated emotions which were already there.

Your point about how he "tried to come back immediately"? Total crap. I knew a guy in my neighborhood who'd get drunk, get angry, hit you and knock you down, and then apologize after. I wonder if you would be making the same bullshit rationalizations? "Oh no, he was under the influence, and he did apologize!". That doesn't redeem his actions.

It's not "a moment of angry", it's a pattern with Ron, because he did the same thing in book 4.

As for the movies, I've never even finished the movies. I've watched them once up until 7th one years ago.

**** "Follow the spiders," said Hagrid, to someone who has been established to have arachnophobia. "In the dangerous and scary forest during the night." Also, Ron still followed Harry to the Ministry to help him save Sirius from who they thought was Voldemort himself.

Edit: I would also like to add that Ron was the only one who even had the option to leave the mission or could lose something/someone in DH. Harry had no family and was Voldemort's number one target and Hermione was a Muggle-born, so she would be targeted by Voldemort and his regime either way, and she already modified the memories of her parents and sent them to the other side of the world. Ron? Ron had a whole family who loved him who could have been attacked or killed by the Death Eaters at any point and he was also a pure-blood and as such had a smaller target on his back than his other two friends. Of course he left, he was the only one who could!

****** You're right, although I don't know why you seem so fixated on this particular point since /I've/ never mentioned the size of the spiders. Ron still followed spiders (big enough ones to be noticeable, so not the small spiders the size of bugs) into the Forbidden Forest which he knew from first-hand experience was dangerous, and during the night to top it all. Did I forget to mention that Ron has arachnophobia? That's right, so the relative size of the spiders doesn't really matter when you take that factor into consideration. I also like how you oh so conveniently ignore my other points.

******* You make so many irrelevant and silly "points", you'll have to forgive me if I don't waste time on all of them.

The size, number, and temperament of the spiders matters very much. You seem very keen on equivocating some things, which is why I keep pointing out that they are not the same.

Following a cliff side when you're afraid of nights is not the same thing as jumping off a plane.

******** Right, forgive me to include a crippling fear when the situation at hand involves the subject of that very fear. How dare I not fixate on a single point while ignoring everything else!

#+end_quote

See, you seem to forget that a continuous trail of spiders actually involves a rather high number of spiders. As I also said in my previous comment, the size of the spiders they were following wasn't exactly small when it comes to spiders in Europe, since they were clearly visible and easy to follow. So, again, not exactly small, not car-sized, but not so small that you wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the forest ground. The temperament point I'll pass since Ron doesn't need to have the spiders actively climbing on him to be scared of them.

#+end_quote

You say this, yet you also seem to forget that phobias are, by their very nature, illogical. Your own analogy about heights is quite poor, considering Ron isn't only close/following his fear, he's following his fear to where he can only assume it will have stopped in an even greater number. Hagrid wouldn't have simply told them to follow the spiders unless their final destination was a place they would stop and where they could get answers or clues. That means that wherever the spiders are going, there'll be more waiting for them. So yes, Ron /is/ following a cliffside so as to eventually go up in a plane.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Indeed, how "silly" of me to prove that Ron is a friend that truly cares for Harry. After all, Ron sticking with him during the year the press and the government were after Harry to discredit him and making him pass as a dangerous fool. Never mind that he actually followed Harry to save Sirius from who they thought was Voldemort himself. But perhaps 16-years-old is too "young" and so this act doesn't count because it's only him being "brash and not fully cognizant of the dangers".

As a parting remark, I would like to add that one should never be rude, especially when they are wrong.
