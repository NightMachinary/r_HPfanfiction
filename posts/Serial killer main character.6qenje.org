Where in the main character believes Murder is the Best Solution. Snape trying to kill Harry? Tripped and broke his neck. Draco being a shit 4th year? A shame he was jealous and committed sucide. Umbridge? Yeah, that bitch is dead. Etc etc.

Where instead of trying to solve the mystery and come up with a (legal) non lethal solution, MC goes "they can't cause trouble if they're dead". Crack or serious, doesn't matter. Please and thank you.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent.

** I remember a story where Tom Riddle (not Voldemort) was Minister. Harry's parents were killed by some serial killer. Harry then started murdering people who, in his eyes, did not atone for their crimes. ie - they got away with it via the courts.

I just can't remember the name.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
