I am wondering if there are any Fanfics where Lily and James are alive (no abandoning Harry for his sibling/siblings BS) and live a normal life and it's not Harry x GInny or Harry x Hermione.


** You clearly haven't been reading fanfiction long.

There are so many of these I think it's even considered a trope.
