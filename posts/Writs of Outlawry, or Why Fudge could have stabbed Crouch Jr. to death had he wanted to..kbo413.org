This is a bit of headcanon/worldbuilding that I came up with a while ago. It answers the questions of why Dementors---who can't really do anything but kill---were deployed to hunt Sirius Black, and why Fudge had Barty Crouch Jr. summarily executed even after he was subdued---and nobody batted an eye as to the legality of the act. I think fits well into the Potterverse in spirit as well.

British common law (and other legal systems) have historically had the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw][/outlawing/]] or /Writs of Outlawry/. The subject of such a writ was declared to be outside the protection of the law, so that crimes against outlawed person---up to, and including, murder---were not considered unlawful. Rather than being imposed for a specific crime, outlawing was imposed for rejecting the authority of the court: "an outlaw was a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a summons to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a crime."

This concept does have an internal logic from the social contract point of view: if one wants the court to protect oneself from others, one must also accept its authority over oneself. In England, though it fell into disuse long before that, outlawing was not officially abolished until 1938.

Now, it would make sense for the wizards' legal system, borrowing from the British common law, to automatically declare someone outlaw in particular for escaping from Azkaban. Then, Barty Crouch Jr. and Sirius Black would simply have no protection under the law, and anything anyone did to them would not be illegal. Deploying Dementors with a standing order to Kiss Sirius on sight makes perfect sense in this context, as does Cornelius Fudge summarily ordering Crouch Jr. Kissed, even though the latter did not pose a threat to anyone at the time. In fact, if Fudge had personally stabbed Crouch Jr. to death, he would have been within his rights to do so, as would any other witch or wizard; maybe even a Muggle.

Would it make the wizarding world barbaric to make use of outlawing? Hard to say. Consider just how difficult it is to track down and apprehend someone who can teleport and is materially self-sufficient with a wand, if they have a modicum of competence, especially given how sparsely populated (by magicals) the world is, and how few law enforcement officers there are (per unit land area). Outlawing would have the effect of making it dangerous for an outlaw to interact with society---since anyone could both literally and metaphorically stab them in the back and not be punished for it---and make them lawful prey for, say, a Dark wizard looking for ingredients. This would serve as an incentive for the outlaw to turn themselves in and stand trial.

An interesting parallel is Australia: it had laws about outlawing until 1976, and made use of them as late as the late 19th century, applying them to bushrangers: robbers and thieves who could survive in the outback (i.e., "the bush"), which was too expansive to police. To quote Wikipedia again, "A judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special bench warrant requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw." This is not dissimilar to the situation the Ministry faces.

So, what do you all think? Does this sound consistent with what we see in canon in fact and in spirit? Has this element appeared in any fics?


** Except, I am quite certain that even in countries with the most harsh outlawry laws, officer of law is bound to stop killing an outlaw if new evidence reasonably doubting his guilt are uncovered. Killing Barty Crouch jr. is just a summary execution, and there is no weaselling out of it.

*** Sure! That's why I posted it. The only thing I'd ask is that you note that you got the idea from somewhere else, so that others feel free to reuse it as well.

** The problem is, no such writ/sentence was ever mentioned. I would think that should've been declared publicly.

Also, breaking out of Azkaban woldn't be enough for that in Sirius's case - not when he basically surrendered to the Aurors in 1981. I would assume you'd need more "proof" or incidents for declaring someone an outlaw.

*** Why would anyone discuss with Harry the minutiae of law that didn't apply to him? For that matter, in a hypothetical universe in which Sirius is outlawed, would he want to worry Harry by telling him that it's not just that the Ministry is hunting for him, it's that it's perfectly lawful for anyone to not just to kill him but to torture him to death? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, in this case. (Mind you, I /can/ imagine Snape pointing it out, but I can also imagine him not.)

I would also imagine that when (hypothetically) wizarding parliament (whatever it's called) made breaking out Azkaban automatically punishable by outlawing, they wouldn't be considering how peacefully someone went in.

**** Such a decision has to be published. You can't just declare someone an outlaw without telling everyone - people need to know that if it is supposed to work at all.

And I assume that the fugitive would first receive a public warning to turn themselves in or be declared outlaw, too.

If neither of those two things happen, all you have are secret "Kill on sight" orders.

***** There was a point in PoA where the "permission to Kiss" order was publicly announced, though. Lupin tells Harry about it when they have their first Patronus lesson; he says it was in the /Daily Prophet./

People make good points though. And I think for Sirius, it would clearly be an unjust order, since Sirius never got the protection of the law in the first place. For Barty Crouch Jr, though, I think OP makes a good case for the use of writs of outlawry.

*** Not to mention that Barty Crouch Sr deliberately failed to give Sirius a trial. He WASN'T offered the protection of the law.
