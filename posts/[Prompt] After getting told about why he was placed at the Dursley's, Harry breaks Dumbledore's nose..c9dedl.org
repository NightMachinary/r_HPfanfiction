Look at this mirroring Aberforth breaking his brother's nose at his sister's funeral.

** The anger filled his chest so quickly that it poured over into the other limbs of his body. His teeth clenched together while his eyes narrowed dangerously. His fingers curled into the palm of his hands. His blunt nails dug into the soft flesh of his young hands.

The anger had caused a pounding sound in his ears. It sounded like the roaring tides of an unsettled ocean. Though he could see the Headmaster's mouth moving, he couldn't hear anything over the enraged ocean in his mind.

He wasn't an idiot, unlike the general population believed he was. No, he wasn't book smart like Hermoine, but damn it he knew how to survive on the streets. He knew where to hide, when the larger bodies were barreling after you for a fight. He knew when to stand his ground. Knew where the best and worse places to hit the body were.

Take the nose for example. This small structure was connected to the sinuses. It wasn't as difficult to break like a cheekbone or the jaw. Hell, even if you didn't break it, it was still painful. A light punch could cause the eyes to water and the victim to back away in pain.

He knew this not only from observation but from experience.

Throwing the punch wasn't hard. You just even out your center gravity, put your left foot forward and the other behind at a forty-five-degree angle. You then bend your knees ever so slightly to balance yourself, then throw your right hand out thumb down. Don't throw your body into, his mind supplied, otherwise you lose your balance giving the opponent an opportunity to attack when trying to recover. Always, he remembered, bring your arms back to protect your face and kidneys. Those were the weak spots.

Dumbledore wasn't expecting. And why would he? He had never reacted this way before. He never was one for physical violence. Then again, Dumbledore didn't know him. He never would expect his perfect golden boy to take an opponent out A La Muggle, but Dumbledore didn't know what he had to go through at his Aunt's.

Now, the old man was staring at the younger boy with blood pouring down his nose and a shocked expression painted on his face. Harry was sneering at him behind two balled fists the were hovering in front of his cheeks. The old man opened his mouth to chastise the angered teen only to have another fist thrown at him. This time, his nose broke and leaned to the left.

Harry, resting on the balls of his feet, spoke while the Headmaster tried to stop the bleeding. "I learned this from my loving Aunt's home." His voice was dripping with venom. Several portraits had flinched away from the tone. The old Black Headmaster was watching on cheerfully.

"I quickly learned how to protect my vital organs," He spat behind his hands, "I learned how to endure a punch just as quickly as I learned to dodge one. Do you think I'm a natural seeker? No. That came from years of twisting and ducking away from fists that were bigger than my face."

Dumbledore opened his mouth to defend his actions. To defend the placement of his childhood. Harry quickly shut him up with a left hook to the side of his jaw. His tongue got caught in between his teeth. Blood started to pour into his mouth and down his lips from where the tongue was bitten into.

'YOU DID THIS!" He growled at the man. "You took my childhood away." He slammed another fist into the man's eye. His spectacles shattered on impact.

Harry backed up several steps watching the Headmaster before dropping his fighting stance with a sick smile. With a chuckle, he informed the man, "You took away my childhood. Now I'm taking away your savior." He then stomped out the office leaving a gaping and bleeding headmaster, several whispering portraits, on one that was cackling joyously.

*** I'm so happy!

This wasn't the direction I was expecting. I was thinking of Aberforth at Ariana's funeral, but this is good.
