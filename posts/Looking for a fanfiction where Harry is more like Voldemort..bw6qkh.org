I mean as in he tortures people who disagree and is extremely smart. It's even better if he's in Slytherin. I don't particularly care if there is romance or not.

  Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, suffered a remarkably similar past to the child Tom Riddle when he was put into the foster care system as an infant. He grew up equally charismatic, just as cunning, and with the same love for the chaotic.But, with no amorentia flowing through his veins, Harry did not share the same struggles to understand or to feign human emotions. Perhaps it was because of this, Dumbledore would muse many years into the future, that he had never suspected Harry as he had done with young Tom. At least, not until it was far too late.Harry's chosen allegiances were ones that they would never see coming.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

*** I like this fic. Harry isn't angsty, he has the trio+Neville and a bunch of friends, and it has a sympathetic Dumbledore.

  Yet Another True Story, chronicling the real incidents behind the myths in the books. (YATS, another genre like YATTFF). Rated M for safety. Chapter 5: Won but Lost is up. The events of 1981. The trials. Chapter 5: Word count 37.5k All positive canon characters are positive; their relations are tweaked.
