I found this story the other day, and despite me despising certain parts of it, some others I found enjoyable, such as:

- The 'world view' of the fic, which discusses and is set in multiple other schools (which one main character ends up attending) and countries.

- Harry being raised or being taken care of by an international wizarding family. He didn't grow up with them as family, so the dynamic between him and the other family members and his slowly changing view on them was a pleasant surprise.

- The Veela OC was actually intriguing despite the author's attempts to make her the best at everything, it felt as if the character's depth and life was an accident, something the author did unknowingly. I want to read more fics with Veela OC's now.

- Harry sticking to his views, but being able to adapt if necessary, albeit unwillingly.

- The mythical theme of the story was very well done, I want more magic that is mystical and ancient in fanfiction.

- The natural transitions Harry had between being cool and calculating, to being arrogant and self-righteous. It fit the character (who was raised himself on the streets of London) very well.

- The exploration of legends. I believe there was another story similar to this that I enjoyed, which had Harry with a sharingan (from Naruto) and had an extraordinarily convoluted magic system?

- Harry wandering around. Fics often get stagnant when most of the time is spent in Hogwarts.

The main gripe I had with the story was that the author would oftentimes make Harry unbelievably angry, for no real reason whatsoever. It makes sense for a child raised on the streets to have possible anger issues, but earlier in the fic he was described as being dangerously intelligent. It made no sense, as his anger often caused unnecessary problems for himself. The writing of him during these moments reminded me of a few translated Chinese web novels I've read, where the main character often encounters characters created purely to start conflict, who allow him to show off his 'awe-inspiring' skills whilst still seeming as though he's a saint. Other novels have these conflict-causing characters as the main character, which turns them into a very difficult read. Phrases like 'old fart' are common in both this fic and the web novels, which is a cause of cringe whenever I read it. Thankfully, treating these parts as though they were hyperbolized and intended to be cringe actually enhanced the reading experience and yielded a few laughs.

Thanks in advance for the recommendations!

** haha yeah i also realised its similiarity to chinese novels. apparently the author is a xianxia reader, that'd explain that.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.

**** I quite like them, but then that's largely /because/ of the magic system, so yeah... They are reasonably well written, I found them interesting but Harry is rather OP (some people like that, some not so much). It's been a little while since I last read them, but I think I quite liked Dumbledore's character in them, especially nearing the end of the story (I think Kaleidoscope one is the finished one?)

  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant, pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Grey, asshole Harry.
