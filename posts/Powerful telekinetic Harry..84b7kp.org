Any stories where the focus is Harry with Telekinesis. Incredibly powerful Telekinesis, so much so that he could rip apart a dragon, or city, as long as it's above what anyone else can achieve through magic(levitation charm, banishing charm, summoning charm, flight rune, etc...).

Prefer(though not a requirement) more than 40k, or complete.

Edit: if it's a crossover, i'd rather it be pretty light. By that I mean, few new powers, few OC, and few of the crossover characters. I want it to be predominantly HP with a side of 'insert crossover here'.

Thanks,

Warryn.

*** Read that story so many times at this point. I just wish I knew if they are going to continue it.

Thanks,

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** Sorry, I should have put this in the post, but i'm not looking for heavy crossovers. Something small like getting powers from another universe, maybe even some characters, but this rec looks like it's light on the HP elements. I mean it's a crossover with Avengers. That universe is so much more...everything.

Thanks,

Warryn.
