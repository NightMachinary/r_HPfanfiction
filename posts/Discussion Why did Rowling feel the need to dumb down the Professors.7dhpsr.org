Like most people I have a few pet peeves of the series that I wish had been written better; and one of the things that I have trouble with is how Rowling wrote the Professors.

Why did Dumbedore tell not only the students but Quirrell that the 3rd floor corridor was forbidden? Why didn't he create a age line so that no one under the age of 17 could get in?

Why didn't McGonagall do anything when Harry, Ron and Hermione told her that they knew about the stone? Even if she didn't believe that anyone was after the stone she should have done something about the fact that three first years ended up finding out about the stone.

Why did Dumbledore have Hagrid get the stone out of Gringotts? Especially when he was with Harry, eleven year olds are naturally curious, Dumbledore should have had anyone else get the stone, either Snape or McGonagall would have been good. And it definitely shouldn't have been when Harry was there at Gringotts to see it.

Why did McGonagall send first year students to the Forbidden Forest for a detention when there was something out there that could destroy unicorns?

Why was it that Harry, Hermione and Ron were able to get through the traps that were hiding the stone? Harry was the youngest Seeker at Hogwarts in a century, Hermione was one of the brightest witches, Ron was great at Chess. And the Troll; if the troll had still been up the gang would have likely been able to attack the troll since they did it before.

Did Dumbledore never ask Myrtle how she died? Obviously he knew or at least guessed that Riddle did it, but he never asked her how she died once she became a resident at Hogwarts. It took a twelve year old boy (Harry) to ask her. And it took a thirteen (I think she was thirteen) year old girl (Hermione) to find out what the monster actually was. If she could find out what the monster was why didn't the Professors?

Why would you allow Dementors at the school? Creatures that could suck out your soul; that is extremely dangerous, I get that they were hunting for Sirius Black but did they really need Dementors?

And other similar things that just feels that Rowling dumbed down the Professors for plot convenience.

I get that Harry was the hero of the story, but I just think it would have worked just as well if the Professors had been able to help out.

**** Well, Snape is Dumbledores "Spy" in School for the whole Years, despite Dumbledore "Knowledge of Everything" as he mentioned to Harry in Year 5. Dumbledore doesnt have trust (or dont see them capable to use lesser harsh words) the other teachers. The fact that Snape is the best occlumentic performer (besides Dumbles, maybe) proves that he cant read by the enemy on purpose. Still im wondering how Dumbles could "watch Harry in the distance as he fought the Dementors off"....and didnt do anything to help. Yes Snape is the only one that notices, because its his excercise to do this.

*** I get what you're saying, I do; it just seems like poor writing or just plot convenience as I said that the Professors didn't do anything to be more helpful.

Yes Harry was the hero of the story but heroes can have help, Dumbledore was a very quiet man, he didn't like telling people his plans even though he probably should have.

Why did he take the stone out of Gringotts? If he wanted it safe he could have been carrying it. Or kept it in his office heavily guarded.

I don't know when Dumbledore became suspicious of Quirrell but the fact that Gringotts was broken into should have made him think of a better plan for the stone.

Dumbledore wasn't the Headmaster when Myrtle was killed, but he was still a Professor. A professor that was skeptic of Tom Riddle, and didn't believe that Hagrid was guilty of killing Myrtle. If he was truly curious and suspicious he could have still checked things out. Hermione found out what the monster was, if Hermione could have done it Dumbledore could have as well and Hagrid wouldn't have gotten his wand snapped.

That is fair about the age line, it seems like some things she just thought up on the fly; but even so there could have been something else if not the age line to stop the students from going to the 3rd floor corridor.

And yes I get that it's a children's boarding school story and there are going to be things written in a way that's meant more for children then adults but the adults could have still helped protect the school and protect Harry and everything better. I don't know, maybe it's just me.

**** i could extend your List. While i do "eat" some of your Points, because "its a childbook series" (my favourite excuse for the Plot holes in the Books, atleast until 5, anything above that is argueable).

Year 2: Looking at it as an "adult" its really unbelievable, that the Teachers would trade Lucky Charms after the Heirs Attacks, they are the most powerful People on that Grounds and the Attacker might be just an adolescence, tops, but he would be noticed, i guess. But from a childs perspective, it has something funny on it. Still, if Dumbles didnt do anything to stop, but trusted like in Year 1, that Harry and friends solve this Puzzle, than he was taking a risk in offering the students lives and THIS was something he didnt tolerate at all, atleast if you take him serious in Book 5 and 7.

Year 4: nobody was thinking about Harry disqualify the Tournament. It was mentioned once by Hermione speaking for the solving about the Lake riddle, but thats it. Why did Crouch waited a whole Year for the Tournament, while he could take Harry outside of Hogwarts and let him take the Portkey?

Year 5, ignoring the fact that Harry should keep himself calm (he seems to really think that everybody thinks, he is lying. Its not even enough that his Friends believe him, No, ALL People in the World have to believe him so that he can die in piece -.- He is like Hagrid in Year 4, but unlike Harry, Hagrid pulled himself together). Nobody was thinking about the Mauraders Map, when Harry wanted to check on Sirius, not even Hermione....oh, not to mention that i still miss an Apology from Harry after the Ministry fight. The fact that Rowling "cut" this out makes me think, that Harry is a stupid brat and he doesnt need to apologize to his friend for leading them in a live-threatening situation because he was to thick to think rationaly (not that i blame him fully, but still. Im really glad that he regretted it in th end), because its naturally, that he doesnt need to apologize.

Year 6, Ouch. Everything is broken. Nobody is believing Harry that Voldemort could choose Malfoy as a Deatheater, not even thinking about that Voldy only uses Malfoy. "Harry, i dont think, Voldemort would do such a thing", "By all respects! Does ANYBODY know, what happens in Voldemorts Head?!" (<<<THIS, great Job, Harry, wonderful, both Thumbs Up for you). The Fact, that neither Hermione nor Ron do believe him and just focus on their envious feelings is just for the Plot sake.

Year 7, one of the Things that annoy, no DISTURB, me most is that Rowling made a correction about the Fidelius charm, just like that...out of the Blue. Clearly because she had to solve the "Secret keeper is dead, what now" problem...Oh, and again Ron and Hermione dont believe in Harry about the places, the Horcruxes could be, just for the stretching of the Books sake.

And why doesnt anybody thinking about calling Kreacher to get rid of the Deatheaters in Grimmauld Place?! Because it would be Boring, if the Trio isnt in a permanently Life-threatening Situation that "Testing" their Friendship.

Lets not forget, that Rowling makes Harry into a Cheater, since he gains the Firebolt. WHO of the other Pupils parents has enough moneys (or is willing to) to buy such a High prized Item, just for School sport purposes? No one of the others Teams Seekers has a chance against him. It might be that Harry and the Enemy seeker are "Head-on-head" on some situations, but that is a mockery to the Enemy in my eyes. And in year 6 he becomes a cheater because he has access to better Knowledge about the Potions brewing (note: Harry NEVER admits, that its not HIS doing, just his Friends know about it). Hermiones bigotry and intolerance are argueable (i think)....hmm, she wont believe anything thats not written in Books.....but what about her Speech at Year 1 "There is more than learning and Books", if i take her by this, her Friendship isnt true.

But we do expanding this Thread to a High level, the Title of it was for the Professors and not for the Plotholes.

***** While you're perfectly right it could be fun to come up with some (non-canon) explanations.

Year 2: Imagine you're Salazar Slytherin (a man with a known penchant for snakes). You expect it's going to be quite easy for anyone to work out what the monster you've left in the school is. However, you're a wizard who as a founder of Hogwarts has at least some notable power over it (enough to include a massive hidden underground chamber). Why not work in a self perpetuating confundus charm into the castle so that when the chamber is activated those who should be able to combat the threat are neutralised? Harry (as a parselmouth) is somewhat immune, and he always gets the right answer through the wrong steps anyway, so it's hardly the charm's fault if he gets there anyway.

Year Four: Similar to year 2, powerful magical artefacts change people's perception of reality, around their sphere of influence you actually CAN'T defy their intent. So, the Goblet of Fire binds Harry to the task no matter what. As for the abduction date, apart from Voldemort's insane melodramatic sense of fair play, it's approximately six months after his death-date, thirteen years after his defeat: there may be some arithmancy coming into play. If Voldemort captures him earlier he may fear that Dumbledore and co. will find Harry too early.

Year 5, are you actually talking about the mirror? I suppose you could suggest that Voldemort could have put in a subtle block about doing the sensible thing when sending him visions. He's certainly implied to have had that level power.

Year 6: I'm just going to abandon that one. It's a bad year.

Year 7: Maybe there have been advances in the charm theory for the Fidelius charm ... I guess that's possible. Maybe this is Fidelius Mark II. IT's about the only way I can even bear the disaster that that makes of James and Lily's attempt at hiding.

People seem very dismissive of house-elves powers, a bit bizarre, but it could just be cultural problem that even the main characters aren't free from? Also, getting him to do that wouldn't solve the problem permanently as long as any Death Eaters knew the secret, and at some point he might get killed like Dobby.

Anyway, that's all just for fun.

****** Hmm, a Confundus Charm for the chambers Protection....But Ron and Lockhart are Witnesses as its opening.

Oh, right. If i remember Voldemort mentioned in the Beginning that it was yet to early to perform the Ritual and in the end he revealed that he was preparing for this Night to be "revived". Or that Voldemort had to get stronger by Wormtails "feeding" or he would be to weak to become as strong as he was before he vanished or to die during the ritual.

Mirror? I mentioned the Mauraders Map...Ginny and other DAs took Guard but was taken down by Umbridge. With the Map, they would had an alerting system.

True, the Fidelius was only mentioned in Year 3 and 5, but it was precise enough. If the new Rule was that any "keepers" became Keepers after the Mainkeeper dies, thatn the Guardians in Year 5 actually had to drag Harry into the Black House, instead of giving him the note. Nah, i dont believe the Trio suddenly dismissed in House-elf magic....remember, after their escape Harry was thinking about the Meal, that Kreacher had prepared and would now be cold untouched, HA! Plothole, Harry WAS thinking about the Elf, but the idea to use him for help wasnt coming to his mind, not even Hermione and Ron. The Intruding DEs would just be memorized to forget they visited and entered the House. I doubt there would be many Legeilimentics Among them. An obvious Plot hole just for the Thrilling sake, like i mentioned: it would be boring (would it really be?) if the Trio would have had a save place to return. Oh, nor that i think about: Kreacher wouldnt be alone, Harry could have ordered Dobby for Help. Jesus, Harry now that you are good friend with the Grumpy, you dont think about using him.

Sorry, I was thinking of the mirror Sirius gave Harry to talk to him at Christmas ... and which he forgot. If he'd used it the whole problem could have been avoided. I'd forgotten that they hadn't used the map. :(

Definite plothole, though maybe he thought that a bunch of Death Eaters were just sitting on Kreacher waiting for him to be summoned or something of the sort. Harry was never particularly sane, or logical. Maybe Hermione was on to something when she mentioned many of the greatest wizards weren't logical, perhaps magic impedes logic.

  Why did Dumbedore tell not only the students but Quirrell that the 3rd floor corridor was forbidden? Why didn't he create a age line so that no one under the age of 17 could get in?
#+end_quote

The dead troll is precedent for having obvious traps in the way that Voldemort had bludgeoned his way through. It would have cost little to show two or three more of those, but more obviously dangerous. An age line might not have been appropriate -- unless it were set to something greater than Quirrell's age, or unless it were bound with other protections that Voldemort would have needed to remove.

Doesn't alter the result, does underscore how dangerous the situation is and how powerful Voldemort is, takes /maybe/ two extra pages. But it's the sort of thing that you likely wouldn't notice even after editing.

#+end_quote

They were allowed at the border of the school grounds, officially, but they exceeded their mandate.

#+begin_quote
  I get that they were hunting for Sirius Black but did they really need Dementors?
#+end_quote

This is actually a pretty believable part of the story. It was Minister Fudge employing the age-old syllogism: something must be done, this is something, therefore we must do this. The Dementors didn't help. It was obvious they wouldn't help. But it was a simple thing for him to order, and it was a public sign that he was responding to the situation.

** Bah writers using random acts of character stupidity to cause plot is a blight on good storytelling. And yet all the supposedly good writers (bookes, movies, games, doesn't matter) are apparently all lazy hacks.

I really think the story telling world would be better off if any would-be-writers were forced to DM a game of DnD first, hence being introduced to how to tell a story where you can't rely on characters being dumb just for your convenience.

With HP the problem is that is started as the so called "Children's boarding school story" or some such, where the tropes are expected, and because they are expected they are also accepted, and nobody looks too much into them.\\
But then it kept going into at least the young adult genre, which has ENTIRELY different accepted tropes. Looking back at especially the earlier books, well.... most of those tropes are really bad and have some rather unfortunate implications if viewed without the cover of being a children's story.

Personally I don't care for Doylist interpretations, I like my story to be internally consistent as much as possible from a Watsonian view. So when I look and see these implications caused by the wrong trope in the wrong genre, I much prefer the explanations that make some sense in universe, even if they are reaching (manipulative dumbles) rather then the much more boring explanation (Rowling is a shit writer).

** I like to imagine that the reason the professors seem so dumb is because they're worrying about bigger things and you literally don't see all the different things that the adults are doing to protect the kids because it's from the kids' point of view.

Highly subjective narrators, like Harry, artificially distort the motives and actions of others. It's important to realize that while reading any story, but especially the HP series where Harry does things like trust Fake Moody all year long and nearly die or go from wanting to murder Sirius to wanting to move in with him in ten minutes.

*** oh, i wouldnt say, he "trusted" Fake Moody....well, ok, he felt "save" in his presence, because Crouch perfectly doubled Moody (not so obvious for the viewers sake in the Movie) and not even Dumbledore had any suspiciouns about his Friend, untill the End at least. So where is the Reason for NOT trusting this Man...or feeling Save in his Presence.

And About Sirius....you calling Harry a subjective Narrator, but there were also Hermione and Ron, not to mention Lupin. All of them were listening to the Confession Wormtail made. Harry was just happy that atleast one part of his "past" was still alive and he could asked Sirius anything about his Parents live. Maybe it would be an awkward situation since Harry believed a whole Year that Sirius was a Murder, but its just that he only known him before the Year began, because Sirius escaped.

** ...Harry was always meant to try and get the Stone, Dumbledore deliberately dropped all those hints.

Dumbledore never thought to ask Myrtle because Dumbledore, for all he was a great wizard, didn't ask others for advice, or try to think of things outside his preconceptions. And to be fair. All she could tell Harry and Ron was that she saw a big pair of eyes. Most animals have eyes. An Acromantula could have stung her fatally before she got a look at anything but its huge eyes as it beared down on her, if she was caught by surprise by it.

As for Dementors, wasn't it in-text that Dumbledore was railroaded into having them at the school, it wasn't his idea?

Because that story would be terribly dull.

  Also Cornelius Fudge was always shown to be a scared man way over his head, so it's rather in character for him
#+end_quote

was he? i thought that his "Scaryness" was just because of the Public Pressure. But that would explain why he ordered a Dementor to deal with a simple poor Deatheater in Year 4, who was captured and guarded by a Teacher....wow, what a Deed. Jesus, think about he would stalking any Dumble-fans in Year 5 with a Dementor because they could endanger him O.o
