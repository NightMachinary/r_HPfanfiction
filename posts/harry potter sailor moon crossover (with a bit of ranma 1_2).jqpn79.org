:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i went looking for a very specific harry potter x sailor moon fic today but it seems to have vanished into thin air?? i was in the feels to read a really sad part of the fic but that's elsewhere.

its a harry potter fic where harry initially ends up fucking teleporting halfway across the world to china, trips into a pool, and comes out cursed with the body of sailor moon whenever he touches water. harry (and ghost usagi) travel to japan and kick some japanese villain butt. mamoru and usagi eventually fall apart bc he's older and he's seeing other girls, and harry stuck around with usagi.

anyways its weird bc i vividly remember reading this on ao3 but its up and disappeared now

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon
