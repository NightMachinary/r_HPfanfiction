  Harry didn't understand why Voldemort had suggested their marriage as a solution to the war. He didn't understand why his friends were supporting the suggestion. But he goes into it, trying to be as numb as possible, trying to retreat into his mind and just let the world play out around him---no matter how difficult that is.

** Linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles) is probably the most popular fic where this happens.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED ‚ô°]
