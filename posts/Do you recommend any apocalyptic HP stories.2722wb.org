The ones were Voldemort wins and its like a rebellion were they're forced to infiltrate etc.. Usually dark harry


** As an extension of this anyone have any that are about Muggles?

Basically one where wizards are the Muggle's Apocalypse and they exterminate the muggle population.

I read Rise of the Wizards which was great but I couldn't find any others like it.

** If you would like to give dark Dramione a shot I definitely recommend one called Resilience that I read a couple of years ago. If I recall correctly it's extremely well written, may be too dark and angsty for some people, though.

** I highly recommend "Sunset over Britain" and its sequel, "Sunrise over Britain". Not a dark harry story, but the world gets rather dark as things move along. It's also very well written. It is rather long, but when I first read it I couldn't put it down.
