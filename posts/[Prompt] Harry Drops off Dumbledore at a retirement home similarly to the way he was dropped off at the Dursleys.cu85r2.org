So was inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cu2zcf/lf_stories_where_harry_keeps_dumbledore_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]]

I know Rorschach's Blot did a omake about it, but write a fic where Dumbledore gets dropped off into a retirement home.

Can be humorous, can be serious, I'd love it if it has callbacks to the first chapter of book 1.


** Pretty sure this was how Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia ended, with Dumbledore in a Muggle nursing home with his magic bound.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
