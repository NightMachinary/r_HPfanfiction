So I'm about 80% sure this fic has been taken off ffnet since I've been looking for it for years by using specific term search in google and scouring the grey harry communities and never found it, but even just hearing someone else who read it would be very nice. I actually remember a fair amount from it, so I'll just list all of the relevant details off in what i hope is chronological order.

I'm fairly certain that it's a HPB AU, set after 5th year (also think Sirius died)

The earliest scene I can remember is Harry standing by Hogwarts, and he literally tears it from the ground and floats it to some island, probably Azkaban.)

He lets students stay in the now relocated castle (including Malfoy), and there's a scene where they are in the entry hall or smth and there's a glowing floating orb and they have to touch the orb to see if they are trustworthy or not. Hermione and Ron don't go to the castle at first, but I'm pretty sure Hermione sends an owl and goes later on in the story.

This is where things get fuzzy and I can't tell what order it happened in. In no particular order, the scenes I remember are:

Giant stone dragons possessed by the souls of the Hogwarts founders

Harry claiming himself to be the heir of slytherin at some point (not actually the heir, I think he claims the power because he bested Voldie when he was a baby)

Slytherin being a glowing floating orb talking to Voldie in his mansion

Seamus being on a ship and fighting Dumbledore/Voldie's ships

There being a dock where Dumbledore and Snape go talk to Harry and I think Snape chooses to stay

Madeye choosing to stay

Ginny being there

Luna being the weapons department expert where she makes robotic weapons and has metal spiders guarding her R&D area.

And last but not least, I remember that it had insanely long paragraphs. And I mean long. A page worth of information in one paragraph.

As you can see, I remember a fair amount, but have never been able to find it again despite extensive effort, leading me to believe that it has been taken from FFnet.

Any help is very appreciated!
