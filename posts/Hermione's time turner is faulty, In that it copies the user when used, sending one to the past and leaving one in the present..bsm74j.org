So it clones Hermione. The one in the past doesn't know this has happened and the one in the present thinks its broken - at least until she sees her other self that is.

My take on it (in spoilers so you can make your own without being influenced)

50 Hermione's and 2 Harry's sitting in a room wondering what the hell they're going to do.


** It depends on when exactly it malfunctions and how. A very important question is what happens to the time-turner itself. Does it,

- Copy itself? If it does, it's a setting-breaking item, since anyone with just one can make as many copies of it and of themselves as they want.
- Stay in the present?
- Go to the past?

If it malfunctions during the year, I think you'd end up with 2-3 Hermiones before they realise that something is wrong and stop turning.

In a nutshell, the Hermione left in the present, when she realises that she hasn't gone back in time (and if she still has the time-turner), might question whether she had forgotten time-turner and try again. After the second failure, she will probably go to a teacher. The two Hermiones sent to the past would run into each other in the classroom, and then do their best to avert a paradox by separating and hiding out until they are caught up. (If their time-turners vanish, they would immediately report it to a teacher, which would have the same effect.)

If the time-turner goes to the past, then the Hermione left in the present would go to a teacher immediately. They would eventually run into the one who'd been sent to the past going about her business, unaware of anything going wrong.

Some further thoughts:

- I think that Hermione would probably get along with herselves just fine, as would most people. The [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues][Cloning Blues]] trope is, in my opinion, overrated. In fact, Hermiones might get along /too/ well, to the exclusion of others. (Remember, she's being shunned by Harry and Ron over the Firebolt at this point.)
- If one of hers figures out what's going on before she surrenders the time-turner and decides to think big, she might make more of herselves for the greater good.
- A cloning time-turner itself is an invaluable artifact, since it can duplicate everything, including wands and Philosopher's Stones.

Also, I had a related idea a while ago:

/[HBP, about midway through.]/

*Hermione:* So, after seeing how well drawing inspiration from Dark Marks to enable DA to communicate worked out, I asked myself, "What else can we copy?" Anyway, I read up on the Potion that Voldemort used to give himself a new body, and I realised that with some tweaks, it can be used to make copies of a whole person instead.

*Harry:* Have you tested this?

*Hermione:* Of course I did! I don't brew recklessly, unlike /some/ people. Anyway, I can now spare the time to figure out what Draco has been up to.

*Harry:* Spare the time? How many times did you copy yourself?!

*Hermione:* Well, I'm the me that volunteered to help you with Draco; there's another me in the library, researching the Half-Blood Prince; a me in the Gryffindor tower working on McGonagall's essay; two more mes in an unused classroom, sorting out if all of me can use Legilimency to resynchronise our knowledge and mental state; and one last me, setting up the next round of copying. I haven't checked in with that me in a while, so there might be more of me by now. In fact, the hardest part is finding wands for everyone. Even the Potion is simpler, because you can use your own bone and flesh, though blood still has to come from an enemy.

*Ron:* Blimey... Is that why Malfoy has been looking even more pale than usual?

*Hermione:* ... Yes, probably. Oh, and Ron, how do you feel about a harem?

*** I did have an idea for why Hermione can't get her other self to stop using the time turner, some sort of protection intended to prevent paradoxes stops anyone from telling past Hermione until she takes it off.

I think they'd notice something long before the end of the end of the book.

Anyway, the Hermiones form the study group to end all study groups and eventually take over Wizarding Britain.

The Harries get into a fight over who gets to be the Gryffindor seeker. :P

*** I /really/ hated that part of The Prestige and the assumption a lot of fiction makes. Your copy would be closer to you than any other human being could ever be. They would be a person whom you would understand completely and with whom you would agree on everything. You would get along with them if you can get along with /anyone/. Killing them would be worse than fratricide.

***** So, first of all, apparently, back when I saw The Prestige a long time ago, I had missed the point that Tesla's machine didn't actually work and it was a trick-within-a-trick, this one aimed at the movie watcher.

With that out of the way, it takes a lot for an otherwise sane person to murder family, and we know that we are generally favourably disposed towards people who look, think, and act like ourselves. In fact, I daresay that if you were to ask any of these writers what would it take for them to murder their own copy, they would put the bar about as high as they would for murdering their own brother or sister.

In this particular case, there is absolutely no reason even 50 Hermiones with 50 wands (which would also be copied) couldn't all attend Hogwarts, though some of them might need to be resorted due to dormitory space constraints.

****** Oh yeah, my reply was strictly related to the prestige and not applicable to hp.

To the point where the conflict created by the killing of his original self was a major plot point of the movie.

Now a hermione all out brawl and fight to the death is completely out of character, but psychopaths do exist
