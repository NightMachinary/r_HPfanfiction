One of my favorite fanfic's ever was the "Harry's Seventh Year" series where Dumbldores Army reunites and fights back in secret. I was wondering if anyone knew of any similar stories. Preferably canon pairings or at least H/G


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Year 7 saw heavy actions by the Trio who were operating mostly independent from the Order, but were employing various other assets (Weasleys, Scotland Yard, SIS, School Classmates). During the Final Battle, [[/spoiler][Order participation was minimal, Riddle and his Death Eaters were mostly destroyed by Hogwarts kids]]. Canon pairings.

** Blood of the Phoenix linkffn(4776013) and its sequel linkffn(6519893) have Harry and his OC wife forming an advanced study group that also fights Voldemort. It's Mary-Sueish and Harry is a little overpowered but it's still enjoyable.

** I'd like to second this request, but without the canon pairings :) (I despise Harry and Ginny - no chemistry there IMHO (hell, what's that meme? - "Not even the movies believed it"?)...chest monster! Neither do I like Ron/Hermione...they don't fight like "an old married couple", they fight like people who couldn't make a relationship work because they'd ruin one another! (hell, Rowling herself admits that this was wish fulfillment on her part and that Harry and Hermione make more sense!))

I'd also like fictions where Harry recruits other allies (we know he has got an open mind and doesn't treat creatures (goblins for example) badly, so it's not out of the question that he could find other help) :)

ps: @OP: Great request (except for the canon pairings!)

*** /massages temples/

That's not what Rowling said. She said in some ways Harry and Hermione could have worked better than Ron and HERMIONE but ultimately with some counselling hermione and Ron would have worked. She also said in the same interview that Harry and Ginny were soul mates.

You're entitled to your ships but that interview is constantly misinterpreted.
