  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I really like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]]). It handles the whole thing with a lot of maturity and really examines the consequences of becoming a cold-blooded murderer for the greater good - especially how people might react if they ever find out.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

**** Yeah. Harry going from "We're back in time! Let's prevent the holocaust and the end of the world by killing the nazi leaders" into "I shouldn't have killed Goebbels! Now his child is sad" simply was too damn stupid. Especially after he lived through said holocaust.

It might have worked if the two actually had gone overboard - but killing marked Death Eaters, after all they have gone through in the future? That was a very proportionate response.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

It never indicated that Hermione would tolerate Ron as anything more than a somewhat friend. Their personalities clash so violently that it would be a shouting match every day, not exactly a loving environment.

Harry and Ginny's scenes were completely forced and out of fucking nowhere, if she at least had spend some time with them in the rest of the books...

Also, the author said the same thing in an interview. She forced it and regretted it.
