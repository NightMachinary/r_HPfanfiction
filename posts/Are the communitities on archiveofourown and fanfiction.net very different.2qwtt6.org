I started reading harry potter fanfiction about 9 months ago and I've noticed that the top fanfics on archiveofourown are very different from the top fanfics on fanfiction.net.

Archiveofourown seems to be primarily 'Drarry' and slash/relationship based. However, even though I dislike the ship, I've mostly stayed in a03 because quality control seems somewhat better there.

Just wondering why the fandoms are so different.


** Yes. Archive is about 90% slash, while FFN.net is about 90% shite.

**** There's no hosting site which has a high amount of quality content, because hosting sites are open to everyone who wants to post a fic. You just have to trawl through and find good fics amid all the rubbish.

One useful thing is to go through the favourites lists of authors you like. Another tactic is to go through old recommendation threads on HP forums.

** Archive requires a wait to sign up and start posting, which tends to lead to better quality fic since someone who is posting crap usually won't want to wait the few months it takes to get an account. It's also a site that is largely populated by tumblr communities and older writers, which tends to result in a lot of tumblr popular ships and general porn. In addition, the tagging system leads to porn because of how specific you can be to find the right 'market' for your fic if you're writing niche porn. So you get some FANTASTIC fic when you find the good stuff, like, some of the best you'll read sometimes because of sheer quality and in-depth characterization. But you're going to have to wade through a significant amount of porn to get there. Fanfiction.net on the other hand is a very old, very well known fanfiction site. Everyone who wants to try fanfiction hits it up at some point, tagging is basically nonexistent, etc. You're going to find much less porn because of it's restrictions, but also a lot more general crap because everyone regardless of talent is going to post there.

**** Ugh this. Dunno about Ao3, but hpfanficarchive has the same problem. So many fics that are just Category: everything Characters: all of them. Pairings often suffers the same.

Generally if I look at a fic and the category/characters is a wall of text, I ignore it and move on.

***** Exactly. While there a ton of issues with FFN, I can't fault them for putting a limit on characters and pairings in the description. It solves the problem of mass tagging at least.

Trusting people not to tag everything is stupid, especially when if you /don't/ do it, you lose views because everyone /else/ does anyway.

****** Yup. Limit tags to 2-3 items, so authors have to choose the most applicable, that potential readers will care the most about. Personally I've given up on using hpfanficarchive entirely, because the tag spam means I can never actually find what I am looking for.

Given that, I've got some AO3 account invites sitting around specifically for redditors, if anyone wants one. Oops, foiled that quality filter. PM me.

And, err, check out my porn while you're there.

** AO3 doesn't really have a community to speak of. It is an end point for people who use other services to talk. It doesn't have forums or even a PM system, so it doesn't have a good way to gather on-site. FFN has lots of forums and personal discussion tools, but few people you'd want to actually talk to as a sane adult.

FFN has anti-porn housewives patrolling it and lots of teenage crap submissions, whereas AO3 has no quality control or censorship whatsoever but also virtually no "edgey", AU, power-fantasy, forced slave harem, millionaire, real-world high-school, 8th grade writing level, teen drama fics.

I've written some straight porn on AO3 and gotten zero backlash from the mostly slash audience and writers and several individual compliments. So in that sense, it is better than the FFN community treats slashers. My M-rated straight action/romance fics have gotten a good reception as well. I strongly recommend it for explicit erotica and romance. Though it is still a little thin, the quality is usually quite high.

** There is some crossover, where people post on both sites (generally uncensored on archive and censored on fanfic, but otherwise, generally archive does have a bigger ratio of erotica (straight and slash) than other sites (at least for all the fandoms I care about to look up fanfiction for), the stories listed there are /generally/ shorter than on fanfic for some reason as well.

So, TLTR, yep.

** The basic difference is that the core of writers at the Archive (AO3) are long-time slashers. The idea of AO3 originated from slash fandom and the founders were all older slashers active on slash fandom on LiveJournal at the time. The older slash community on LJ generally consisted of fans who'd migrated away from FF.net completely and formed much more mature communities of writers/feedback/beta-readers/etc, or from even older fans who came from Usenet or late '90s mailing lists or sci-fi fandom--basically LiveJournal is what people migrated to when they "graduated" from FF.net. All the best fandom writing of the mid-2000s are still to be found there, though discovering fics there is much, much harder now that LJ as a community is basically over. Pinboard.in is probably your best bet to find great LJ fics. LJ fics are, again, primary slash, and the high quality is, again, due to the critical community that tends to form around slash and the generally older age of slash fandom writers.

Beginning in 2008 with the founding of AO3 and really picking up speed in 2010, when LJ started getting hammered by Russian political DDOS attempts, all of the LJ writers moved to AO3 and merged into Tumblr. That's why the quality of AO3 is better and also why it's so heavily slash. It was founded from slash fandom, and the vast majority of fandom activity on both LJ and Tumblr is and always has been slash.

Sources: Fanlore.org generally, personal experience as a longtime fan who lived through all this stuff, an [[http://www.dailydot.com/society/tracking-livejournal-fandom-diaspora-infographic/][article I wrote]] about the LJ diaspora, and Tumblr's year-in-review [[http://yearinreview.tumblr.com/post/104214981882/most-reblogged-ships][Top 20 ships listing]] for the prevalence of slash.

**** No problem! :)

Personally I'm really proud of AO3, because it's something that came straight from fandom and is run by/for fandom as part of a non-profit organization. I think slashers probably have more of a vested interest in protecting their fanworks like this because we're used to being historically misunderstood and attacked by creators in a way that people who write het fic may not always experience. Although there's more of an overlap between het/slash fandoms than ever, so I think ultimately it's all fanfic and the difference is more about quality/experience than what pairings you write.
