Looking for some good stories about Harry getting summoned to another universe where his parents are alive, whether by Fate/Death giving him another chance, via a ritual, or just general "how in the name of Merlin did I get here?"

Preferably where his parents are alive but he's not due to whatever reason.

***** Nonjon posted a rough outline of an epilogue set decades in the future. It wasnt a chapter, more a series of ideas he thought about putting together.

Sirius had a dozen or so kids after marrying and divorcing a heap of witches. He kept blaming the best man at his weddings for letting him marry such women, so he went through just about every wizard he knew. Harry had about the same number of kids but had never married.

Ghost!Ginny could touch and pick up the babies, which Harry figured was the reason she hadnt passed on (a weasley woman dying without becoming a mother -the ultimate unfinished business). So they had a nanny that didnt sleep and doted on the kids.

Tom and Harry had a friendly competition to see which of them had the better deadly plan to be the best dark lord. Harry believed he was winning with his idea to fidelius the oxygen in the atmosphere and axphixiate everyone. Sirius though they were crazy.

Tom was dying much earlier than expected for a wizard of his power. Voldemort was a goldfish and kept headbutting the glass to get at them. Harry and sirius arrived at Toms place and Tom drank a potion that gave him horrendous farts specifically to annoy sirius.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]] is short but worth it. It is in James' POV, and very wonderful for it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World in Pieces]] by Lomonaaeren doesn't have alive parents, but it is pretty good and complete, and Harry has to deal with the fact that he isn't the first Harry they have called across. Which, really, in these stories should be an issue, as if people do it once, they can do it again. linkffn(4180686; 6730432)

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** I really liked that chapter. For a moment i thought the author just went all fuck you and decided he didn't want to write the story anymore but instead of starting a new one he just sends Harry to another dimension.

I'm glad i was wrong and i think this was one of the best uses for the Dimension Travel Trope i've seen so far. Giving Harry some closure and then sending him back was a great idea.

On a side note; i hate what that fic is doing to Tonks. (Not the actual idea behind it but i'm rather invested in Tonks' emotional and physical well being in pretty much every fic i read...)

  What if Death wasn't an entity but a job? What if Death wanted to retire and offered Harry and his new loves a new chance in exchange for taking up the job from him? I came up with this story when one of my followers requested a story with the pairing of Harry with the Carrow twins so here it is.
