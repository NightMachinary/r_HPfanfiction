Does anyone thinks it's strange that Harry never got his NEWTS? I mean Harry wants to be normal, but chooses to not finish school and choices the auror instead. That has always seen so out of character to me ! Like I want to be normal so I'll use my fame and get my new job. Even in a fanfic just some story about Harry doing his NEWTS on his on terms then becoming a auror would be nice. Harry graduates school then gets a job a story !


** The British Ministry of Magic resembled more of a failed state after the Battle of Hogwarts. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the great Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's hordes. Large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its own security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and reputation after the war. The Ministry NEEDED Harry Potter, not vice versa, to become a viable institution again.

This teenager army, who had held off some of the most dangerous dark wizards and their Auror collaborators, didn't need bureaucratic tests to prove themselves anymore. They were already much much better than those old 'Auror' scums!

*** Although they had scored a major victory over the evil, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on the Ministry immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best.

But after the horror and suffering of the past year, do you honestly believe they would leave their fate to those soulless bureaucratic Ministry minions again? No! They would take matters into their own hands and forge their own destiny!

After experiencing the attempted genocide of Muggleborns and mass torture of Hogwarts (especially his beloved girlfriend), do you believe Harry would really care about 'being normal' anymore?

**** J. K. Rowling is constitutionally incapable of imagining a “good” revolution which does anything but reestablish the old social order plus one or two tiny adjustments.

(I joked the other day that Lucius Malfoy might still have a career in politics following the Deathly Hallows, but the more I think about it, the more likely that is in Rowling's post-series world.)

***** It's not only her, but most of the Hollywood "superhero and supervillain" literature is bent on maintaining the status quo. Only the Matrix Series offers something refreshing.

--------------

I'm of the opinion that the Old Order in Wizarding Britain is no longer tenable, not after what had transpired in DH. If the Ministry was somewhat capable and managed to hold off Voldemort from a takeover, then the Old Order could have survived, at least for much longer.

But after falling so easily and after turning Hogwarts into a mass torture prison camp? I think all bridges are burnt by this point.

****** Yes. It's one of my biggest pet peeves. That and “This one finishing blow will conclusively end the war! Villains hate it!”

I much prefer radically different post-DH Britains, as you say.

** Does Harry want to be normal? I can't recall him ever saying or thinking such a thing.

Regardless, Harry doesn't like learning for the sake of it, has no authority figures telling him otherwise, wanted to be an Auror to begin with, and was probably begged to help round up escaped Death Eaters. So it's not so great a surprise to think he'd drop out to get a headstart on something he wanted to do anyway.

*** He doesn't care for his /fame/, which is different from wanting to be /normal/.

He didn't want to deal with the press or the absolute rollercoaster that is public opinion, but even without all of that he'd still have jumped on the back of a mountain troll, gone after a Basilisk in a sewer, fought off a hundred-odd Dementors, or deliberately walked into a death-trap to save the people he cared about.

** In the 90s, although it's a little different now, leaving school with just GCSEs and not A levels was completely normal. In HP terms that would like leaving after OWLs. There are some jobs, and certainly going to University, that require post 16 education but not as much as you would think, at least back then. Also in the UK you don't graduate from school you pass exams, you don't graduate till university. If Harry wanted a job that didn't require NEWTs then it would be perfectly reasonable to not do them. The fact that the books specifically state that he needs NEWTs to be an Auror mean that he should go back and do them for that, but if he doesn't then it's less of an issue.

** It's quite common at the end of a war. In The Netherlands in 1945 all final year high school students got a diploma without taking the exams.

** Most post-war fics resolve this by Harry getting his NEWTs by the extra-Hogwarts exams after self-study and while working on his Auror training.
