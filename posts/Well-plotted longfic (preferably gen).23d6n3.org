I'm graduating with my Master's in a month and I'm looking to celebrate my newfound freedom with some really engrossing, plotty longfic. All eras and characters are acceptable, although I do prefer romance be kept to a minimum. Oh, and no cross-gen pairings, please.


** I don't know much about your preferences, so you'll have to see which one's are to your liking yourself.

- [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][HP & the Methods of Rationality]]---Author uses the HP universe to introduce readers to rationality, cognitive tools for rational thinking, biases, fallacies and so on. Later on the story gets derailed somewhat into a more regular fanfic that's written for the sake of itself. 561,157 words / ~700pages in total (WiP, updates very slowly).
- [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Alexandra_Quick_Series][Alexandra Quick series]]---Characters and the setting (Charmbridge Academy, U.S.) are original. I haven't read it myself, but it often gets positive reviews from others. You can get additional details about the story [[http://quickipedia.wikia.com/wiki/Quickipedia][on its own wiki]]. 866,854 words in total (WiP).
- [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]]---generally it has detailed and believable characters and thoroughly worked-out plot. Among drawbacks are several repetitively reused plot devices, Idiot Balls used to drive the plot in the author's intended direction, slash, and gore. You can read a longer review on it [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1so5rg/looking_for_fics_that_talk_about_house_elves_or/cdzx3qw][here]]. Hogwarts era AU, covers all 7 years. 2,853,818 words \ ~3,200 pages in total (complete).
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7090918/1/01-Albus-Potter-and-the-Forgotten-Memory][Albus Potter series]]---A post-Hogwarts series portraying educational years of Harry's children and Draco's son (who become friends). I've only read the beginning of the first book, but the characters and relations between them seemed to be pretty well developed. Can't say if the story keeps its quality later on, but that's likely the case. 331,493 words in total (WiP).
- There is also [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/James_Potter_%28series%29][a James Potter series]], but I have no idea what it's about---I've just discovered its existence recently through Goodreads.

/p.s. Congrats with your degree!/

This is an either love it or hate it fic. I can't stand it (Harry sounds like a smarmy asshole, and I hate the Dumbledore character), but many people do like it (for some unknown reason). Worth a shot if that's your thing.

This reads far more like an entirely new series set in the HP universe, rather than an HP fanfiction. If that's your thing, you'll probably love it. I wasn't very interested in it, but it's definitely high quality.

**** I liked HPMOR at the start for the science-nerd humor. The science used is not mere hand-waving, the fallacies presented are famous ones, and the logic is complete. There are influences of Ender's Game there which are kind of fun. It is one of the rare stories where romance and family are not crutches for developing the characters. Last but not least, the story is well written.

Don't get me wrong: the story loses it's charm over time, Harry is rather annoying, it is obviously aimed at people with a very dominant rational side, and most of all, it tends to get overly preachy. I have stopped reading it, despite what I consider the strongest first 50k word introduction segment in fan fiction (mostly due to the fact that the humor is to my liking).

So it's not love or hate only. It is a story with a lot going for it, and definitely stands out for being unique in the HP fan fiction landscape.

*** Thank you! Generally speaking, my preferences are for mystery or thriller stories with lots of plot or things that delve into unexplored corners of the wizarding world. I also confess a fondness for well-done, if slightly WAFFy, fic where Sirius takes in Harry, but these are somewhat easier to find than the former.

** Renegade Cause : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause]]

This story is definitely worth a read. The plot is great, the writing is great (and get better after the first few chapters, I personally found the first two chapters a bit strange), there is a strong background story and the universe is quite widened

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] is the absolute best longfic in my opinion. It is so well thought out and maintains the multi-level plot that is expressed in the real books. I highly recommend it. There are also two more books in the series, equally as long.
