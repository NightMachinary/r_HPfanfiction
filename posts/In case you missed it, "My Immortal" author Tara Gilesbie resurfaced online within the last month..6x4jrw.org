Yes, as we all know, "My Immortal" is the fanfic that gave all fanfics a bad name, and I am not approving of it or celebrating it by any means. However, for those of you interested in the saga surrounding the fic, it would appear there is now an interesting epilogue:

While Tara's FFNet account was hacked and taken down, what nobody seems to have known up until now is that she had [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/518933/XXXblodyblaktearz666XXX][a sister account on FictionPress]], which has remained intact. By following that link, you can see that Tara - and I don't think there's any doubt that it's the real Tara - left a message thanking her fans and explaining that FFNet's Support won't allow her back on the site. In her exact words: "I can't say I blame them. They're probably scared I'll flood their site with poorly written sex scenes again."

*IMPORTANT UPDATE:* All signs now point to "Tara Gilesbie" actually being the YA author Rose Christo, judging by [[https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/search/my%20immortal][this series of messages]] on her Tumblr page. While the mystery may indeed finally be solved (pending verification from an outside source), please respect Ms. Christo's privacy during this time. While I am in no way connected to her and am only discovering this at the same time as the rest of you, I am sure she doesn't want a big deal made out of this. If she wishes to say anything else about her work, she will arrange a time and place to do so.

*EVEN MORE IMPORTANT UPDATE:* It would appear she's a fraud - maybe she didn't lie about writing "My Immortal", necessarily, but she seems to have lied about several other things in her life, and it's severe enough that her memoir has now been cancelled. Go [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/75nzp0/rose_christo_had_her_memoir_cancelled_deleted_her/][here]] for further details.

We have a starting point for unraveling the mystery, but there's a lot of things still unanswered.

I have a theory that could explain the inconsistencies. Was "My Immortal" perhaps written by a tag-team of authors, each one picking up where the last one left off? Similar to what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleny,_or_The_Reverse_of_the_Medal][Oscar Wilde and friends did]] with the gay erotic novel "Teleny"?

********* *Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal*

Teleny, or, The Reverse of the Medal, is a pornographic novel, first published in London in 1893. The authorship of the work is unknown. There is a general consensus that it was an ensemble effort, but it has often been attributed to Oscar Wilde. Set in fin-de-siècle Paris, its concerns are the magnetic attraction and passionate though ultimately tragic affair between a young Frenchman named Camille de Grieux and the Hungarian pianist René Teleny.
