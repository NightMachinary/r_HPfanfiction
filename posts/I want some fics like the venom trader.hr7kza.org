** Oh ffs it's called the venom peddler ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13330853/1/The-Venom-Peddler]])

It was the top result for a google search on “venom seller fanfiction”. If you don't want to help, just don't answer, but quit whining about stupid shit.

OP, are you looking for “harry gets a basilisk” stories, “harry travels the world” stories, “Luna is awesome” stories, or something else entirely? Like most good fanfic, there's enough to recommend it that you have to be specific about which bits you want more of to get a helpful response.

**** Two best that I know of are listed below. There are others. Again, google is your friend for this type of search; ffnet and ao3 have quirky search engines, to put it charitably.

** I can think of a couple off the top of my head. Give me a bit to dig up the links.

Edit: Also, I apparently suck at threaded responses. My bad

** So, you expect us to find what story you are talking about, then divine from our understanding of it, what you like about it, and then to suggest something? Why should we bother, when you don't care enough to ask properly?

*** I'm sorry if I wasn't clear let me reiterate: I'm looking for a story that has similar themes and/or plot points to the story called "The Venom Trader" where after fighting the basilisk in second year harry goes back down to the chamber.

**** Right, but what plot points are you wanting to match? Just that Harry returns to the Chamber at any time for any reason? Lots of fics have that.

**** Better, but which site it is on. I cannot find it neither on fanfiction.net nor archiveofourown.org. Either provide link using the mechanism described in the sidebar here, or at least post full URL of the story, please.
