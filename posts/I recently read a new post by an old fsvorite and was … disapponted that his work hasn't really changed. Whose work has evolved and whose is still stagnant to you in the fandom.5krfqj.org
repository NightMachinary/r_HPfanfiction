#+TITLE: I recently read a new post by an old fsvorite and was … disapponted that his work hasn't really changed. Whose work has evolved and whose is still stagnant to you in the fandom?

Favorite and disappointed*


** I don't entirely understand what you are looking for. Are you expecting someone else to have changed because you have? It seems unfair to be disappointed. If this is an 'old favourite', you must have liked it at one time, so that suggests it's just that your tastes have changed and you are probably more discriminating than you used to be. That is a Good Thing, but though plenty of people do change and develop it's not fair to /expect/ it.

*** I always expect better of others than myself.

I'd like to see who people think have improved in their writing and who's remained stagnant---in the redditor's eyes---clinging to old cliches/tropes and not trying new things.
