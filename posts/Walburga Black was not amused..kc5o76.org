Holding up the front page of The Daily Prophet, all she could do was scowl. It was bad enough that the philandering blood traitor was being given credit for dear Bellatrix's rightful role as the Dark Lord's right hand, but now the Prophet was decrying that filthy castout as a Black in their headlines? No, this would not stand. Not one bit.

Knowing what she must do, Walburga threw down the offending newspaper and called for Kreacher. It was time she gave the ministry a piece of her mind.

TL;DR: Walburga Black clears Sirius's name after the attack on the Potters out of pure disgust with the notion of him being associated with the Death Eater members of the Black Family.

** She'd have just enough time to do it, too. Sirius Black got incarcerated in 1981, Walburga died sometime in 1985 (according to Da Wiki, anyways).

It wouldn't surprise me if there's 4 years of red-tape and legal battles in getting someone out of Azkaban, regardless of whom it is.

Imagine if Walburga went through with this, and /the very last thing she does/ is spring her son from Azkaban - without being able to tell him why. I think it'd confuse the heck out of Sirius, which is a hilarious thought.

** Okay, I love it. I know for a fact that there are some stories similars to this premise, but I cannot remember their names right now, and they're not about Walpurga's disgust (which is a loss, in my opinion).
