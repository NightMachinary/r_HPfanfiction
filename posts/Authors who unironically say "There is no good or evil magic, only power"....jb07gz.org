What the fuck is wrong with you, you utter psychopath? OK, so I'm a fan of Harry Potter SI's, to be more specific I'm a fan of main characters who have meta-knowledge of the setting, and generally like to learn magic. So I was trying to read linkffn(Harry Potter: Lost Son) and it's one of /those/ self inserts. You know what I mean, within the first half of the first chapter the author's self insert is already ranting about how dumb the wizarding world is, and how nothing makes sense, and how stupid and antiquated the laws regarding dark magic is and goes on to unironically talk about how stupid it is that Dumbles and the ministry don't want to use the Unforgivable because they're not /that/ bad.

Like dude, there's a spell which literally only exists to torture people. That's not good in any way, it's like exclusively bad, Ahh it's just so annoying to find these things.

And I know, I know, plenty of dark!Harry fics exists, but with SI's you can normally tell when the author is treating it as an OC with meta knowldege vs as if they themselves were literally in the setting, and reading about an author essentially condoneing torture and other atrocities /as if they were the character themselves/ is incredibly disturbing to me.

Edit: I had a look at some other reviews for the first chapter afterwords (reviews later on complement it as a masterpiece, bleh) and yeah there are a lot of other standard shitfic tropes, polite Goblins, Goblin healers, Goblins blood test inheritance, Mansion in a Trunk, etc. And that's just first chapter reviews. I can't imagine anyone who could stomach reading further even realises when something is right or wrong, so I've got no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.

*** Maybe having magic accelerates healing (this is why Quidditch players aren't all dead yet), but some dark spells damage the map of what counts as part of the body and gets to be rapidly healed. So what you do about that? You force every nerve ending to send a brief "I exist" message to the CNS, with the details of the message decided by the caster's intent, so that a person's magic can intercept those messages and rebuild a map of where the body is and isn't. The problem arises when dark wizards use this specialized medical spell on healthy people, with the intent to cause as much harm as possible.

** Well a wise man once said that "If we do not learn from the mistakes of the past, we are doomed to repeat them" and then another wise man said that in order to truly understand history you have to view from the eyes of the perpetrators because otherwise you just compartmentalize it(or I guess identify as the victim). I think that one of the reasons why certain people write and think and speak in such a way, like your example is because for them it is abstract. Maybe it's a self insert but not in the turest sense because they don't make it real, they keep it abstract.

It would actually be a very interesting read of a self insert when someones then has to actually struggle with the moral ramafacation if his new powers. Where does on draw the line? Your kid is grumpy? Why not a cheering charm? Everyone does it! Hey LovePotions seem to somewhat legal. Soo there is that super cute girl....I mean everyone is doing it soo no big deal right?

** The way I understood it, "Spells" in the Harry Potter universe are used to standardize the will of the wizards. During their childhood, Witches and Wizards use "Accidental Magic", but their effect are unpredictable. A child who "wants" the cookie jar may summon it to his hands, just like he could teleport right next to it. So spell are learnt and used to "control" their power.

Because of this understanding, I always liked to compare the "Spell" used in Harry Potter to tools. Just like Muggle created specialized tools for each different tasks, Wizard created Spells. And in the middle of all these Spells, the "Dark Arts" are the weapons of the wizards, created to fight, hurt and kill.

Basically, "Light" spells are the spoons and forks of the Magical World, while "Dark" spells are the swords, spears, and axes. Technically, someone could use a Light Spell to hurt someone, like someone could use a spoon as a murder weapon; and someone could use the Dark Art to do something harmless, just like someone could use a sword to cut a load of bread. But it doesn't change the fact that each spell was created with an intent, using the Sectusempra to cut paper doesn't change the fact that it was created in the intent to cut "enemies".

I agree with the idea that Magic is not Dark in essence, but it doesn't change the fact that anyone using the Dark Art is Dark himself.

Like the one about cruciatus being originally intended to start a stopped heart -- perhaps someone took a medical spell that did something along those lines, and experimented with it like a sick, maniacal doctor. Tested it on patients (victims), tweaking it and twisted it to make it cause intense pain, and pushed it so far through hatred and willpower that the abomination of a spell that it resulted in requires the hatred and intent, and that corrupted version is what became known as the cruciatus.

That's crazy. I can't really imagine the kind of /healer/ that decides they need a swift and perfect way to perform euthanasia.

Because if you are considering it, it means that all other means and resources are tied up in healing/stasis effects.

I mean, with Draught of Living Death and human transfiguration both being a thing, if there is no shortage of potions AND personnel skilled at precise applications of magic, euthanasia would be almost absent, because short of some seriously dark magic, you can pause the patient and spend days, months or even years finding the solution.

KK would, theoretically, be a way to end a life with minmum of focus, no interference, and no time wasted. Not that I believe it likely, just playing devil's advocate.

** I've commented already with a comment about the stupidity of many authors' mechanics of the cruciatus curse.

But to provide my own thoughts on the ethical discussion in many comments:

1. Both sides are taking incredibly reductionist approaches to the issue

   1. On one hand, you have "Harry's torture of Bellatrix was good." No, no it wasn't. Torture is never okay. For those who say that torture is fine in a situation where lives hand in the balance, remember that torture simply does not work. Which we know from actually torturing people.
   2. On the other hand, you have "nothing's okay if it's not legal." Great, tell that to the civil rights movements in the 1960s in the US. Tell that to the people who smuggled Jews out of Nazi Germany. Not all laws are ethical. Not everything unethical is illegal.

2. I do also think the context of spells matters as well. I don't think anything can really be reduced to "good" or "evil". Using the killing curse on an animal about to kill you is not an evil action by any means. Nor would I consider it good. That said, it's hard to justify the imperius when confundment exists for the situations given as examples (stopping suicide). Why use the imperius when you can just confund them?
3. Many, many people here need to review the unforgivables. For example, see how the cruciatus is, in fact, blockable in HBP. The issue of the intent behind them is not as clear-cut as many people make it out to be (See Deathly Hallows, GoF, and OoTP).

Imperio could be used for any number of things and is obviously a violation. But so is obliviate, and that's government policy to use on innocent muggles.

In my mind, it means that you have to want to torture, no, you have to know deep in your heart that those you use the cruciatus on aren't worthy of anything /except/ torture. That the person you kill with avada kedavra life was so utterly meaningless that killing them isn't even on the scale of consideration when it comes to whether you have the right to kill them or not.

1. The popularity of moral relativism among fanfic writers. The idea that something could be inherently good or evil is seen as old fashioned, prejudiced, etc. I think a lot of this is probably due to a backlash against "traditional Christian values" and imperialism- morality has come to be seen as a tool to oppress other viewpoints, cultures, sexual orientations, etc.
2. Some of it is also probably just writers trying to show how "edgy" they are.
3. Most SI fics are probably written as, essentially, power fantasies on the part of the author, and having to worry about whether an action is right or wrong gets in the way of the fantasy.

** I generally dislike the idea that Magic itself has any sort of morality built into it, or at the least, if it does have morality that it would give any sort of a shit about human morality.

Thus I think magic isn't inherently evil, it's what's done with it that can be.

As mentioned by most others, I can easily see the unforgivable's having more benign or practical origins (whether or not those origins are actually practical or even feasible doesn't matter much to me as I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for magic). For example, I've seen in a couple of fic the killing curse originally being created as a humane and bloodless method of killing livestock. It only became an unforgivable after it was perverted by some magicals into the killing curse we're familiar with.

The important thing is not the magic itself but the user of said magic. Are there evil magics? Of course there are. But that's not because magic itself has deemed them to be evil, it's because evil magicals /made/ them to be evil.

** To be fair, it is extremely easy for things to be labeled dark when that label really shouldn't apply (not all werewolves are Greyback; yes they need to be careful for a night or two a month, but the rest of the time they are just people with an illness), and other things to be labeled acceptable when it really should be labeled dark or at least extremely restricted (for an example of the latter, look at the implications of obliviate and love potions).

In a sort of counter of the obliviate and love potions thing, I'm curious what kind of magics there may be to force a tense arm holding a knife at someone's throat to relax and remove the knife without any spell impact jerking/spasms/knockback or otherwise letting the crazy person have a chance to react aside from imperious, because if there aren't that could put it up there with obliviate as extremely dangerous but theoretically having fringe cases where it could become acceptable.

Also don't kink shame, I highly doubt there would be absolutely zero BDSM people who would have no interest in or at least curiosity about the crucio and/or imperio in the bedroom under explicit mutual consent (admittedly few, but still >0 lol).

Oh, and I will say that using lethal force /in times of war/ should be an acceptable norm for anyone not willing to engage in serious reprogramming (which brings up moral dilemmas all its own and should only be considered if the gene pool is unviably small as-is), since not doing so when magic can reverse nonlethal takedowns in seconds makes nonlethal war an extremely deadly tactical error in and of itself. OTOH, I will agree that the killing curse isn't something that just anyone can/should use, as canonically it requires hate (not just intent to kill like some fanfics suggest), and probably damages the soul of the caster far more than say a lethally aimed reducto. Afaik we lack confirmation on the question of magic-resistant creatures like basilisks, dragons, or nundus facing the AK too, as theoretically they may be able to ignore it or survive with just a chunk of skin/flesh blown off, which puts a big hold on arguments about using the AK for rampage control.

As for those rants, a lot of that boils down to how the little of the world we've seen looks kinda bad TBH. Maybe not /that/ bad, but definitely not perfect. Love potions being openly sold? Ludicrously laughable kangaroo courts sentencing people to death or worse with minimal deliberation or even being skipped entirely (FB&WTFT + Sirius references, respectively)? The human rights violation that is Azkaban (admittedly we don't know how Nurmengard works, for all we know that could've been built in some kind of magical dead zone or on some ancient something or other nobody knows how to reproduce making dementors a more practical if regrettable means to prevent accidental/wandless magic among prisoners)? Quill and parchment (I think I saw a fic somewhere suggest this actually had a function of imprinting and holding a magical signature of sorts from whoever did the writing, which could make this a legit anti-forgery method if true)? Rampant corruption (look at me, pot and kettle given IRL politics lol)? Systematic bigotry (seemingly worse than IRL issues)? Apparent extreme ignorance of muggle tech /by the person supposedly functioning as an expert/ (which admittedly could be an act but if so Arthur never reveals it to Harry or the reader) in an era when surveillance and instant worldwide communications are becoming more and more prevalent almost by the day and casual digital video photography is in active development and maybe a decade or so away at most (even if magic shorts it out automatically, that doesn't mean nobody will ever start to notice and get curious about dead zones)? Yeah there are issues with the wizarding world.

That all said, yeah some tropes are stupid and annoying and it's generally best to keep certain magics as off-limits regardless of intent (somehow I doubt good could come from horcruxes, but then again D&D did come up with the concept of the Baelnorn so I dunno), but sometimes I like some corny cheese if I'm in the right mood so yeah to each their own.

** Killing curse might be useful to stop rampaging beasts that are resistant to less powerful spells. Cruciatus would be useful if the goal is to not kill it. For example dragons are rare, endangered and take several stunners from multiple wizards at once to subdue. If there's only one wizard available to stop a dragon from flying into a city possibly killing thousands, normal spells wouldn't be enough.

** I'm going to make the assertion that Rictumsempra can be a far worse torture spell than Cruciatus. At least the ancient Romans thought tickling someone to death was a lot worse than Crucification. But do you know what the worst form of torture is? Muggle torture, such as a dentist drill, followed by healing spell so you can torture them day after day, night after night!

Avada Kedavra is very humane when it comes to killing, at least far more so than beating someone to death with a Muggle golf club.

Imperio is great for preventing someone hurting or killing themselves or others. Maybe it was the Wizards who prevented Muggles from launching their nukes in 1962 or 1983?

*Intentions*, not the means, matter far more. Same with nuclear and other weapons: you need deterrence to keep the peace and prosperity.

As for how to prevent you from abusing the power, the answer lies in the balance of power, because the other side is not stupid.

The Unforgivables exist as they are, and as nasty as the Cruciatus is, threatening to use it hopefully scares most criminals from using it too.

If you actually feel the need to use the Cruciatus and are willing to do it then you probably don't care anymore about what horrible things might happen to you when you get caught - you're either already too far gone or you completely believe that you won't get caught. The threat of the authorities using it on you will not stop you. Ignoring that the authorities in the HP world /don't/ use the Cruciatus or /any/ unforgivables, they send you to Azkaban instead which is worse.

Regardless of what you think construes proper retribution, things can look very different both in the heat of the moment and/or if there are strong emotions tied to the action. If someone deliberately murdered your beloved mother right in front of you, you likely wouldn't have a calm and collected reaction, rather attempt to get retribution. It's all well and good to sit here emotionally detached and rationally thinking and condemn the actions and thoughts of others, but at least in the example of Harry casting the crucio at Bellatrix /moments after she murdered his godfather in front of him,/ it's a foreigner conclusion that unless he was sociopathic, which I don't think JKR has retconned yet, he would /not/ be in a stable emotional state /or/ thinking clearly.

I would like to clarify in this that I am using the general ‘you' rather than the second person singular form so that you (2nd, s.) don't think I'm attacking you specifically.

** It's just an issue of moral relativism versus moral absolutism. Is killing a person always a bad thing regardless of context or circumstances, or is killing sometimes okay under particular circumstances?

I can't think of a legitimate use for the cruciatus curse as it's presented in canon, but otherwise, I think that every 'dark' curse we come across has a potential moral or amoral application within a moral relativist framework. Something like the imperius curse could be very helpful for quick and dirty anesthesia in an emergency, which is a moral thing within a moral relativist framework, but is an unforgivable thing in a moral absolutist framework.

Considering there seems to be only one purely awful spell that everyone can think of, a moral relativist could absolutely unironically say 'there's no such thing as good and evil magic' while still being reasonable within their own moral framework.

** Expanding on what [[/u/PuzzleheadedPool1][u/PuzzleheadedPool1]] said

If you back your HP fanfiction to where there is a.. more sensible magic system behind it all (and clearly it simply isn't studied/known to the practitioners), this not only makes sense, but is almost a requirement. This usually isn't done with "the spell isn't evil", but more of "blood magic isn't evil, just all of its users/known applications" or something.

The problem is that doing the above is *really* hard in a fanfic so it usually falls flat.

The other option, which is basically 'there is no logic to magic' and lots of 'rule of cool', then yea, it makes little sense to say there is no evil magic, since, you know.....

** Is a gun inherently evil? Or is it the one pulling the trigger?

I agree that the Unforgivables and the Horcrux ritual are clearly dark magic, it's why they are /Unforgivable/ in the first place, and even the book named "Magics Moste Foul" warns the reader that the Horcrux is some fucked up shit. But aside from those, I can't think of a single spell mentioned in the books, movies or most fiction that is inherently evil. Some might point out the Entrail Expelling or Flaying Curses (I honestly can't remember if they where ever mentioned in the books, but it's ubiquitous in fan fiction) as prime examples of "dark magic".

But tell me, would that make your local butcher a dark wizard? After all, he would use those spells every day when rendering carcasses, the flaying spell to neatly remove the skin, and the entrail expelling curse to remove the internal organs without damaging the flesh.

Some might argue that /any/ combat oriented spell such as Stupefy, Reducto or Flippendo are dark magic, because you cast them with negative emotions, in a negative situation with the intent to cause harm or discomfort. Yet Aurors and "good" wizards use them all the time and no-one bats an eye.

Magic (for the most part) is neither dark, nor light, it merely is.

** As far as this: linkffn(12418957).

Also with regards to the Unforgivable Curses, they are inherently evil. That's why they are called "Unforgivable" but they are still used for good purposes in the original series. Harry uses Imperius to get Voldemort's Horcrux, uses the Cruciatus to defend McGonagall's honor and Snape uses the killing curse to put Dumbledore out of his misery and save Draco's soul.

I think the original idea was that Voldemort was justifying his actions through that statement but as the book started to orient itself more towards more mature audience, it would also imply that the use of dark spells was subjective and dark magic was not evil in itself but the purpose for which it was used determined that.

** Why are we having this discussion again? Its FAN-FICTION!!! A exploration of possibility's and what ifs. Nothing is wrong with using older tropes, doing a spin one that old one, or a new trope in a series. If you want the canon story read the books over again.

There is a LOT of things authors do that are a lot more egregious out there, other then redoing the origins of a spell. (cant talk about them here, R.8 or the like)

Because if the 3U are the worst spells imaginable, there is a reason for magic users to fear the muggles, there lot that you can do to a person, to hurt, to kill, and to control without magic.

There is a time and place for torture, someone your planing to kill anyway and want them to suffer more then death could do or to punish a person quickly. Why are so many people soft skinned nowadays, letting crimes go unpunished properly because somehow we are better people now with technology and such. (Its mostly a western thing) ...Or you know they are in to that kind of thing, don't kink shame the masochist (it only encouraging bad behavior).

A story can have nice Goblins or worse Goblins, how much interaction did we have in canon to really decided what they could act fully or what they are fully capable of. There was WARs between Wizards and Goblins, they have to be able to do magics and stuff somehow.

It can have buildings in trunks, there is a premise for it in canon. Expanded trunks and Tents.

Again its this is Fan-Fiction.

...Fan-Fiction of a Story that's world building is still Swiss-Cheese, with post books work done through other means. Don't hold yourself back by the imagination of a Author.

** In their defence, one may note that the unforgivables are justifiable if it is to save a life or for just retribution. For example, an imperius can be used to stop somebody from committing suicide by jumping off the cliff and the killing Curse for self-defence or for euthanasia if the caster is willing to kill. The cruciatus on the other hand, can be used for just retribution as when Harry tried to crucio Bellatrix after she killed Sirius to avenge his godfather and it will be idiotic and unfair to Sirius if Bellatrix isn't properly tortured. By her deeds, Bellatrix has shown scant regard for the law and therefore she merits no protection under the law.

You can make spells that are just torture just like IRL you could create bombs and use them from household items. Dark magic is defined in a separate category from the unforgivable and the description of what dark magic is in the series is broad enough that spells which probably exist or existed at some point would have literal mundane uses which could be used for great evil with just a little effort. There are a lot of troupes that are genuinely terrible both logically and in how often they come up, I'd suggest getting up in arms over them rather than something that at least has some reason for existing.
