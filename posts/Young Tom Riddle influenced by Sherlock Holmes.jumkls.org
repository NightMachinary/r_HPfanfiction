I've seen stories where Harry Potter is influenced by the Sherlock Holmes stories, identifying with either Sherlock Holmes or James Moriarty, which led me to think about young Tom Riddle.

Do you know any stories with the premise that Tom read Sherlock Holmes? After all, the stories were quite famous. Around the time that Tom Riddle was a child, there would have been several play and movie adaptations already, aside from reprints of the stories. Maybe some patrons donated books to the orphanage and Tom read them.
