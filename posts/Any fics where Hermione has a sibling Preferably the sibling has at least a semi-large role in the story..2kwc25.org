Preferably in the Hogwarts era, but that isn't a requirement.

The entire premise of the Dangerverse series is that Hermione's older sister raises her (and a kidnapped Harry) after their parents are killed in a death eater attack. Its been a while, so I forget the details of how she meets Moony and ends up kidnapping Harry with him, but its an entertaining read. Fair warning, the sister is older and doesn't attend Hogwarts as a student, but does visit iirc. Not sure if you were looking for a more contemporary sibling or not, Hermione does end up being raised as a for all intents and purposes besides blood sibling to a number of characters.

Hermione is raised as Draco's sister in a world where Voldemort won the first war. It's more a retelling and focuses on Harry, but since Harry is friends with both Draco and Hermione, the sibling bits do come up.

--------------

Both are heavily AU, but cover the time period where Hermione is at Hogwarts and has a sibling. I haven't read anything that is both close to canon and involves a Granger sibling.

** I don't remember the names and can't look through bookmarks since I'm on mobile, but I remember an incomplete fiction where around age 5, Harry uses accidental magic to do an animagus transformation to escape some particularly nasty abuse from the Dursleys. I don't remember if it was physical only or sexual too, not that it matters a whole lot. Harry stays in his animagus form for an extended period of time and wanders through the English countryside, eventually wandering into a yard because he smells someone like him. Lo and behold, it's the Granger residence. He winds up being raised by the Grangers and considers Hermione to be his sister and best friend. The fiction was abandoned sometime in year 1.

/Edit/ - I should mention that when I get home, I'll look through and see if I can find the link for you.

*** That sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] which is not abandoned. It's a pretty long one, 300k+ words right now, and looks to be in roughly second year. Last updated 2014-10-25.
