Is there a fanfiction where Harry is the only male magical person in the world? I read a fanfiction with this genre but sadly it was a horrible writing and it doesn't satisfy me at all. Are there other fanfictions with the same genre as this?

P/S Sorry for the grammar, English is not my first language.


** There are several Harem fics that come to mind, not so much Harry being the only wizard but Wizards being in the vast minority to witches. The Firebird trilogy is probably the best example.

*** It's alright, it still fits my objective. Any other fics?

**** Not of the top of my head. I'm sure I've read similar ones (although Firebird is a little higher in quality) but I can't really recall them.
