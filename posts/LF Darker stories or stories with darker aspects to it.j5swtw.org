*Not looking for Harry being dark/evil*, I like Harry neutral, or on his own side, or working with Dumbledore, more then him working with/for Voldemort.

But just having darker aspects of stories. It can have light moments, I don't want it being 100% dark, or with dark aspects, but throughout it is fine.

*Note: I don't want Harry abused by the Dursley's just for the shock value, same for rape and the like, if there is anything of that nature, I'd like for it to be a reason, and it to mess up the character or characters more mentally*.

I do want them to recover (If they can), or have help with friends/people they trust. I don't want it being 100% gloom and doom.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

I love the Weasley's and don't want them bashed. I hate when the authors have the Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune.

I'm fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.

Doesn't have to be Harry focused, can be any other character(s) too.

Doesn't have to have everything that I'm looking for, but definitely do NOT want evil/bad Weasley's. Or rape/abuse just for the sake of it.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
