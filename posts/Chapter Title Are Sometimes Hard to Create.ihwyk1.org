I am writing my HP fanfiction, which has 33 chapters. All of which have titles. They came naturally to me. But now I am starting to struggle coming up with names for my next chapter. They just sound uninteresting and sometimes weird. I have no idea why. I can't just stop naming the chapters because it's going to be confusing if I do. Any help here?

Thanks so much in advance.


** Off the top of my head based on the chapter description in other comments:

Perfecting the Patronus

Happy Thoughts

Would you like a link to the fanfic? I dunno if it'll help.

**** “Silver Shadows” (as a reference to Patroni)? “Where Your Joy Is” ... it depends on what's really going on and what's important in that chapter.

Or some other reference to them. They are nice, intriguing.

****** Had he displayed this prowness in teaching before? Did he know he had this skill before but just didn't show it until now? Was it a surprise for him as well?

If it is the main, like in this case, usually you would like to talk about the action of assisting... if it is a background usually you can focus on the noun as in "assistant"

Also, you mention patronus... is there any other relevant spell he is teaching, that might also be a good title.

******* He just helps and tutors others if he can. Like helping your friend with homework type of thing. No surprise. Nope, it's just the Patronus.

******** If Patronus is heavily featured you can focus in that (The Patronus Enhancer). or work with the patronus etymology. (The Protection Tutor?)

**** Also, how serious is the story? Does it have humorous titles? Long ones? Small and simple ones?

***** It's just mainly simple and short ones. One or two words. Not really humorous. How serious is the story? Umm, not sure what you mean by that. Its my take on the wbwl Harry but he's adopted by the Flamels. Guess its kinda serious...

****** Ask yourself what do you want to tell with the title.

Saying "The Teacher's Assistant" just speaks action, plot.

Something like "The Deputy Professor" marks the character after actually taking the role of the teacher in substitution or of a more fixed role.

YOu can also focus on how this teaching position translates in the story....Was it new to him? (A Teacher Within)... Is he not sure about taking the position (The Reluctant Helper)... Is it more focused on the actual task of "help" instead of "knowledge"? (A Moment of Guidance) Is he reevaluating his future? (A New Career Path)
