So as title says this is to gauge interest, mainly because I feel like the story with Harry taken off the board could lead into some interesting and potentially darker directions. Big ideas:

- Ron is the main POV/protagonist , mainly because I feel like his fan fic love of him in the lead is sparse & because of the next point.
- Sirius sees what he once was right after James and Lilly's deaths in Ron, so he takes Ron as his pupil to try and help them both get through the grief.
- Hermonie emotionally shuts Ron out, processing her grief rather poorly by distancing herself in an attempt to minimize more potential grief. She still is his friend though, but much more is off the table due to the strain this emotional distance puts on their relationship .
- Diving into the various family connections. Since Draco and Ron both are pureblooded, come from branches of family by female heirs and are probably near age to claim lordship of House Black. Sirius seeing power in the name of the ancient house in the upcoming wizard war under a new lord, without a criminal record & Draco wishing to stake his own claim out of his father's shadow.
- *Edit: Since people keep on focusing on this, let me point out, the lordship while a tired trope won't be played for politics, Ron or Draco becoming Lord black would be similar to the boy who lived, an element of the character but not the sole defining aspect.*
- Harry did actually die (along with the Horcrux part of himself) , it was Crouch Jr.. Who was able to complete his attack, before Dumbledore and McGonagall could find them.
- Ministry covers up the murder of Harry using the Daily Prophet to "suggest" it was suicide brought on by intense mental stress & that "maybe" it was Harry who killed Cedric, using the Voldermort excuse to cover it. All the while downplaying Crouch's escape & capture as coincidence.

I want to start off with this low point because losing Harry should carry this weight, especially with the Order of the Phoenix now coming off their biggest loss going into year five's events. All so the victories building up feels a bit more triumphant, so know that this isn't a "dark for the sake of dark" fic

the black fortune is rather sizable and having a worthy successor would mean the money would go to a trust worthy person

Instead of the whole Lordship thing, it could be sirius Growing into his Role as a black and starting to throw his last name around to get things down sort of like how lucius uses his last name and wealth to get things he wants to get done

*** This. Whole milieu of HP universe is bourgeois, middle class, heroes are mostly businessmen, tradesmen, bureaucrats, that sort of people. Aside from Malfoys we really don't see anybody who even behaves in aristocratic manner (notice, that even Blacks for all its declared nobility lived in one house in the middle of London, no manor house is ever mentioned). *Nobody* (including Malfoys) ever claims any degree of actual nobility (the only lord in whole story is Lord Voldemort and that's just fancy name, nothing actually meaning anything). Ever mentioning of actual nobility is when Hermione (and Remus) just mentions that The Half-Blood Prince being actual prince is a nonsense, because “there are no princes in the Wizarding world!” (OK, princes doesn't mean nobles, but still, it does sound irritated enough to be completely out of character for the wizarding world to even think about such things).

Yes, it is technically possible (or even probable), that at least some posts on Wizengamot are hereditary, but remember we are talking about community of some ten thousand of people, there is not enough of anything to acquire astronomical wealth and grandeur. Wizengamot is more like a town council, not The Houses of Parliament.

In the very moment you say the phrase “Lord Potter” (or even worse Lord Weasley), you are getting massively AU, and you have to basically make a complete whole alternative world to the one JKR made. Wouldn't it be better to switch to some other fandom?

**** The whole miliue is wrecked when you remember: Harry is rather well off after he is found by Hagrid to the point he possibly never needs to work a day in his life if he used his money right that he inherited as the last member of House Potter and more so with his inheritance from House Black when Sirius is killed. This is diving into the realm of needing the nobles on aristocratic types on board just as much as the middle class and maybe the lower class as well. Ron becoming a reluctant arisotract to appease the upper class to get them on their side.

It is an AU already with the title character of the franchise dying during the middle point of the franchise. The claiming of House Black is more a means to the end of finding another solution that isn't somehow Ron and Hermonie besting Voldemort in the same fashion Harry did/tried.

As for your Fandom question : not many have such an interesting place to start from where the main character almost died and if they'd do, it would fall to the remaining heroes to basically pick the slack in a way that isn't just "train how they did" but find different solution.

Lord Potter/Weasley aren't the goal, a leader who uses the black name, a name significant and ancient to stand against Voldemort. It's a two prong thing of making the Black name change(from blood purists/supremacist views) with this new Era under its new head. Also a Banner for the people of the public to rally behind. Lord Black is more of a nickname than what the positiom the winner would hold.

Then he got from Sirius one large house in London and possibly a vault in Gringotts (and he doesn't have it in the start of your story; and we don't whether for example Walburga didn't give most of her money to the Lord Voldemort in the First Wizarding War).

As the price of Gold alone was 350 USD pre troy ounce (31 grams) in 1993, and the common gold bar is 400 Troy Ounces, even if a pile of gold and silver and bronze only contains 5 of them , that's over half a million USD at the time. Nevermind everything else.

And this is after his mother and father's years of not working because of them trying to fight Voldermort's rule with the Order. It's also came out that Fleamont, had quadrupled the family's money in the 1900s to the point James didn't need to worry about getting a well paying job (source [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-aol-chat.htm][here from JK ,herself]] ) when passed down in 1979, a year before Harry's birth. Overall Harry should be decently rich, not Malfoy level but definitely able to go without working without an issue. He also is shown to be cavalier with his money during his first few years , like buying the whole cart's sweets.

Also, there is that huge question of the value of a Galleon INSIDE of the wizarding economy (certainly Lord Potter didn't move all his money to GBP and lived in the muggle economy, so conversion to GBP is mostly irrelevant for estimating the value of his vault inside of the wizarding economy). Yes, I am highly sceptical to whatever JKR said outside of the books (vanishing of one's excrements?), especially concerning any numbers (she seems to be almost having dyscalculia in her statements).

Wizards like himself and Voldemort can defeat virtually any number of lesser opponents and can basically force their will on the broader society, if they are so inclined and don't have another uberwizard opposing them. In fact, Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry in DH wasn't subtle politicking. He just used brute magical force to murder his way down the list of Ministry officials who could oppose him (Bones, Scrimegour, and many unnamed others), then, when he no longer had a fellow uberwizard Dumbledore to worry about, he just had someone Imperius the next person in line.

With Harry dead, Dumbledore might not be in the mood to play petty politics.

******* Indeed, Dumbledore and Voldemort are roughly equal in general combat ability. In the Ministry, Dumbledore had a phoenix to let him teleport, but he was also protecting Harry. Also, Dumbledore's goal was not to kill Voldemort, since that would only delay him a little; rather, it was to expose Voldemort's return to the Ministry.

However, both Voldemort and Dumbledore have both been shown defeating large numbers of lesser opponents like Aurors and Death Eaters with barely any effort. It's also telling that Voldemort didn't take over the Ministry until Dumbledore died, but took over shortly after: absent various prophecies, brother wands, and similar outliers, it takes an uberwizard to counter an uberwizard.

No but acting publicly will draw the attention to the other "uberwizard" as you've put it. If Dumbledore makes a public fuss trying to expose the cover up on harry's death, then Voldermort knows where he is and where he isn't and can thus act on that information(say raid hogwarts). Same if Voldemort attacks a place, Dumbledore would probably use a floo to come and help with the ministry. Which is why Voldermort would probably secure the Ministry first before acting with a still alive Dumbledore. So, They're technically sidelining each other as either exposing themselves will leave them open for the other to act according to their own schemes more so than the Ministry sidelining.

*** The politcal pull of a lordship is highly understated and rather misused imo , especially since unlike other stories where Harry becomes a Lord, this is Ron. He doesnt have the masses on his side, nor would he be able to win them simply on the premise of being Harry's friend. Ron also being the 6th child and 6th son would be looked down on by snobs & blood purist who don't agree with V but weren't swayed by Harry. Even Dumbledore would probably be more hesitant to back Ron Sans Harry without something to assure him. That's why I put in place. I can understand the hesitation.

As for Draco: Becomong lord of his own house is a notable shift than him inheriting his father's lordship, it's also allows him greater freedom as he no longer has to worry about his family's dealings and promises made by his father he has to upkeep or will threaten its stability. It's seems like a lateral move but is him winning his freedom by not just simply doing what his father tells him without giving his life style up as he'd be a Lord. That's how I'm proposing it, if you aren't a fan I understand.

Edit: also after double checking, Lucius Malfoy, while a powerful man of a notably powerful house, isn't a Lord formerly, so it'd actually be him exceeding his father's designs.

Right until the Lordship noble houses trope, then it stops being a 'what if' and wanders off into Noble Houses AU which has been /done/, all you have is different AU characters rehashing an old, very toroughly explored fanfic story.

** Using the Lordship trope can be quite hit and miss but I think it's most well used when there is no magical inheritance involved. Taking the fight into the wizengamot can create a lot of political intrigue and cloak and dagger type tension. The main problem you would come up with is having Ron claim the title as Siris is still a convicted criminal and would not be able to legally name him as his heir. Draco could but he would have to use some serious subterfuge to convince his father he wasn't doing it to build his own power base, Lucius wouldn't trust him nor think him capable.

Other things to think about:

- Hermione would not stand still after Harry's death. She's a muggleborn and she knows exactly what that means for her if the dark lord rises to power. If she's distancing herself from Ron it's because she's throwing herself into the kind of study she thinks he and his family wouldn't approve of. There are a number of ways this could play out and the diverging paths could mean she ends up as Ron's foil.

- Ginny would not take his death lightly either. Being the absolute firebrand that she is I don't doubt her new life's goal would be to have her vengeance on crouch.

How you chose to resolve other characters reactions to Harry's death is up to you but having more action/darker B plots to contrast against your political A plot will serve to create a lot of dramatic tension and suspense

The thing is though, you don't have to tell it from Hermione's point of view at all while still keeping her an active player in the story. News and rumours of what she's doing will still reach Ron through their circle of friends. Without Harry and Ron, would she be invited OotP meetings? Will she still trust Dumbledore after he fails to protect Harry? Dropping her from the story rather than having her pursue her own agenda seems off to me but that may not be the majority view.

The other thing to think about is what is Voldemort doing now that the only person he believes can truly defeat him is dead?

That is going to be addressed as the main thrust to things and why the status quo will change rapidly, because without that obstacle, Voldermort is a lot freer to reign terror however he wishes.

** I'd read it! Ideally you'd also flesh out some of the characters who dont get some love- I could see Percy being approached by Ron and having to choose between his military career and his family early, the Sirius/Ron dynamic can be a gateway to get the Order involved, Lavender pops up early, etc.

Also with Harry dead, I feel Ron and Draco's rivalry gets WAY worse, especially if Ron thinks Lucius had a hand in Harry dying. And how does Dumbledore react!

** I would read it for the following reasons: Ron being the main character, you're right that he doesn't get enough love, and seeing how his whole thing is about getting out of both Harry and his families shadow, him becoming the hero would be interesting to read. Sirius helping Ron through his grief, they've both lost their best friends, that's perfect right there. The Ministry covering up Harry's death, that is something I can easily see the Ministry doing in canon, and adds another layer to the story of getting the truth revealed.

While I would prefer Hermione to be in the story, I would still read it. But I just think ot would be more interesting to follow the both of them as they deal with their grief differently, before they work together again to help bring down Voldemort. Though I'd actually prefer to see them take down Crouch Jr if he is the one who kills Harry, and leave Voldemort for Dumbledore or something, would make it a much more personal story.

However, no matter how good your story is, no matter how perfectly you capture Ron and Hermione's grief, no matter how interesting and readable your story is, if there is a single mention of any bullshit lordships, family houses/rings/wizengamot seats, or god forbid the fucking phrase "So mote it be", I am out. The lords of the Wizarding world has been done to death, maybe one or two au's about it would have been fine or interesting, but the way it has been somehow established as canon is so irritating when 99% of the way it is done is the most boring and irrelevant crap. Political intrigue is great, give me corrupt politicians desparate to cover up something they think will effect their position, give me the heroes trying to reveal the truth to the public only to be discredited, give me the fallout once the truth is revealed, but do not give me inherited positions or any of that other crap, it's just not interesting.

** First of all, I like the premise. Potterverse was in a sense designed to revolve around Harry, and removing that element opens it up to many interesting and unconventional storylines.

I concur with most of the posters about the Lordships thing... When an element that is completely absent in canon comes to dominate the storyline, the nominal point of divergence isn't really the important part of the premise anymore.

You might want to think some more about Draco's motivation. Draco has no reason to question his father's views and decisions, and, in fact, Harry's death would vindicate Lucius's teachings in Draco's eyes.

You might also want to consider some logistics around Ron. Him growing into his own is generally a good thing, but keep in mind that he will be 15, with no political skills or connections other than his father and Percy (who thinks things are fine just as they are). Sirius isn't going to make a good mentor either: what political skills he would have learned, he would have had to learn before he went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor; and then he spent the rest of his life /not/ practising those skills. Ron would have to learn through trial and error, all the while attending Hogwarts and passing his classes, all without Hermione's help.

It would take Ron years to be even barely effective, years that they don't have, because Voldemort is out there.

I understand the decision to sideline Hermione, though I don't like the implication that if you don't have a noble title, you don't matter. You are basically implying that sure, blood prejudice and privileges are bad, but prejudice and privileges based on inherited noble title are A-OK. I like the suggestion made by some to have Hermione go Dark and help in her own, less diplomatic and more unsavoury ways. (Snape might serve as a mentor of sorts---since Harry's death is to him a failure to protect the last vestige of Lily in the world.)

*** Thank you

I understand it devovles when not handled properly. I'm not going to make it trade deals or anything but it is going to be something key to the characters.

On Draco, he realized he's relying on his father's name a lot and while he does love and respect his father, He wants to be his own man and do better. He doesn't question his father's motives or think he's wrong at this point but just wants something that no one can say Draco only got it because his dad's money/influence. Because remember almost everything Draco does up until year 5 in story is in some way influenced or assisted by his father.

One thing I feel is downplayed is that: Ron is smart ,he did pass his NEWT with a with "Exceeds Expectations" in several aspect, something only less than 20 students in his year did. He may not be Hermonie or Harry smart but he is intellectually solid. His political capitol will be bulit on the lordship/the house name & money, he may stumble with it and that's expected, but a favor/debt from a lord is worth a lot to the right person and *Hermonie will be helping facilitate.*

Yes, this is a key important factor, but it's also the point he has to try, because really without Harry it's all mayhem.

Not sidelining Hermonie, just to clarify, I'm not going to have her as POV and things are going to be emotionally strained/distant with her and Ron (namely the chemistry they have that becomes overtly romantic in the books isn't going to happen). She will still be an active member of the situation, just clearly keeping Ron at arms's length. Namely interactions will feel more silted/professional/direct. She still cares about Ron, as well as the rest of the Weasely family and that scares the hell out of her because she now knows if Harry can be taken, anyone of her friends can be.

A lone death eater killing the boy who lived sounds suspiciously like an assassination, especially after Harry directly is quoted as saying Voldemort has returned. Having it seem like a boy snapped and committed suicide while horrible isn't as alarming to the general public. It's like if someone today said "I have evidence (terrorist here) is active in our country" and the government denies it then the person is killed by someone who claims ties to the same terrorist... Wouldn't that strike the general public as suspect? Compared to the person committing suicide, citing mental instability as a reason.

**** What I dislike about fanon politicking isn't that, it's child heirs allying with each other and following intricate medieval protocols that never come up in canon that are always the same and always simplified yet tedious. It's the 'Light and Dark' factions, it's the 'well not all Dark-aligned houses are evil', the large quantities of unearned prestige and influence with grandiose titles despite a population of about 10,000, etc.

You needn't worry about spoilers at this stage. Only a small part of your audience would be exposed to them, presumably your plans are still fluid and this idea might not even properly take off. Spoilers only become an issue if it's already exceeded 80,000 words.

A teenage representative of their school with widespread fame killing themselves and then their competitor would be far more suspicious.

The Death Eaters were fanatics, and it was known that not all of them were rounded up. When the public knew Black was at large, they immediately expected him to go after Harry. Since Crouch is uncovered, him having killed the Boy Who Lived is incredibly plausible. Harry saying 'Oh no he's back' can be explained away by confundment or something.

Your analogy isn't quite apt. It's more like (I don't want to use Hitler but he's the first one that comes to mind) if the son of a government official in Germany had said his friend was shot by Hitler, and then a neo-nazi does him in. In a world where several varieties of mind-control exist.

Would they believe that over the son having killed his own friend due to mental issues the public wasn't aware of, and then the son committed suicide (presumably covering up the existence of the neo-nazi in the first place even though he's now dead?)

***** Yeah, don't want to get into that fanon stuff, also that'd no longer be Ron, that'd be some weird OC wearing Ron's skin interacting with some weird OC wearing that character's skin. I want it to be at most Ron apporaching some high born blood purist type going "Hey, hey how's i- /Hermoine behind him clears throat/ I apologize I mean, It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Sir. I'm Ronald, Lord of House black, but you may call me Ron." /looks at Hermione and she nods in approval/ That type of interaction.

It'd be suspcious, if it didn't fit a narrative already built/can be easily bulit that puts together a picture of a broken boy on his mental limits: He's was abused and mistreated by the Dursleys until the age of 12, He's shown signs of being a parseltongue (while not relevant to his supposed mental illness it may be spun to show he was on a dark path similar to V's), he had been know to hear voices. Ontop of all that isn't it oddly 'suspicious' that all 3 of his previous years he just "happened" to be the one in the center of a mystery involving V's legacy? Also that he just happened to claim at a very public event that Voldermort's back and have the death of his classmate as proof? And, just like they bought the story of Hermione using love potions, or the article that ran right before what would be his death in this story, that Harry was "disturbed and dangerous" with comments from 'concerned classmates' Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson and the rest of that group. Rita's Libelous claims & other events has created a prefect storm for the ministry to capitalize on if harry died in a mysterious enough way to cover as suicide and pin the death of Cedric on him as the end result of a boy broken by his life as unlike a book reader, a person reading a random article wouldn't know everything we and his friends know about Harry.

Publicly though: Crouch Jr was captured though and is officially stated to have died in Azkaban (actually his mother in disguise) . So to have him, the son of a high ranking ministry official suddenly appear alive and well, announce to the public he's alive, that he set up things so Cedric died while disguised as a FORMER AUROR AND killed Harry Potter IN HOGWARTS' GROUNDS in the finale of the first triwizards cup in over a hundred years. It'd make the ministry look like fools who couldn't keep one death eater they supposedly captured, nevermind the fact this is after Sirius escaped the year before. Overall it's a horribly bad look, one that you can avoid by making it look like a boy who you can establish is in a weak mental state instead took his own life and life of the classmate. Then just simply Dementor's kiss the Crouch Jr. problem away.

To get on your analogy, as I pointed out above though, they do know he's a bit off mentally and even considered dangerous, according to another Offical's son(Draco).

** Well people have given their opinions and here are my two cents. I won't dissuade you from a lordship story since that seems to be what you want to write. However, I will give some thoughts on the matter.

A different Ron story that involved lordships and such called Fate has recently started to lose my interest. The plot, writing and characters are still on point but the content has become too bloated with Lord speech. You can say Lord to suck up to people that want to be called Lord but when he starts thinking like that it gets way too boring. You start telling a lie so much that it starts feeling like the truth. People that start of as minor political allies start sucking up to his every need. Basically there is a severe lack of that healthy dose of reality where people are only out for themselves.

What I am saying is that I think you should make a clear dissonance between what Ron thinks and what he actually says. Something like this maybe..

Ron stared at Daphne's father as he introduced himself. He was a normal looking man with no striking features surprisingly, he expected him to be a more imposing figure. Still, he bowed his head and said, "Lord Greengrass" in greeting.

I think though that Ron is the kind of person that adapts more easily to these things when it comes to survival. His morals don't overwhelm his pragmatism. I don't remember exactly what happened in the books anymore but when they were attacked in the Cafe I think it was Ron who suggested drastic measures like killing the Death Eaters. Of course, on the flip side he does not hesitate from giving even his friends a dose of reality, politeness be dammed.

That's the problem with bribery; it doesn't get you loyalty, all it does is give you fair-weather friends who desert you as soon as you can't give them what they want anymore.... or your demands on them are too high for any reward they might hope for.

A fourteen year old boy who just gets a title thrust upon him is not going to inspire anyone to follow him in battle. There might be plenty of people who try to exploit him, if he suddenly gets rich, but these people wouldn't fight for him.

If people don't rally behind DUMBLEDORE, they won't rally behind RON, no matter how much of a Lord he is.

People have much better reasons to rally behind Dumbledore; he's a legitimately powerful wizard who has defeated at least one Dark wizard before; he's been around for over a century and he knows a lot of people and has personal connections and friends in many places. Being on his side makes a lot more sense.

Even rallying behind Harry makes more sense, even without a title. After all, he HAS defeated Voldemort before, even if he's a snot-nosed teen at least he has some accomplishments under his belt that makes it at least SOMEWHAT more plausible that people would throw their lot in with him.

But Ron? It's fourth year. What's RON accomplished? People who know him personally are going to know that he's a brave and steadfast guy, if a little insensitive and snarky... but he hasn't really DONE much to inspire loyalty. A lordship would not change that, especially since he did nothing to earn the title.

******* Yeah...notice I never said Loyalty? notice I never said they'd always be around? Just that they suck up to him. He commands enough surface level "respect" because of the promise of what they can get him, his perosnality is why they are so fair-weather, because he sucks as a person when he was 14.

Who said it's thrust upon him? Yeah and that's where Hermione comes in, she is going to help him sort those who could be beneficial to him on terms of long term gains vs flighty social manipulators who just want the money. You don't need everyone to fight for you but if they can supply weapons, if they can supply artifacts, ingredients, medicines and ritual books, if they can spare a favor to have someone to look away for an hour on something they'd otherwise crack down on. Those things can be beneficial to making a strong, effective but small group of basically guerrilla fighters.

You're viewing it from the eyes of the audience, in the universe itself : Dumbledore is a kook who has lost his edge and his mind in his older age and has been going on about Voldermort for over a decade to the point he got Harry wrapped up in it. His name is dragged through the mud at the beginning of the canon events of Year 5, they get him removed from several positions of prominence and it's only because Harry lived and went to help Sirius does Voldermort end up getting exposed at the end of Year 5 to the ministry in an undeniable way. So who'd follow him?

Yep but he's dead.

Yeah and that's the point harry's dead, Dumbledore is getting his name dragged through mud, it's up to Ron and Hermione using the tile of the lord of house black and their wits and skills as magic user to right this ship enough to pull through and prepare for a battle, it's not going to be easy. Except he does earn it.

******** None of what you say necessitates a lordship or any kind of title. From the sound of it, it's the money that's actually important here. The MONEY could buy artifacts, ingredients, medicines and ritual books, the MONEY could get people to look away for half an hour. I just don't see that the title adds anything at all to this. A lordship isn't some magic that makes people immediately respect a boy of fourteen.

If Dumbledore is a kook who had lost his edge and Harry is untrustworthy, then there's NO reason a teenage boy who was a perfect nobody until very recently would be viewed any more favourably. He could call himself "Lord Black" all he wanted, but he would still be nothing more than a child and an inexperienced upstart with no merits or connections to his name. If they won't follow Dumbledore, they won't follow Ron.

If he throws money at them, then it'll be the money that buys them, not the title. If Hermione's skills with magic win the day, that won't have anything to do with Ron being a lord. So I think the entire title is totally superfluous and would just clutter up what otherwise might be an interesting story. There's nothing the title accomplishes that couldn't be done just as well without, so to me it just seems pointless to even start messing about with titles and lordships.

Titles and lordships are hardly ever used well in fanfic; and it's even rarer that they're used well in HP fanfic. So I would strongly encourage you to drop the lordship unless it absolutely can't be avoided. In this case, it just seems like an afterthought that's just there because you like the sound of calling Ron "Lord."

********* Money is one way, influence and the promise of favors is also another way. I'd point you to the new swamp thing series, the main villain of the first 7 episodes is in deep debt but he uses the promises of his influence and ability to make things happen as well as money he's shifting around from one source to another but he, himself doesn't own. having money, or appearing to, is one part of a large puzzle. I didn't say it was.

Yep, part of the struggle is to get the recongition of that name up and recongized for it's potential. Ron has no slanders to his name, infact that articles by Rita in canon paint him as a victim(of the Hermione situation) or a not involved 3rd party to Harry's antics . He's a clean slate to do whatever you want with.

If...but I again never said it was. Never said her skills with magic, but her intellect applied to playing on people's desires. That's fine that you think that.

Yeah, you and several others have said this before in this thread, I'm going to keep saying no. Okay, so give me a suggestion on how Ron and Hermione ,with the idea Dumbledore has been disgraced publicly and harry is dead, could gather people to their side at the start of Year 5? Because this is mine. Or I have planned out idea and you're not exactly seeing it, I do like the idea of Ron becoming more than he is in canon, especially Cursed Child(retired from being an Auror, after revolutionizing it with harry, to run the joke shop?! REALLY!). But at the same time him becoming "Lord" Ron isn't it, but a conclusion I came to based on "What is there that is specifically Ron's that could get himself that Harry or Hermonie couldn't in his place?" and lead of House black was it and to put some spin on it to make it more grandiose idea I played up the nobility part of it that has always been in the name canonically. If you don't like it, that's fine but I'm not going to change it.

*********** It doesn't make sense and It doesnt seem to add to the story, because you're given a detail out of context. I've given you: Ron becomes a Lord, by claiming the head of House black after the death of Harry.

Things I left out: How does he go about this, Why would people think he's got influence now & ultimately what is it that changes with this title.

I gave enough for people to either bite on or not. I understand this leaves holes but that was purposeful

** Reminds me a bit of linfffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter), which was excellent, although it ended up focusing a bit more on Percy because Harry died as a baby. But anyway, I definitely like the idea. I'd probably wait to read it until you got through the dark parts--I can appreciate angst, but only as part of a whole, not on its own.

******* Nope, because no professional work has a title like that. You don't use first person in a title that starts out in third person, that's the mark of an amateur. You can say what you like about JKR, but she's not an amateur.

On a more serious note, for better or worse the franchise is called "Harry Potter," not "The Wizarding World." On fanfic sites, fics that don't feature Harry but take place in that universe are still featured in the "Harry Potter" category, Harry's the face of the franchise, which is why it's called the "Harry Potter universe" or sometimes the "Potterverse."

So I'd argue against your claim. Harry doesn't have to be the main character, or even featured at all, for the story to be a Harry Potter fic. And he certainly doesn't have to be in the TITLE. There are tons of HP stories out there that AREN'T called "Harry Potter and ..."
