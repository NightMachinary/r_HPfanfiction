About five years after the end of the war, with Andromeda both getting on in years and genuinely struggling with so many deaths in her family, Ginny and Harry become Teddy Tonks's primary caregivers.

The two move to a flat in the Muggle world because it's cheaper, meaning a certain level of assimilation is expected of them.

- Harry has few issues slotting into Muggle life again, though he still has some trouble with bits and pieces from a childhood in the cupboard under the stairs.

- Ginny, despite being fairly cool and calm, is still a Pureblood witch with next to no interaction with the Muggle world. This fact coming to a head now she has to interact with it on a day to day. Leading to her fiance having to slowly teach her about the dos and do nots of living in a world without magic.

- Teddy is happy to be living with his super cool godfather and Aunty Ginny, but does have to have his own dos and do nots talks with his new guardians in regards to the Muggles. But he's a clever boy and is super ready to learn more about these Muggles.

Even if he's getting conflicting information from his Aunty (whose dad's entire job is about Muggles so she's the REAL expert here) and his godfather (who actually knows what he's talking about)...

...

Wholesome family fic (in a similar vein to Kobayashi's Dragon Maid) where the magical family has to adapt to Muggle life:

▪︎Ginny and Teddy constantly making magical faux pas that Harry has to clean up.

▪︎ Teddy being super excited to actually go to school (as magical kids get daycare and then homeschooling until Hogwarts)

▪︎ Subplot of Andromeda slowly seeking therapy and recovering enough to be a more active presence in her grandsons life.

▪︎ Wholesome moments of Harry reliving the childhood he never had via excursions with the family and living vicariously through Teddy.

▪︎ Exploration of differences in childrearing between magicals and Muggles.

▪︎ Harry having to work a Muggle 9-5 and HATING it because he has (subconsciously) gotten used to his hero status.

▪︎ Closeted Muggle-fanatic Ginny being mesmerised and gleeful at all things Muggle, to her partners bemusement and exasperation.

** ▪︎ Cameo's from Hermione, the Weasley's etc. as the story goes on

《》 BONUS (though I don't like acknowledging the Cursed Child, and this makes it a little angsty):

▪︎ An Auror mission has Harry finding and adopting a young Delphini Rowle and raising her as Teddy's big sister. Possibly the reason why they chose to live as Muggles, so no one will target her or them.


** Why does Harry need a Muggle job he hates if he has Black and Potter gold at his disposal?

If he needs Muggle money, he just needs to reparo some distressed Muggle real estate and flip them at market prices, or reparo some clunkers and sell them.

He can make boatloads of money easily that way. Do you know that [[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-37409273][4 Privet Drive sold for 290000 pounds]] in 2010? Or that [[https://time.com/4508563/hermione-harry-potter-house-sale/][Hermione Granger's house went for 3.1 million pounds]] in 2016? If we go buy JKR's pounds to galleons exchange rate, they would be 58000 and 620000 galleons respectively. Remember, the Twins only needed 1000 galleons to open a big shop in Wizarding Britain's primary commercial district.

*** Fixing and selling houses is an obvious endless machine for getting money (as observed in “A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking' by Bakuraptor” linkffn(12327848)), but the prices of these two houses are certainly not the average ones. Selling house used in the world-famous film franchise will get you a way over the fair-market value of the similar non-famous house. Just a warning for anybody who plans to use these prices as anything resembling the fair market value of a home in UK in the given time.

Quoting from the BBC article:

#+begin_quote
  Its current owners have put the house on sale for £475,000 - it was bought for £290,000 in 2010.
#+end_quote

Perhaps those £290,000 represents FMV more?

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

*** It's not explicitly specified in any canonical source why Muggle-borns or wizards, in general, familiar with how the Muggle world works, are not rich. I had thought about your suggestion in the past as well, but my headcanon is that reparo would not account for wear or deterioration of the pieces. So a house fallen apart could probably be put back together but it would still look like an abandoned house. Also, most people who choose to leave the Muggle world in favor of the Magical world, do so at the early age of 11, therefore not acquiring significant skills in interacting with Muggles (say negotiation skills, marketing skills, etc.). Even when they return, they struggle to adapt and they cannot really use magical shortcuts (such as confounding or imperiusing the Muggles) because they are still under heavy scrutiny due to the ISS.

The only families in the series mentioned to have broke bank due to relationships with Muggles were the Potters (specifically the Potter ancestor whose name I forgot now) and, ironically, the Malfoys, who actually got most of their wealth from real estate prior to the enactment of ISS.

** I'd read it.

Draco has some good "learning to be muggle" times in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]] (linkffn(6432055)): first year: "How do muggles live without heat?!", second year: "Oh, there's a knob to control the radiator."

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I'd read most of this except for the last two points before the cameo, i.e. Harry working a muggle job and Ginny being a closeted muggle-fanatic, because I just don't see either of those happening. I'm happy enough with their canon jobs of Auror and professional Quidditch player respectively.

What I'd definitely love to read though is Teddy in the muggle world. The nice Ms. Robinson next door is surprised to see her new neighbours allowing their adorable charge to dye his own hair - and every two to three days at that. Every time she sees him, the boy seems to sport a different hair colour. She questions Harry and Ginny about it, and Harry has to come up with a lie about it being 'washable dye.' As Ms. Robinson doesn't really know these 'young people things', she supposes it's probably true and probably fine.

What's even odder, however, is that young Teddy's /features/ seems to change sometimes too. She could swear the day before the boy had had honey-brown eyes, but today as he skips past her going "hello Ms. Robinson!" she thought his eyes looked...green. Very green. Almost as green as his godfather's.

The next time she knocks on their door with her leftover scones, Harry chuckles in what she thinks of as a nervous fashion, and says they're contact lenses, approved by an optometrist for child use and all that. "Teddy was very insistent," he says, with a helpless smile. "We like to let him make his own fashion choices, as long as it doesn't hurt him."

The other day, she could almost swear she saw that Weasley girl playing catch-and-release with a fluttering golden bug of some sort on their balcony. When she blinks again, the girl had gone inside, and Ms. Robinson blames it on her lack of sleep from catching up with EastEnders the night before.

Her new next door neighbours are certainly very eccentric, Ms. Robinson thinks, but they seem to be the good sort. She wishes them all the best.

I'm always of the opinion that we need more Harry-raising-Teddy fics! There can never be enough.
