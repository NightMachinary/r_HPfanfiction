When I started reading this, I hadn't read the content warnings or anything. The mechanics intrigued me, and even the darker side of Sirius's arc didn't put me off.

I liked the way the game mechanics were handled, the enchantment system in particular was something I hadn't quite seen anywhere else (though if it's from something let me know), and I liked details like the Weasley curse, exploiting mechanics, etc.

But then... yeah. It got weird, and it got disgusting.


** I haven't heard of this. What happened in the story that was so horrible?

*** Incest, underage, cold blooded murder by children...

** Is this the one that had cannibalism? Wasted potential is what I think of most of Mist of Shadows/Rainbows' work.

A lot of their stories end up with the characters taking some willing flaw to have a bonus of some sort. Munchkinry and min maxing can be cool in an RPG, but in a story, where everything is written by the one author, it takes a lot of the "I sacrificed x to get enough points to do y" when the person writing the point system is also the person writing the characters using it.

Also, all of their character immediately sacrifice all standards to get that extra level up.

Sometimes they have excellent stories. I'm fairly fond of Harry Potter and Libromancy linkffn(12855936) from their FFN account, but quite a few get... odd.

*** Honestly, the cannibalism didn't bother me that much. It happened in a gamified version of the world, so the exploitable easter egg of being able to use a butcher's knife on corpses to make meat made sense. It was just sold, rather than eaten anyway.

But the underage and incest stuff... yeah, no.

** I recall powering through that at some point because someone recommended it here. Probably 90% of it is incredibly boring grinding (e.g. killing mobs & leveling up) with no relevance to the plot. Then another crossover and the final revelation of Hermione being a god comes out of nowhere at the very end.

I wouldn't say the fic had any potential to begin with.

There's some grinding, but a lot of it is learning how the mechanics work and exploiting them, at least the portion that I read.
