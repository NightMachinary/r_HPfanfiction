Bonus points if they all go through separate "Chosen One" training montages to achieve their destiny.


** "Why couldn't my destiny have been being the most brilliant scientist of the century. Why did it have to be me being the best por I mean adult writer."

"Shut up; Hermione. At least you are not destined to give birth to 12 kids. 12. I swear I am going to Bat Boogey hex any boy who tries to ask me out. I have half a mind to leave Britain and go into exile just to avoid it"

"Be happy your destiny is not becoming a test rat for Fred and George. Some of their products turn you into spiders *shudder*"

*sob*

"It will be alright Luna. Don't cry. Everything will be alright"

"But if the prophecy is true that will mean that Heliopaths don't exist and everyone making fun of me was right"

"I will help you find them once I find a way to make a potion that cures Cancer, AIDS, Lupus, Diabates and.. I don't even know what they are. How am I going to make a potion for things I don't know anything about."

"The same way Harry is going to marry and redeem Voldemort. No way in hell"

"Has he come out of the coma yet?"

** "So this one is another about my harem"

​

"Oooh, I get a free sandwich next year"

​

"That's different, I guess, this one is about me breaking into a bank to defeat yet another dark lord"

​

"Another book one... you don't suppose any of these dark lords are the same person?"

​

"Possibly, except that one about the dark mistress"

​

"And another one going into way too much detail about my future sex life."

​

"Face it, most of these are useless and the few that are useful we won't realise that they are useful until just after we really could have used the information, except that free sandwich one maybe"

** Ron just keeps seeing everyone else's sweet prophecies and in each one he keeps dying, so the plot is then Ron crafting his own destiny to keep avoiding as many as he can with slight precognition brought on by eating and excessive amount of magical candy.

** Everyone is hearing their own prophecies and the room has an enchantment that you can't tell anyone else your prophecy; so they all see a great calamity where they have to sacrifice themselves and that's what everyone is so selflessly trying to do. But everyone is trying to sacrifice themselves because they don't want anyone to else to do it but keep fuckin it up for each other.
