  It's Harry's sixth year, and he's ready for anything. Well, almost everything. Old enemies, new ones, Harry's got his plate full. Especially when the girl he loves makes her way back into his life. HPCC OOCness! [ABANDONED]

** Not many people care to write about Cho, do they? Can't say I've read too many of these, but I kinda like linkffn(Firewhisky Nights by Silens Cursor). Harry and Cho meet again at Vegas after the war. It was supposed to be a three-shot, abandoned after ch 1. Can be read as a one-shot though; it stands on its own well enough.

** I honestly can't speak to their respective qualities, but I remember a couple really really old ones (like before Order of the Phoenix old). One might have been called Betrayal of the Best Kind. Something with Harry getting abducted by Voldemort and then imprisoned in Buckingham Palace. The other was Something Something Flying Squad. By an author with a German sounding name, maybe? Harry gets a bunch of war brooms from the goblins. Sorry, that pairing kind of went away after it sort of happened in canon.

** decently written smut, characters are flawed and do develop but i would be hestiant to call this fic good. Starts off extreme noncon that then slowly develops into romance(super long fic), Paying for his pedestal
