***** But you still called it rape, so... Was she trying to stop him, or not?

Edit: I haven't read it, so I don't know whether it was rape or wasn't. I was just pointing out that the prior comments don't quite add up. If she was quite capable of blasting Harry through a wall, but didn't because she was in heat and he reminded her of her late husband, then that makes it sound like she didn't actually want him to stop, in which case, it doesn't sound like rape. But maybe there were other factors that the previous comment didn't mention?

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

*** I think people are into pairings with such characters for a multitude of reasons. Some are into it more because they think the characters are physically attractive (either in the movies or in how they imagine them). Some like those pairings because they can lead to more complex character interactions, usually with one character coming around to the other's worldview; this may or may not have flavors of a character being redeemed by love in some ways, or in finding out that there's more to a person's viewpoint than whatever's portrayed on the surface, and so on. There's also more generally the idea of "enemies to lovers", or of having a secret relationship, which goes along with the idea of "forbidden fruit".

I guess what I'm getting at is saying that there's lots of reasons. People are complex and they have many layers, so there's no reason to think that a character can't be written the same way.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
