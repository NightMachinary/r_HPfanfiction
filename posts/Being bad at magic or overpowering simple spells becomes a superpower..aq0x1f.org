In the book you've got levitation charms that cause feathers to explode, memory charms that collapse tunnels, etc.

Lemme see some fics where someone abuses this by miscasting spells deliberately or over powers spells, like a Scourgify stripping flesh off like a belt sander.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

** Hm. The closest I can think of that fits is linkffn(A Sage Among Wizards by Kythorian). It's not really close at all though.

There's just one part where Naruto-as-Harry points out that while the other students struggled to do some minor bit of transfiguration, his particular difficulty meant that he learned how to produce explosions at will.

I feel like it should be said that the problem with trying to harness this sort of thing canonically is that it's likely entirely unreliable and mostly unrepeatable. Sometimes your failed levitation might cause the feather to explode, sometimes it might make it rocket into your eyeball.

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

** I don't remember the name, but there's one story in which Harry uses 'scourgify' to get rid of all of Voldemort's Death Eaters during the final battle. The story notes that the spell sends things to the magma chamber under Mt. Etna, IIRC.
