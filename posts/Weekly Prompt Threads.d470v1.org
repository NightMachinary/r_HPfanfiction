Recently it has been brought to my attention that some folks feel inundated with the number of prompt threads being posted. There is a concern that these threads are taking away from discussion and other request threads, instead flooding the subreddit with cool ideas that go nowhere.

A proposal: would the userbase like to see these prompts limited to a regularly-posted stickeyed thread? This would cause all other prompt threads to be removed as they are posted.

Please discuss.


** I disagree. Prompt threads could, I believe, also result in lively discussions. And if there are existing stories which fulfill the prompts (or some aspect of it) they could also stand in for request threads. Doing this for prompts could be counterproductive.

** Nah, I like the prompt threads. Sometimes they result in a wee minific and sometimes they result in discussion about the prompt itself. I always tend to avoid stickies as they get dominated by a few discussions and drown out any smaller ones that would be easier to find and join if they were their own threads.

** Given the number of prompt threads every day, I do believe forcing them all into a single thread owuld be equivalent to banning the concept. 90% would go completely unseen hidden by the sheer mole of comments most prompts generate.

Besides, do these threads really bother anyone? It's not like they're sliding more meritorious discussions or request threads off the first pages before they can be seen, this sub isn't *that* fast paced.

For the same reason I wouldn't want requests being forced into a single thread either.

What's that fic threads might be fine with the one thread approach tho. It's not like they're meant to have more than a couple answers.

** I'd say a sticky for request/what's that fic kinds of posts would be a much better choice.

Even if there's no major responses to a prompt I still enjoy seeing it in my feed, there's some amusing and interesting ones posted. Whereas, seeing the thirtieth '[LF] that one where harry became an independent super badass after meeting daphne greengrass' doesn't really contribute much to my feed. Those would be much better suited in a sticky

*** I disagree with having a sticky for request/what's that fic as well only because then that'd limit the visibility of the requests. If we limited request/what's that fic to just a weekly stickied thread then we'd have to dig through a hundred or so comments just to find an interesting request to respond to. I can easily see many casual users just giving up rather than digging, which means that people who do post requests/what's that fic would be less likely to get help or recs.

** Disagree.

I initially held the same opinion that prompt threads were annoying. That lasted until I started actually reading and posting in them, and discovered that there is actually interesting discussion to be had. Prompt threads are just themed discussion threads, and should be treated as such, and I don't think anyone wants to end/limit discussion threads.

My take on it is that people think most of the prompts they see are frivolous or don't interest them, and therefore they don't like them. That may be the case, but I've yet to see a discussion thread that I thought was stupid that made me think "Let's stop having discussions."

I'd recommend making a pinned post explaining the fundamental purpose and advantages of prompt threads, i.e. a type of discussion thread where the participants are encouraged to write a small snippet about the topic, along with a a few links to past prompts that were productive.

** The thing is, these days a significant percentage of the prompts are made by only a few prolific posters. Three people are responsible for 30% of the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search/?q=flair%3Aprompt&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=month&show=all][~193 prompt threads created in the last month]]. They tend to post multiple prompt threads per day. Only a small percentage of those posts actually result in discussion, and an even more minuscule percentage garner any fills.

I'm not sure it'd be fair or beneficial to kill all prompt threads just because a few community members spam them. If anything, a better rule might be to limit everyone to one prompt post per person per day. If that happened, they would have to choose between their own ideas each day. Maybe then they would put more thought into sharing only the ideas which would garner a strong response from the sub.

*** 30% of 193 = 57.8

57.8 / 3 (people) = < 20 prompts per month per poster.

While I would agree that there is a lot of low effort posts amongst that crowd, your proposed solution would not change much. Perhaps a minimum of 100 or 200 words per prompt would be a better solution to minimise the preceived low effort spam.

**** A word-count minimum would be an interesting idea. I'd be curious to see what effect that would have on the number of prompts as well as the percentage of prompts that result in lively discussion.

Unfortunately, both rule ideas have the same logistical problems. The mods would have a difficult time enforcing either of them uniformly, and relying on user reports would not provide consistency. Not to mention, the majority feeling in this thread seems to indicate that the sub community would find such rules to be draconian and unnecessary.

There is an auto-moderator which, for example, can delete any post or comment by an account younger than a day. I am sure you could rig something similar up with the word count. I mean 100 is not much, this comment is just seven words short of that number.

** Like many others who've posted here, I also disagree with moving prompt threads to a single thread. While there are some that aren't interesting, the ones that /are/ interesting really do make me think. Even some of the prompts that aren't interesting can have interesting responses by users. Some of these responses have made me laugh and smile in ways that no other subreddit has been able to copy. When I come across these, I often marvel at how some people can push out a witty set of paragraphs with such little lead time. I don't consider myself a fanfic writer, but once even I got inspired to write a brief scene in response to a prompt.

To shove all prompts into a single thread would likely diminish the chance that we get to see people write these nifty takes on other's. Having separate threads for every prompt can help inspire something wonderful in any of us, and allows the rest of us a very visible and accessible forum to see them showcase these inspirations. I'd hate for that opportunity to be shuttled off and condensed to a single thread. So let's keep the prompts as a separate thread.

** Has it been explored what the percentage of Prompt threads get fulfilled? If it's lower than say 25% then I think a stickied post handling it would be good. If it's higher than 25% then a /themed/ sticky could be good to take up some of them. Simply because people are more likely to browse fresh threads than stickies when looking for something to read.

Also an idea: maybe flairs could be used to denote how many times a person fulfills prompts? That would encourage more people to fulfill them, helping the prompter find more to read, and fanfic writers to have more incentive to fulfill them.

** I would like this. However, it would be worth considering leaving the prompt thread in sort by new.

A norm of not posting spammy prompts would be better, if we could somehow get it. Prompts that are really good deserve their own threads, but we can't really implement that as a top down policy without a tyranny of moderator taste.

Almost all of them are single ideas that couldn't generate more than a couple of paragraphs of text at best.

Most of them are just bad. None of the ones on the front page would generate anything worth reading, and one of them is just nonsensical. If you don't want to kill them altogether then putting them in one pinned thread is the next best thing.

** If we're looking for weekly sticky posts, I think one that would be interesting/good is one for people to bounce and refine ideas around. I'm sure many here have had ideas of different twists to put as the start of a fic - which ones pair well is nice to get feedback on. Maybe there's ideas for plots or how to dig out of a rut that an author can't figure out.

Basically, small things that are not worth a full post for an individual person, but would be nice to get feedback/thoughts on in a more collective sense.
