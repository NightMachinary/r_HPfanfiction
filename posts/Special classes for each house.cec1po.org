So i got this idea, maybe each house has one or two special classes to suit the house. Example:

Slytherin house gets class like 'Human Psychology for future uses when maybe manipulating someone, seeing body language to reap higher benefits from trade/business, etc etc.

​

Ravenclaw house gets mediation techniques for better concentration, memory, and creativity.

​

I cannot come up with something else right know, but what do you people think?


** Gryffindor gets fencing and Magic Martial Arts.

Hufflepuff gets crafting lessons, everything from knitting and baking to enchanting and basic alchemy. Takes hard work to create.

** Better to think they would be specialized classes that are broadly covered elsewhere, but not to the same depth. Examining the characteristics of each house at Hogwarts, these seem like decent contenders:

- Gryffindor - fencing (or something more combat oriented), history of magical warfare, possibly something more sporty for the jocks as well, fire-based magic
- Slytherin - economics (or something equivalent to the basics), etiquette course, emotional control, water-based magic
- Ravenclaw - astromancy, testing skills, Hogwarts layout, air or weather-based magic
- Hufflepuff - culinary and house making skills, team building classes, earth-based magic

*** You could tie it into them not being official classes, but stuff the older students teach the younger members of the house

and its just been happening for a thousand years, so gryffindors are known for being good duelers due to a thousand years of house culture promoting that

** Slytherin should get classes on healing. As far as I can find only Christianity views snakes as only evil and in most cultures, snakes are tied to rebirth and/or healing.

** Slytherins are cunning and ambitious but that doesn't necessarily mean psychopathic or manipulative. Take Dumbledore for an example of why that trait doesn't belong to a particular house. And everyone's ambitious about something even if it isn't defining their entire life. For some it's school, politics, business, status or whatever. There are too many options for a personal ambition to present itself so psychology isn't going to be a catch-all class. That's going to be true for most other houses as well so I don't think anybody writing this story should strictly define the House Classes. Instead, let the head of house have the students participate in different projects throughout the year so there's always something for each student to learn. Maybe for Slytherin they have projects that involve buttering up the upper years for a goal they've been given, guest lessons from iconic figures in business or ministry workers, etc. For Gryffindor that could be camping/hiking or other physical and competitive tasks. Hufflepuff would also do well with some hiking/camping as it builds both character and cooperation, they could do joint projects like building or designing something cool, etc. Ravenclaw could do field trips to places of historical/academic importance and participate in their own version of a muggle schools science fair. Designing experiments, showing how they removed variables and being rated on the results they found, that kind of thing.

** Okay, let's see here...

Gryffindor: Sword training

Slytherin: Personal Finance - since many of the students in that house are future lords/ladies of their pureblood families and should learn how to manage their family riches

Hufflepuff: Cooking/Baking classes

Ravenclaw:

** This doesn't make any sense. Why would parents allow this? Remember, the Board has enough power to fire Dumbledore. I can't see parents, especially ones like Lucius allowing their child to miss any possibly useful classes or be forced to take useless classes due to their House. Heck, I can't see them allowing their kids to be forced to take classes due their House at all!!

*** well if this is an au

then maybe the classess have been part of the houses forever so there is a thousand years of tradition behind it

I always found it weird there was no differences in the houses, when there should be a thousand years of small house culture building up

**** I was in a house at a grammar school which had hundreds of years of history, exactly the same classes, usually the same teachers and everything in each house. Just different timetables for the first few years, inter house competitions, house captains, vice captains, house sports and music teams, the younger years would get into the inter house rivalry a little bit, but by the time we were 15 or so, no one really cared. That's basically how it works in all old british schools.
