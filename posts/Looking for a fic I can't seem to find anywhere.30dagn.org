I've been spending the past week or so looking for a fic and I'm hoping one of you lovely people could find it.

The part that I remember is that when the dementors come onto the train, instead of Lupin fighting them off, they were in a different compartment and Ron jumped in between a dementor and Hermione and dies. That's all I can really remember of the fic.
