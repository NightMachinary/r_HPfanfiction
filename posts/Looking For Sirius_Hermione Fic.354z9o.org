I read it awhile ago, and I'm fairly sure it was completed. It was on ff.net and was rated M. Sirius comes back from the veil after the war, and he and Hermione get together. She was with Snape before the story starts and there's some drama surrounding that. Hermione also has dreams that come true in it. Thanks.
