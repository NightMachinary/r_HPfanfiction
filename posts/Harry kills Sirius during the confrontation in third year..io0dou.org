Not sure if something like this exists (share link if it does). But I think reading people's reactions to this happening, Lupin's, Dumbledore's and the trio's would be interesting. I would prefer the trio stay together, however, the real truth can be revealed or not that's up to you.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13480069/1/Birds-and-Monsters]]

Slytherin Harry, Dark Haphne, and he isn't friends with Ron & Hermione.

Sirius tries to talk to him in the Shrieking Shack, but Harry doesn't give him the time to explain and attacks him the very moment he sees him. Daphne gets Sirius with a Body-Bind and Harry kills him without knowing he is innocent.

The truth hasn't been revealed yet.

** I just read a fic where it's mentioned offhand that it's possible to be trapped in your animagus form permanently, and if that happened to Peter Harry probably never gets convinced of Sirius' innocence. I think Sirius was in a pretty good position for a while to escape but if Snape shows up and the trio is on Snape's side I don't see that going well.

** linkao3(8132578) : Really dark H/Hr. Sirius is murdered by Harry despite knowing that he is innocent, the act is justified by very flimsy reasoning. Had to drop there.

**** The fic itself is very good writing. Everything up until that point is worryingly plausible. It has one of the more interesting slytherin H&Hr. The scene with Sirius simply felt forced as if the author wanted to push them to the dark side only for sake of the plot. I couldn't stomach any version of Harry doing it without regret.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** I can only think of one fic in which I think this happens, and it's a Slytherin Harry fic that's pretty AU where the trio is not a thing.
