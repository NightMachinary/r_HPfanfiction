Basically, finish everything as fast as possible

In speed running, games have different categories typically

Any%: beat the story mode. For this it would be destroying the horcruxes and killing Voldemort

100%: finish everything. Main story, sidequests, etc. This includes freeing Dobby and Sirius, finding the Hallows, killing the basilisk, finding Peter Pettigrew, completing the Triwizard Tournament, having Umbridge arrested, Harry becomes animagus, rescue the Philosopher's Stone. Basically anything not involved with destroying the horcruxes or killing Voldemort.

Some rules: no time travel. If it is used, the time until Harry traveled back is also counted. Time starts when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter.

Basically, Harry goes in as is, and the events need to allow Harry to kill Voldemort as fast as possible.


** Speedruns usually know what's going to happen and what they need to do, so in universe they'd have to be time traveling redo fics. Linkffn(We are the Golden Trio) has a speedrun doing the Any% and a few side quests like the Hallows and Pettigrew in a few months.

*** This is where you have me mistaken. The speed runner is the author. They have to write this so the events are as fast as possible, but still have a narrative cohesion.

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

** Any %

- After getting the letter, Harry and Hagrid don't immediately go to Diagon Alley. Instead, Harry wants to talk to Hagrid as much as possible before diving head first into the Wizarding World.

- This means Harry and Quirrell meet up later /after/ Voldemort possessed him.

- Harry and Quirrell shake hands.

- Quirrell dies and Voldemort is revealed to be ”alive” in public.

- Someone in the Ministry (likely an unspeakable) says f*ck this, and goes rogue and travels back in time to the 31st of December 1927 after asking Dumbledore a few questions about Voldemort's origins and commits infanticide.

Total time: Around a week.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.
