Voldemort (and by extension the Death Eaters) are often compared to muggle organisations and people. These comparisons can help us better understand the impact Voldemort has on wizarding society so I think it's important for us to consider a few.

In particular I will cover 2 comparisons: Voldemort and Hitler and the Death Eaters and the IRA. I've chosen these two as these are the most common comparisons I see made.

First, the Death Eaters and the IRA.

I can see why this comparison is made. Both organisations are operate with terror tactics and both have some political motivation. However I think this comparison is an extremely flawed one for a very good reason; the scale of the conflict.

People often understate the sheer influence Voldemort had and the danger Voldemort was to wizarding Britain and to the wider world. The Death Eater/IRA comparison is a symptom of that. The IRA were a terrorist organistion with limited scope and no ambition to gain any sort of power beyond the accomplishment of their political goals. The Death Eaters were a collection of extremely politically and magically powerful wizards with the ambition of total rule.

The IRA even if they had had an extremely ambitious leader could not achieve any sort of leadership over any territory. Voldemort on the other hand, was unbeatable apart from wizards of his calibre (of which there was only one) and fate.

I think that writers should be careful not to underplay the threat the Death Eaters pose by holding muggle terrorist organisations as points of reference.

Secondly, Voldemort and Hitler.

The comparison is obvious; both are leaders of extremely prejudiced organisations. Other than that though, the comparison really falls apart. Hitler was a distant and intangible threat whilst Voldemort was a very real one.

As a quick side note, the reason I dislike this comparison is because this sort of thinking is used to justify things that aren't reasonable like nicknames for Voldemort and like mocking how fearful people are of speaking Voldemort's name.

Yes, Hitler was mocked widely in British media. No, that is not precedence for the mocking of Voldemort. The difference between the two is that Hitler was a distant figure whilst Voldemort (and by extension the Death Eaters) literally killed a close family member or the family of a friend of pretty much EVERYONE in wizarding Britain. It's in really poor taste for a 13 year old to say Volde-shorts to someone who's father had been killed by him. I think that it's OK for someone involved in the war like Sirius to make dark jokes but be careful not to trivialise the real presence Voldemort had in every family. This goes for the tendency to not speak his name too - how much pain could you cause your mother if you mentioned the name of her brothers killers blithely?

There are no comparisons to Voldemort in our history and trying to make them risks undermining the strength of the character. Voldemort was a country (and probably world) spanning threat that personally hung over every family.

Strive when writing to bring that to life - the strength of Voldemort as a character is in the fear he creates.

EDIT: Just to be clear, the difference between Voldemort and comparable muggle figures is that he himself is death personified in the wizarding world - his name itself isn't spoken for fear that speaking it would bring down devastation upon those in hearing range. This is a type of fear and influence strictly unique to Voldemort amongst all muggles.


** The most often overlooked (in fic) aspects of Voldemort and the Death Eater's reign of terror are their /secrecy/ and their /ubiquity/. Comparing them to the IRA, ISIS, or any other recent terrorist group fails; they're more analogous to the KKK, the Stasi, or the Gestapo. Anyone could be a Death Eater, behind that mask and those robes could be a friend, a brother, a lover. Speak against them, even to your most trusted, and they might come for you in the night. Say the Name, and wake up to find your bed surrounded.

It's not merely their power and their ruthlessness that made the Dark Lord's followers terrible, but their seeming inevitability - helped along by their hamstringing, manipulation, and even outright dominance of the Ministry. Even Aurors were forbidden from using lethal force in self defender for much of the first conflict, after all.

Again to compare to the KKK, imagine you're a poor Black farmer in the antebellum South, and you find a cross burning on your yard in the middle of the night. You shoot at the men burning it and drive them off - and in the morning, the sheriff comes and arrests you for noise violations, public endangerment, maybe grievous bodily harm or attempted murder if you actually hit someone.

And then that night, in your cell, masked men come and unlock the door and lead you to the hanging tree.

My headcanon is that the Secret-Keeper cannot spend very long inside the Fidelius'd premises. Dumbledore is rarely inside the Order headquarters, and there's really no reason not to have Sirius/Pettigrew live with the Potters rather than use their bait plan.

On top of that, it would make things very inconvenient to undertake any non-war activities. How are you going to shop if anyone on Diagon Alley could be a Death Eater or an Imperius'd assassin? You need food delivered. How are you going to do that if nobody can find your house?

Chain vows.

In a post-veritaserum world, the war makes little sense. You could "headcanon" that the potion was created after the first war, to fight false claims of imperius.

***** I suppose someone can use it extra-legally, but it's not applicable in court for the same reasons polygraphs are. It can be fooled and you wouldn't know if they could fool it. Are they saying no because they're not, in fact, death eaters, or are they capable enough at occlumency to fool it?

****** I don't know if occlumency being a shield from veritaserum makes sense. All occlumency does (in canon) is defend your mind against legilimency attacks. Veritaserum makes you tell the truth, there's no mind reading going on. To fight it, you'd need a memory charm that makes you believe that your alternate truth is the real truth.

**** People already gave tens of reason about why Veritaserum and the likes can fail (antitode, transfiguration or just full memory alteration), but even if they were, I understand why people don't always use it :

A potion that force you to answer trufthfully to /any/ question asked, a vow that kills you if you break it, and a spell that can even make people forget a location. So, 2 perfect tools for a authoritarian dictature, and a spell that would put anyone using it on top of any suspect list.

When you see all the troubles our society has about things like informations collection of internet, or things like security cameras, do you really think anyone would accept to live in a world where any secret can be forced out of you, and where the government can force you to make a promise (on what you have no controle) potentially able to kill you?

*** Yeah, I was thinking along those lines too. The mob or the Ku Klux Klan.

The KKK comparison reflects their prejudiced ideology. The Death Eaters didn't want to kill indiscriminately, but to specifically use violence and terror tactics to purge muggleborns from magical Britain and scare any other magical people into following their ideology. If you're in an area where the KKK is prevalent and powerful, /especially/ if you're black, you're scared of them in a much more visceral way than you're scared of another nation.

** I would really like to read an SI fanfic set during the first war. The SI doesn't take the threat of Voldemort and the Death Eaters seriously at the start and maybe plans to save the Potters etc. Only to get caught up in a truly terrible conflict. After a while they might really be hoping Halloween 1981 comes quickly.

** Another flaw in the Voldemort ~ Hitler comparison, I think, is that Voldemort operated outside the law, whereas Hitler was put in power through legitimate channels and thereafter /became/ the law. The Voldemort in Violet Matter's Pureblood Pretense series, for example, is fairly Hitlerian. The Voldemort in canon, I would agree with other commenters, is more similar to the leader of the KKK, the mafia, or the mob.

*** See, I think that Voldemort is only really comparable to the leader of the KKK at all in a superficial sense - I tried to address this in my IRA comparison but perhaps failed to make myself clear.

The leader of the KKK, whilst similar to Voldemort in organisational terms is not at all comparable in real terms. The leader of the KKK is just another man to the black person persecuted and the KKK are the real threat but even they are only a violent symptom of wider racism that they experience and fear daily.

Voldemort on the other hand is death personified in the wizarding world - his name isn't spoken for fear that he will be there to punish you for speaking it.

That is the special brand of fear that Voldemort creates.

*** Hitler's coming to power was probably at least partially illegal.

The Weimar constitution allowed suspending certain civil rights using a provision that it was permitted be temporarily suspend them to restore public security and order. However, Hitler didn't use it for the purpose of restoring public security and order, which had never been seriously disturbed.

A similar legal situation happened when Turkey occupied Cyprus under the pretext of the Treaty of Guarantee according to which the guaranteeing powers had the right to take action to re-establish the state of affairs created by the treaty in 1960. However, since Turkey instead established a separate state and forced many Cypriots to abandon their lands its actions were illegal.

*** Not really. The thing is, if you met any of the dictators of our world in a dark alleyway alone, you'd propably be able to make a run for it or beat them up with ease. If you met Voldemort literally anywhere you'd be looking at your own quick death in the best of circumstances.

The Death-eaters can be compared to a mob, KKK or any of the covert agents of commie states and their puppets - you don't know who they are, but you know they are there somewhere, and one wrong word or behaviour in the wrong place can result in a really horrible surprise at 3 a.m. next morning.
