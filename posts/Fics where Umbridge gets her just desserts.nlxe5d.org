I /despise/ Umbridge and I think I would've resorted to the unforgivables if I were in the golden trio's place... therefore, I'd like to see some fics where they get revenge on Umbridge either during the year or afterwards.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15260055]]

AU. Voldemort cursed Harry in the graveyard so that he can only speak Parseltongue. Harry embarks on his fifth year alternately furious and despairing and trying to learn faster writing, British Sign Language, and nonverbal casting all at once. It turns out that not all Slytherins are Malfoy or Snape, and not everyone is frightened of Parseltongue.

*** I still don't understand why people pull off this centaur rape nonsense.

Sure, classical literature represents them this way. But in the HP-verse, do you think Dumbledore would allow rapehungry centaurs to hang out in the forest within walking distance of the school with a high amount of female children about? The acromantula at least are deeper into the forest.

Not to mention Hermione READS ALL THE BOOKS Granger of all people would do that to someone. Sure, get someone that has been systematically messing with her education and torturing them murdered? Yeah, I can see her doing that. But not giftwrap someone for a one-way trip to Gangbang, Rapetown. And if that doesn't settle things, that whole skit with the horse clopping sounds in the Hospital Wing afterwards? Yeah, that would be even more messed up, and the fact that she didn't react to it in that context is even more telling. Let's go even further with this... Would Dumbledore allow a rapehungry centaur into the castle TO TEACH?

And even then, would Dumbledore let Hermione back into the thick of things after doing that? Not even a slap on the wrist?

******* I mean, taken, kidnapped, or the like sure, but I don't know where the gang-raping is canon. It paints the centaurs in a much more barbaric way than I remember them.

Not that I think she doesn't deserve some harsh comeuppance...
