There was one I read about harry being able to channel hogwart's magic and he stole some of Draco's magic as well. And he levitated desks too.


** That kinda sounds like "Other People's Magic" by Mr. Ragtop. It definitely has Harry using Hogwart's magic and levitating desks. No idea about draco though.

**** [[http://onj1.andrelouis.com/hp/Harry%20Potter-%20Other%20People%27s%20Magic.txt][The magic of Google.]] This appears to be all of it, despite what it says at the beginning.

**** I'm fairly certain there were more than 12 chapters before it was taken down. You might want to go to [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=22418][DLP]] and see if anyone has a line on a more complete archive.
