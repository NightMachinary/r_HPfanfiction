Does anyone else find bashing of 'good' canon characters boring in a fic?

I used to read alot of them as it is a popular trope that comes with most of my OTP's fics but lately I found a few that have no bashing at all and it's so refreshing.

I just adore all the friendship and love between the golden trio, the weasley family, his parents(if they show up), and Dumbledore.

I find it rather exhausting to read a bashing fic after finding a few nice no bashing ones that I feel a bit spoiled...


** I think bashing is boring when the writer thinks that the bashing itself constitutes as a plot instead of an accessory to it. Especially in WBWL stories, james and lily are portrayed either as evil, unloving parents or massive Dumbledick supporters which is completely opposite to canon and they become OCs in a james and lily meatsuit.

*** They want readers to sympathise with Harry, but instead of doing it through good world building and good character development, they just have his parents as evil

*** Agreed. If there is bashing, then I prefer it to serve as a light bulb moment for the character being bashed. The characters gain more depth and the story becomes richer for it. We all want to see some justice for and better treatment of Harry, but the bashing sometimes makes everyone (Harry included) seem like jerks.

** Yes, almost everyone on this sub finds bashing stupid and pointless. Please stop making posts like these talking shit about bashing, they're getting posted multiple times a day

** I think the main reason I dislike bashing so much is because it tends to make characters much less interesting, it reduces them from Rowling's three dimensional characters to flat characters and the only traits they keep are the negative ones.

Fics where a character with negative traits - like Snape or Mrs Weasley - is explored are interesting, but bashing fics never do that, because they always flanderize the character into becoming bland and easy to hate.

** I've got nothing against bashing, to be honest.

I still enjoy any fic where Minerva/Snape/Remus/Dumbledore/Umbridge, etc. where they get to face the consequences of their actions/inactions and the loss of trust/faith in them etc.

I don't particularly care for any bashing of the kids, to be honest (because they're either children or young adults at most). And it's rarely for serious things---I feel like I've seen more Ron bashing than Draco bashing, which I don't get.

Though, at times, I seek out some Hermione bashing but only after having read too much Hermione wank before hand. And it's less about canon Hermione (which I don't particularly care about) but about her fanon version which is truly insufferable in high doses. Like, that one shot where she goes to a job interview and she's call out on her shortcomings? Very petty but very satisfying. Especially since she's almost in every fic calling Ron andHarry idiots, being weirdly violent and agressive and still shown as some model of perfection of which the boys ought to be in total adoration.

Otherwise, I don't usually seek out any bashing and just ignore it if the plot is good enough. What I don't get is why the main bashing seems to be focused on the Weasleys? I can understand not liking some of them, even Ron. I can read Ron and Harry being enemies etc. But, to go to such lengths to bash him and usually his whole family is a bit strange. Especially since Arthur is so nice? I can get Molly being a bit too much, but, yeah. It's like they're bashing another version of these characters (which, fair enough).

I'd be glad to read more bashing of the awful adults through Harry's career in Hogwarts. Or even the Dursley's. They're clearly abusing him, and somehow they're more spared than Ron who put his life on the line for Harry, at times.

** Molly and Dumbledore bashing is basically sublimated anger against the author's mom and dad.

** Agreed entirely with this. When I stopped reading bashing fics, I found myself reading fewer fics - but much better ones.
