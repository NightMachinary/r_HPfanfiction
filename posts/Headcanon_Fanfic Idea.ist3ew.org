*** I didn't say you had to care about them lol. It's just an idea and I was wondering if people liked it and if you don't, I don't really care. It was just an idea of mine and I'm not making people like it. I actually really wanted a look into Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff. What do you think I could add to the plot to make it more ✨spoicy✨?

** I assume you'll get similar feedback to this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ismnna/headcanonfanfic_idea_originally_posted_on/]].

To reiterate the main ideas of those who commented that I agree with, it feels like you're trying to solve problems that don't exist and create flaws where there aren't any. As Sercoat notes, the three OCs find this information, hand it over, and then are surprised when HRH do things with it? And you're giving the canonical main characters flaws so that your OCs look better?

Calling it an AU does not excuse inconsistencies within a story.

And of course, your introduction makes me think you're only looking for praise, not actual feedback.

#+begin_quote
  Angeli is a sweet, Hufflepuff, muggleborn, Muslim girl. Her father is a bit abusive and possibly an alcoholic, which led to some trauma and general shyness.
#+end_quote

I am a bit confused about that point. Is the father also a Muslim or did she get the religion from her mother?\\
Because while it's technically possible, it is a bit strange to make an alcoholic of someone from the one religion that forbid alcohol, and not something I have ever read about.

​

For the rest, I don't really have much interest for this prompt. It's doesn't change anything from canon, except that, rather than being the hero of the story, the MC are a bunch of morons unable to solve the mysteries by themselves, and who steal the "limelight" from your OC by not giving them the credit they "deserve".
