** For McGonagall/Snape relationship (nothing romantic there, the difference in age of like forty years make my stomach funny when thinking about their romance) I suggest linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities;Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities), where unfortunately the main (Harmony) relationship is the weakest part of whole story, but side-characters (Percy, McGonagall/Snape, Fred & George Weasley) are really outstanding.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Draco Malfoy doesn't know what he believes anymore. He doesn't know if he cares about the dealings of mudbloods and half-bloods and blood traitors and blood purity. All he knows is that he once saved his parents from certain death, and now he is determined to save them from the entirety of the Wizarding world. Only this time he is entirely on his own.----In which Draco is an angsty prat, the family feels are strong, the politics are complicated, and Luna Lovegood is basically an angel.

*** Your appreciation for Puzzle makes me think you might enjoy this very short Snape/Lily fic by someone who left HP fandom years ago. It was posted in 2006, so the Lily reveal hadn't happened yet, and their "friendship" is tense and twisted (well, Snape's side of it, anyway). It has some of the poetic bitterness that infuses Puzzle.

** For McGonagall/Snape, I feel like it only works in some fanfics, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6703155/1/The-First-Cut-is-the-Deepest]]) is probably the best - it's set in the first war, and actually takes time to develop the characters/romance. ~150,000 words, and I believe there is a sequel.

A great McGonagall and general Staff Centric fic that's about them dealing with Umbridge in 5th year is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday]]). ~58,000 words, 3 chapters.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]]) is a great Luna centric fic - it starts off with a bit of a silly premise of 'What if Luna finds Tom Riddle's Diary' but slowly develops into a funny and sweet story. ~72,000 words.

Then there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus]]). White Squirrel is an author who is often recommended, and you should definitely check out their other stories. This one in the later years contains some great Harry/Luna, but it's worth the read. ~700,000 words, with a ~170,000 word sequel still being updated.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/kelly_chambliss/pseuds/kelly_chambliss/works?fandom_id=136512][kelly_chambliss]] has written a lot of excellent Snape/McGonagall, some of it dark, some romantic, some amusing. She also writes lovely femslash ships among the Hogwarts staff and their contemporaries. The fics tend to be on the shorter side, though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Squibstress/pseuds/Squibstress/works?fandom_id=136512][Squibstress]] has written a dozen Snape/McGonagall fics and another dozen for McGonagall/Dumbledore, including this epic series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/9046][Epithalamium]]

Dueltastic has a fair bit of Snape/McGonagall in her non-archived catalogue, and only a few have been posted to AO3. They're all archive-locked. I love her dry wit and brisk style. The longest is also a kidfic. I'm usually somewhat allergic to kidfic, but even I read it all the way through: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1018314/chapters/2024840][Circumstances of a Small and Accidental Nature]]

Two of my favorites of hers are a linked pair of Aberforth/Minerva/Severus fics that I love a lot, and I can post links if you're interested. The slash content is blink-and-you'll-miss it, but it's definitely a domestic threesome.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13844247/chapters/31840572][Come Once Again and Love Me]] by laventadorn is an excellent Snape/Lily fic in a more optimistic do-over vein, in contrast to the already recced (and amazing) Puzzle.

This might be something of an odd bird in answer to your request, and it's got mixed het & slash content, if that's an issue for you. It's basically a character study of young Professor Snape and a portrayal of the ways in which he's so fundamentally broken that his canon fate is inevitable. The pairings are Snape/McGonagall and Snape/Moody, and it's excellent.

***** You /did/ say it wasn't a rhetorical question. Truthfully, I don't feel this is the best place for this conversation. It's a request thread - not a bashing or discussion thread. That being said, to answer your question, some people aren't looking healthy ships when reading fiction. They're looking for what they find interesting. This could include ships with serious power differentials, on opposite sides, or various other complications.

If you prefer ships which originate from friendship, are in the same age group, and so on... Great. That's good for you. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with people who disagree, any more than people should be shamed for picking the mean option in a video game. It's just two different ways of enjoying fiction. It's not hurting anyone.

I don't even really ship anything in this thread, though I've read of the odd Draco/Luna, but I also don't feel like people should be made to defend what's entirely subjective in the first place.

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Your recommendations were fine. However, the commentary was not warranted. Don't hate on what other people want to read.
