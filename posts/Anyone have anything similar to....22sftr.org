Ok so I just got done reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/63/][a mauraders plan]] or at least what is completed of it. Really hope it gets finished because it's actually pretty good. Minor grammatical errors, but they can be overlooked. I was wondering if anyone had anything similar to it that is COMPLETED please!


** Sadly no, but if you're into Fleur you might like to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]], which begins with Sirius before fifth year engaging a marriage contract that derails everything. Worth reading; it's one of my favorites.
