I never found this argument, which comes up a lot in Fanfics that try to redeem Snape, very convincing.

If Snape is trying to prove to Voldemort and the Death Eaters that he is on their side and spying on Dumbledore it seems like an idiotic move to openly behave like an evil villain. Voldemort and his Death Eaters want Dumbledore and the rest of the Order to trust Snape, right? Snape's behaviour seems very counterproductive for that goal: He's totally blowing his cover all the time if he's supposedly in deep cover in Dumbledore's camp. Wouldn't he - if he's pretending to *secretly* work for Voldemort - try to help Slyterhins *in secret*? He surely would pretend to treat everyone equally in public... if he's a really good actor he could "accidentally" let his mask slip on occasion, so that he doesn't become too convincing.

This is drifting into a critique of JKRs writing, but Voldemort should really think that Snape is the worst spy ever and wonder "WTF is he doing?" by being so blatantly a "bad guy" in Hogwarts (i.e. in public):

Imagine Snape constantly trying to protect Muggleborns and chastising Bellatrix for using Crucio while being on Death Eater missions... Voldemort: "What are you doing Severus?!" Snape: "Oh, I have to behave that way, so that Dumbledore still thinks I'm on his side!!!" Dumbledore: "WTF is that idiot doing, he's supposed to be my /spy/, how come he is blatantly showing is true allegiance to the enemy? This sure seems fishy to me!!!!11"

I imagine him constantly having to apologize to Voldemort behind the scenes in canon for losing his temper yet again and almost blowing his cover. Still, Voldemort should wonder why his not-so-secret spy/sympathizer hasn't been exposed... Not to mention that Dumbledore would just demand that Snape shows better behaviour in the classroom or be fired if they weren't in cahoots with each other.

My take on the character:

In my opinion Snape is - for the most part begrudgingly - trying to repay his debt to Lily. He's not enjoying it and he is not doing it out of the goodness of his heart. His caustic behaviour in the classroom is probably the closest we ever come to seeing his true self (he's wearing masks both with Voldemort and Dumbledore). He doesn't enjoy teaching, thinks kids are mostly stupid and only remains in that position because both Dumbledore and Voldemort want him there. He wants to see Voldemort dead, yes, but at some point sympathized with some of his ideology to join in the first place. There's little evidence that he did a complete 180 in his views - he's just out for revenge and justice. His original sympathies towards Voldemort probably stem more from elitism than fundamentalist/radical blood-bigotry though. He just saw Lily as exceptional (for a lowly Muggleborn), rising from her lowborn and magically uneducated heritage. Just the same as there are racists who can make exceptions for that one black guy who is okay, Snape is willing to overlook Lily's "unfortunate" origins.

Really, if he secretly was completely against the Pureblood-dogma he would do something to improve the situation of Muggleborns in Hogwarts, instead he seems to enjoy their abuse from the sidelines:

#+begin_quote
  He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth---she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back.

  Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, "I see no difference."
#+end_quote

There is a lot of good he could do exactly /because/ he is a double agent if he were so inclined. Ingratiating himself with the Order and Dumbledore by being helpful/sympathetic to their heroes (without any real cost to Voldemort in that situation) is exactly what a good spy would do. His deep-seated character flaws and grudge against Harry/James prevent him from going that route though.

TL;DR: If Snape is being an ass because he's trying to pass as a spy he's doing the exact opposite of what he should be doing.

Edit: The whole "fake" assassination of Dumbledore of course is brilliant - props to JKR for that scheme - he's just not being a very convincing sleeper agent beforehand.

** For the life of me I cannot understand why this topic hasn't received more attention from fans.

It should be entirely the other way around, with Snape painfully obviously acting like the redeemed Death Eater he wants everyone to think he has become. Instead, Rowling shows us a Severus Snape that is consistently behaving like a supporter of blood purity who shows flashes of the more extreme convictions of Voldemort supporters. How come that the one person who fought against all that and saved him from Azkaban in the end simply accepts this?

If I were Voldemort and heard about Snape's actions and behavior in school - which wouldn't surprise me, since the wizarding community is small and the guy is by far the most hated teacher in Hogwarts - I would seriously rethink his position among my followers. From this perspective you have to speculate at the reasons why Dumbledore would keep Snape around in a school of all places, why him behaving almost like a Death Eater is worth accepting. Snape must obviously do something very important for Dumbledore to be allowed this much leeway ... and from there it is not difficult to conclude he's spying for the other side as a double agent.

** The reason why Snape is a complicated character is because the reader is suspicious of him and even hates him, right up until the last book where they suddenly sympathize with him. He's obviously not a good person, and I think he knows it. But he's trying to do what he has to so that he can atone for what he's done.

But about his behaviour not reflecting his being a spy: you have to actually consider Voldemort and his madness, fueled by his jealousy, paranoia, and his hunger for power. Snape had to walk a fine line between showing too much support for either the light or dark side of the war, but I think Voldemort would most definitely have killed him if he had shown any type of favouritism that he felt was too great towards Dumbledore's side. Not that it excuses his behaviour, which I also believe Snape knew and sometimes took advantage of. But Voldemort was much more of a threat, and he needed to remain firmly in Voldemort's camp to everyone except for the Order to achieve that redemption.

** Snape was an unpleasant, unhappy person and he did a great job of playing both sides for his own agenda.

He used the same excuse to Dumbles & Voldie: I have to act like a complete ass to all non-Slytherians or people will think I'm a spy.

I think Snape got bullied by Griffs, Ravens and Huffles (and the teachers) in school and while the Snakes didn't protect him - they didn't go out of their way to harass him - unlike Potter/Lupin/Black et al.

His treatment of the other houses is just payback for the way he was treated. He's paying back the wrong people (innocent kids) but most of those kids are the children of the people who treated him poorly so it justifies it in his mind I think Snape, like many abused people, does not see the cycle of abuse he is trapped into.

It's not hard to think that there might have been more people who had a problem with him and that most of them did it precisely because of his behaviour; likewise, it's not hard to think that he might have thought himself bullied by those other people too, even if not as much as by James and his group.

Whether or not he actually was bullied or if he gave as much as he took is not very relevant for Snape's feelings towards all the people around him, I think. What matters is how /he/ saw it back then, regardless of whether he was right or wrong.

#+end_quote

Actually it wasn't one-sided and wasn't biased. The Pensieve is objective fact, as JKR already confirmed.

#+begin_quote
  JKR: It's reality. It's important that I have got that across, because Slughorn gave Dumbledore this pathetic cut-and-paste memory. He didn't want to give the real thing, and he very obviously patched it up and cobbled it together. *So, what you remember is accurate in the Pensieve.*
#+end_quote

Snape's memory was objective fact, and everything happened in the memory without bias or lies. Actually, Snape wasn't as bad to the Marauders as they were to him.

- Sirius manipulated Snape and had him almost get killed or turned into a Werewolf, without any remorse or regret, and Sirius knew exactly what would happen to Snape since he wasn't exactly ignorant of what a Werewolf would do to a human being.

- Side Note: Sirius not only almost had Snape killed, but he USED Lupin. Sirius didn't care what the consequences would be for Lupin if Snape had died or became a Werewolf (i.e. Lupin gets expelled, then sent to Azkaban, and probably kissed by a Dementor given the anti-Werewolf nature of the wizarding world). Sirius' desire to kill Snape outweighed Lupin's worth as a friend.

- James and Sirius then ganged up on Snape 2v1, publicly humilating by hanging him upside down no differently than the Death Eaters did to the muggles in GoF (as Hermione reminds us in HBP). Lupin also fails to stop the bullying despite having the authority of a prefect. I'd expect that behavior from Ron, not from Lupin. Keep in mind that SWM happened after the Werewolf event so it only makes SWM a worse act.

- Levicorpus flipped Snape upside down so he was basically pantsed in front of the entire school. Imagine if Draco had done that to Hermione? But I suppose that if the Marauders had done that to a girl, the implications would probably be too dark for HP.

- Side Note: Snape needed Diffindo/Sectumsempra to defend himself, but only when the Marauders weren't paying him attention. Given James' lack of cursed wounds and Sirius/Lupin never bring up the cut, it heavily implies that Snape used Diffindo in SWM and then created Sectumsempra at some point after SWM but before he left Hogwarts.

- The fact we never see the outcome of SWM in either OOTP or DH heavily implies that James did in fact strip Snape by removing his underwear in front of the whole school. Its further implied by the fact that McGonagall, Flitwick, Hagrid, and Dumbledore seem pretty ignorant of the conflict by how James and Sirius were remembered. Its not like JKR could have actually put that scene in the book given how it would pretty much be putting sexual assault in the book, which is a massive no-no. If Snape had been a girl, the entire Levicorpus-Underwear stuff would be a whole lot more blatant.

What I'm saying is that Snape never did anything even remotely comparable to what the Marauders did. Lily asks what he (Snape) has ever done to them (James/Marauders). Lupin seemed to regret that he didn't speak up during OOTP, so part of him knew what was happening was wrong.

*Now Avery and Mulciber DEFINITELY did things at least as bad as the Marauders during Hogwarts, and by the seventh year, they were definitely worse since they were probably Death Eaters by that point.* Snape may have been the Marauders favourite victim, but Avery and Mulciber (and Lucius, etc too) were the real threat since they represented everything the Marauders hated (dark arts, pureblood supremacy, Death Eaters in training, etc) and unlike Snape, they would be able to fight back and would be darker.

Its implied that the so-called "dark magic" that Mulciber used on Mary Macdonald was actually Levicorpus. Specifically, he used in the same way that James used it on Snape. This is further implied by the fact that Ron found Levicorpus funny when used on him in HBP, and Dean and Seamus found it funny to be used on Ron, and Snape found Mulciber's use of the spell funny. Lily calls what Mulciber did to Mary "dark magic" yet she, like basically every non-villain in HP, has a hypocritcal definition of dark magic. Yet Levicorpus is considered dark by the Trio when used on the muggles but Ron finds it fun to be used on himself. Snape found Mulciber's use of the spell amusing but not when used on him. Any non-villainous character considers anything they don't like to be dark magic, yet they have no problem using that magic themselves since its not dark magic if they or their friends do it.

So the worst Avery and Mulciber did in Hogwarts is use a spell that is pretty much heavily implied to be Levicorpus, yet neither are said to be prefects. The Marauders also became unregistered Animagi and smuggled a Werewolf out around Hogsmeade, knowingly endangering the lives of innocent Hogsmeade residents. As far as I see, what the Marauders did becoming unregistered Animagi and setting Lupin out on the town is almost as bad as Voldemort's original use of the Basilisk. The only thing keeping it from being as bad is that the Marauders didn't get anyone killed because of it.

As much as people bring up Snape's "gang of Slytherins", they only exist in Sirius' questionable biased memory, especially since Sirius implied that Snape has friends. If anything, the worst thing Snape ever did as a Hogwarts student was passively watch as Avery and Mulciber bullied others. Snape was never the Marauders' equal, he was the Lupin of the Slytherins in that both Snape and Lupin passively watched their housemates bullied others, yet neither objected since they believed that they would be rejected otherwise. Snape is almost as guilty as Lupin in that aspect. I say -almost- guilty because Lupin was a prefect so he was obligated to object to what the Marauders did, Snape wasn't obligated to object since he wasn't a prefect but he should have done it anyway.

******* A valid point. Perhaps instead of unbiased I should have said isolated? So we can assume that everything that happened in that one memory was 100% factual. My point was based more along the lines of Snape wasn't some poor, mistreated soul who never retaliated. I always assumed that maybe the marauders started picking on him because he was an easy target, but his personality never allowed him to just let it go, and so things just snowballed.

I suppose my original argument was more along the lines of Snape was not some miserable, mistreated soul who really just needed a hug. He was a nasty person who lashed out at others. Buuuut this discussion is evolving past the OP's original question, so I'll leave it there. Basically, I think that he was not a "good" person and that his behavior as a Hogwarts teacher was not an act.

i think that's the point of the counter? snape /was/ horrendously mistreated, and that did affect his behaviour. he lashed out, because of that abuse. he should have gotten support, and it's not unrealistic to suggest he would have been better if positive qualities had been cultivated in him.

on a slight tangent, i want to comment generally on a line of thought that i occasionally see around the sub. woobie!snape isn't a fan creation (or woobie!draco for that matter, but that's another discussion). it's a huge part of his arc, the narrative and how harry's conceptualises and relates to him. the first thing harry thinks on after leaving snape's memory isn't about lily, it's this:

#+begin_quote

To be more accurate Sirius didn't manipulate Snape, he simply told him how to go there expecting the Slytherin to be nosy enough to follow Remus. It speaks of Sirius's chaacter who was ready to have Snape killed (or whatever his intents were) just for fun. However it is Snape who chose to go there, to broke the school rules in order to have his suspicion confirmed and then ruined Remus's life.

Which likely was the case and it likely did colour the other students' view of him, regardless of whether it was fair or not. Add to that his generally dour personality (that stemmed from family issues and not really having many friends, rather than from getting “dark”, but the public did not care and likely did not even know) and it would be easy for people to assume that he is a bully in the making who is simply biding his time. And it's likely that this lead to people having enough of a problem with him as a person that nobody actually put any effort into stopping James's inanity during the incident.

The “mudblood” comment? He probably got it from associating a bit too much with Avery and Mulciber, which would serve to highlight the fact that he spent enough time with them to be seen as their standard associate and someone just like them. And while there's really no excuse for him using that word towards Lily, it's probable that he used that word because he was fed up with everyone crapping on him for what he saw to be no reason back then.

The fact that Lily apparently broke all ties with him after he called her a name just ONCE when they'd been friends for years suggests that she was more or less fed up with his shit. Either that or he made no pretense at apologizing afterward.

Again, I don't dislike the character. I think he's one of the most complex characters that JKR rolled out, and one of the more interesting ones. I am just not romanticizing his intentions or trying to make him a "misunderstood soul." Snape was an asshole, plain and simple.

*********** Sorry about that. I guess if we're making a nurture vs. nature debate, my interpretation of his character was that he was always an unpleasant person (maybe from his home situation?), and his treatment in school only intensified those traits, not created them.

And the Lily thing is just weird to me. Feeling regret is fine. Exactly how he felt about Lily when Harry showed up is sort of vague. I interpreted it in a much creepier, obsessive way. Like I wish in his memory conversation with Dumbledore, he'd been a little clearer with the significance of his doe patronus and the "always" statement, because it can be interpreted as either "I will always remember the consequences of what I did." or "I will always have this stalker-ish, unrequited love for a dead woman." and some people legitimately did read it as the latter.

But also, fandom has tainted my feelings toward him, honestly. So maybe I am making unfair assumptions. I admit a lot of your points are valid, but I can't really buy into the idea that his behavior was all an act.

************ mm. to clarify- i don't think his behaviour was an act, or that he was a good person. i don't think you can definitively state how snape would have turned out without being mistreated by the marauders. before hogwarts he was bigoted, though i think his political allegiances are (obviously) flexible. i don't think he's misanthropic- he obviously put himself out there to be friends with and nice to lily, likes to stan for the slyths etc. i do think he was obsessed with lily, but i similarly don't think his feelings for her can be separated from his remorse etc.

*********** I recently noped out of a fic, because Harry did not understand why Lily wouldn't forgive a friend for an insult. Snape not only called her the equivalent of the n-word at a time like today, but at a time equivalent to when blacks were actively hunted and dragged behind horses/cars.

People who use the word Mudblood want to see her dead or worse: It's not the same as forgiving a simple insult.

**** I think this is already answered but most kids seem to be sorted into their parents house(s) and almost every British wizard seems to attend Hogwarts so it only seems to follow that the older kids who picked on Snape at Hogwarts were the parents/relatives of kids who attend Hogwarts with Harry.

I can image Snape keeping very detailed notes of just who mistreated him during his *entire life* and keeping a mental (or even physical) tote board of the repayments he makes.

If magic didn't exist in Snape's world, I could see him becoming a kleptomaniac or pyromaniac as a form of payback but without magic, the basic conflict between his parents wouldn't have existed and he'd have a whole different upbringing.

** I wouldn't say that Snape's behaviour makes him the worst spy. The nature of Snape's position is that both sides know that he's a spy, both sides know that the other side knows that he's a spy, and both sides think he's actually loyal to them. That basically gives him the freedom to act however he likes. No behaviour makes him a bad spy because there are no behaviour expectations on him.

** At the time I'm posting this, half of the comments discuss Snape at Hogwarts being relentlessly bullied by the Mauraders, we also know he was a non-pureblood in Slytherin, and his parents were abusive assholes. All of which made him a nasty person. When he returned to teach there were still students who knew him as a student, his reputation at that point was he was an awful, miserable, nasty student who became a death eater and then comes back as a teacher. If he suddenly, changed and either became too chummy with anyone it would set off alarm bells, I think he had to continue being the one thing everyone knew him as, miserable. If everyone could say Snape has always been that way, he has always been miserable and awful, they wouldn't examine his actions as closely. I also think he hated teaching and was poorly suited for it, and lived a life where he really couldn't move on get married and be happy, which also will make you bitter as hell. And he had some guilt issues.

** To expand on other people's points:

Voldemort returned. He asked his followers: what have you done in my absence?

Most of them were self-serving and did nothing against him. They paid their way out of Azkaban or dissembled with sufficient skill. He can deal with selfish people.

Snape, though, had Dumbledore's endorsement. That was a huge mark of suspicion. If he hadn't been doing /something/ to advance Voldemort's cause in that time, he would have been killed immediately, or at least made useless as a spy. Sent him on suicide missions. Made him do something even more stark to prove his loyalty.

This assumes that he and Dumbledore couldn't cook up any better plan than to traumatize two decades of schoolchildren and scare off three fourths of potential potioneers against the eventual return of Voldemort. And what did that buy them? Snape was able to give the sword of Gryffindor to Harry -- whereas Dumbledore could have left it outside Hogwarts, or in the Chamber of Secrets, and simply told Harry where it was; and there was no particular reason to expect that Snape could find them and every possibility that Voldemort would move Snape to another position.

It was a bad plan. It happened to work.

I don't think they do at all. I think Snape simply latched on to the only friends he could find (besides Lily) and followed them. I don't think he had any pure-blood sympathies at all, really, he just jumped off a bridge because all his friends were doing it.

** Snape is classic Nice Guy™. He was friends with Lilly, and was nice to her, and expected her to reward him with her reciprocated love. It wasn't enough to be friends. Then, when she doesn't, he does that creepy basement dweller thing and gets bitter and resentful at the rest of the planet. You're not going to always get the one that you have idolised and put on a pedestal. The healthy person response is to close that chapter of your life, find someone else to shag, and move on with life. It's not sit there and silently stew and hate the rest of the world because you were denied.

***** I mean, if you go back and read The Prince's Tale, the Nice Guy narrative doesn't really fit his character arc. He never makes any romantic advances toward Lily (regardless of the nature of his feelings) and their falling out after the lake fiasco is very pointedly about his burgeoning Death Eater leanings, fascination with the Dark Arts and increasingly overt bigotry.

It honestly barely even smacks of romantic feelings to me; I think that view was partially predicated on the Men and Women Can't Be Just Friends trope and bolstered by the fact that it's more dramatic/tragic in some people's eyes.

On another note, I can't see Snape honestly being THAT much less prickly on a day-to-day basis, even pre-war. I rather got the impression that Lily kept him in spite of his abrasiveness (to a point) rather than because of any Nice Guy tendencies; she could probably have gotten that anywhere (James Potter comes to mind).
