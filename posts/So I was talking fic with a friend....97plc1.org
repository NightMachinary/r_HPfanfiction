...and we started joking about all the muggleborn and muggle raised possible breaking out into muggle song at times. Not as a curse or anything but more jokingly, like kids do in general. Like Queens We will Rock You during a quidditch match, or Ghostbusters during Halloween, somebody humming Curella Devil under there breath during potions.

Thoughts? Any fics?


** Honestly my first thought was "Cruella de Vil." While its a bad pun, even Disney isn't so naive to believe someone would have the last name Devil.

Rowling on the other hand though...she did name a dude who talked to snakes Slytherin, made /Severus Snape/'s favorite curse /sectumsempra/ (how long till she realized the potential there?), and Harry's 'rival' in school is named /Malfoy/ (roughly means bad fields, and any character in Anglo-Germanic literature whose name starts with Mal-, Mor-, Mar, etc. is always evil or will become bad at some point).

I could totally see her making a pureblood family named Deville or something like that.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

*** Right? I mean kids growing up all have songs that they know and use in play and to tease. I me remember my niece singing 'can't touch this' as a taunt when she was younger as a basic example. Why wouldn't the muggle raised kids..plus it would be a really easy way to confuse the purebloods.

  First place winner, MEFA 2007. A modern day woman lands a job that is too good to be true at a mysterious toy company. Things are not as they seem. Has she strayed into a dream? Drama humor. Characters: All the usual Mirkwood suspects and an OFC.

** Muggle music is used in Not Fade Away, it's both a bit of fun and a direct rebellion. Abandoned though.

  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake.From the start of sixth year at Hogwarts to beyond the death of Voldemort, the rise of the bright young friends, allies, and enemies of the Order of the Phoenix - and how each and every one of them fell.Unfinished/Abandoned.

The point still stands though, subtle as a brick through a window.
