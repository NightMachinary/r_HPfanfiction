** There is linkffn(Heroes Assemble! By Stargon1) . I don't know if it arrived at infinity war and endgame yet, since I stopped reading a few chapters back. The pacing is too slow for me, there's no real goal, in my perception, so it gives me that feeling of something that will never end and it bums me out. But it is a good fic nonetheless, and there's the whole lot of characters, from HP and MCU Avengers, along with a few of the marvel comics characters. It handles at least civil war differently, but, as I stopped at chapter 110 I think, I got a bit lost as to what was happening.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

And almost all the characters (well the heroes at least) are from the MCU even if indirectly, you have the characters from the movies obviously, but also from the various tv shows (Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, The Runaways, Agents of SHIELD), the only one who aren't from memory are Gwen Stacy (although to be fair she could be from the Amazing Spider-Man franchise), Squirel Girl, She-Hulk and another one whose name I don't remember.

I recognize all the non movie characters, from the numerous TV series. But like it has been mentioned, it is too many characters for me to be able to accurately remind. Although this discussion made me curious, so I may be returning to that.

I understand what you mean about the "too many characters" bit but I enjoy HP/Avengers crossovers but I haven't found much that are worth it, especially considering that my favourites pairings for those are HP/Black Widow or HP/Quake and I'm not much of a writer to write my own, so I make do with what I have (and this story is pretty good if you can keep up with the characters).

  Nothing happened. The stupidly bewildered look on his face wasn't bad, as far as last sights go, but Tony still wished he could have been looking at Morgan as he died. Of course, that meant his daughter would have to watch him basically burn himself to a crisp with the power of Creation itself, so this was probably better in the long run. He raised his right hand, making sure Thanos could see the Stones his nano-suit was even now incorporating into itself.Ah, gormless despair. Even better.It's time.“I am---”That was as far as he got before everything changed.“Accio Infinity Stones.”Or, the one where Thanos accidentally made a very powerful enemy and didn't find out about it until the last possible second.

** linkffn(A Third Path to the Future)

It's unbelievably long and based on the comics not the movies but it's enjoyable and includes almost every marvel character at some point. It starts with the fantastic four, moves to the X-men, then includes the avengers as well. However, it's a harem fic and in progress. The Thanos plotline hasn't resolved itself but they both barely survived their first encounter. I'd say if you want the feeling of “everyone's here” this fic does it extremely well.

** This sort of fits, but it's a side fic to another fic, and you would likely be very confused if you read it without reading at least some of Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds first.

** JacobApples has one featuring a post-Endgame Natasha Romanoff who is brought to the HP universe by Death and raises Harry Potter. It's quite good.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure.

** I read this one which takes place after infinity war and before endgame. It is a Hermione x Peter Parker fic. Really loved it.
