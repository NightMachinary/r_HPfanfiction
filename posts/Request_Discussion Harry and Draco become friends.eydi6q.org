I was thinking about what would realistically happen if Harry and Draco were friends. During the shopping trip and the time leading up to and including the sorting Draco and Harry are friends. (This might affect sorting) And then on the first day Draco tries to take Harry along to bully a student. Needless to say Harry isn't impressed, and their friendship dies pretty quickly after that.


** Draco cannot stay Harry's friend and stay a bigot - Harry's mum, who sacrificed her life for him, was a muggleborn, after all. The first time he rants about "mudbloods", it's over.

Unless we're talking about some "Voldemort with Harry's appearance" OC who doesn't give a damn about his parents and heritage.

** I think it's insanely important to remember that bullies and bigots ARE capable of changing. This is why I continue to try to have patient conversations with prejudiced people.

We might not have gotten to see it in the books, but that doesn't mean it can't happen in fan fiction.

With proper character development, anything could happen.

*** Oh sure, I totally agree. My point was just that in most fics Draco is either not like he is in canon, or Harry isn't. And that allows them to hit it off straight away. You could definitely make them friends if they have a chance for character development. In fact I would love to see something like that.

** Canon Harry and Draco are just to different to be friends, the only thing I can think they could bond over would be quidditch, even then they are on opposite teams.

** Everyone is sorted into a different house. One of the few fics where I felt a Draco & Harry friendship was well developed (helps that they're both in hufflepuff). First in a "series", with the rest of the stories giving their friendship and Draco's character development more focus - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071]])

Harry alarms Draco & Ron so much on the train that they make a pact to keep him from finding out he's famous. Neville joins in too. The "friendship" between all of them is hilarious and this is probably one of the only fics to keep both Draco /and/ Ron in character. - linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4810036/1/On-a-Train-Switching-Tracks]])

** *Oh God Not Again!* linkffn(4536005)

Time travel, there's some manipulation involved, but they have this weird frenemy-adversarial-snarkfest thing going on. Does it count that Harry already had the walkthrough to avoid enemyship with Draco? Doesn't matter, it's still a funny novel.

---

*Luna's Hubby* linkffn(2919503)

Harry doesn't go to school his first year, instead going with Luna for her first year. As a result of all this, everyone doesn't know Harry is Harry, and at the holiday visits to Grimmuald place, Draco does his Lucy-mandated "purebloods are the best spiel". They play around to keep Draco from getting punished, become pretty decent friends. Not the best of friends, but close.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** I could /maybe/ imagine some bizzare kind of friendship between the two of them begin to form post DH, but it would require a significant amount of introspection on Draco's part, and would almost certainly retain an antagonistic undercurrent, even if it's only a minor one.

** This is explored extensively in Methods of Rationality.

- Harry finds Draco's attitudes unacceptable, but a) recognises that Draco is a product of his environment, and might be redeemable with the right reeducation; b) realises that if he openly opposes Draco, then Lucius may step in and wreck Harry; c) sees an opportunity to flip a very important piece, undermining Lucius Malfoy's grip on the government by luring Draco to the light side; d) respects Draco's intelligence and doesn't want to just walk away if he can do something about the situation.

- Hermione is very unhappy about Harry's friendship with Draco, and tells Harry so. They talk it out and remain friends while deeply disagreeing.

- Draco eventually stares enough evidence in the face to realise that magic is just an inherited trait, there's no moral superiority, just human beings. He's never exactly Hermione's biggest fan, but he develops actual respect for her, no longer looking down his nose, and seeks to reform Slytherin to truly be the house of the ambitious instead of the house of Muggle-hating.
