Pretty much the title, just read A Cadmean Victory and found the portrayals of both snape and dumbledore interesting but annoying in the sense that this fics Harry was so hateful of both. It makes me wanna see more fics with interesting portrayals of these two characters in well written fics. Only condition is no Harry/Snape and no evil or super manipulative dumbledore


** Do you have any particular interests or requirements besides being Snape-centric or Dumbledore-centric? Because there's a writer I really like who writes a lot of Snape stuff, but it's Snape/OC with a romantic focus, although there's action and so forth as well, and her main works have plots that are sort of happening in the periphery of canon events, but occasionally intersecting with canon events, if that makes sense. So it's a whole side story that's technically consistent with canon. (But then she also writes AU Snape stuff, which I also love.)

At this point, after all that rambling, I'll just link you to her AO3 page, haha --- but if you'd like me to specifically rec any fics by her according to what you're looking for, or give a little explanation of her various fics, I'm happy to do so.

Her writing itself is honestly top notch, and while there's a heavy romantic focus with an OC, her fics also include non-romance plots.
