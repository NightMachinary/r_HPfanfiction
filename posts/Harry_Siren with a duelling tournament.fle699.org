*** Thanks!! I really thought the fic would have some kind of reference to Siren in it's description so I just skipped over this one in my lists. Thanks!

*** Ah yes, one of the many lovely but abandoned/orphaned fics out there.

** This probably isn't the case in that fic, but the idea of a recurring gag where the Siren keeps trying to lure Harry into a body of water so she can drown and eat him, and it continuing so long that they end up in love, really tickles me.

*** I kinda like this trope.

It becomes so casual that most people are like "wtf is wrong with you" when they find out.

Harry goes to the edge of the cursed lake, just out of a (practiced) arms reach of her.

She greets him, and playfully asks if he's going to come closer so she can 'hug him'.

He just rolls his eyes and, for the millionth time, says "no", despite her pouting.

He then tosses her a sandwich from the local shop ('notSubway*cough*') and they casually chat about things, as per routine.

When a friend comes with him, he casually says, "don't get too close, or she'll drag you in, drown you, and eat your face".

"It's true," she says unabashedly, munching on her ham and rye.
