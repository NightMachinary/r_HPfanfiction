They posted my two favorite fanfictions ever, running on air and Astra Inclinant. Just saw today that they were all gone from my favourites.


** This is why I started downloading my favorite fics. You never know when a fic is going to go away. I once had one get deleted while I was reading it... clicked on Next Chapter and got the "not found" message.

** Omg what??? /Running on Air/ is my favorite Drarry fic of all time, that's so disappointing to hear that it's no longer on FFN. :// Their entire profile seems to be gone from FFN, too. I wonder why?

As of right now, they seem to still have their fics up on AO3. I hope they stay there.

If I had to guess, they got enough unpleasant feedback on ffn that they left it. The crowd there tends to be rather more juvenile and entitled

*** I think it's more that the people who use ffn are less likely to comment, only really doing so when they don't like something. The layout for ao3 is more conducive to nice conversations and stuff than ffn.
