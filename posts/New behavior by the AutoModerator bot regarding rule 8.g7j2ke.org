At some point in the past week someone configured the AutoModerator bot to start responding with a warning about rule 8 to any post that mentions certain keywords. It's looks ridiculous because so far most of the threads that triggered the bot had nothing to do with rule 8.

One of the tagged threads ended up locked and full of obviously deleted comments. Apparently most of the recommended fics in that thread featured a character who was in fourth or fifth year at Hogwarts at the time in the fic. Thus, it looks like the changes to the bot are part of a move by the mods to start aggressively enforcing reddit's sitewide policy. This is odd, because it's a steep departure from their previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dgwpit/petition_to_have_blindness_by_angelastarcat/][more relaxed precedent]] of only going after "egregious violations".

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g5s6nj/i_want_to_review_your_fics/][Example 1]] (4/21/2020)

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g68t2g/diagon_drama/][Example 2]] (4/22/2020) - The bot apparently doesn't like some keywords in [[/u/Avalon1632]]'s standard disclaimer about being nonjudgemental regarding any recommended fics. Their posts have triggered the bot several times in the past few days.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g68v65/fics_that_involve_magical_games_incl_quidditch/fo80j9r/][Example 3]] (4/22/2020) - Harmless Avalon1632 disclaimer.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g6qso1/looking_for_a_specific_harry_x_fleur_fic/][Example 4]] (4/23/2020) - The aforementioned threadlock with many deleted comments.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g6vtrv/short_fic_recs/][Example 5]] (4/23/2020) - Post content before deletion: [[https://www.removeddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g6vtrv/short_fic_recs/fod23k8/][link]]. It's another case of a polite disclaimer wrongly triggering the bot.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7a2eo/looking_for_a_george_x_fred_fanfic/fofqknq/][Example 6]] (4/24/2020) - Post content before deletion: [[https://www.removeddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7a2eo/looking_for_a_george_x_fred_fanfic/fofqknq/][link]]. It's not clear if the bot scared the poster into deleting it themselves or if the mods deleted it regardless of it not actually breaking rule 8.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7alyj/azkaban_breakout_fics/fofu797/][Example 7]] (4/24/2020) - Another harmless Avalon1632 disclaimer.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7h36z/are_there_any_fics_that_deal_with_matters_of_soul/][Example 8]] (4/24/2020) - Yet another harmless Avalon1632 disclaimer.

- Edit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7m5u4/looking_for_stories_like_lightning_lord/][Example 9]] (4/24/2020) - Another random person's disclaimer triggered the bot.

- Edit 2: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g7p7bi/can_someone_give_me_a_drarry_one_shot_idea/][Example 10]] (4/25/2020)

I made this post because it's pretty clear that whatever triggers that the bot is working off of need to be finetuned. One correct trigger out of (ten) in just four days is a pretty terrible success rate, and it looks like the bot might be scaring off newer posters by wrongly making them think that they broke a rule.

Also, I think the mods need to make a statement clarifying their position so that the community of this sub isn't caught off guard or wrongfooted by the change. We've already had one embarrassingly public episode of drama in the past when mod stance on enforcing rule 8 was unclear/inconsistent. So please, mods, can you explain a little what your plans are going forward? Is there something in particular that prompted this abrupt change?


** Update from the team:

We are tweaking the keywords so that Automod only comments in relevant threads. Please remember, this is just a *comment* that reminds viewers of rule 8. It is not removing anything.

** I wish there was an alternative hpfanfic discussion sub. I'm not sure if the mods are just trigger-happy or the sense of power has started to make them trip, but they've gradually turned this place from an interesting discussion platform into something bland and... overly sterile.

In the last few months I've caught myself several times on the notion of wanting to ask for a request on this sub, and then remembered what it has become like and just lost any interest in going through with it.

The only alternative I know is the DLP forums, and that is a PHPBB forum, which usually tend to have their own kinds of problems.

*** The mods of the sub like to say that their hand was forced by Reddit-wide rules, but I don't think anyone really believes that.

For comparison, the Rule 34 sub has 20 times the subscribers as this one, is much better known than this one, is full of pics of e.g. Hermione in Hogwarts robes, and no one blinks an eye. Because everyone knows that the Reddit-wide rule is not targeted at legitimate fan or artistic works.

The fact is that the mods of this sub have a history of trying to prevent discussion of fic types they personally dislike and the Reddit-wide rule was just a convenient excuse for them to implement the plans which had always been their preference, even though the measures introduced here go well beyond what the Reddit-wide rule requires.

But there are other communities out there, as you mention. So I just participate here on the basis of "it is what it is" - you obey the rules of the community so long as you are a part of it. Meanwhile, if I want free and open discussion I go to DLP.

*** To be fair this sub has always been a drama filled mess at times. There was a ton of mod drama when the original creator added a mod randomly, there's been random rule changes, and power users, people spamming their own fics.

It comes and goes.

Tbh the thing that gets me is the rec threads are all identical to the point people are just linking old threads/comments. Like yes, I know, i'm looking for new time travel/funny fics, we've all heard of Seventh Horcrux.

Also replying to one of those threads with 20 recs. Pick one. Otherwise it's not a rec, it's just every random fic you can remember.

******** This certainly doesn't seem like "caring about the community". It should be obvious that programming a bot to respond to trigger words needs an exception when those trigger words are stated in a negative sense.

Deleting posts with "sex", "smut", "lemons" etc in them seems like a /really/ half-assed approach.

And yes, alright - maybe /you/ don't do stuff like this, but Phony Pony for example was only active once in the last month, and that was to self promote. (at least at the time this thread was posted)

So with all this in mind, don't try to take the high road here. Inaction is also an action.

** People have generally ignored rule 8 since it was introduced. We constantly have to remove reported violations and there is surely more that don't get reported. So I added a rule to post a warning in threads where it might be relevant. Automod can't be fine-tuned to be smarter about what it matches. Matching keywords is pretty much the limit of what it's capable of. If anyone has suggestions for improving the wording of the bot's warning, I will take it under advisement.

*** I recommend a softer, politely conversational wording of the bots message.

With the current way the bot is operating, that warning message is the first (so to speak) face-to-face interaction that many new posters will have with this sub. The current wording turns that first interaction into an overtly threatening Big Brother-esque impression of "step carefully potential criminal; we've got our eyes on you!" Many first-time posters have never taken the time to read the sidebar and have never seen a comment or post by a mod on this sub. Thus this first impersonal interaction gives them a false impression of the mods as draconian adversaries harshly cracking down on an innocent mistake.

For a first-time automated warning I would always recommend something more human and friendly, such as:

#+begin_quote
  "Hi! Welcome to the [[/r/hpfanfiction]] community! Something in your post triggered this automated reminder message. If you haven't already, please take the time to read the sidebar and familiarize yourself with this sub's rules. We try to ensure that this is a welcoming place for all of our members while also abiding by Reddit's sitewide policies. In particular, please keep in mind rule 8. If you have any questions about this message or any of the rules, feel free to contact one of our moderators."

**** As I said in the post and throughout this thread, the problem is /not/ that the bot has deleted anything. The problem is that its warning ends up in so many threads that have nothing to do with rule 8.

This malfunction of the bot's design confuses and alarms the community by making it look like the mods are trying to crack down on any mention of sex. Judging by past mod comments, that's not actually their intention, but nonetheless that's the impression conveyed by the bot's actions. Also, as I stated in my post, some of the examples seem to show that the posters who are new to the sub and unfamiliar with its rules get spooked by the harsh unmerited warning, electing to delete their own post. In online communities that sort of mostly-off-target approach to issuing warnings tends to scare away potential new members and build a bad reputation for the moderation team.

****** What is the rule the bot is upholding ? Rule Eight of no links to content which is inappropriate. Or the rule of no suggestive content even to tell we don't want it ? (Because in the letter of no suggestive content, the negation of said suggestive content is also banned. The user must simply never think of it like someone that was never informed of what is this activity that minors must not know about.) if the bot is upholding the latter, it does a sufficiently good job. If the bot is upholding rule eight, you are right to tell that it is triggered by mere key words. You will see that I avoided using those key words to not trigger it.

******** The rules needs to be more specific to not be interpreted in the extreme like I just did. And also the bot would need to understand the context if he has to operate with keywords. Just see how the rule of no MA on FanFiction.Net was never fully uphold and so many MA fictions are still on the site. Whose types of rules are difficult to uphold by an AI.

********* I agree, and that's part of why I made this thread. The bot's trigger needs to be refined (by adding more complex and foolproof conditions if possible) in order to stop acting on false positives. Otherwise it will just keep confusing people and scaring them away from this sub.

********** There is only one solution, the bot would have to be able to learn on its own. Deep learning on specific signals and confidence on signals type, on their number.

*********** Nah. This is actually a rudimentary problem that wikis have already handled years ago with automated bots using regex pattern matching ([[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AbuseFilter][example extension]]). And that's part of why it's so embarrassing that the mods on this sub failed so hard at it.

you call 10% accuracy good?

The bot triggers when you write "sex", or any other variation of the word. I don't know how you/they could have been so incompetent as not to see that it would also trigger when people say "without smut" or "I want fics that don't include [trigger word]".

Your comments are ridiculous. Deflate your ego and actually read what you're responding to.
