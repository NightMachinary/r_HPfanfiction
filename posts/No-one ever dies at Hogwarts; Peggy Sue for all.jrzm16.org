This is based on "The many Deaths of Harry Potter" linkffn(12388283) but what if it applied to everyone at Hogwarts? Perhaps Lily's blood protection is amplified by the school's magic.

If anyone dies then time resets to a few days, weeks or months earlier; the victim (including everyone who died at approximately the same point) retains their memories of the future but everyone else is oblivious.

But the penalty is that no-one has plot armour anymore.

Canon up to when Harry starts school then possible reset points:-

- Hermione killed by the troll in the bathroom. Perhaps time resets to the train ride and she has a second chance to make a good impression with Harry and Ron.

- Harry by his cursed broom. Snape falls off the Quidditch stands when Hermione sets fire to him. Snape gives Hermione/Harry detention in the new past, apparently for no reason, so Harry can't play.

- Ron by an infected dragon bite.

- Draco by something in the Forbidden Forest during their detention. He starts to suspect the trio might have had similar experiences.

- Harry, Ron and Hermione by the Cerberus; Devil's Snare; animated chess set; misidentified potions.

- Harry by Quirrellmort, several times. Eventually he hits on a workable plan.

- Quirrell by Voldemort.

- Harry, beaten to death by Vernon over the destroyed pudding (Too dark?). Harry flees to the Weasley's early.

- Harry and Ron by crashing the flying car.

- Harry by Dobby, many times. Harry avoids each situation after the reset but cannot convince Dobby to stop.

- Colin Creevy, Justin, etc by the Basilisk. Diary!Tom becomes increasingly frustrated that his victims keep outwitting him.

- Everyone by the Basilisk as it invades the great hall at dinner time. Mass panic and demands for an outside investigation after the reset.

- Ginny by Tom Riddle. She chucks the diary again or gives it to Dumbledore.

- Tom Riddle by Harry (or Dumbledore). He finds a new victim and only drains them partially or compels them to leave Hogwarts.

- At this point knowledge of the reset is general.

- Ravenclaws try killing themselves to gain extra study time.

- Weasley twins and others perform increasingly reckless stunts.

- The Ministry are worried Sirius Black might infiltrate Hogwarts and become effectively immortal.

- How does Scabbers manage to dodge Crookshanks at exactly the right moment? A few experiments with other animals and trio start to form a crazy hypothesis.

This one cracked me up!!

I like the idea that living at Hogwarts essentially makes you immortal. But that could be kind of negative: somebody dies of a heart attack, gets reset a few days, has the heart attack again. Even if they have taken steps to have medical assistance on hand, it still hurts like hell.

Then again, maybe magic can fix heart disease, so perhaps heart attack isn't a good example. Basically, something that doesn't have a quick fix that results in a few repeat loops. (You had one of these with Harry taking a few tries to not be killed by Quirrelmort, but I was thinking something medical rather than an event that can be avoided.

** Kind of related but not really: I'm pretty sure there's a fic where Harry's sacrifice in the Forbidden Forest placed the same protection on everyone in the battle. If I remember correctly, it was MoD fic and one of the only reasons he was okay with going with Death was because he knew everyone would be okay.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.
