I've never seen any in all the years I've been reading fanfiction.


** I saw one that was eventually a Lunar Harmony story where Harry was rescued from his cupboard by a Potter family house elf. He was then returned to one of the ancestral Potter properties, and raised under the tutelage of portraits of his paternal grandparents.

For the lift of me, I can't remember the name. I think it may have been started pre-HBP, as I remember there being no mention of horcruxes.

**** I also remember:[[/spoiler][Luna & her parents, Sirius, Hermione & her parents all came to live at the same place. Luna had some sort of mystic vision in which she, Harry, & Hermione got together, and drew a picture of this for Xeno, but couldn't spell Hermione so she left it captioned as Luna, Harry, Her. Because of events I don't remember, both Xeno & Mr Granger die, and Sirius winds up formally marrying either Mrs Granger or Mrs Lovegood, don't remember which. They only attend Hogwarts part time, primarily for classes that neither Sirius nor Mrs Lovegood are capable of teaching. They attend a muggle high school for the rest of their days. The final fight with Voldemort involves him attacking the high school while it's in session.]]

****** I appreciate the suggestion, however I don't believe this one is the one I'm thinking of. From what I remember of the story you linked, [[/spoiler][Harry/Hermione/Luna were all abandoned at a young age and essentially raised themselves while under threat of starvation, whereas in the story I'm thinking of, they were under adult + grandparent portrait + house elf supervision. Furthermore, in the story you linked, the climactic battle against Voldemort involved H/Hr/L returning unexpectedly from something like a time bubble to fight, whereas in the one I'm thinking of, the trio all went to a muggle school for a majority of the time, and formally re-entered the wizarding world by starting part time at Hogwarts in what would have been canon Luna's first year.]].

  Seven Year AU. Suppose the Dursleys had not been Harry's only living relations. How might the young hero that we know and adore have been changed by a loving childhood? The differences might not be as universally positive as one might think. Discontinued.
