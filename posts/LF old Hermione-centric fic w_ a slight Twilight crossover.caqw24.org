:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read about 12 years ago. I think it must have come out shortly after DH was written. Hermione was injured in the war and suffered injuries plus amnesia. I believe she went by the name Jane. While recovering in a mental hospital she became friends with a self-admitted Edward. With the help of his family she ended up moving to Louisiana and lived with a nice older woman that took her in as her daughter. Eventually her friends find her by chance and she is reunited with them.

It sounds odd but it was good and one of the first fanfics I read. I mentioned it to someone who was interested but can't find it online anywhere. Came here hoping someone would be familiar with it.

TIA.
