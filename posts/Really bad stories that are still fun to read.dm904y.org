Basically, if the story is completely horrible, except it's really fun to read, that's what I'm after.


** RobSt. They're samey so just pick one at random.

It's well written technically but the writer hates Weasleys and Dumbledore and is pretty self indulgent about it, and he kinda turns Hermione into "arbitrary pretty girl". Still pretty fun.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.
