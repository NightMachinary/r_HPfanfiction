I thought this was mostly a fanon or fanfiction thing but it's come to my attention that some people think Lucius Malfoy was abusive in canon, which I don't understand. I mean, he was a bad parent by all means and I see the Malfoys as sort of like the wizarding version of the Dursleys, but that's just because they're shitty people.


** In my opinion the series gives a lot of impressions of absolute good vs evil despite the things that actually happen or didn't happen in cannon. So since Lucius is evil to Harry and the good guys, he must be evil to everyone and perform evil actions all the time instead of just in certain situations.

***** JKR wrote, and I agree, that both the Dursley's and Malfoy's one good attribute was the deep love that they held for one another. Yes, they're absolutely awful people, but at the end of the day, they're family, and they treat each other that way.

I can see Lucius being strict, and demanding, but also caring.

** Prior to DH, the impression (gained mostly from the brief interaction in CoS) was that Lucius saw Draco as merely an investment and Draco kept disappointing him by failing in grades, quidditch etc. Then in HBP he failed at being a Death Eater as well. So the theory was that Lucius viewed Draco as a disappointment for an heir.

This was a nice version of events sympathetic to Draco, so a lot of Draco fanfics ran with it. DH debunked this view and showed that Lucius cared for Draco more than any ideology, but the earlier view had stuck by then.

*** I don't know if Lucius actually cared for Draco, only because of what Lucius did in second year. Setting plans in motion to release the basilisk which put his son in danger doesn't show too much care in my opinion.

**** But did Lucius really know that a book would be the key to release a basilisk? He wasn't at Hogwarts during the first incident and since the diary was one of Tom's horcrux set . . . he was probably supposed to keep the diary secure.

Voldemort in book 1 may have directed Quirrell to contact Lucius and set some kind of plan in motion for book 2 but then -- why wouldn't Voldemort/Quirrell have told Lucius - a member of the school board - to raise hell about the Stone in the first week of Draco & Harry's first year then swoop in with the prime minister to get the Stone?

Voldemort was a really poor manager of his evil minions.

***** I read this headcanon that fits with the story perfectly: Lucius wanted to give the diary to Harry. He knew it was some Voldemort's weapon and that it would probably kill mudbloods and mudbloods only. That's why he sent Dobby to spy on Harry. He was not supposed to talk to him though. Then he saw his enemy with his family and talking to mudbloods, things escalated and he decided to punish Arthur by giving Ginny the diary in homes that she, as blood traitor, would be one of the first victims.

In PS, Voldemort didn't contact any of his DEs, he was very weak and didn't even know if they would still work for him or not.

He took a really big risk that a) Ginny would be the one who ended up with the book b) she wouldn't turn the book over to her parents.

Then again - Peter was living with the Weasleys and maybe had a good notion about Ginny's vulnerabilities and he relayed that info to Lucius/Voldemort . . .

But this all depends on the basilisk being able to determine half bloods or muggles and attacking only those who weren't. Was Myrtle a halfblood or muggle? Was the cat or the ghost?

** For a lot of authors, I think it's lazy writing. If authors make the decision to include Lucius to any significant extent (as in, included enough that readers will get a good sense of his character) in the story, they have to choose what kind of person they're going to make him. Is he going to be a complex character who has flawed beliefs, is a terrible person, but still fundamentally caring towards his family? Is he going to be a terrible person and abusive, but still developed enough that his character is interesting and his motivations aren't just 'because he's evil'?

Then there are the lazier authors who turn Lucius into a caricature of who he was in canon. It's easier to make the racist, immoral and corrupt Lucius be abusive because bad people like Lucius are evil through and through. They don't have any redeeming qualities and are ripe for bashing material in fanfic. They don't need a reason to be evil, they just /are/.

I suppose you could argue that Lucius did abuse Dobby, but I think for people like Lucius, there is a world of difference between torturing those you consider beneath you and those you don't.

** For several reasons.

Firstly, people often read very lazily - they take the simplest things, they revolve around those, and don't try to read more deeply or look at the details and contributing factors that lead up to something. Some people have an instinct to simplify a situation to its basic parts: Lucius becomes an abuser for the same reason Albus Dumbledore becomes a monstrous manipulator and Hermione becomes the smartest, most competent witch to ever live. People take things to extremes because they don't necessarily want to think too much about the information is being given to them, and just want to do a surface reading that then concentrates on stupid shit.

Secondly, writing is /hard/. If you don't worry about complex, three-dimensional characterisation, it becomes easier! How do we drum up sympathy for Draco when he's been such a rude bully? Oh, his dad was mean to him! That means it wasn't his fault, and it's all okay! How do we get Narcissa away from Lucius so we can ship her with a character we like more? Oh, Lucius abused Draco! She should leave him! Rinse and repeat until your eyes bleed.

And thirdly... People often misunderstand what abuse is.

It's not abuse to teach your children the stuff you believe in. Does Lucius Malfoy have disgusting, odious beliefs? Yeah, totally. But it's not /abuse/ for people to teach their children stuff you don't agree with. It's not /abuse/ for Draco to be racist, or to be a spoilt brat. Is it shitty for Draco? Yeah, undoubtedly. But it's not abusive - it's Lucius and Narcissa teaching Draco what they believe to be the truth, and perhaps not knowing how to go about punishing him or teaching him restraint, et cetera.

Not being an amazing parent isn't the same as being an abusive one.

The idea that Lucius and Narcissa aren't absolutely trying their best is mad to me, because it's obvious that the both of them love Draco more than anything else in the world. It's pretty obvious to /anybody/ that Lucius didn't really want to return to Voldemort's side - he wasn't a loyal servant. He was looking out for himself, going with what he'd thought was the winning side, and the second time around, he couldn't get away.

So he spent the war letting Voldemort control his household, desperately trying to protect his son and wife. He was constantly asking about Draco, constantly thinking about Draco, and was doing anything he could to make sure Draco, Narcissa and himself were safe. None of these things are excuses for what the things he did, but that's not the /point./

You shouldn't have to think someone is a paragon of virtue to believe they don't hit their children, or verbally abuse them.

I've read fics where Lucius Malfoy tortures Draco - that's obviously not something that happens to Draco. Is Draco scared of disappointing his father? /Yes./ But that doesn't mean Lucius beats him! Draco is used to an unending shower of praise - if Lucius so much as says a cold word to him, he probably doesn't know what to do with it. Children are often afraid of disappointing their parents. No child actually wants someone to tell their parents about something they did wrong - that doesn't mean they're all being abused.

And as for verbal abuse...

Jason Isaacs certainly portrayed Lucius Malfoy as quite a harsh man. He had much more of a temper, he lashed out at Draco a whole lot more, and he seemed to be quite physical with both Draco and Harry - I have some issues with Isaac's portrayal of Lucius Malfoy 'cause I do think it feeds into the "omg lucius BAUSES!! DRACO!!" nonsense. But like, even in the movies, Lucius isn't outright attacking his son or berating him.

The idea that Lucius sits around telling Draco how worthless he is is mad to me. Draco has /excellent/ self esteem: he does not have the attitude of a boy who is not made aware of his strengths, and in fact could probably stand to be more aware of his weaknesses.

Look. Not every parent is perfect. In fact, /no/ parent is perfect.

Good parents, sometimes, drop their children. They don't run fast enough to wipe a skinned knee. They react too harshly, or they get impatient, or they lose a favourite toy; they throw something precious away, or they forget you don't like fish fingers, or they don't understand that you don't want to wear something green. They might not understand your homework, or your hobbies, or you. They might disagree with you, or they might say something nasty about your hair, or careless about your weight, without meaning to.

The relationship between parents and their children is not the relationship between a young human and some angel that is without sin. Parents are tired! They are tired, and angry, or jealous, or ecstatic, or excited, or hopeful, or bored, or aching, or in need of a break. Parents can be criminals, and they can be murderers, and they can be monsters - and that doesn't mean they abuse their children. It doesn't mean they don't /love/ their children.

It isn't abuse for a parent to be a person. Even if it's a person you don't like! I can't believe this is something that needs to be said.

Thank You. I was somewhat bewildered to see all the stuff about "Draco's boggart would be his dad" and "Lucius took it out on Draco" because the Malfoys have one thing going for them: they loved each other. It's like the other user said. It's inconceivable to some that a person as evil as Lucius Malfoy can be a loving parent. He wasn't a good one, because he shoved his beliefs onto a child who wasn't able to think critically and reject them, but that is bad parenting. And bad parenting is not the same as being abusive.

**** And in many ways, Ron and Draco mirror each other. Both the scions of important Pureblood families, one poor, one rich; one the youngest of his brothers, the other an only child. They each have similar flaws - entitlement, a lack of tact, a tendency to sulk - and they share a love of Quidditch and a great adherence to their beliefs.

In parallel, Lucius and Arthur share a lot in common, too - patriarchs that do their very best for their children, even if they're not perfect, on each side of the war.

It really helps to think of the similarities between "light" and "dark" characters, even if their goals are very different.

** I think a lot of people find it hard to see that people can compartmentalize their evil and violence. Someone can go to work, kill women and children (especially if they don't see those people as "people") and go home and love their wife and kids.

Personally, I find that way scarier than a big bad pure evil.

It's also, imho, laziness. Making Draco an abused kid gives them a lot of outs and explanations for his shitty behavior in canon. Otherwise, if the author wants a likable character they have to do the work to redeem him through character growth while having to maintain a quality of writing that will keep people around while the character is still a terrible person.

** While I agree that the Malfoys love their son in canon, in fanfiction I think an argument can be made for an abusive Lucius Malfoy that's not just laziness or an excuse to forgive all of Draco's sins.

In real life, children can turn out like Draco because they're overly spoiled. Another way they can end up like that is if they've been abused. Abused children growing up to be bullies happens. As for his swagger, a good writer could make it the act of a Draco with both a superiority and inferiority complex. He's better than everyone because he was raised to believe Malfoys are superior, but because his father emotionally abuses him by withholding love and denigrating or humiliating him unless Draco acts perfectly, then he's also got an inferiority complex. So he goes out of his way to make others feel like dirt, and because he's racist, he goes after Hermione. You don't have to have Lucius beating Draco up, casting the cruciatus on him, or molesting him. Emotional manipulation will suffice. So while it's not canon, a good writer could make it believable.

***** Uh I mean, I wouldn't consider it emotional abuse either. It's not the best parenting, comparing how your child does with someone else, but a lot of parents do that sort of thing sometimes. And Draco also never once felt like he was "lacking" or "incompetant" compared to Hermione. We don't know if it happens again, and it didn't seem to affect how his Dad treated him, considering that he buys the Quidditch team new brooms just so that Draco can get the position he wants. I feel like there's a difference between a parent having high expectations and being abusive.
