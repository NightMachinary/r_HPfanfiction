Hello all,

I have had an idea for awhile but too busy to write and have the energy for it. Pretty much Harry and Draco find mutual ground and understanding as they battle a horror that has kidnapped a few students in Hogwarts. I'm not looking for slash.

Harry returns to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione for an '8th year' but so does Draco Malfoy.

Over the summer period Hogwarts begins its rebuild and Death Eaters are put on trial and sent to prison, however Harry puts in a good word about Draco to keep him out of prison (I believe this is what DD would have done, and Harry thinks that Draco could be redeemed), although not without punishment. Draco needs to go back to school and promote interhouse cooperation blah blah.

While at Hogwarts Christmas looms and while Hermione and Ron go home, Harry decides to stay at Hogwarts. So do a few other students and Draco Malfoy, who now has no home to go to. (For whatever reason)

Draco tries several times to talk to Harry about why he had not been put in prison, but Harry avoids him.

While the castle is quiet things start to happen. The recent battle had caused the castle to open some sort of underworld portal and something begins taking the students that have stayed for christmas. The teachers seemed completely unfazed as though in a trance and Harry and Draco end up working together to find the students and vanquish the horror.

Anyway I'd like to see what you guys think and or come up with. :)
