I've been listening to Witch, Please and re-reading the series, and now that I'm a bit more grown/after a suggestion in one of the episodes of Witch, Please I'm interested in reading some top-quality fanfiction from the point of view of the professors and staff who were there during Harry's years. Gen or slash of possible. Hoo boy, I can't believe I'm jumping back down this rabbithole.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Why would Albus ask Severus to be the Head of Hufflepuff? Why should Severus accept? How would a Severus succeed in working with this house?

** On LiveJournal, there was a Minerva McGonagall-specific fest that ran for several years: [[http://minerva-fest.livejournal.com][Minerva Fest]]

You might also check out [[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/][Hoggywartyxmas]], a holiday-themed fest that focuses specifically on the Hogwarts staff and older characters in general.

I would also recommend browsing through [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/][HP Beholder]] on InsaneJournal, an exchange fest created to celebrate HP's unconventionally attractive characters. The Hogwarts staff are often featured, although since the focus is on pairings, you won't find gen fics here. It built up a stellar reputation during the seven years it ran.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.
