So, what I'm looking for is a fic with a nice fluffy romance arch. The pairing/ rest of the plot is mostly irrelevant. What I don't want to see:

- Any mention of previous partners
- Any hint of infidelity (even if it's just a /hillarious/ misunderstanding)
- Any hint of sexual violence (even if it's to have one of the characters rush in and save the day)
- Any extended break ups. (Particularly for bullshit noble reasons)

Many thanks.


** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] has written some fantastic romances.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] HarryxDaphne

#+begin_quote
  Daphne gives a Eulogy for Harry revealing their secret relationship.
#+end_quote

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] HarryxGabrielle

#+begin_quote
  A man who is lost in his own country. A girl who needs her mate to survive. A tale of Quidditch and romance, of anger and betrayal, of friendship and enmity. A story of the power of hope.
#+end_quote

Touches on some of the points you didn't want, but I still highly recommend it.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] HarryxPansy

#+begin_quote
  When Pansy finds herself on the wrong side of Voldemort, she persuades her parents that only one person could help them. Harry. A story that looks at what could happen if Harry had someone who loved him, someone who would push him, and someone who would back him financially.
#+end_quote

Some of my favourite stories are on Jeconais' page.

*** Just read hope and really enjoyed it, Harry did seem a bit over powered but the fix wasn't centred around how godlike he was so that was a nice change. The way it was all slowly built up was great, very good recommendation. Going to try the Harry pansy one now.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4703843/1/That-Old-House]])

That Old House is so sweet and fluffy it will make you smile while your teeth fall out and your brain turns to cotton. It matches all of you requirement minus one, it briefly touches on Harry's previous relationship with Ginny but only enough to say that it didn't/couldn't work out. I've read this one a couple of times and I can't recommend it enough.

I'm trying to think of a bellmione fic where Hermione gets sent back in time by an older Bellatrix Lestrange and falls in love with a teenage Bellatrix Black but for the life of me I can't remember the name of it. If anyone could give me a link that would be nice.

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
