Only to get squashed because she isn't exceptional like them.


** She is the Director of Magical Law Enforcement. She knows which battles she can win and which ones she absolutely cannot. If she could've defeated either of them, she would have done that in her prime. However there is one case here, her realising that she has an untreatable disease which will eat away at her magic and mind until she doesn't remember herself or her niece could lead to a final battle of futility where she tries to take out Voldemort so that Susan can live safely. That's the only way I can see that working.

*** In canon I agree with you, even if Dumbledore isn't a villain.

In fanfiction I just see her hyped so much for no reason other than her title and having a niece.

**** True that. I generally skip these unless the plot is captivating or quite funny. Though if a fanfic does come with a situation as you said, Amelia getting utterly squashed by one of these two , it could be about making emotional character arc for Susan or an Auror under Amelia's command or both. If she gets squashed for no reason then the bashing police will come in.

***** Or just a crack fic. Either way, much better than Mary Sue Amelia.
