Two of the bottles held Nettle Wine, so I want to see Hermione get the riddle wrong, or Quirrel put them back in the wrong spots to confuse anyone who might follow him, and Harry ends up drinking the Wine. Being 11, he'd have a terrible constitution, and would end up drunk. Bonus points if he gets the potion right after drinking the wine, and goes on to face Quirrel drunk. "Gimme a hug Proffessor" *proceeds to melt Quirrel with his hug*


** wouldnt he just get burned up by the fire if that happened

**** He would only know he'd drunk alcohol if he had ever drunk alcohol before (very unusual for a child his age with a normal upbringing, but his upbringing ain't exactly normal) but even then there are plenty of alcoholic drinks where the taste of alcohol is not very noticeable.

***** In the UK its fairly normal to have had a sip of your parents wine at dinner. However, Harry would definitely not have been given any wine by the Durselys so its not that relevant.

**** If she is stupid enough to trust a Riddle written by the man who they suspect being the thief, she is stupid enough to get Harry killed...

*** I doubt the fire would actually actually kill anyone, maybe stun or just not let through. Wizards in general, and especially Hogwarts teachers, are pretty irresponsible but I don't think Dumbledore would have allowed a trap that would outright kill.

** Children don't get drunk from just a sip of wine. Or even from a glass of wine. And even when they do get drunk it still takes time for the booze to make its way form the gut to the blood to the brain. If he doesn't immediately go "wait, that was booze, not a potion", then he'd step into the fire stone cold sober.
