I've never been a fan of Ginny. But recently, I've grown more open to fanfics which include her, either having a relationship with Harry or not. What are some of your favorite Harry/Ginny fics with adventure as the main focus but also with some Harry/Ginny elements?

Thanks in advance for any recs!

P.S. No soul-bond, please.
