The story I am searching for is one where Harry is the reincarnation of Salazar Slytherin and Ron is the reincarnation of Godric Gryffindor. I believe it is Harry who starts remembering first. Hermione may have also been one of the Founders. The Order begins distrusting Harry who uses dark magic and for having been Salazar. They really like Ron since he was Godric and can't believe that he and Salazar were ever friends. In this fic Salazar left the school after an argument with the others and is attacked in his shack by a robber and is killed. Helga or Rowena later finds him dead inside. Any help finding this fic is appreciated.

  Their plans all worked, but the cost was too high. Voldemort might have died in the long run, but he takes so many people with him that it cannot possibly be considered a 'victory'. So a group of four decide to send themselves back in time to fix it... What could possibly go wrong? Alternate Reality; Time travel; Reincarnated Founders; Harry is Salazar; Canon pairs

** Harry is Salazar has always fascinated me. There are quite too few fics like that. But even though it's not what you wanted, there was a great fic on AO3 that had Hermione, Harry, Ron and Ginny as the founders. linkao3(873337)

  The night before Quidditch try-outs in the Trio's fifth year, a mysterious magical accident takes place in the Gryffindor common room, transporting Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny back over a thousand years in time to a century of discord, persecution and tumult, where they lose their memories of their own time and become the Founders of Hogwarts.When another such occurrence returns them to a time they can no longer think of as their own, Godric, Helga, Salazar and Rowena must defeat Voldemort and overcome the divisions within the school they founded, while simultaneously trying to uncover the reason for their time-travel.Some elements have been borrowed, with permission, from the work of Wicked Witch of the North on fanfiction.net, who has since closed her account.
