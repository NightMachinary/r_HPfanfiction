:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I've read it years ago and I believe it's a one-shot. Basically, Harry is summoned by the Muggle Govt and one of these employees is Hermione. She's been leading the charge and is attempting to basically eradicate magic.

Harry basically gets into her mind about how she's doing all of this because she couldn't control her magic and her parents were attacked by muggle-hating obliviators. Then, he shows off his power and gets out of there.

Hope someone can help out (and hope this is the right flair for the post)


** It's chapter 9 of "Adventures in child care and other one-shots"

*** What I loved about this story is that it shows Hermione being expelled before she even starts Hogwarts, because she couldn't resist using her wand.

After all, in canon she says that she tried several spells at home "and they all worked for me," on the Hogwarts Express when she first meets them.

I think this exchange on the train is the reason why fanon went through all these mental gymnastics about the Trace, such as that it is applied on the boat ride to the castle. After all, if Hermione could do a bunch of spells before starting school without getting into trouble for underage magic, she must not have been under the Trace yet.

This exchange is also used in some bashing stories, saying either that she lied, or that Dumbledore arranged for her to be exempt from the underage magic restrictions as part of his manipulations for getting her to spy on Harry.

Thank you!
