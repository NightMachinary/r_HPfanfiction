Looking for a fic that I read awhile back where it turns out Voldemort cursed himself into insanity by making horcruxes and HP and his meddling friends have to put him back together like Humpty Dumpty.

Other things - Voldie was somewhat like the Fisher King, where the king and land are one, so as he descended into insanity, it dragged his followers along with him, so no one on his side could fix him. And it was probably a Dumbledore bashing fic... It's not Lily's Changes by Arekay although that does fit the fixing-Voldie & Dumbles-bash criteria.

Anyone have any leads?


** There's quite a few that use this plotline, do you remember anything more specific?

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
