I posted on here and was recommended to read The Changeling, I finally finished along with it's 2(!) sequels last night, although I think the second is still getting updated, I hope. Anyway I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations that were similar, preferably a Harry/Ginny pairing. Any help is appreciated.


** I really enjoyed The Changeling and also liked linkffn(11419408). It's also a Ginny centric fic.

  The thing about war is that it never ends. Not really. The battlefields just change locations. Harry and Ginny after the war. Sequel to The Changeling. First story in the Armistice Series. Harry/Ginny.
