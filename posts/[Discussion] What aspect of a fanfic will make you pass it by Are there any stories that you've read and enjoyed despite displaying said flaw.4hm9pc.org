For me, any story not written in at least Third person, preferably Third Person Limited, is almost immediately closed and ignored. However, after struggling through a large portion of Jbern's "Bungle" I'm actually finding myself enjoying it.

So my question to you, What will cause you to near instantly ignore a fic (Grammatical style, simplicity, tropes, slash, whatever) And is there a fic that you've enjoyed despite it featuring said flaws?


** It's really hard to describe it, but I guess the best way would be to say, I won't read a fic where the dialogue doesn't flow well. This comprises a number of things, ranging from it seeming in character, to the author not reusing words over and over again. It's like porn vs art, you know it when you see it.

I can get over grammatical errors, spelling issues, but the dialogue must flow. Otherwise I pretty much always give up within a chapter or two of starting.

**** Real speech is not the same as dialogue. Real speech is full of umma and errs, incomplete sentences, and other flaws that most people don't want to see in dialogue.

Also, it's difficult to envision how other people would talk in certain situations, even if you know how you yourself would talk.

Also, not being a native speaker makes it more difficult. Slang expressions or accents aren't really taught at school. Also, I read and write a lot in English, but I don't speak it very often.

Because of Bobmin's passing (Rest in Peace) I've finally started reading Sunrise over Britain. Harry and Hermione call each other "My Heart" there, but they are really close in this fic (for many reasons) and the rest of it is quite well written. It's still somewhat annoying, but tolerable.

**** Heck, him not receiving a trial doesn't mean he can get one just like that, actually. Him being thrown into Azkaban without a trial is caused by the wizarding world operating under martial law and there being “overwhelming evidence of guilt” which basically gave Crouch the capability to single-handedly give out the “guilty” verdict without a trial. Thus, even though there was no trial, there is a verdict.

But, obviously, those stories have the characters speaking out like that because the authors don't know and aren't willing to know.

** Excessive spelling and grammar errors are the main reason I stop reading some fics. Often this extends to the summary so it's easy to skip them, but if I read the first chapter and it's already hurting me to read it, I won't read on.

*** It gets even worse when they start training some kind of physical art and become masters in mere months. Often authors that do this think its a great idea to throw in some martial arts mysticism/romanticism ("Oh Sensei, teach me your secret arts") for good measure.

As someone who practices a traditional Japanese martial art it just pisses me off royally. Anyone who knows what they are talking about will not try to fight someone hand-to-hand when they are confronted by a gun. Considering every wizard is armed with a wand (that offers way more possibilites than a gun) it seems pretty pointless to invest much time in a martial art - just use expelliarmus instead.

Near the bottom.

Anyway, you need to realize the Snape wasn't a complete dick because he liked it. He came from an abusive home (A scene in his memories show him cowering in the corner while his father yells), he was a half blood sorted into Slytherin during the rise of Voldemort, and he was frequently singled out by the Marauders. He would almost always be saved by Lily; and you know his friends in Slytherin would give him shit for being saved by a 'Mudblood'.

As for the 'life debt' deal, Snape obviously doesn't care about it. The James he knew at that point was just a bully, trying to save him to save his own skin.

As for Voldemort trusting him, Snape brought him the prophecy (Incomplete at the time, but they didn't know that), and killed Dumbledore. Voldemort is arrogant as all fuck, and fears death above all; he wouldn't consider that Dumbledore planned his own death to put Severus in Voldie's good graces.

And I don't see why you bring up the dark side when I pointed out that Lily would love him if he didn't practice the dark arts...

It kinda just seems to me that you bash the pairing not because it wouldn't work, but because you just hate Snape.

***** To be fair, though, most people would be perfectly fine with someone they never really got to know and with whom they always fought and had unpleasant encounters being killed. It doesn't make us horrible, it just means we are human and flawed.

Snape is, in at least some ways, a bad person, in some maybe even a terrible one. But not caring about the well-being of someone who is basically his enemy, or someone who is said enemy's child, is not one of those ways.

** I'm very very picky, to the point that if I don't like how the writing flows within the first couple of paragraphs, I'll close the story.

Instant passes are slash, shitty grammar, gender bending the characters for no reason, overpowered Harry, and poor characterization. Character bashing is rage-inducing for me. It's an excuse for authors who can't properly write three dimensional characters.

All that said, I'm currently addicted to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]], which contains a genderbent Harry, a low-key slash pairing going on in the background, and a pairing that I am completely disturbed by. I started reading just to see how bad it would be. However, the writing and characterization was so good, I kept reading. I recommend it, even if you don't usually like that type of story, simply because it's a damn good story.

** First person, I can't get into it. And I really hate fics that have a lot of back and forth dialog, especially if it's in the great hall and revolves around Ron chewing with his mouth open

** Pretty much the only things I avoid are explicit het and the 'all straight people' cast. I've backed out of every single one of the former, but for the latter, I've made it through and enjoyed linkffn(Promises Unbroken) and the subsequent series, and and oldie-but-goodie I first read as it was being posted--linkffn(Never Alone, Never Again). That latter probably dates me a bit.

I'd add linkao3(A Marauder's Plan) and linkffn(Growing Up Black) to that, but late reveals in each show Sirius as being either bi or gay. Nevertheless, I started both with the belief that 'straight people everywhere.'

There are certainly types of fics for which I have higher (MUCH higher) standards for--mpreg, Wolfstar with Sirius regularly topping, any sort of sexually dominant Sirius really. And definitely other categories where my standards are so low, I'm still digging the hole I'd need to find them--I would possibly actually sell my soul for crossovers featuring Sirius, if anyone happens to know any other than the like three I've found.

*** I can honestly say you're the first person I've met who prefers Mpreg to het.
