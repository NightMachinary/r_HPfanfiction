** [[/u/Praveen4]] is likely yet another sleeper troll account, along the lines of [[/u/varunf]], [[/u/Klopptheclown]], [[/u/worydfandomer]], [[/u/gzgGahavaavaava]], and [[/u/Seenu1]]. Same usage of accounts created years ago, same subs to which he posts, same style of commenting and posting, and likely the same vendetta against DLP.net. He has likely posted [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/what-is-your-favorite-pairing.35723/][the exact same thread on DLP.net]], among other troll threads, such as [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/is-ron-an-asshole.35717/][this]], [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/what-you-think-of-harry-ginny.37511/][this]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/can-we-please-talk-about-the-hypocrisy-of-some-people-in-this-forum.37521/][this]]. He has gotten banned from that forum, but keeps coming back every now and then with a new account.

  Harry/Fleur is my favorite pairing. Harry and Fleur are perfect for each other. Both hate attention they get from others.
#+end_quote

Is there any canon evidence for this? She was characterized as conceited and arrogant at first, and those type of people don't usually hate attention. I'm fairly certain the "Ugh, my veela heritage makes people insufferable" thing comes from fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Also Daphne is pureblood royalty so she will teach Harry proper pureblood customs.
#+end_quote

We don't see any real evidence of purebloods acting like royalty. Nor is there any evidence that purebloods /are/ royalty. Even if there was, Harry would absolutely despise acting like that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry/Hermione
#+end_quote

I hate Ron/Hermione, but Harry and her don't work either. Yeah, they get along better than her and Ron, but he considers her nagging annoying, he only found her attractive during the Yule Ball, and he doesn't think hanging out with her and only her is all that much fun.

**** Oh there are definitly some gross ships. Snape/anybody, really, makes me not read it. Draco pairings also generally get a no, although i enjoyed "the malfoy case" a lot. I think its mostly draco/ginny, draco/hermione, and draco/harry that really bug me. None of those 3 would /ever/ (in my opinion) give draco any kind of a chance in that way.

*** I guess I've been desensitized to this kind of thing. I don't even blink at Harry/Lily fics. I'd honestly enjoy reading a good time travel one. It's not like either really had the chance to form that mother/son barrier. I find Harry/Voldemort & Harry/Snape far worse, and they are much more popular.

*** Why, though? Unless you're being facetious.

A well-written pairing can make a good story great. And romance is a big part of life.

Personally, am a Dramione fan. So much potential for corruption and/or redemption arcs in those fics. Sadly, most are wasted.

**** Because the entire concept ruins the fandom. Rather than trying to actually write a story about something upcoming writers say something like, "I want to write a Draco/Hermione story where..." and you're already boned at that point. It's such a backward way to think about writing or reading that it drives me nuts.

I highly doubt anyone on here picked up the first Harry Potter book and thought, "I hope this is a Harry/Hermione story!' or picked up A Game of Thrones and thought "This better be Robb and Margaery!" Going into anything with ship goggles and a pairing focus is just backwards.

Writers should want to write a story in that universe dealing with something about that universe. If, somehow, a romance develops between said characters, great. But having that be the focus and purpose for it all detracts from the story. And it only hurts that half the time it's established by chapter two. I would have no problem arguing that pairings, as a whole, are the root cause of a great deal of bad writing.

I have received over a hundred review and messages about a story I'm working on asking 'What's the pairing?' and nothing else. No comments on the text, nothing. There isn't a god damn pairing. If I had to label it I'd label it Emily/Martin! As that is the only real romantic relationship in the text for the whole two chapters it's a thing! And yes, that's including the Harry and Hermione scenes!

Thinking about writing in terms of breeding pairs and happily ever after is just the wrong way to go about it. And that line of thought comes straight out of pairings.

***** I think the focus on shipping is born from the desire to avoid certain pairings. If I don't know the pairing, I'm not even going to bother with the story because I started far too many fics where at some point the author decides to drop some pairing (main or background, doesn't matter), which I just can't see working. That pushes the fic beyond what I find believable and that ruins fics for me. My suspension of disbelief has its limits and once crossed, I find it nearly impossible to still like the story. It's like biting in a sandwich and then finding that it has the one topping you loathe. The sandwich may be superb, but the one ingredient still ruins the overall taste.

I agree with your sentiment that one should tell stories which go beyond "they get together and have lots of hot sex". Unless the story is short (below 20k), Romance just doesn't make a very interesting plot. Adding drama and angst just for the sake of it is bad writing.

***** I agree with you up to a point.

In my opinion, a pairing should be the zesty flavor on a story; it shouldn't revolve around who wants to fu...kiss who. The HP universe is large and vast: there is tons of room for original plots.

However, we all have our fancies. Someone wants to read an in-depth exploration of magical themes; someone else just wants to get closer to to characters they already have an emotional bond with. They might enjoy bad writing. They might not care about some overarching plot. They might just want some romance with a sizzle of smut. And to each his own; there's no right or wrong.

Of course, I get your frustration regarding the abundance of pure pairing stories. And about the reviews. It sucks when you want some feedback, but all you get is some shallow question or a comment from a person who obviously hasn't payed attention to what's written. But this is fanfiction. It's expected.

I started reading your story because of a potential pairing between Harry and fem!Voldemort. That's what drew me in, I'm not gonna lie, although I have tried leaving reviews that are deeper than a generic thanks! I know it's a lot of work to write a story.

***** I think is a problem that's just unique to a lot of modern media. There has to be a romance element. There has to be a “pairing”. It's why there's hamfisted romance sub plots in every blockbuster, or every TV show. Now yes there are a lot that grow organically and there are romance movies that obviously had an intended end state. But it seems that everyone feels compelled to have some romance plot line.

I don't think wanting a romance is a bad thing for writing, nor is wanting a certain outcome in mind. I think it's just especially apparent in fanfiction when things like that can come off as wish-fulfillment or lazy. There isn't anything wrong with happily ever after, it's just most writers forget that it has to be earned.
