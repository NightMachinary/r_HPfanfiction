*** Okay, I have read the story, and I believe it has a lot of potential. I think you really need to go back and flesh out who Dudley really is. The only "emotion" we get after [[/spoiler][he murders the old wizard]] is a "grin". I think you need to go into his head more and give him more personality.

*** Hey, going to read it later. Just want to say that you should publish at both FFN and the tumblr. because it is always good to have a backup and a place to really say that this is MY story.

** Interesting idea and a pretty good story overall. The writing could use a bit of work, but that only comes from practice and creative criticism on a level I'm not able to give.
