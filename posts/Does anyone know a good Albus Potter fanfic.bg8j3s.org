** As far as Albus Potter fics go, I personally love the Albus Potter series by Noah Phantom. It may not be what you're looking for, but it is Epilogue compliant, and each installment (of the seven fic series) is over 100k words.

Here's the first one: linkffn(8417562)

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** No one suggested Tea Time Series? I'm disappointed.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time series]], stared with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]]. It's CC compliant but totally disregard its characterization and stick with the original books. The first story is full with family fluff and the setup for Albus/Scorpius relationship, but the second one moved to a darker side with a new dark uprising. What I liked is how both the next-gen and the original casts are both important in their own ways, there's no useless adult and the children have their own 'war' at Hogwarts.

If you like next-gen stuff you might also enjoy the ones below:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]]. Not really canon; Percy, Charlie, and George married different people and has different child, other than that everyone is pretty close to their canon counterpart. It's more of a slice of life stuff that covers */everyone/* from the extended Weasley family, heck it even has a well-written subplot for Parker, Percy's son. I think Albus isn't gay here, but he's friend with Scorpius, but Hugo is bi and Dudley is gay.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7961051/1/Inter-Arma][Inter Arma]]. More James-centric, than Albus-centric. AU where the goblin rebellion started immediately after the war ends. I liked this one because it's similiar to The Tea Time Series, there's no useless adult and they're not really OOC; the children are pretty useless tough.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

These are old. I remember liking them when I read them. But that was a decade ago. My tastes have changed, and acceptable fanfic has changed. So they could actually be good, or they could be terrible.

** I really enjoy the Albus in Stygian Series, but there's no Albus slash (there is some romance between female characters). He is also not majorly angsty at first but as the series progresses he does definitely take a very angsty turn. Still the black sheep and still has issues feeling he has to live up to Harry, like Albus in the Cursed Child. Also strong friends with Scorpius but not romantically so.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
