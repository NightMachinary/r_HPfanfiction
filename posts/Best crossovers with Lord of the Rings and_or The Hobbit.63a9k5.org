** linkffn(11281891) Harry and Ginny end up in Middle Earth. Abandoned. Also this is the only HPxLotR worth reading that isn't written by Steelbadger.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) Best of the lot by a large margin. The Witch King tries to yank Morgoth back from wherever and gets Harry from the Kings Cross scene of DH instead.

linkffn(11027086)

linkffn(11120132)

Steelbadger's other two fics. One is crack, they're okay.

  Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest expecting to die. Instead he wakes up in the Third Age of Middle Earth, lost and confused. Realistic crossover with canon Harry. No power-ups, elfling Harry or tenth walker. No slash.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** It's a bit off the wall, but my favourite story in the HP/Tolkien area is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]] by Araceil. It's a Harry Potter crossover in name only, really, and it has basically all of the usual red flags. Despite that, though, I really do recommend giving it a go. I think I often value love of the fandom over other things, especially with Lord of the Rings (where love of Legolas seems to be the most common reason to write things), and this definitely has the warm fuzzies for LotR.

In other news, my own LotR crossovers (I am Steelbadger on FFN) are still being actively worked on. I just had a bit of a crisis of confidence in my plans recently.

** From what I read of it, [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/52][Not Quite a Maia]] is pretty good. At 551769 words, I think it's longer than the entirety of the LOTR books; however, it's permanently unfinished (which is why that's a fictionhunt link).

*** The wordcount is why I laugh at the Hobbit having been 3 movies. LOTR was not a short trilogy, but the Hobbit was only 70% of the word count of Return of the King, the shortest of the 3.

I have a really hard time even starting any fanfic with more than about 250k words. I don't care how good it is, seeing 500k+ and incomplete is a really good way to make me ignore something thinking maybe I'll check back in later.

**** I read it a while back. Beginning is awesome and very well written. And I mean professional quality writing. But story kind of looses itself at some point and I gave up waiting for updates. Main characters are Neville and Mrs. Weasley.

  Harry Potter shows up in the middle of the Council of Elrond, and shows them why all magic is equal, but some magics are more equal than others. Brace yourself: it's a Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossover kinda-sorta crack!fic one-shot.
