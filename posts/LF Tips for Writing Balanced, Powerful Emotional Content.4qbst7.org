I've looked over [[http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/01/30/creating-emotion-in-the-reader/][several]] [[http://jamigold.com/2012/06/3-tips-for-writing-heavy-emotional-scenes/][online]] [[http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/creating-emotional-frustration-in-your-characters][resources]] but would really appreciate any assistance with creating intense, but not overwrought, emotional scenes that clearly define characters' emotions and motivations for the readers.

Have you ever come across a story that does an emotional scene in a particularly succinct but powerful way? What did you like about it and what about the characters' dialogue or writer's narration made you feel that way?

Thank you in advance for any help you're able to give.


** According to my reviews, I've made people cry before. I'm not sure how useful/applicable my advice will be, but I'll give it a shot...

I think the best thing to do is to draw from your own experiences and then escalating them. Obviously none of us have been in a wizarding war or magical battle, but everyone has been sad at some point in their lives, even if it's just screwing up on that big test or some kid being mean to you on the playground. When my mum told me she had cancer, I just sort of stared at her. My eyes were watering, but I was holding it together, and then the fucking dog came and stole food off my plate. It was so stupid and not at all the sort of sombre cancer reveal you get in movies, so I started laughing in this really disbelieving way then burst into tears.

I feel like where fanfic writers can go wrong is by taking away those human reactions that don't fit with a romanticised view of sadness or emotion. They can't resist throwing a little pity party of other characters talking to each other about how much pain the MC must be going through, or big dramatic speeches with poetic lines about hope and love. I think it's more powerful to let the reader feel the grief of the characters rather than telling them that they're grieving - it's that age old rule of showing rather than telling. Think about body language, think about shock and denial. Think about how you have reacted and physically felt after receiving bad news. Perhaps it's just me, but when I'm feeling very overwhelmed emotionally, I feel like my chest is very cold, or heavy. Don't go overboard on the description, but use just enough so that the reader can empathise, perhaps remembering back to times when they too have been frightened, or devastated.

This is a scene I wrote that made one of the mods on SIYE suggest I add a tear-jerker warning. It's of George finding out about Fred from Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  She nodded dully and waited a few moments before she too, turned around, intent on doing something until this nightmare was over. She began to head to the doors, meaning to follow Oliver, but a familiar laugh from the stairs caught her attention, and she froze, staring up at them.

  George, Lee and Seamus were jogging down the stairs, looking weary and roughed up, but laughing gently, Seamus mumbling something about gallows humour. George spotted Ginny, and his face broke into a wider grin.

  ‘All right, Ginny? Did you hear Lord Chatty too then? Why does he talk about himself in the third person? If he's not careful, people will start to think he's mentally unstable.'

  Lee and Seamus chuckled, but her heart seemed to stop, or possibly it was no longer there. His smile faltered a little at her unchanging expression, of which she assumed was one of dull despair.

  ‘I heard about Colin,' he said gently. ‘It's rough, I'm sorry, Ginny.' She found herself shaking her head slightly at him. Lee and Seamus seemed to realise something was wrong immediately, their expressions turning to ones of dread, but George kept smiling gently.

  ‘We've all fought really well though, I bet you did too. Did you get to say any cool one-liners? I did loads. Where is everyone? I need to swap notes-'

  ‘George,' she said, and her voice came out as a croak.

  His smile was now frozen, and something had clicked behind his eyes. ‘Ginny? Has... Has something else happened?'

  She couldn't bring herself to move, or speak. Her mouth opened slightly, and now she remembered her conversation with Percy, could see the same thing happening, but she didn't want to be Percy, she didn't want to be the one to tear out George's heart, she wasn't strong enough for this-

  ‘Ginny? Is it someone in the family? Ginny? Ginny!'

  She was now struggling to breathe, she was shaking from it. Her voice was gone, along with her breath and her heart.

  ‘Not Mum or Dad?' He was looking at her urgently, but then he looked to the Great Hall and perhaps he could see the family huddled, maybe he could see that it was not his parents...

  ‘Ginny? Talk to me! Not Ron? Bill? Charlie? Percy?'

  She stared at him, her eyes were filling with tears but still she was rooted to the spot. He stared back at her, and gave an odd, shallow laugh, grinning again, though it didn't meet his eyes. ‘That's not funny, Ginny,' he said.

  ‘George...' she whispered, tilting her head and shaking it gently, her jaw trembling. ‘George... I-I'm sorry...'

  He laughed again, though now his eyes were shining, and he was backing away from her shaking his head, his face just as pale as Fred's had been. Lee gripped his arm to stop him from falling, and George used the momentum to launch himself into a sprint, rushing to the Great Hall, to the huddled family...

  Ginny closed her eyes as she heard the howl. It was like a fatally wounded animal, the most terrible noise she had ever heard, a memory worse than seeing Fred himself. She broke down, wailing herself, she wanted to scream but it felt as though her lungs were too cold.

*** Thank you very much! I can see the similarities between what you described from personal experience and the blurb you shared from your story. That's an excellent example.

If someone writes an emotional scene, is the author expected to add a preface notifying the reader in advance?

**** Nah, I think the mod was just trying to compliment me. I did anyway though, because I'd already had the two previous chapters emotionally pretty heavy and, not gonna lie, I was kind of proud of myself. I usually don't do authors notes at all.

Not any more than they are expected to write “Warning: May cause emotions” at the beginning of every single story you write.

But that's a bit of a joke. So I'll get serious for a moment and say that no, you aren't really expected to do it. If it's something really really bad then you might or might not want to add a trigger warning to it (because, though many people are going overboard with the usage of the word “trigger” and they should get used for boxing practice for a bit, there really are people out there with issues of that ilk and you might happen to want to be considerate towards them). But with normal emotions there's really no need, especially with emotions being very much a subjective thing.

*** Ok, yeah, that deserved the warning. Though I frankly don't believe in adding warnings, because it ruins the suspense... But dang, that made me tear up just from that scene.

** As a reader all I can say is that it has a lot to do with the build up leading up to a single (short) point of breakthrough. Emotional scenes don't have to be dramatic, in fact overly dramatic and long-winded descriptions just make me point and laugh. If the build up is good (that cold heavy sinking feeling weighing on your chest being built up) then just one powerful sentence will make me tear up - but going on and on and dragging the scene out to try and squeeze more tears does nothing.

Also sometimes it helps if you describe the scene from one character's POV instead of every single person's reaction - so the reader can better empathise and lock onto one character's emotions at a time.

*** Very true, on all counts.

To me overdescription is the bane of fanfiction, in particular emotional scenes. You want the reader to immerse themselves in the situation so they can empathise with the characters. Overdescription breaks the flow and the feeling.

Also, if you want the feeling to last longer for the reader, a trick you can do is the close the door on the scene and end the chapter. Dont be too abrupt about it, but dont come to a resolution. "Fade to black" in some way and let the reader sit there in shock or grief along with the characters for a moment instead of hitting the next chapter/page turn button.
