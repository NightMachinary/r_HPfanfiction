I read Hidden Kingdom because someone was looking for it on this sub, I really enjoyed what it had available but it ended at chapter 9 just before Harry leaves for Hogwarts. Are there other stories along those lines, with a Self-Sufficient!Harry?


** Man I love that fic. I reread it earlier and dude I was just thinking about asking if anyone knew stories like it.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.
