What are your favorite stories with great world building or magical theory that avoid rehashing the books? I am not interested in going through Harry's years at Hogwarts again (unless they're just completely unique). Well-written is a must!

Any main characters, pairings, gen, all time periods. I would prefer completed fics, but open to anything not abandoned.


** What does rehashing mean to you? Because certain stations of canon are inevitable if the world is kept the same.

*** I want to avoid rereading seven years worth of school days and teenage drama. If it's a plot point, great! But school drama for the sake of school drama is a no-go.

** Aspen is the Queen of plotting. Her story is so rich and unique while still feeling very like Harry Potter. Not sure if there's enough world building in the broader sense, but the story is completely divergent from canon and sooo layered, my god. Also she's on book three now and by word count her series is now longer than the entire HP series. So there's that.

*** Okay. I got to Chapter 16 and couldn't handle how out of character Snake was. He goes from wishing Harry mental anguish to getting him drunk and soothingly massaging his scalp in a few days. Huh? Thank you for the rec though.
