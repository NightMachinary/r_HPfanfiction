So I posted a reply to a really fun thread about Harry as the MoD using necromantic magic (my reply here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gyzb79/thinking_of_writing_a_necromancer_master_of_death/ftda12e?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]) but I couldn't stop thinking about the question of what uniting the Hallows actually means.

We're never given any indication that it has happened before, and Harry immediately abandons all but the Cloak and descends into a life of mediocrity.

So, even though I'm 30 chapters into my main story, I went ahead and wrote out the intro to my take on a MoD!Harry. Guess some ideas you just can't shake.

Nothing new under the sun, but I will of course be putting my own spin on the trope.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter's Disarming Charm collided with the Dark Lord's Killing Curse, he never could have imagined what would result. Harnessing his newfound eldritch power, the Master of Death is back to set things right - starting with one Harry Potter.
