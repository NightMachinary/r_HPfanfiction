You know. That one set of circumstances where you're like 'If this is the exact same as canon, I'm dropping this fic right now."

Personally, I don't mind if differences don't assert themselves in the first book. But for second year if Harry is outed as a parselmouth in the duelling club by Malfoy casting /serpensortia/ I'm likely to drop the fic. I mean, there are so many things that could change that outcome. Most indy- Harrys would probably see Lockhart in charge and turn around instantly. Even slightly different relationships with Snape or Malfoy could have enough of a change. /Serpensortia/ doesn't seem to be a very common spell. Lockhart could have launched it somewhere else or deboned it. A more active Harry could have already disposed of the snake. A smarter Harry probably would have researched Voldemort and known that talking to snakes is a big fucking deal and kept it a secret.

It's very hard to change much of the characterization of several characters and keep this event as is. What really gets me is that it contributes very little. Plotwise is just adds angst for Harry having everyone against him, but he doesn't need this bit to figure out the mystery of the chamber. He can easily tell Hermione about his talent, or just figure it out himself.

Anyway, that's my litmus test for if a fic is too chained to canon, what's yours?


** The one thing I absolutely hate is when authors diverge canon by having Harry be raised by someone other than the Dursleys yet still somehow have Harry act exactly the same way he does in canon. By act I don't mean his personality but rather the actions he takes are the same actions he takes in canon even though he is a different person.

To authors: If you change any aspect of Harry's personality the story is going to diverge from canon a lot faster. For example: If you make Harry even 10% more hard working then the story would change dramatically.

Exactly why I don't like canon re-hash fictions that change Harry but stick to canon like glue, because like ripples in a pond stuff would change quickly!

** Once I get the feeling that the author is basically just taking the canon events and rephrasing them I am out. I'll throw in a rude gesture as I leave if you do this while adding an obvious self-insert OC as a lame attempt to make things original.

It's like, I've read the books multiple times. I don't need for you to describe Harry's first Quidditch game to me.

*** Canon is pretty vague on the process, right? All we know is that it's a specialized branch of transfiguration, and a list of people who have managed it?

Why would Harry being a falcon/ talking about falcons be upsetting? Especially in a canon rehash type of way?

Honestly curious, it seems like I'm not understanding a lot of the subtext you've got going on here.

The implication, I guess, that just because a person is skilled in one area, their animagus form must match.

Like James was good at...and was a stag as a result. I guess Sirius was good at licking his own balls so he's a dog. Harry's good at flying so he's a bird, natch.

***** I don't have any problem with Harry being a bird. The issue is that becoming an animagus never has any point in a fic and is just a boring waste of time.

In a fic I'm writing Harry learns how, but he doesn't turn into something 'cool' or useful. Being an animal won't matter, but the process of learning how is very important for character development.

****** If it is used as a tool for character and relationship development, I don't mind so much. Although ultimately the forms (or at least Harry's) do participate in the plot in Vox Corporis, most of the fic is character and relationship fluff.

The only problem with it being used for character and relationship development is that in most cases it would be interchangeable with any other "deep" magical study. It is hard to find a balance between it being throwaway and it being a cheap plot device. I think I find it acceptable in Vox Corporis because it is just enough of both to be acceptable.

I believe it was also in that fic that it is mentioned Dumbledore is an animagus but never uses it because either his form is useless or he just dislikes it? I do like that it takes away from the mystique a bit, turning it into something that is not more common because it is both time-consuming and not always useful.

*** My peeve is when absolutely /everyone/ turns out to be an animagus. The books say it's a super-rare skill and it's implied that it was somewhat unheard of for James, Sirius, and Peter to have all learned, much less at their ages.

Then in some stories, half the school is a secret unregistered animagus.

**** While i do agree with you that it's sometimes overdone we can't really say how rare Animagi are.

The list of /registered/ ones is probably fairly short but that's only logical because the skill is mostly useless unless it's a secret. For all we know it's a common skill and no one talks about it; and let's be honest if 3 school kids could manage it, it can't be all that difficult to do.

It's probably very time consuming and my guess is that most forms are simply useless and therefore no one bothers actually learning it. Stags and Grims aren't particularly inconspicuous and i doubt James and SIrius would have bothered if it weren't for helping Remus.

Three school kids + Remus who also managed to create one of the most powerful magical artefacts we see in the series: The Map (it even sees through polyjuice and animagi). We never see anyone in Harrys group create anything that comes close in power. So either the Marauders were incredible Savants or it's just a huge plothole.

I disagree. Hermione's beaded bag? DA coin? Extendable ears? Instant Darkness Powder?

Sure, Harry didn't create any artefacts but he did accomplish much more - killing a basilisk? Surviving Triwizard Tournament? Facing Voldemort and vanquishing him?

The fact that it's "Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder" indicates that they imported it, either in actuality or the idea of it.

And aside from performing the spellwork, there isn't any indication that Hermione did anything groundbreaking with her bag. It's the same principle as Harry's Mokeskin pouch but without the security feature.

The same can be said about the Marauder's Map. Sure it was a high-level charmwork but so were the DA coins. Though, I admit it was creative.

  The four created the map via the usage of the Homonculous Charm, a powerful and advanced charm that enchanted the map to track the movements of everyone in the castle, as well as a charm to insult Severus Snape.

****** I'd argue that Hermione's DA Coins are pretty amazing, not to mention the kind of things Fred and George invented.

You're right though, it is a pretty big plot hole. JKR never really was the best at worldbuilding and consistency.

The problem is that the first few books were basically written for children and then became more mature over time, which only makes sense, but it also resulted in a series that is not very well thought out.

It's more about the story and the main characters than the world around them, which is completely fine but it also results in us having to rely on a lot of fanon simply because canon information often doesn't really make sense.

** Yeah, I typically avoid stories that start earlier than 4th year, and a big part of the reason for that is that these stories tend to want to span across all 7 years but they then spend a lot of time in 1st year not doing much different. Its a real drag to read through all the events I'm already quite familiar with.

But worse than a fic rehash is a recap. I absolutely hate when a story grinds to a halt so that Harry can tell his new girlfriend about everything that happened in canon prior to this minor divergence.

Either one will turn me off almost immediately, and then I might skip ahead a bit to see if things diverge enough if the story had an interesting enough premise, but usually I just quite the story right then and there.

** Basically ANY significant amount of time spent on canon events without any changes is a turn off for me. I'm here for interesting changes to canon, not the canon story with Naruto along for the ride while inexplicably influencing absolutely nothing. I don't have a litmus test, really. It depends on how major the premise change is and how much the author pays attention to the subtleties that might arise from such a change. For example,let's say Harry is raised by loving guardians, I'd usually be fine with him still acquiring Hedwig, but if the Hagrid interaction is similar to canon I'm likely to stop reading before we make it through Diagon Alley.

*** Eeeeh, depends. My daughter's teachers always commented on how she spoke like an adult, mostly because I always talked to her more or less like an adult. I never did the "kiddie talk" when speaking with her. So at 11 she did sound fairly mature in conversation. If I used a phrase or word she didn't understand I'd explain to her, and then she'd start using them.

*** Making 'kids sound like kids' has to be the worst move for a story. It's almost as annoying as the sounding out of words for people like Fleur and Krum, because they have an accent. Can you not just create a normal piece of dialogue, while adding "she said in a heavy french accent" at the end? You just make it harder to convey the point being made. But with making kids sound like kids, the author has to purposefully dumb the main character down, and everyone else, it makes it uninteresting to read. A person like Harry who had to live for himself would most definitely be able to hold adult conversations, or maybe just avoid the conversation altogether, growing up Anti-Social with no friends might make him wary to start a conversation.
