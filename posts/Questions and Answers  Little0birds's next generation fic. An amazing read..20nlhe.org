** I remember now why I didn't read it. First because it wasn't finished and doesn't look like it updates very often, and second because I find it impossible to believe that they don't know about their parents' and thus their fame before going to Hogwarts. And that James hasn't mentioned something before now about how, oh I don't know, their parents are the saviors of the Wizarding world and everyone wants to be friends with him.

Unless they don't interact with anyone else, they'd have to be incredibly unperceptive not to notice. The normal childhood until eleven thing is stupid anyways. It's not like it's going to stop them from basking in the influence and adoration. Most movie stars who go screwy become stars in their late childhood/early teens, around 11. I doubt they'd be glad they had those eleven years not knowing anything about their parents past.

*** It's generally canon pairings, though George, Charlie, and Percy are married to different people and their kids have slightly different names. It feels very canon though. As for the next gen, other than Teddy/Victoire, they're mostly in their early to mid teens, so nothing serious yet. Probably Lily/Scorpius later though.
