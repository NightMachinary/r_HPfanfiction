Having read several wonderful fics by American authors, there is one small fact of which I would like to make my cousins across the pond aware.

LEMON. DOES. NOT. BELONG. IN. TEA!!!!!

Tea in Britain is almost exclusively taken with milk and no sugar. Sometimes one sugar. I can count on one hand the number of people I know that have two or more sugars in their tea with enough fingers left over to swear at them.

If I see one more American tell me that Lucius Malfoy, epitome of British aristocracy, has LEMON in his BLACK TEA (which is a sin in itself) I will THROW HANDS.

(i.e. sniff angrily because I'm British and that's what we do.)

The correct order to make tea is as follows:

1. Boil the kettle.
2. Put the teabag in a cup.
3. Pour the boiling water in the cup.
4. Leave it. DO NOT hassle the teabag, give it space!!
5. After 1-3 minutes, take out the teabag.
6. Add the milk.
7. If dealing with a man-child, add ONE sugar.
8. Stir and serve.

This has been a PSA to all my American friends, thank you for listening.

P.S. We say "term" rather than "semester" and there's no such thing as extra credit. It's the little things that make your fic authentic!

Edit: I should probably clarify that this is in reference to English Breakfast tea. If you don't clarify what kind of tea the person is serving, English Breakfast is the default. If they're serving Early Grey or a Darjeeling, ignore the advice above entirely - actually, do more than ignore it, consciously break every single rule outlined. Early Grey should be taken black with lemon and if someone has milk in it I'll fight them. But for the sake of my poor British mind, TELL ME IF IT'S EARL GREY!!


** You and I may not like it but plenty of people make tea with /far/ too much sugar in, and it can be perfectly accurate to people's characters to include it - I can see Umbridge having multiple sugars (in the form of sugarlumps, from a little China bowl with kittens on) and so much milk the tea is practically white, for example.

And lemon is a very important part of drinking /some/ tea properly. Just not all. Milk would ruin Earl grey, but lemon is an essential part! And I can definitely see Lucius drinking Earl grey.

*** I think Umbridge having so much sugar in her tea was the exact moment you could pin her as a psychopath. If I were writing about Umbridge I'd have her add the milk first, no question. She's a monster.

Hard agree on the Early Grey front, but most fanfic writers don't specify the kind of tea being drunk. If a tea isn't specified I would assume it were English Breakfast, and lemon in English Breakfast is a sin. If a writer starts knows the difference in etiquette between types of tea I would 100% assume they were British.

(As an aside, black Early Grey with honey and lemon is the best home remedy for a cold/bad day. Something about the bergamot chases all the nasties away.)

But i have been living here for 5 years.

The tea culture is pretty large, with the chai being a major thing over here, always being with milk and having several spices in it.

And even the green tea itself being popular. But my issue is, i live in the capital in a metropolitan area, so all i see is black tea which i myself do not prefer.

But for those who know where to look or are interested is tea, it can be found, i myself only developed a thirst for green tea these past few months,so i am inexperienced.

But i have seen that green tea sold around me is of average quality, but i did once have the luck to try several of Assam produce and i can say without doubt it is some of the best i have drank in my life.

Usually tea you would get in an Indian restaurant is black tea with milk which is made in a large pot with spices and sugar mixed into it.

But it is a popular past time of everyone to go to the road side tea stall to share chai, so it is deep ingrained into the culture.

Many times you can spot many company employees surrounding a small stall which is just a man with a gas cylinder who would make the chai and give it for you to drink on the street and it would be a place to enjoy the lunch break even if some would consider it (excuse my word) plebian.

I don't know if this makes sense, but i am rather uneducated in the tea culture, as i have just begun my journey as a consumer ( i have actually spent 18 years not drinking any tea)

While Lucius likely drinks expensive teas, and likely out of fine china, it's unlikely he follows the manners that many of us brits learn as being “upper class” as typically “upper class” manners mean “upper middle class”. As that's where the obsession with manners mostly comes from, the middle classes attempting to fit into upper class society. Things like extended pinkies (a middle class manner born from snuff (also a middle class habit)) and refusing teabags.

** So, I see that you are making a making a major mistake here in your complaints. You are acting as if you expect the Pureblood Aristocracy to be following muggle tea traditions. Based on some quick googling, tea didn't really start to become popular in the UK until the 1660s at the earliest, and it didn't start getting imported in commercial quantities until 1678. Additionally "afternoon tea" as a concept didn't really become popular until the 1880s. However, the Statue of Secrecy was enacted in 1692. That means that there was only a very small overlap in the Wizarding World's tea tradition and the Muggle world's traditions.

There is substantial evidence that the wizarding world has bizarre tastes (see: pumpkin juice at every meal). I don't particularly see any reason why they wouldn't have equally strange and divergent views on how tea should be taken. For all we know, they could be using pumpkin juice as a sweetener for their tea sort of like a twisted version of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_(drink][Arnold Palmer]]. While the muggleborn most likely still adhere to british traditions, the purebloods have probably developed their own complex traditions centered around tea (possibly including pumpkins). They would most likely make an attempt to not even come close to emulating what muggles would be doing, and if they find out how muggles drink their tea, they would likely deliberately try to differentiate it.

Making assumptions about tea culture in the wizarding world would require you to go back to how tea was drunk in the late 1600s to figure out their starting point, and then account for divergences caused by general wizarding oddities. Who knows what someone as eccentric as Dumbledore would put in his tea? Basically, you are trying to apply muggle standards to purebloods though, which is bound to fail.

TL;DR: Lucius Malfoy sweetens his tea with pumpkin juice, Dumbledore sweetens it with lemon sherbets.

So i googled the phenomenon.

Turns out it's not that microwave is incapable of heating water as hot as a kettle does. It's just that most of us don't wait for microwave to do that kind of heating. Google it yourself.

In the meanwhile I am sincerely sorry for the 'pain' caused to you by your opinion of incorrect physics being applied to a funny conversation... Truly and deeply regretful for the 'pain' I have caused.

But tea in India? That is a whole different thing. Our teas have anywhere between 5-15 ingredients.

1.  Put water to boil
2.  add ginger.
3.  add lemon grass (a milder version. this is mostly in Mumbai and surrounding areas)
4.  add mint sprigs.
5.  add cardamom
6.  rich people will also add saffron (not rich, but just fancy people)
7.  Add Tea
8.  add sugar.
9.  add milk
10. boil for another 3-4 mins.
11. Like the OP said. Don't add lemon!

pour and drink that tea. this is the tea 1.3 billion Indians are hooked on.

****** Firstly, population matters more than land area, and historically European population (including Britain's) was quite high. As a result the population differential was not as great as you would think from looking at the countries today.

In 1900, the UK population was 39 million compared to the entire population of Africa of 140 million, or a UK:Africa population ratio of 1:3.6.

If that ratio was the same today, the population of Africa would be 239 million. But in fact it is 1.3 billion.

Secondly, even more important than population is money. And Britain had the industrial revolution on its side when it came to that.

That being said... it's great for black tea. But for good quality green teas or oolongs? Got to drink those straight.

**** The problem with using 'lemon grass' (as most people use in normal cooking) is that it is too strong, it can curdle the milk, in the chai. The lemon grass we get in Mumbai, is a mild one, i think. And it is used only for tea. It is sold by the name that translates to green tea.

Lemon grass for thai curry is bought from another vendor in the market and is more expensive. (if you want to try lemon grass, add it to the water, and make sure it is on a rolling boil when you add the milk, that will protect the milk and may stop it from curdling)

Masala chai with cloves is not my favorite. Cloves are a spice i use for savory items, not sweet ones, so my brain cannot accept it in tea. My frnd swears by clove infused tea as a recipe against cold induced headaches.

Kashmiri Kawha is awesome in the cold weather. especially if drunk from a clay cup. But Kawha tea is generally different from normal tea leaves. I think there are specific Kashmiri tea leaves for Kawha( I could be wrong, Google isnt being particularly helpful).

One of the things that's really nice about masala chai is just experimenting to see what works best with everyone's personal tastes - I've seen/tried variations with star anise and peppercorn that added a slightly different twist to it, and I'm sure everyone swears by a different recipe!

For Kawha, I think the main difference is that it uses green tea, right? Though I'm not sure what variation of green tea I have access to that would be closest to the Kashmiri green tea that's traditional.

** In Indian tea, we simplify a lot. Pour some milk(only milk and heaven help you if you add water to it), add powdered tea leaves, a healthy amount of sugar(definitions of healthy vary), add ginger, clove and basically every other spice on planet Earth, boil, filter the milk to remove the tea leaves, and voila, Indian Masala Chai. I think it's probably illegal to add water to Indian tea, but some roadside stalls do it, to save milk costs, but my point still stands:

But you'll have to experiment a little. Try it on a low flame and add small amount of smashed ginger to the tea. Take a whiff and see if it smells alright. If not, add a little more.

Lemon would normally be offered with Earl Grey tea. And regarding the amount of sugar folk take...many, many people take 2 or more.

***** I wonder how such a breakfast might differ between muggles and purebloods. There are three main pressures that exert influence on the diet of the average pureblood.

1, People like the Malfoys and the Blacks would be inclined to turn their noses up at common muggle fare, so the market for wizard-only food is there.

2, Wizarding food producers would have to mince around a minefield of muggle government rules and regulations, which might make the production of certain foods unusually difficult. All foods, all production facilities, all farms, etc., are subject to stringent rules and regular inspections. Let's say you want to exploit your prodigious magical ability to breed a more efficient milk cow, or to grow crops out of season, or to grow berries the size of melons. You will have to explain yourself to government inspectors, or else you have to give up on exploiting your prodigious magical ability, or you could hide your production. Let's say you choose to hide your berry farm on Ben Nevis, for example. You might have escaped the awkward questions and risk of Azkaban, but now you're blowing all your profits on making this harsh mountain produce melon-sized berries. I imagine a number of foods have price disparities with their muggle counterparts that look really odd to a casually observing muggle.

3, There's a number of foods and recipes that are out of reach of the average muggle due to expensive ingredients, the requirement of advanced technical cooking skills, rarity of the ingredients, or (especially historically) difficulty in conveying the ingredients halfway across the globe. Wizards posses an array of abilities that could go a long way in solving a lot of those problems, which could result in some foods that muggles consider luxurious being more commonly available in the wizarding world. Once again, odd price disparities may ensue.

**** The weekend thing would be whats called a Full English (often referred to as a fry up), it has a number of variable options, but broadly its bacon, sausage, fried mushroom, eggs (done how you want them), fried or grilled tomato, either toast or fried bread, baked beans (which are haricot beans in a sweet tomato sauce), and sometimes black pudding or something called bubble and squeak (which is fried potato and cabbage, its a way of using up the left over veg from the previous night).

During the week the more normal substantial breakfast she might make would be a bacon roll, or maybe a bacon and egg roll. Just a bread roll, heavily buttered, with bacon, fried egg, maybe a sausage or two.

Being an American, I can assure you that Americans have no idea how to make tea. In fact, tea to us is the cold sweet tea on most days and it's completely disgusting. I love tea, but not Southern Sweet Tea.

Like I said, love tea, but I never put lemon in it, but I have also never put milk in it either. I see it's a common occurrence. How much milk exactly would you put in the tea? Enough to make the color turn? I do want to try it. I have English Breakfast tea and I just drink it hot with sugar.

I am American, which is pretty obvious when I write on reddit. However, I do my best to properly British-ise my Harry Potter fanfiction so that it could reasonably take place in Great Britain. That said, mistakes will be made. I manage to avoid the most obvious ones (mom/mum, double quotes/single quotes, -ize/-ise, -or/-our, -er/-re, differences in cursing, arse/ass, etc etc). But I do get tripped up every once in a while, even after I send my WiP chapters to a British friend who proofreads them specifically for Americanisms that need to be changed.

Sometimes the issue isn't that the American author didn't do their due diligence when researching British culture and language. There are always some differences between the two cultures that are very minor and only rarely come up. Things that you would never think to research. You can't expect an author to research every bit of every paragraph they write.

That's why I'm not appreciating OP's attitude. There's a way to communicate that information in an instructive and humorous way without denigrating the people that work very hard on their fanfics. Even looking through the comments, apparently there are things that OP is wrong about, which makes their tone even more annoying.

Of course people take their tea differently, I acknowledge that in my comments, but my intention was to start a humorous thread - and in that I was successful, as many people have correctly realised I wasn't serious.

One thing I really love about Americans is how polite and friendly you all seem to be (or the ones I've met anyway) so I could see how the British sense of humour, which is much more deadpan, may come off as rude.

I have an electric kettle and no microwave, and think microwaved tea is an abomination - but on the other hand, milk in my tea is sacrilege, although I mostly drink Earl Grey or Jasmine green or something really dark and smoky like Lapsang Souchong, so milk wouldn't blend well anyway. It's not an American thing with me; I just detest milk.

So on my side, the humor (or humour) is much appreciated. I also try when writing for HP to use British spellings simply because it puts /me/ in the mood. It's a mental trick to signal my brain to shift to a slightly different vocabulary track, even though I still trip up plenty. A year or so ago I was absolutely baffled to learn that 'blocks' aren't a British unit of measure for street lengths and directions. I've been writing in this fandom for more than ten years, yet I still managed to miss this.

Also, much as I love British slang, I'm timid about using it because I'm not sufficiently familiar with regional dialects or class distinctions. Writing Snape as a Midlands lad from a mill town, for example, is daunting. Not to mention that slang from the 1970s wouldn't be the same as slang now.

Anyway, now that I've wandered far afield, I'm off to extract a bottle of iced tea from the mini-fridge because wearing these masks inside is really bloody hot work.

I once tried watching Wedding Belles because I adore Michelle Gomez, and even turning on closed caption didn't always help me make sense of it.

***** I should have clarified English schools (that was actually what I meant to type because I know Scotland and Northern Ireland have different exams, and Wales marks them differently.)

I mentioned BTECs and vocational qualifications in another comment that the original commenter appears to have deleted, but I saw no evidence of those in the HP universe.

I sat a mixture of old and new GCSEs and completely reformed A-levels. My coursework had no extra credit available (which really bugged me because my geography coursework was my lowest mark even if I did well overall.) And the new exams have no coursework in them at all if the experience of myself and my younger sister is to be believed.

I agree with your point but yeah there's no coursework in HP as far as I'm aware and never any extra credit.

No worries - I always find it amusing because in theory Hogwarts should be more closely aligned to Scottish exams than English ones.

I sat what we saw as 'old' and 'new' GCSEs at the time - I did a combination of coursework and controlled coursework and the AS and A Level. Re-takes for A level were more of a thing.

***** I find it a lot less jarring than tea sacrilege, hence why it's a footnote, but Rowling doesn't refer to it as extra credit, and in fan fiction it's often done in tandem with several decisively non-British terms like "finals", "diploma" and "graduation" (which only refer to University, not high school, and are never used by Rowling in the books in any capacity). Extra credit as a concept is decisively American and imo skews the generally British feel of Harry Potter. I often find myself getting really involved in a fic and getting into the story, and finding words like that that just don't fit really drags me out of it.

Of course I can't tell anyone how to write a fic. If you want to make Harry and backwards-baseball-cap-wearing, Harley-riding quarterback who calls people "cupcake" and carries an AK-47 on the back of his varsity jacket, I wouldn't want to stop you. But if people want to imitate the British feel of the original series, then I would like to help them by pointing out pitfalls that may stop them from accomplishing that objective.

***** Ok, so the tl;dr version of this: It is compatible with the English school system to

a) score beyond the ability of your year group on the tests given, but not to do extra assignments that lead to a higher grade.

and

b) You don't need full marks to get 100%

Bonus c) England scores for depth of learning but doesn't give extra assignments.

​

See, the whole GCSE/A Level thing in the English curriculum is moot before GCSEs start. These days, you are rated compared to expectations for your year. Much to the consternation of many educators you can literally go from year to year scoring the equivalent term for below average.

Before the recent reforms to the curriculum in England, you would be scored based off Curriculum Levels. Particularly in Sats exams and you can't score any higher than the level on the test. So, suppose you get 100% on the exam - you can only score a Level 5. Another school might allow some pupils to take a test that goes up to Level 6.In this case, I suspect Hermione was showing skills well beyond what you would expect the higher ability children in her year to get. So the points were not for extra work, but for greater depth.

Under the reformed system in England, children can genuinely be scored at 'working at greater depth' but that cannot be scored in comparison to the year above.

Incidentally, the GCSEs also have foundation level exams (or whatever they are called these days) where the maximum you can be graded is a C. So schools have to be very careful with borderline cases for foundation and higher exams.

With regard to GCSE/A LEVEL scoring - In England, grade boundaries are based not on how well pupils do, but how well the cohort as a whole does So, a certain percentage of pupils can get an A* (9, since they went numerical) in any given year group. As a result, 100ums percentage score points (the maximum they put down) does not mean you got 100% of the points available. So, in theory Hermione could well have scored 14% better than 100%. There's no benefit to it, but in theory Flitwick could have had the raw score and told her.

** Hm, but there seems to be some form of extra credit in canon:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

  “She'll be fine --- remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron.
#+end_quote

And Harry also gets some extra credit:

#+begin_quote
  “Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...”

  He leaned forward a little. “I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?”

  Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her being sacked.

  “Expecto Patronum!”

  The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

** Correct Way To Make Tea:

1. Squeeze Lemon into Cup
2. Add Water
3. Add Sugar, at least as much as lemon
4. Add ice to brim
5. Add lemon Slice
6. Open Teabag
7. Use Teabag as decoration for proper cup of tea
8. Enjoy your superior cup of tea.

** Alright I just have this to say about this post. Everyone in the UK takes their tea differently. I'm an American but I lived in the Uk for a while When my dad was stationed there. I have cousins who are British, and Quite a few of them put sugar in there tea and my uncle Who is British and my dad's half brother puts lemon and honey in his tea. So there are plenty of British people that take their tea a bit differently then how you are describing. And my cousins always use looseleaf tea so I don't think your instructions are applicable to all variations of tea Preparation in the United Kingdom.

Just a sidenote I am American and I do not like tea so the above post is completely based off of what I remember my cousins drinking.

*** I feel like I should clarify, this post is written in an intentionally pretentious style, it's not my actual view on tea. Of course people make their tea differently and that's all a-okay, but as I've explained in a few comments, I wrote it because I felt a lot of American fanfic writers had put a lot of time and effort into giving their stories the British vibe that HP has in canon, and I think it's a shame when small points such as tea mute that effect.

I'm not a tea connoisseuse, I'm just a British girl who loves tea and wanted to lend a hand to American fanfic writers.

(Also your cousins are totally right to use loose leaf tea. It's objectively superior to teabags. Just a pain in backside.)

The last 10 years have been amazing in terms of dairy free solutions in hot drinks, not only is there more variety, but the quality of them has also increased. There was nothing worse than putting cold soya into a hot drink and having it separate on you and make your cup undrinkable.

I prefer hot tea, but only if it's not stupid hot that day, given I have to work outside half the time, though if I'm drinking cold tea I prefer that it be sweetened. Not really sweet, just slightly more so than not sweet at all.

I also don't like normal coffee, but I will drink a latte from time to time. I probably only drink five cups of normal coffee a year, and maybe two or three dozen lattes. I prefer tea.

*** Loose leaf tea. Basically the stuff that's in teabags, without the bag. It also tends to be higher quality than the stuff in teabags, but loose leaf tea is incredibly fiddly sometimes. You can either use a tea strainer (especially if you're making a pot of tea and pouring it into a cup) or just leave them in the bottom of your cup - which is how reading someone's tea leaves would work.

** As an Aussie, yeah this is a little confusing. We drink tea with milk and sugar to be added to the brewed tea as you desire. Twinnings English breakfast is the standard in my household, I drink with milk and sugar my mum drinks it black (lactose-intolerant) but dad just drinks coffee, real espresso from a machine mind you.

I don't think were as fussy about it as the English but yeah, lemons not really a thing. Can't say anything about Earl Grey, mum hates it so it never crosses the door step.

For a sore throat I drink green tea with lemon and honey.

To brew and Aussie tea,

Boil water

Poor over the tea (bag or loose, up to you)

steep for as long as you desire, remove tea

add sugar if desired

add milk if desired

drink, even on 30+ days

and yeah, we have ice tea, but you buy it from the store and drink it like a soft drink/soda.

Past morning: “uncle Vernon, how do you like your tea again?”

“Just throw 3 lemons in there it'll be fine.”

In plain sight Harry did what they call a pro gamer move and enacted his plan, he threw 3 unsqueezed lemons into the cup.

Harry also added 4 spoonfuls of sugar, then added 50% hot water, 40% ice water and 10%milk

Soon after he added 2 tea bags and the proceeded to stir for 5 seconds.

How I learned (as a southern, sweet iced tea drinking, american) that I like earl grey.-

We had no sweet tea left and I had a craving. I found some earl grey tea bags. I proceeded to make a big ol' pot, poured in an obscene amount of sugar while still hot and stirred until dissolved. Chilled. Had pretty decent sweet iced tea. Good enough until I went to Publix for the good stuff.
