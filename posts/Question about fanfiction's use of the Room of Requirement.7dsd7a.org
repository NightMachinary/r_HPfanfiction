I've read many fics which use the RoR for things well beyond what it was used for in canon, but one thing I can't recall ever seeing was it used as a limitless library. Has anyone ever thought to use it to recreate every book ever written?


** I don't think it can get any book ever written just just every book that has ever been inside hogwarts.

Mabye it could go further and access any book that anyone who has ever been inside hogwarts has read.

** I just assumed it could take either anything from the Room of Hidden Things or anything inside the castle and duplicate it.

** Some of the uses of ror have been uhh blatantly 'op' but I've read about it as a limitless library and I liked it. I mostly read hermione fics so ror as a library makes sense.
