How is that possible? In so many stories harry gets muscles and everything from playing quidditch when in reality he just sits on a broom, in some fics it is said that they have to workout to stay in shape but some just say that he now is fit from PLAYING quidditch

  I would assume it is the same as race car drivers. I mean, have you seen the Formula 1 drivers? They look like olympic swimmers with the neck muscles of weightlifters. They also only sit in their car and do nothing. But if a normal person that has not done it before and has not built the required muscles over time would experience those insane forces during a race, they would come out with a handful of broken bones, assuming with their lack of muscles they could even make it through the track fast enough to generate those forces, which is doubtful.

*** I totally agree with that. And, personally, I fail to see Quidditch captains not give their players workout sessions like making them do a few laps of the field or something before taking the air.

*** Harry could play at 11 years old while being very thin in one of the fastests broom in the market, it would make more sense to assume that the broom is enchanted so the rider doesn't have to withstand the forces that would make a kid break his bones.

100G is 100km/h (or 60mph) to 0 in 0.028 seconds.

That's a bad car crash.

** Entirely depends on how you think the broom works.

Race car drivers are /fit/. They have to be, otherwise they couldn't cope with the acceleration strains (from turns, not at the start!). Professional cyclists are fit ... and not only have they got strong legs, but also strong upper bodies and arms, because they carry the bodyweight for prolonged stretches of time. The position is similar to how one would suppose wizards are sitting on a broom; as is the acceleration strain.

/Unless/, of course, you say everything is magic, and the wizard sitting on a broom can magically make turns on a dime without feeling anything, and the broom basically is steered by intention, not your hands, and essentially you have a flying armchair.

Your call. It's never specified in Canon.

*** I think it's safe to assume that the players have to train as every player except the seeker has to use their upper body heavily. you don't throw with just the arm normally, you use the rest of your body as well. So you'd probably train so that you can complete those crazy plays. And there isn't a chance in hell that Harry gets out of training with everyone. On the broom front, you summarized everything perfectly. Though I personally hold with the idea that it requires effort. Think about what would happen if you had a stray thought about going to the right on a firebolt. Eek

** I'm no expert, but I imagine you would develop some muscles by playing Quidditch. There is some effort in maneuvering and staying on the broom, especially in bad weather when there's more resistance, just like riding a horse (or so I'm told). And it would depend on the position, too. Beaters probably would develop their arms and upper bodies to some degree by hitting those bludgers, for example.

Toned might be a better way to think about it for most players. Not heavy muscles.

** Its the fact that he's going through puberty the entire time he's playing quidditch, as he grows up he develops these muscles from living an active lifestyle and because he's getting older and eating proper meals. Think of how much walking they do in that school alone, which would also build up muscles and keep you in relatively good shape. He's got the body type to be naturally fit without much effort, when you add in the quidditch and everything else its natural he would be considered fit compared to some of the other students. The majority of guys in high school usually put on muscle just the same.

** Really, it's not. I can imagine it would build the core muscles if anything, but describing Harry's chiselled "Quidditch-toned muscles" is always a bit silly.

Chalk it up to over-active imaginations wanting to picture Harry as a muscle-bound God, but not wanting to write the necessary workout regimen.

*** Not just core, neck/shoulders, arms and thighs as well. You are frequently doing high G turns and need to hold on during those. Or pull out of dives and the like. And other than that seeker, all players use their arms to get one or two balls to go places.

  This is a spoof, Harry is worried about finding someone who loves him for him and not his muscles or fame, Hermione's just trying to keep things logical, and Ron really wants to wake up. Rated M just in case, oneshot...

** Some minor muscles would be worked in the legs, forearms, and core. They would likely be not get jacked from Quidditch however. On the professional level I'd expect to see fitter players. Just like in racing, keeping yourself in shape would allow better performance. Racers watch their weight and exercise to withstand the forces of their vehicles. But at a school level? No way in hell. At best they'd have forearms like Popeye's. They would gain the bare minimum level of muscle necessary to ride a broom at that level. I can see being lean as encouraged though, as Oliver made a comment about a seeker's build when we first met him.

Racers aren't even that crazy though, as being lean is encouraged, rather than being necessary. I think a lot of people think of athletes as musclebound, when they're really not. It's not practical, they only need the muscle to play the sport. Anymore would be impractical.

That's the best I can get before pulling out the reference photos and complex plans

To respond to some other points here, toning is just the ratio of muscle to fat. More lean? More toned. Less lean? Less toned. It's a body composition term. You don't have toned muscles, you have a toned body. This drives me insane.

** I think it also depends on how much you think magic guides the broom. If it just just simple propulsion then you would use a lot of different muscles to move it in various directions and if you think about how hard it would be to keep yourself on a broom hanging upside down or banked in a turn I could see a player becoming very tones, especially core, forearms and shoulders. But if in your headcannon its all controlled by magic and intent, Including actually staying on the broom then yeah, I imagine a seeker would be really tiny and weedy thin with a heavy emphasis on weight control around games.
