** It's VERY early stages, they literally aren't even allowed to start until 2025

#+begin_quote
  The Harry Potter franchise has complicated rights issues. Rowling controls the franchise and has a say in everything involving the property. NBCUniversal in 2016 inked a rich seven-year rights deal with Warner Bros. Domestic TV Distribution that included U.S. broadcast, cable and streaming rights to the Wizarding World franchise. That deal, which ends in April 2025

To put in perspective, by the rate the Percy Jackson show is going, it'll be heading into it's third or fourth season by the time this is getting off the ground

I'd want it to be the books again honestly to see a new take from new creatives and to reinvigorate the fandom

** I think it would be cool to have a TV show set in the /world/ of Harry Potter, but not the actual Harry Potter stories. The reason for that is because there were so many iconic actors who worked on HP, and I couldn't deal with someone else playing that part.

For me, Alan Rickman /was/ Snape. Helena Bonham Carter /was/ Bellatrix Lestrange. Maggie Smith /was/ McGonagall. (I could go on.). You're not going to ever improve on Rickman, HBC, or Maggie Smith, no matter who you hire.

If they tried to do a straight-up Harry Potter adaptation, I'd constantly be making comparisons and I can almost guarantee that the TV show actors are not going to win that battle.

Now, a show set earlier than the books, perhaps in the Marauder's time, or during the time of the Founders would be cool. Likewise if they set it today and there was a new threat to face. (The benefit of this would be that you could occasionally have the original cast members drop in, because they'd be the appropriate age, in a nice bit of fan service. Except for those actors who are unfortunately no longer with us. RIP Alan Rickman.)

Either that, or you could set it in Harry Potter's time, but somewhere like Durmstrang, or even someplace like Australia, which I'm sure has a magical school. But since it's never mentioned, the writers would have plenty of scope to be original and not step on canon.

There are a lot of ways they could do this right. Hopefully they choose one of those instead of sticking with the books.

** After J.K. Rowling's comments, I stopped engaging in the fandom in any way that brings her money. Basically, reading fanfic is the only Harry Potter interaction I get. I'd be hesitant to watch a show that she was involved in because of her activism.

Edit: by activism, I mean transphobia. I was kind of pussyfooting around, but it's the transphobia. [[http://www.galop.org.uk/transphobic-hate-crime-report-2020/][Considering that one in five trans people in the U.K. have been threatened with or experienced sexual assault in the last year,]] I think it's safe to say that trans people need to be protected more, not advocated against.

Do whatever you want with your money. It just doesn't feel right to me personally to support a brand that is still so closely creatively controlled by someone who is unapologetically bigoted.

**** I edited my original post to clarify, but "her activism" was referring to the transphobia. She is an artist whose works shape young impressionable minds and I don't want to give her further power and voice.

It's great that she has donated ao much of her personal wealth. Considering where she was when she started writing Harry Potter, she has come a long way and she's paying back into the system and society that saved her from an abusive situation. We all contain multitudes. However. This is where I draw the line in the sand. That might be different for you and that's fine. I'm not interested in taking things away from people.

*** I get what you're saying. I guess I just don't feel the same way.

I guess I'm just able to separate the product and the creator?

I patronize Chik-Fil-A (sp) because I am a fan of delicious chicken, and that is the product I am using my money to purchase. Am I a fan of all of the company's policies and activism? No, but I'm not making a charitable donation to their causes. I'm signaling support of their delicious chicken, not signaling support of their activism.

If I started treating all my purchases not as transactions for products, but a referendum on the companies/individuals that created those products, I think I'd drive myself crazy.

That's why it's easy for me to ignore JK. JK can believe whatever she wants because I don't give a damn about JK. Just her books. The second I don't like her books, I won't.

Maybe that makes me selfish. I'd prefer to say that my life is difficult enough without being forced to give up something I like just because I don't like the person that created it.

**** I understand where you're coming from. My parents boycotted Disney for political reasons all through the 90s and all it really did was alienate me from other kids my age. However, I don't feel comfortable spending my money on a product that is so closely tied with a creator. JKR's vision is inextricably intertwined with the world of Harry Potter. She still has a lot of creative control.

I want to be clear. I am in no way saying anyone is a "bad" person if they engage with Harry Potter commercially. Maybe I'd even feel differently if I had actually enjoyed Fantastic Beasts or anything that's come out in the past decade or so. But when I think about buying something, I think of my trans cousin's face. I wonder how they would feel.

Again, this is a personal choice for me. I'm not campaigning on the streets and I certainly wouldn't force anyone to give up something they love. I probably would have scrolled by if the OP hadn't asked for opinions. But not buying HP stuff feels right so I'll keep on until it doesn't feel right
