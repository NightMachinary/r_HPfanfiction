I'm writing a longfic that starts in fifth year and follows canon until mid year six. I'm not rehashing all the events, just mentioning them for context and timeline. For now the story is mostly interactions between two characters as they evolve from enemies to friends, and MC's musings on what's going on around them.

I'm ten chapters in and just getting to where Umbridge becomes headmistress and I'm starting to worry that it may bore readers. I don't want them to feel like they're re-reading OotP from a different POV. Thoughts?


** If your characters are just discussing what's going on, not actually witnessing it, that's fine. The problem, well, mine at least, with rehashing canon is when it's literally the same events copied almost verbatim from JKR, but usually worse.

If you MC isn't interacting with Harry much, is doing their own thing and hearing about the Trio's escapades through the grapevine then it shouldn't be boring.

** I suppose it depends on how much new material you are introducing. If your MC gets up to their own shenanigans, while the canon story remains unaffected, then I think it's fine. As a general rule when doing canon compliant stories, try to introduce subplots which are interesting yet ultimately unimportant to the canon storyline.

** I had to re-tell pretty much a whole scene in DH with an extra character in it (who needed to be there to witness it) I kept it as light touch as possible and mostly focused on how the extra character felt. It felt super awkward to do but best advice is to allude and have as little direct material from the actual books as possible.
