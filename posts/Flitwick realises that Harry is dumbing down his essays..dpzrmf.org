:END:
There's this fanfic where Flitwick finds an original draft of Harry's essays and realises that he's dumbing down his essays. Anyone remembered which fic this is?


** That's a minor trope, but the one that I always think of when it's brought up is linkffn(poison pen by genkaifan)

**** Ah, sorrow. It's a pretty decent series, though, I hope it can at least hold your interest while you're looking.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
