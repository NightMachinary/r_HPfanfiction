Title basically, thanks for the help!


** Sounds like /Realizations/ by Wishweaver, except in that fic I think the Dursleys moved away and left Harry behind. Discontinued on ffn, but again updating on ao3. linkao3(25925863).

  AU Summer before Fifth Year story. If you recognize it, I don't own it. Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What does he do since he's not supposed to contact his friends until he gets the all clear?
