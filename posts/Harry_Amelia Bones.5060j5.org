I recently read Harry Potter: Whiskey Accident ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303518/1/Harry-Potter-Whiskey-Accident]]) and I enjoyed it. So I was wondering if there were any other Harry/Amelia Fanfics out there


** There's actually a relatively new one that I just started reading. linkffn(Retrograde by Knife Hand)

*** Amelia is good in this but I'm pretty sure its going to be Harry/Bellatrix if it ever goes that far.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
