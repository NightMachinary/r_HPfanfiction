Someone recommended Kairos Amid the Ruins by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lomonaaeren/pseuds/Lomonaaeren][Lomonaaeren]] to me the other day for my Time Travel post and I'm liking it but reading it has be wondering about other fics where Harry has a */secret Identity./* In this one he travels to a AU and into the past and has to take up a new name and new life.

I want more fics with him pretending to be someone else. I know a good number of time travel ones do it. But are there any where he creates a new identity to sit on the Wizengamot or Hogwarts board of Governors? Idk. I like stories where he is smart and steps up to change and make things better. I'm a sucker for those Lord Peverell, Slytherin, Gryffindor, Potter, Black, as long as they aren't over the top with him having 10 names, unlimited funds, and suddenly super smart. Slash is preferable, but Het and Gen are good as long as its not Harry/Ginny. Don't mind character bashing, evil Dumbledore, good (sane) Voldemort or Dark stories.

Note: I want Secret Identity, not those were he or someone else changes his name to something random and ridiculous. I still want him to be Harry (to himself, or trusted others) just pretending or acting like someone else so they don't know its him.


** Lomonaaeren also has linkao3(Changing of the Guards by lomonaaeren), one of my favorites! No Wizengamot politics, but he does accidentally start a revolution while fighting homophobia in the wizarding world. And secret identity is a key part of this story.

  Need a perfect stranger? Ask Metamorphosis. Harry Potter runs the business secretly and becomes whoever's needed for each occasion. He's not sure whether he should be more surprised, worried, or amused when Draco Malfoy comes to Metamorphosis and requests an actor who can play his boyfriend so that his parents will disown him. Yet Harry has even more dangerous choices after he creates Brian, Draco's “perfect” boyfriend. Draco doesn't know who Brian is, but he's trying to find out---and now so is Harry.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

Harry is a mastermind and starts an "empire" because there is no-one to stob him. He does all of that just because of money, not because of political power. He has a secret identity but I think nobody knows it

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
