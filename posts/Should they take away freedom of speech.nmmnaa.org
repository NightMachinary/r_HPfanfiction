*** It gets a lot worse than that. There's something on AO3 that's [Hermione (age 6) / her father] that frames that pairing as a good thing. I'm not going to link it for obvious reasons. But I still support that monstrosity being legally protected speech, because I distrust the government more than I distrust individual authors of horrible fanfic.

*** Actually, Free Speech is about being free to express your own opinion and not suffer from it, within reason.

For example, Freedom of Speech allows me to tell you that you are an absolute moron, a dumbass of the highest quality. What it does not allow me to do is to say that because you're [insert something], your life matters less.

**** No, free speech totally allows you to say my life matters less or not at all, so long as you aren't inciting specific violence. Because the alternative is giving the government blanket permission to decide what speech is too harmful/disgusting to allow, and if you do that then political dissent will be the most banned kind of speech within an hour.
