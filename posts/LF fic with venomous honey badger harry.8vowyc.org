What i think happens in this fic is that harry gets captured by voldemort but turns into a honey badger and escapes, he kills a number of death eaters (bellatrix is the only one i can remember by name) and Nagini in his honey badger animagus form and i think kills voldemort too, at the end. Thanks in advance. Oh, and his venom is basilisk venom, i think


** Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter). Is this it? Harry gets captured by Voldemort. He does escape using his animagus form (It was some kind of rodent). He kills a number of death eaters and does manage to kill Voldemort in the end.

** I know the one, but I cannot remember the name. I remember it was important because honey badgers are immune to snake venom I think, and that saved him.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

  Voldemort has won, and having won, he wants to put on a show of ending Harry. He's heard rumors of Harry's new abilities and wants to show the world that even with the new skill, Harry Potter is no match for Voldemort.

  Harry is not content to hear how he is "perfectly safe" and turns to the only adult he feels he can trust. Sirius helps him gain his animagus form, its down hill for the bad guys after that. Then one shock after another leads to a new life for Harry and his three 'Uncles". No pairings yet. For missgsmith51 who picked the animagus form.
