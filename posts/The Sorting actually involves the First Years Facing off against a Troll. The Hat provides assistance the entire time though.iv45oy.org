*** Or an starting point for a more epic/badass wizarding world. Just think, if 11 YO are supposed to be able to at the very least survive a troll before having any formal training then just how common are things like it? Fudge and Umbridge wouldn't have made it to graduation with their usual cannon level of skill.

**** Yes JOKERR the magical world could be like actually portrayed as super dangerous and stuff! :) So Hogwarts is where mages go through super HARDCORE training!!! just to be able to survive on the outside! And it turns out all muggle areas even still exist because ancient mages put a crapload of super powerful protective barriers around them and stuff to make magical creatures tend to not notice them! :)

***** Kind of like the mist in the PJO series then? Huh, now that is a thought, the “gods” are actually only a wizarding family that rules part of USA and decided to say they were gods so they don't have to actually raise the metric ton of kids they have, the MACUSA let's then get away with it as they are making the Statute of Secret airtight, every time one dies someone else takes over the name depending of their skill and continues right from where the other left... huh maybe I should post it as a prompt.

*** I could definitely see a time traveling dark!Harry finding a way to get Quirrell to set the troll loose during the welcoming feast instead of the Halloween feast. Probably as a way to kill off a few classmates he doesn't like and to show how great he is when he kills it.

** "Please, just tell me how we get sorted!"

The twins glanced at each other; Ron had never seen them look so serious.

"Look Ron, it's not that we don't want to, but the rules around the Sorting are pretty strict."

Ron huffed. "You two break rules all the time!"

"Yeah, but the punishment for breaking this one is... really bad."

"You're in Gryffindor! Are you scared?"

"Sometimes." Fred admitted, mumbling. Again, they glanced at each other, then looked at Ron.

"It's a troll," George blurted out, "but you only have to survive."

"You're joking." said Ron, but something in the twins' eyes told him otherwise. They looked serious like he'd never seen them before. Their gazes were almost cold.

"Magic, spells -." Ron stammered.

Fred shook his head. "No good, you'll only have had your wand a month or so, not enough time to learn anything really good. And anything tailored to trolls will get us found out. Then we're all screwed."

"You just have to survive." repeated George.

"And there's the sorting hat too. It's like an animated hat that can read your mind or something; yells out advice during the fight. Sometimes things fall out if it for first years to use. Even a sword, one year. That kid died though."

"A sword." Ron mused.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the year turned, Ron began to practice. His family's laughter at his new hobby gradually gave way to support. His father picked up a discount book on muggle sword fighting, his brothers animated scarecrows to duel him.

You cannot become a master of the blade in a couple of years without formal tuition, but desperation lent Ron a certain talent of his own.

Eventually, the time came. He received his wand, boarded the train, began his journey.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sunken in the Great Hall of Hogwarts is the Pentagon. Several meters deep, with the four house tables and the professors above to watch. The rest of the year it Pentagon sits empty, but to those with the clearest of vision - the young; a scattering of dried blood was still evident.

The sort of message delivered by the Pentagon worked best with constant reinforcement. And if you have suffered, should the next generation not suffer in turn?

It was a solemn atmosphere as the first years filed into the pit, clad in their black robes. The four houses gazed down at them. They were alone, abandoned aside from a small brown hat sitting in the centre of the Pentagon.

The rules were explained, and as the first years began to panic, a door under the professors burst open, revealing the troll.

Ron broke into a sprint, charging for the hat. Around him, children were screaming, pushing, crying. Across the Pentagon, the troll had taken a moment to sniff the air, great strings of saliva dripping from its maw.

His heart pounding, almost drowning out the roar of the troll, Ron seized the Sorting Hat. The troll began to charge, with great thundering footsteps.

"Another Weasley!" exclaimed the Hat, swinging through the air.

"I sense desperation, determination. Oh and courage too, enough to make Godric proud. For now, I think you could use this."

With a clang, the sword of Gryffindor fell from the base of the hat. Enameled in gold and red, long and perfectly weighted. The watching crowd rippled with shock.

The troll was only steps away, its club beginning a great downward arc. Ron seized up the blade. It seemed to sing as his hands grasped the hilt.

Ron would not live in a world where children suffered and then sat by when more suffered in turn. No more oppression. No more abuse. No more darkness. He was going to kill this troll.

The troll swung down. Ron swung up.

** As first years it sounds like a good way to kill off half the year intake.

Maybe you could have the fifth years fight one as part of their OWLs. For NEWTs you and your group have to fight something much more dangerous, maybe a group of Inferius.

*** Maybe it's a slightly trained troll. Enough so the troll won't eat the kids, the clubs, hands and feet have cushioning charms so they won't crush the children. Children wear the Sorting Hat and he wants to see how their mind works when in a perilous situation.
