I love the Marauder era. This is set in the summer before their seventh year. Keep in mind that it's only half historically correct. It's not finished, but I'm trying to get some more interest generated before I keep going with it. * [[https://www.booksie.com/posting/siriuslyriddikulus/us-delinquents-a-james-and-lily-fanfic-46948][Booksie link!]] * [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=258800][HPfanfiction.com link!]]

  Ever wonder how tf Lily fell for James?
#+end_quote

I mean he was only handsome, good at quidditch, talented at magic, reasonably wealthy, popular, funny, had his own group, seemingly upper middle class, an only child (=will inherit eveything) AND he chased her for years. But oh no he was IMMATURE (truly a shock for a boy of 15-16). The only thing going against James would be the 4v1 ganks vs Snape, who convieniently was out of the picture by their last year, through his own shitty actions.

On top of all that, James then saved Snape's life (++heroic brownie points) and lost his parents (++++ tragic backstory angst).

But, yeah, it's a bit of a mystery how a lower middle class muggleborn girl could fall for such a boy.

*** James didn't lose his parents until Harry was almost born. They both died of a disease (I think dragonpox). Of course, if like me, you believe that Charlus and Dorea will forever be James's parents, then yes, James does have the tragic backstory.

Also one more thing to add - James was a genuinely good person. I'm sure once he was less of a little shit, it wasn't hard to see that.

*** I read the title then read your reply and didn't connect the two. Then, I reread the title and mistakenly placed "if" in place of "tf." Now, everything is much more clearer.
