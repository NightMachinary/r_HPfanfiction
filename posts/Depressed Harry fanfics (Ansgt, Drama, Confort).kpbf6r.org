Hey guys, are you all fine?

Did you have a good new year? (Still hungover, anyone?)

​

Well, I'm trying to be a little sad, my share of happiness is very high, it needs to decrease a little!

​

And what is the best way to stay down? That's right, you got it right! Reading sad, depressive, angst fanfics.

​

My favorite couples at the moment are, Harry and Daphne, Harry and Fleur, Harry and Nymphadora, (Now one that I'm pretty sure almost nobody likes or has read about, is Harry and Andromeda, or Harry and Narcissa)

​

I've read a lot of fanfics where Harry is depressed, but a lot of it is Snape who helps, and seriously I can't take it anymore! Whatever Snarry I see up front I feel like throwing up, it's just sickening to imagine Harry and Snape.

​

Anyway, I already stretched the text, right?

​

In short, I want to read something where Harry is depressed, and who helps him, is one of these characters: Daphne, Fleur, Nymphadora, Susan Bones, Tracey. (If there is one with Andromeda and Narcissa, send it to me, okay?)

​

That's it, stay well, and a kiss on the heart of each of you!
