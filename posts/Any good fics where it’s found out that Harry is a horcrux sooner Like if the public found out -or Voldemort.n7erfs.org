Thanks!


** The power of 7 on ao3 is pretty good. Kinda long but harry figures out hes a horcrux during the riddle history lessons. Hermione and Ginny find a ritual that can destroy the hoecrux but it requires he bond with 7 witches. Admittedly a little smutty at times but it doesnt detract from the plot. A few surprising plot twists and a good amount of character development

*** a little smutty at times LMAO! the whole thing is gratuitous Harry x harem. But yes, this is also the only fic I could think of.

Like I'm pretty sure there is at least one other where they figure it out but I can't remember where

**** I mean yea theres a lot of sex but theres also a lot of plot between the sex. To me that just makes it a story with smut rather than just porn with a semblance of plot like most gratuitous harems are

***** I sort of agree to a point but it just makes it porn with plot in my book, which is certainly a tag for a reason. I admit I'm very partial to a good sex scene but even I stopped reading it because it was too smut heavy.

...Actually now that I think of it I stopped reading when they wrote that super unnecessary Gabi chapter

But the first few chapters are the ones with OP's plot point anyway and it's certainly valid for all of that! Dumbles is like ‘too bad you have to die' and Harry's friends are like ‘uh no. Nope. No.'

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.
