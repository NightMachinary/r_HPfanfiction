Anything (not slash-y) goes! Just looking for creepy stories for the week.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds The Image]] is creepy and very well done! It's a mild Dr. Who (Doctor Who?) crossover, but I read it and the sequel having never seen a single episode of the show and found it still made sense and was highly eerie.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
