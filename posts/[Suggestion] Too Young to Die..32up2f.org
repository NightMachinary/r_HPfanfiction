Just finished reading it after finding it in a fic dump last week. One of my new favorite psycho Harry fics. Super messed up, the first chapter sucks but give the first few a try and see what you think!

Features a slow descent into madness and great ritual mechanics.


** I loved that fic. Super dark. But the harry character comes alive. There are points where you watch him slip deeper and deeper into darkness. No one dimensional Powerful!Harry. A full character you root for and against simultaneously. You just want him to be better. What a fic. Top 5 for me.

** It's one of my favorite despite Harry morphing into one of the most abhorrent characters in all of fanon. The purity of his resolution was just inspiring. The writing was enjoyable, almost on par with the imagination and Harry's downward spiral. The level of world building and magic exploration was something I have rarely found in other stories. And finally the ending was elegant, simple yet appropriate.

** I think that fans of Too Young to Die would really enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]]. COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] and come here to post it as a suggestion and then I saw your post.

It was absolutely amazing. I've read so many fanfics that I thought there wasn't anything of quality left but this one proved me wrong. The character development is superb as well as the story progression. I can honestly say this in now in my top 5 favorite. Maybe my all time favorite.

The author says in his ANs that some people complained about the first chapter (which I didn't find bad) being weak compared to the rest of the story, so if you do give it a try, read the first two chapters before giving up on it.

If you liked Too Young to Die, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]]. I feel like they're similar in a few ways and are equally good.
