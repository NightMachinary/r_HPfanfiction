Like, no inhibitions, super charming accent, explores jungles. Stuff like that.


** Fun fact number 1: Acromantula venom paralyzes the victim within seconds.

Fun fact number 2: Wandless magic means even a paralyzed wizard is still a threat.

Fun fact number 3: Magic laughs at evolution and does it's own thing. In this case Acromantula bites also induce vivid hallucinations and replicate the effects of a confounding spell. Afterall a highly confused paralyzed wizard is far less dangerous than only a paralyzed wizard.

As Ron and Harry escaped from the Forbidden Forest in Mr. Weasley's car Harry had been bitten quit severely.

(Capital letters there, see it's important to note a forest filled with giant man eating spiders is in fact Forbidden)

As Ron dragged his quickly stilling body into the castle his heart finally gave up the good fight and froze right up.

(See that's what massive doses far beyond the regular amount of powerful magical paralyzing venom do. Paralyze the ever living hell out of you, including your lungs and heart muscles. Once again hence the capitals there in Forbidden Forest.)

So it is into this scene stumbles our friendly-ish school medical witch. Who seeing a young boy, (one that tends to visit her station as often as his own bed it seems) bloodied, battered, covered in foul smelling black ooze, paralyzed, and so filled with acromantula venom it was seeping from his body, did what she had long prepared for.

She quick trotted off with him to the infirmary and got out her own custom made and fully patented "Everything is fucked, here's the medical kit to fix it: Acromantula Edition" emergency kit.

See having a school filled with hundreds of children less than two miles away from an entire gods damned acromantula colony tends to make medical personnel twitchy.

If they decide one day the big spider nest waiting to happen filled with tasty snacks called Hogwarts is a good vacation destination, she damn well was prepared.

So with this in mind she started spelling potions into the boy like she was conducting an orchestra. Spell work flew from her wand as she went about saving the fool of a boys life.

Finally she collapsed into her chair and leaned back to relax. Mr. Idiot... ahem, Mr. Potter would be fine now though he would need extensive work still over the next week to get him fully back up to par.

Until then she cast off a quick sleeping charm to keep him under and took a well deserved rest.

Ron knew Harry could help! His sister was missing and Harry would surely help. He had learned the enervate spell and snapped it off at Harry as he played sleeping.

Sure Madame Pomfrey had said he needed a few more days for the hallucination effects to fully wear off but it would be fine. Ron was sure of it, afterall his sister was in danger!

The boy known as Harry sat up with a quickness and looked over at the red haired boy standing over him.

"Harry, quick, the Heir took my sister and is going to kill her! We have to find her know!"

Well Prince Harry of Altonasia was not one to turn away from a fight against a noble!

No sir! The noble line of the Atlantian War Keepers would not stand for that! Harold jumped right quick from the bed and felt his wand snap into his hand.

"Quick Page Boy, fetch me a bowl of water and something of hers!"

Ron was confused at why Harry was calling him Paige but he ran for a bowl of water from the tap. He had nicked a quill from her earlier today when he had lost his.

Handing both over he stared as Harry stabbed his hand with the quill and dropped the blood stained quill into the bowl of water.

"By the powers vested in my as the true Prince of Atlantis I command the waters reveal to me where I might find battle this night!"

(Fun fact number 4: magic is mostly belief and power. So pushing power into something your delusional self 100% knows to be true will work a decent amount of the time provided it makes even remotely any sense at all.)

The water wavered and granted them a vision of where to go. Nodding his head Harry vanished the whole thing and strode off wearing his hospital garb.

Opening the shaft Harold turned towards his trusty Page Boy.

"Marcus, you must wait here as I go into battle! It is important that I focus fully on the battle. I can I'll afford to split my attention between battle and protecting you. Stay here, I shall finish battle with this vile low class noble and return your sister post haste!"

Turning he leapt down the hole into the abyss below.

Fun Fact Number 5: Casting Abyssal Darkness on a horcrux works just as well as Fiendfyre. Though the mind rending whispers of things trying to leak from the most dangerous of water spells is not better for your survival than Fiendfyre is.

Fun Fact Number 6: Basilisk venom mixed with hallucinogenic acromantula venom, several healing potions and mind rending whispers does not make a good combination.

Harry James woke up in the hospital wing. No wait, James Bond. Nope not quite right either. Hahaha! At last!

Harry Sterling Archer swung put of the bed and looked around. He found himself alone for the time being in a castle for God's sake. What shitty terrorist organization kept people in castle's?

That's like The Mets forcing their fans to watch their games from the Hoover Damn.

Which honestly would be an upgrade as the Mets were doing terrible this year.

Still he grabbed a few flasks he found laying around, Hello Casa Del Alchohol! Archer made it around the corner quickly only to be stopped by some old Gandalf impersonator.

Jumping up he kneed the man in the face hard enough to knock him out and did a quick search.

He didn't find anything useful besides a gnarly old stick, some truly weird candies, oh and a sack full of gold!

"Jackpot baby, Daddies going to Monte Carlo!"

He kept up his exfiltration of the castle. That was until he found some kids outside flying brooms!

One flew down to talk to him and he quickly knocked the blonde boy out as well.

Taking the broom he jumped up and screamed in joy as he started flying off.

Taking a long swig of a random flask he smiled as the high octane booze hit his throat. He had no clue how but his body had known exactly where the alcohol was and grabbed it out of reflex as he had left.

The sun was setting as he flew off, he felt the urge to swish out the old gnarly suddenly. Hogwarts found itself treated to the sweet tunes of Kenny Loggins as he flew away that evening into the twilight.
