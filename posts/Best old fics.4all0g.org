***** He posted about it in the Yahoo group a few weeks ago. Bone, Lung, and Brain. It's why the Dragon series stopped posting. He posted the last bit of what he had written and then a little bit of what he had planed. The last bit is available on ff(dot)net.

****** Oh, holy jesus. That's no bueno. I hadn't started reading the Dragon series yet (I have an aversion to unfinished fics), so that could be why I haven't started.

I know it's slim, but I hope he gets better.

  Which ones most accurately predicted the next books?
#+end_quote

Probably the most amusing "prediction" was linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by Ruskbyte), which appropriated the title of JKR's fifth book a year before it was released.

An old, epic series that was way before its time was linkffn(Harry Potter's Existence After Life by Cygnus Crux) and sequels.

Then there's the work of Full Pensieve (Mike) [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/][(link)]], specifically Year of Rebellion. Alas, another writer felled by failing health.
