** I'm not sure if it would make sense, but I'd love to see a sequel to *A Black Comedy*.

Harry and Sirius' bromance like relationship had me in stitches throughout the entire story and I'd love to see more it.

*** (I'll try to avoid spoilers but please if you haven't read A Black Comedy, stop reading this reply and do so) I'm a complete sucker for people from alternate dimensions interacting, so Id be happy with a continuation of that. But there's definitely a bunch left to explore. Among other things, I've been itching to know exactly what the lore behind defeating a Dark Lord specifically entails. The last chapter was basically setting up all these awesome things that Harry/Sirius will go and wreck and Harry and Mr. Fucker (his least spoilery name) are going to do politically for the next few decades (Though just Harry/Sirius in the Wizengamont by itself is hilarious, and I'd love to see everyone's reaction to a certain seat that will soon be reactivated). It would be nice to have a certain ability Harry finally figured out near the end of the story have greater affects/implications than simply surviving one battle.

And on more minor notes, I'd like to see more kidnappings/adventures with Hermione and Ginny's reaction to who seems to be James Jr.'s future girlfriend would be great. (Not that either of the Lord Blacks are settling down soon, can't deny the gift, but Id bet money if that ever got written, Harry would end up with Tonks. Even ignoring compatible they are, there would be too much to hide/explain to anyone else)

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
