Harry left the magical world, and opened a school for muggleborns. The magical world didn't know for a while, and I think death eaters attacked it(failing miserably). It might also have had a bit of bashing in it, but i'm not 100% sure on that. It was complete as well(i'm 95% sure of that). Sirius was alive as well.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** It should be We're screwed by White Angel of Aurolon linkffn(10533939), which has also a prequel Screw Them. It could be The Lily Potter Foundation by theflyinfoote linkffn(10536445) to, but the school becomes a point just during the final chapters.

*** My problem with The Lily Potter Foundation is that it dragged Hermione into it needlessly, bashed her, and then made her the romance figure. It's weird, and I think it would have been better as a gen fic.

  The Wizarding World is confronted with a problem they never had to face before. The consquences of their own arrogance and bigotry. After Hogwarts lost dozens of students each year, they try to change things again. But what do you do if you realise that things aren't that easy? Sequel to Screw Them

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry looks for something new to do with his life. Mix in a little heart ache and the Wizarding World is in for some changes.

** Not Harry, but linkffn(12327848) has a Muggleborn mediwizard planning to reform the wizarding world by flooding it with Muggleborns, which he does by infiltrating Muggle sperm banks and fusing the stored samples with those from wizards. As a part of his scheme, he sets up a school to prepare the incoming wave for Hogwarts.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.
