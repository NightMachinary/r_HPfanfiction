Does anyone know of any fanfictions that sort of play up the similarities between Harry and Voldemort? I mean, beyond the whole 'similar childhood' thing. Maybe where Harry is Voldemort's equal because they have the same magical abilities?

Thanks in advance


** I just want to say.

Harry has Slytherin green eyes while Voldemort has Gryffindor red eyes.

** I thinks that there are almost no similarities between them if you don't consider the childhood aspect.

What makes harry special that even though they have similar upbringing he is a good hearted and a pretty exact opposite of Voldemort
