**** Honestly, I don't really think that makes much sense either. Developing it or not, the characters were completely different. Opposites might attract for sex, but I can't imagine actually marrying someone who's basically my polar opposite.

The relationship never made much sense, beyond the fact that people really wanted it while reading the series.

*** I prefer to take almost everything an author says with a pinch of salt, and with JKR it's usually a big pinch of salt because some thing's just don't fit with me, and I agree that this is a huge change. I don't really care, in all honestly, because I sit on the fence re: H/Hr vs. Hr/R, but I have to disagree that announcing Dumbledore is gay is a major change. What she's announced here changes the books in a big way if she'd actually written it, but AD being gay doesn't.

**** I guess what I meant about Dumbledore is that it seemed so non-consequential, because we were never focused on his personal life anyway, or any of the personal lives of the teachers. It was all about Harry and the students. And for something like this to come out to sort of undermine the character development, it feels so weird.

*** This isn't a canon change though, it is hindsight.

Take it that she realizes her characters may not have grown organically, but it was a childrens story and they are fine in that light.

Personally though, VINDICATION!

**** Thing is, after the fans grew up reading it, it wasn't really a children's story any longer. If you're writing a story that you know 16 and 17-year-olds (and older) will be reading, even if they were pre-teens when they read the first book in the series, then you can't pawn off bad romance and weak character development as "just a children's story." The last three books were clearly Young Adult fiction, at least as classified in the US public library system when I was growing up.

JKR let a lot of people down with some of her late series writing decisions, leading directly to HP fanfiction being the scariest, largest fanfic community in the world. I'm glad she realized some of this and is finally admitting it after years of denial.

Personally, I think she panicked in GoF (when a publicly admitted delay and rewrite happened) and at that point she changed several things, including the inevitably cheesy budding romance plotline, which was clearly developing between Harry and Hermione. But there is no way she'll admit to that, I'm sure.

***** Myself and a large number of people I know, believe she probably had a ghost writer for the last 3 books. That she gave them her notes and said "we must hit all of these plot points".

Explains a lot of the out-of-character stuff that happened after 5th year.

I also believe that Ginny was supposed to have put Harry on a love potion to "catch his attention" the same way that Molly did Arthur, but that someone pointed out to her that it was a bit rapey. Possible that it was moved to Merope/Tom Sr, or that it was supposed to be a mirror-life situation which made him realize what was happening.

Not that he would have broken it off with her once he did notice her, just for using a potion. I doubt it would have been Amortentia ... I prefer Harry/Hermione, but I still love a good Ginny in fanfiction and I hate when people feel they have to make her evil Potions!Ginny!Slut in order to justify putting him with someone else.

** I always suspected that she wanted to be Harry and Hermione at the begining. Because book 1 to 4 it seems that they would be a cuple. Come on, everyone thought this when the were flying on Buckbeak.

But suddenly in book 5 (or was the 6, not sure now) Harry is head over heels for Ginny.

And I always thought that she put Hermione with Ron because he would be alone. And I always sorry for her.

If only she could rewrite the books :/

*** I see why you're saying that, but the article suggests the opposite- Rowling conceived the series with Ron and Hermione getting together in the end. Then in later books, even when the characters had evolved so that there didn't seem to be much of a reason for the two to be together, she went ahead with it anyway,

This seems too easy, like it might be a twitter publicity stunt to sell more issues. That JKR never said anything like this, though possibly Emma has given it thought and asked her about it.

edit: Yes, I have long admitted that having the PenName "ginnymylove" makes me being a Harmonian rather strange. But I defend it by wanting Harry to get both; plus I was barely into fanfic when I came up with the name, and now I'm kinda stuck with it unless I want to go back to being unknown.

**** Yes, but a tad more extreme than that. Those three were basically family at that point. They've been together through thick and thin, and are brothers in arms. The way I see it, there are two trios in the war (Neville-Luna-Ginny being the second), and thankfully, at least two of those six didn't get married to one another... it just makes it seem like war forced those six together, and they're just stuck that way.

It feels more like the war decided their life with the pairings between those six, which is kind of sad.
