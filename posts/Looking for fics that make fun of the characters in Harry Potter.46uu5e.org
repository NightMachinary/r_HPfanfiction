** Not quite what you're asking for, but this short fic makes fun of multiple character's personalities through some humorous dialogue: linkffn(1613595)

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy, having lost his position as seeker, is now Quidditch Commentator. And an extremely bitter Slytherin is not the best person to commentate on a game where his former side go against Gryffindor. All-Dialogue fic.

**** Okay. So do you want crack fics where the reader laughs at a character or fics where in-universe characters laugh at another character? The latter tend to be the asshole!Harry fics, the former are just crack fics for reader enjoyment.

Maybe you're looking for a sane protagonist in an insane world? Those can be reader-enjoyment fics.

The first post sounded to me like you wanted in-universe mean spirited comeuppance for wacky characters, sorry if I misinterpreted it.

***** As a crack-fic-lover, yes, please! Off the top of my head I can't think of any sane-protagonist-insane-world fics, do you have any recommendations?
