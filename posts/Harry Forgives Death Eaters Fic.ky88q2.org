:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Old Fic I read a while back where Harry and Dumbledore defeat Voldemort during the third task and after capturing the Death Eaters Harry request lighter sentences for them to stop the cycle of violence. Also after receiving a lighter sentence Pettigrew still gets in trouble and has his magic bound and memory sealed and sent out to the muggle world with life skills.

Any help is appreciated.


** I believe the story you are looking for is called Harry's Loophole by ThinkingSpeck

  [COMPLETE] Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but during the shouting match with Ron he realises that he doesn't actually have to risk his life and look like a fool in front of everyone - he really only needs to show up for each task and make a token effort. Single-point-of-departure fic, departing early in book 4. Some text borrowed from J.K. Rowling.
