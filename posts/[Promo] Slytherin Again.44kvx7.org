Hi there, just wanted to share a little story I wrote for [[/r/writingprompts]] , thought you might enjoy it! The prompt was: For ten years, no one has been sorted into Slytherin. Enjoy!

--------------

It had been ten years now - ten years since the last person was sorted into Slytherin. No young witch or wizard wished to be tarred with the same brush. The name 'Slytherin' was associated with evil now; not just evil, but failure. After all, the fight was won.

The Sorting Hat mused to itself about the lost opportunity, and the imbalance of it all. Was this the way things were meant to be? Four houses was the way it was always meant to be, no matter the...events that had occured.

This year's new batch of first years were nervously looking at The Sorting Hat, like they were scared of him. /Scared!/ He would have to do something about that - perhaps a song would calm them down. He opened his brim wide:

--------------

/Oh what a day it is today;/

/For you will be a witch!/

/Or maybe you'll be wizard,/

/I don't care which is which./

/Here there be four houses,/

/Their virtues bright and strong/

/Ravenclaw brave, Gryffindor wise;/

/Oh dear, I got that wrong./

/Nay, it's Gryffindor Brave,/ /Ravenclaw Wit,/

/Slytherin Clever,/ /and with Hufflepuff the rest will sit!/

/These houses make our Hogwarts whole,/

/My name's The Sorting Hat,/

/And I'll take a look inside your soul./

/I'll see your colour shining true;/

/And show you to your home,/

/Be with Red, Yellow, Green or Blue!/

--------------

It was rough, thought The Sorting Hat, but it worked. The students were all smiling now at the song, even after some cringed at the name 'Slytherin'.

After his little show, the sorting ceremony began. The first little child - 'Arnott, Adam' - was sorted into Ravenclaw.

This carried on, through the A's, and the B's, and the C's, until 'Calvin, Sarah' sat upon the stool.

/Oh yes, what a bright young mind you have,/ said the hat. /Wit, and talent to be seen, for sure. However...I do see more than a little bit of ambition here. You wish to be a professor yourself some day?/ The girl nodded shyly underneath the hat.

/Well then,/ he continued, /You'll be most at home in...SLYTHERIN!/

The girl let out a frightened sob, and a professor rushed to her side.

"It's alright, my dear; there's nothing wrong with being in Slytherin House," she promised, "I'll look out for you, and I'll even be your head of house!"

"Helga's right, you'll be looked after by her," said another professor, placing a strong hand on the girl's shoulder, "And you can be known as the one to bring the house back to greatness."

"Oh don't be so dramatic, Godric," replied the first professor, "She's scared witless, can't you see? Everything will be fine, Sarah, don't you stress."

The little girl nodded bravely, and let the professor lead her to the empty table beside the Hufflepuff one.

"You sit here, my dear, and make friends with my Hufflepuffs - I'm sure you'll have more friends joining you soon!"

The Sorting Hat watched mutely as Hufflepuff's students nearby began to talk to the young witch and coax her into a spirited conversation. He smiled inwardly, looking forward to sending friends her way this year, and the next, and the next.

It was what Godric had made him for, after all.


** Lovely play on expectations here - I thought the time period was after Voldemort, but the little reveal of it actually being in the founder's era made me smile.

Your rhyme, as you note, is a little rough. You should try and see if you can get the structure and flow down a little better.

I think this works really well as a short one-shot.

** Nice little twist there. I like it a lot.

Are you going to make a story out of it?

** This year's song was over again, thank Merlin. Godric had tasked him with ensuring that he only repeated himself once a century, which made his life a right pain if he did say so himself.

Then again, he was a hat, which didn't really call for much in the way of activity when not being worn on someone's head and he only really had two jobs to do; sing and Sort.

And this sorting was already turning into one of the more memorable ones as well.

The entire Slytherin table was empty once more. It happened once or twice every generation these days. Sometimes it was Ravenclaw, at other times Gryffindor and he even remembered two occasions where the Hufflepuff table had been empty as well.

But none had been empty nearly as often as the Slytherin one. The price of ambition was high indeed at times.

Still, he was more than a millenium old now. Godric was long gone and those that followed him were almost all just as gone now. He knew what was going to happen today.

"Able, Archimedes!" McGonnagall called out, just like she'd done for almost 40 years now. A boy shuffled forward from the rank & file, eyeing the empty table nervously.

The Headmistress put the Hat down on him and he felt that familiar sensation of something /connecting/ to him.

He ruffled through the boy's head, looking for something, anything that could make his job easier-and then sighed.

/Hello./ He said to the boy.

He tensed up underneath him, clearly not happy with having someone invade his mind like that. /Look, please don't-/ he pleaded as countless others had before.

/Relax boy./ The hat grumbled. /I don't give away anyone's secrets. Ever. They're not mine to tell./

Archimedes relaxed a bit. /It's Archie/ he said huffily. /So where do you think I'd fit?/

The Hat made a show of thinking about it. /Hmm, quite a bit of ambition in here boy. Lots of things you want to do with your life and I can see-/

/Wait!/ The boy snapped in his mind, an all too familiar fear forming in the pit of his stomach. /Not Slytherin!/

/Not Slytherin? Really, you?/ The hat stated with a growl. /Listen here boy, I've sorted tens if not hundreds of thousands of children. It's what I do. And you, boy, you *are/ /a Slytherin. It's where you'll find your true friends./

/Friends?/ Asked Archie with a derisive tone, the empty table flickering through his mind alongside... other... images. /Oh, there sure are many/ friends /waiting for me over there! I can practically hear the eager anticipation in their voices from here, I can!/

/Now now, no need to be snippy boy. And where else, if not Slytherin, would you go?/

/Hufflepuff./

/What? But-/

/I want Hufflepuff./

/Oh very well then you stubborn little git, might as well be/ HUFFLEPUFF!

The boy scampered off with a relieved smile on his face while the Hat scowled at his back. Such cowardice was nothing new to him, but it always rankled. Because eventually that boy would be back. They always came back once they found their sanctuaries not to fit them. Re-sorting them was always an exercise in smugness for him. Very hard to block him out when he sang /I told you so/, off-key, straight into their minds.

"Coulthard, Catherine!" The Headmistress announced.

Ooh, a muggleborn! Those were always fun to Sort. Few preconceptions, no biases, inquiring minds, he rarely had problems getting them Sorted just right.

And then he /connected/ to her.

/Hello? Mister Hat?/ The girl asked, her mind wondering about whether he was alive or not and how to adress something like that. Imbued Sapience was limited to AIs as far as she knew, but did magic make them more than that or what?

Oh yeah, this was going to be great. /Yes?/ He asked brusquely. /You called?/

/Um, no offence mister Hat, but when will we have to wrestle a troll again?/

What?

/What?/ The sorting Hat asked, confusion echoing through his statement. /What gave you that idea?/

/Umm, that ghost, Frederick or was it Georgie? He went by both.../

/Oh,/him/! Pay him no mind girl! Now where to put you.../ Oh damn, this was Potter all over again. /Let's see, hard working, very intelligent, courageous AND ambitious to boot-damn. Oh well, do you have any preference my dear girl?/

/Um, well, I've got a question first./

/Yes girl?/

/Why is that table empty?/

/It's the Slytherin table./ The Hat said, sparing a thought for those he'd Sorted there just last year. They had all clamored to be re-Sorted before boarding the train, the little ingrates. He'd placed them there for a reason after all.

Much as he'd seen it before, he hated seeing an empty House Table come sorting time. All those bright young minds... lost...

/Oh./ The girl said sadly. /They dead?/

/Most of them are, yes. The others... they decided to switch Houses./

/Can you tell me more about that house?/

/You know enough to know most of it, child./

/Oh, that's right. Mind-reader. Forgot./ She mused. /Say, what was he like, Slytherin?/

/Why do you ask girl?/

/Would he have accepted me as a student?/ She asked sharply.

/Hmmph./ The Hat snorted. /He prized cunning and ambition above all things girl. He wouldn't have liked it, but he would have let you in if you proved yourself worthy./

The girl's thoughts flittered and fluttered through her mind. /But now nobody's there. All their little stories, traditions and all that, what happens to them?/

The Hat caught on quickly. /Pretty ambitious, wanting to make a House yours./

The girl smiled. /You think I can do it?/ She asked.

/Well.../The Hat mused. /I guess you are going to have to find out in/ SLYTHERIN!

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.
