So I've read a fair share of post DH, adult life centric stories, right? Harry is almost always either an auror(head auror in later stories), a quidditch player, an Unspeakable(these are usually the least interesting as most authors never make the position interesting), or a professor at Hogwarts.

But I've yet to read a story where Head Auror Potter is offered the Headmaster position. We could see him ferociously defend the castle on the front lines, a beacon of hope and power to the defenders. Or we could just see day to day life as he distinguishes himself as Headmaster in strange, yet humorous ways, trying to 1-up Dumbledore perhaps.

There's also the fact of the children he may or may not have, canon or otherwise. How would they turn out? I can imagine Harry turning a blind eye to the antics of his kids most of the time.

*** Dumbledore sneaked a three headed dog into the castle and kept it behind an /alohomora/-locked door. Harry would keep a Nundu in the castle and won't bother locking it.

***** Are you nuts? He'll bring in a nundu and breed it with a Ukrainian Ironbelly-Hungarian Horntail hybrid and then create an absolutely insane hybrid which James or Albus Potter have to save the world from.

** it's not post DH but linkffn(the headmaster) seemed pretty good to me. During the Toads effort to get a confession, Harry's dragooned into being Headmaster by the magic of the castle? the job?.. Anyway, not a bad story imho.

  Harry and Co. are caught just as they're trying to floo to the DoM and rescue Sirius. Harry doesn't give into Umbridge's demands and in her rage, she curses him. Unwittingly, she sets something much larger into motion [rev3].

** I mean, there's one where young Harry immediately becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts but it's an extreme AU.
