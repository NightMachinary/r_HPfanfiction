** This is a great idea. You'd have to age her up a couple of years though, so she could be graduated and an Auror for a few years. xD Then she could adopt 11 year old Harry and be a cool parent.

*** Im actually writing a fanfic about that kind. Harry is 15 and she is 22/23. She becomes his godmother after she finds out what bad the Dursley's we're treating Harry and then she adopted Harry

** The closest I've found to this is a fic where Harry develops the ability to turn into a kitten and is found by Nymphadora and adopted. Pretty sure its a gamer fic, and it didn't go very far, they never made it to hogwarts.
