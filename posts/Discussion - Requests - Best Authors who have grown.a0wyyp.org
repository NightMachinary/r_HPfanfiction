Do you have a favorite Author who has grown in skill and content over the years and or stories? As in when you read their earlier stories, you are like okay, childish, a bit cringe worthy, very cliche but okay and now their fics are much more mature, fuller, complete and enjoyable.


** Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 was nothing short of incredible. I had read the original "Shadowed Malice" (Antithesis was a rewrite of this) and the author really managed to nail it and improve; fixing all the cringey power wank moments and adding real characterization and conflict. Antithesis does drag on a bit but it is well written and tells a good story. The uniqueness of what it does also cannot be understated.

This is more from their original work to their rewrite (not the author as a whole), but I really think this fits the bill.

Their first works were okayish, but their last works really reflect their growth as a writer. I especially recommend linkffn(A Second Beginning) if you like D/G.

#+begin_quote
  For Ginny Weasley, being thirty-two years old and divorced while struggling to raise a teenage son on her own, romance just isn't on the map. But when help comes from the most unexpected source she has to re-examine her priorities. Draco Malfoy has it all, the house, the job and the perfect son, but when he meets Ginny Weasley again he realizes all of what he never had. D/G.
