** It's not a Weasley Space Program, but many Weasleys end up joining Harry's space program in the Mischief's Heir series.

Loki from MCU adopts Harry during the summer before second year, but it's all set in the HP universe with only occasional crossover elements. Harry gets more invested in learning and pursuing his interests, and he's decided one of his interests (after hearing stories from Loki) is space travel. It's a rare series that really elevates magic as something unique and different. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

Also employed some incredibly novel solutions to various stations of canon, and to literally every problem the magical world has, actually, including but not limited to the Horcruxes, Pettigrew, Barty Crouch Jr, the Deathly Hallows, Ron and Hermione's constant bickering, the tension between Houses, industrialism's impact on the environment, and the inevitable failure of the Statute of Secrecy due to technology. And little of it felt like unreasonable jumps or Deus ex machina, except a few minor things where it was quite literally Deus ex machina but what do you expect when a god of mischief and magic is physically present occasionally? Every solution felt both earned as a logical development of earlier events, and yet unexpected. You've seen Pettigrew outed by the Marauder's Map hundreds of times, but have you ever seen him outed by an anti-thieving prank? The Hufflepuff Fight Club is something I've never seen before, either.

The author has another HP series, too, which though it shared some similar resolutions to small items had some incredibly different approaches to the big problems of the Wizarding World. It started with Harry getting ninja training from the world of Naruto in his dreams, almost entirely forgets about that premise once he starts immersing himself in the magical world, comes up with another utterly unique solution to the Horcruxes, sends him to the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender to help resolve their plot uniquely, and then returns to the HP world to solve the impending "Muggle technology will eventually break the Statute of Secrecy" crisis in a new and totally different way and also develops into a slash fic unexpectedly. I'm not normally interested in, well, most of the major elements in the series, yet I thought it was novel and entertaining anyway. So many fics do the same things that it's fun to read one that stands out.
