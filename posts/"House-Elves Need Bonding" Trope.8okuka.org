I find it quite strange just how many stories feature Harry (usually) informing Hermione how wrong she is to try and free elves because they need to be bonded, and therefore it isn't slavery (this sounds insidious, for obvious historical reasons). It just doesn't make sense to me, the series seems pretty clear that they are enslaved, irrespective of if they like it. Maybe the method of freeing them need to start subtly, but anyone you can order around like that is, in no uncertain terms, a slave.

I mean, it's hardly odd that pure-bloods would enslave a species they saw as lessers using magic and brainwash them throughout the ages to even make them want to stay in servitude. Is there any particular reason for this trope? One idea I had that I'll be using in my own story is the thought that elves in the past were ensnared by a powerful Maledictus cast by pure-bloods that embedded a desire to serve whatever family that took them in. A way to create a long lasting magical contract that passes down through blood, basically.

I dunno, it's just weird that it's supposed to be such a simple thing but Hermione didn't find it in any book.


** I think it stems from how down the drain Winky went after she was freed, among other things.

I don't know if I like your /Maledictus/ idea any better, though --- although it's admittedly more canon-friendly; I'd rather House-Elves' devotion be a mere "nurture" thing.

Its so the main characters can own house-elves without having to deal with the issue of slavery being immoral regardless of the happiness of individual slaves.

One explanation I have seen is that she read about it, but didn't believe it. Which honestly would make sense, considering that slaves needing to be enslaved was a argument for real slavery and it obviously wasn't true.

just as a suggestion. house-elves in canon are bound to property not families. The owner of a house commands the house-elves regardless of which family they belong to(obviously a house-elve can still prefer a certain family over a random owner). Thats why Kreacher was forced to serve Harry instead of Bellatrix even though Kreacher wanted to serve the Black family and not Harry who was the owner of Grimmauld place 12. They seem more like serfs in that regard.

So you could simply have them use a magically enforced Oath of Fealty which was basically a inheritable feudal contract to bind someone(and that persons descendants) to a piece of land. And the owner of that lands commands the people bound to it.

Not that this would be morally better than plain slavery.

Um, are you sure? They always refer to serving masters and their families, not their homes. Kreacher was forced to serve Harry because Sirius named Harry his heir and thus inheritor of everything owned by the Black Family (in this case, Kreacher).

When they wonder if Harry inherited Grimmauld place they were unsure if the magic Dumbledore placed on it would hold if Bellatrix actually owned it, he says that if Harry owns Grimmauld place Kreacher would have to obey him.

  “You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have in- deed inherited the house, you have also inherited ---”

  He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the crea- ture might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bel- lowed, “What the hell is that?”

** This might be slightly off topic here, but I've been rereading the series and a few things stood out to me about House Elves, particularly their self comparisons to Goblins (this happens between Winky and Dobby in book 4 she says something about being like a common goblin) and the way they're described with certain physical similarities (small stature, large-bat-like ears, long fingers) it occurred to me that it was potential that the common House Elf could have been literally domesticated from Goblins over the course of several centuries, perhaps with magical assistance. (this makes sense because house elves are even smaller, have larger eyes, less intimidating teeth, and floppier ears: mirroring real world differences between dogs and wolves)

On that note, a maledictus could be easily be present. I think it's clear the house elves are heavily indoctrinated, and that that is somehow magically enforced. I don't think Dobby was compelled to continue beating himself for disobeying the Malfoys after being freed (also book 4 I believe in the same scene down in the kitchen) when he told Harry they were ‘bad dark wizards' and then had to smash his face against a table until a human (Harry) stopped him.

It seemed like some sort of compulsion brought on by magic. As if Dobby had been living impiriused his whole life and had pulled a few decades worth of Barty Crouch JR stunts to be able to work through it. Now I wouldn't say it's as simple as that because you can't put the imperius curse on an entire population, so I think maledictus would be a more likely thing but that seems like an unusual thing for a maledictus to do. Have we ever heard of anything like that in canon?

Because it's clear there's some sort of magical binding contract passed down generation by generation that comes with the propaganda built in on such a base level that it should never be possible to question it. Giving magical folk an entire race of happy little servants. Which is horrific lbr.

And once I found myself asking if House Elves would even exist were it not for Wizards, I realized it was very unlikely they're even capable of breeding without orders (they seem to not be able to do anything without orders) so the best course of action would probably just be to stop breeding House Elves. But again I can't imagine how a House Elf would feel about that, and the situation leaves me feeling that there's no real correct answer because their current existence is a horrible reality that should never have come to pass.

Regardless of all this shit tho, we can clearly look at canon and say that House Elves do not ‘need' bonding and it's clearly not ‘for their own good'. Dobby and Winky both were able to live their lives after being freed with no negative physical consequences. No health declination other than mental stress on Winky's part. And it's pretty easy to tell anyone who says enslavement is for any creature's good is absolutely espousing propaganda.

(I also don't feel the House Elf situations is truly comparable to real world slavery and that making comparisons between them can range from tone deaf to racist because of the liberal -/cough/racist/cough/- abstractions in the source text but that's a different conversation.)

*** 1) Your username is great. :)

2) I don't think the common goblin line implies that. Rather, we have to remember that house-elves come with huge, old, expensive properties. Goblins never do put up with such an arrangement, and would take it as an insult to their species to suggest it (they are bankers, fighters and spellcasters first an foremost). I'd even suggest that since elves come with such properties, there aren't very many elves. But goblins aren't bound to anything magically and so there are a lot more of them, so they're more common.

**** I was saying more along the lines of forcibly subjugated and domesticated than along the line of goblins willingly doing anything (because they don't) but it's fair to say that while they don't go too far into the history of it in canon we do hear about quite a lot of goblin/wizard strife and it's safe to say there are a lot of reasons for it. Not that something like that would likely be taught at Hogwarts.

Further more with the way Goblins preside over objects and property themselves, I feel that only supports my theory.

TLDR: I am describing magical atrocity at a level that isn't really applicable to any real world scenario not willing relationships with Goblins formed out of mutual dependence for food/protection. This isn't a wolf to dog kind of domestication process.

** Well, the reason house-elves are indentured unpaid domestic servants in canon is never really explained. The closest we get is Hermione's SPEW being poo-pooed by a handful of characters, so I guess a bunch of fanfic writers extrapolate from that to get 'enslaving elves is okay' whilst conveniently forgetting about how Dobby, Winky, and Kreacher are all physically/emotionally abused.

I guess giving Harry Dobby as a slave lets him break various canon magic rules (apparating in Hogwarts, doing whatchamacallit) without having a character who outshines him; Dobby's just a slave, after all, he doesn't need characterization beyond 'I want to serve Master Harry!'.

That's what I kept thinking, too. It might just be that elves have to have a home - we see one tending a bar, and I suppose that means 'public house' is house enough - but they don't have to be slaves.

They've just taken to acting that way so they don't get given clothes, as whatever it is that lets them make a house their home is broken by that particular act, an act that causes distress to elves that are not abused and not ridden with the house-elf equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome (hence the difference between Dobby and Kreacher). It's not universal, either, as the bar-elf at the Blind Pig doesn't display any kind of obsequiousness.

What we /do/ see is that elves that are given clothes find themselves a new home as quick as they can, whether or not they're happy about being kicked out of their former homes - Dobby is, Winky isn't. In both cases we see, it's Hogwarts. Even Kreacher ends up there when Harry stops treating Grimmauld Place as his home.

I'm of the view that wizards are massively missing a trick with House Elves, holding the power to kick them out over the poor wee blighters to reduce them to slavery. Kreacher becomes a /lot/ more useful with a bit of decent treatment, after all, and he was the most brutalised elf we see.

*** I don't think there's any indication that wizards are magically superior. I mean, Dobby had no trouble stopping Lucius, who objectively is a strong wizard.

Canonically, Griphook basically answers this for us. Wizards enforced their "superiority" by legally denying all other magical beings the use of wands, which make magic more potent and efficient. Based on events that occurred after the end of the series, we know they are basically equal when wands are taken into account. In a modern goblin rebellion, some of them stole wands and immediately began using them just fine, transfiguring and charming stuff.

And yet Lucius made no attempt to get back at Dobby afterwards. If it was so easy, he would have done it. There is nothing in support of this idea that wizards have the best magic. They simply have the wands, Griphook and the goblin rebellion that took place after the end of the series basically makes this undeniable as far as I can tell. Elves, goblins (etc) can use wands, we know once the goblins stole some their magic was not stated to be any different than a wizard's. If anything they might be stronger since it is common for goblins and elves to be able to use magic without wands, whereas most wizards seem powerless without a wand.

****** I think its safe to say that Voldemort and Dumbledore have both proven that numbers can mean little when it comes to magic. You're also ignoring the general incompetence of the population. Never forget that the Weasleys sold hats with shield charms on them since so many ministry employees couldn't cast the charm. The vast majority of wizards likely never encounter anything more dangerous than a doxy in their lives. Defence against the Dark arts doesn't give you an army, it gives you a bunch of people who can recognise dark magic and deal with household pests. NEWT level might go higher than that but I doubt NEWT defence is a popular option unless you plan on doing something about a Dark Lord. Its just not relevant to most jobs. With that in mind the numbers likely matter very little, not to mention the books never give an idea of how many goblins there actually are.

Wands were banned from magical creatures in 1631. There was a Goblin rebellion in 1612 involving Hogsmeade if I remember correctly. Goblins had rebelled even when they could use wands and even then they lost. Perhaps they're really not as good as you think they are. Griphook's bitter words speak of the possibilities not what they could actually do. Also bear in mind he was a bitter individual who hated wizards and both sides regularly accuse the other of being liars and cheats. With that setting you have to consider the possibility that he wasn't being entirely honest. He's never going to admit that his species can't compete.

Malfoy isn't going to murder Dobby in front of Harry in the middle of Hogwarts but if house-elves were so powerful and could beat wizards so easily then the Battle of Hogwarts would have been over in seconds after the house-elves joined the fight. Not to mention wizards would use house-elves for body-guards or assassinations. Malfoy lunges at Harry and Dobby blindsides him. It just says Malfoy had no choice but to leave. It doesn't say anything about Malfoy quaking in fear, likely he felt like he'd been made a fool and stormed off to sulk.

Lucius was trying to kill Harry. If Dobby was inconsequential because of his magic, he would have killed him first, but we are told he had to leave despite getting out his wand:

#+begin_quote
  “Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby --- Dobby is free.” Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.

  “You've lost me my servant, boy!”

  But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

  “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
#+end_quote

Harry would have been a non issue, but the text makes it clear even with his wand out he didn't think he could win (or at least not quickly enough to get away with killing Harry). And it was because of the elves that the Battle wasn't so easy. I didn't say elves could just trump wizards (they were vastly outnumbered), but there's absolutely nothing to suggest the magic of Wizards are above that of elves and goblins unless wand ownership is taken into account. That elves especially seem adept at wandless magic unlike wizards (every elf seems to be capable of it), they might be even stronger with wands (this is just supposition).

** Authors attempt to rationalize certain aspects of the wizarding world.

As far as I can tell, this usually comes up as a way to write off the idea that the house-elves are functionally slaves, true or not, and or a way to get Hermione to stop banging on about the cause very quickly.

If a house elf requires master-servant bonding (never mentioned), then of course they would need to serve wizards/witches. If a house-elf does not require that, you arrive at the conclusion that the wealthy/elite of magical society are more-or-less able to force non-humans to do whatever they want, and be happy to do it. There are OTHER ways around this, but it rarely seems to come up.

TLDR: Bonding is a short cut to rationalize house elf servitude and not have to deal with the uncomfortable implications of its existence in the magical world.

Is it really so unbelievable that Hermoine, fueled by outrage, would ignore anything that doesn't already fit her worldview? It's not outside of the realm of possibility for /magical creatures/ to be bred to require bondage. It's not impossible for elves that have already been bonded for most of their lives to be unable to live independently. Both could be true regardless of their treatment outside that.

It exists because it gives the author room to work in. "The world would be perfect if somebody with my exact mindset fixed everything" is boring as fuck in fiction if used without any serious examination. Moreover, "slavery is bad" isn't a particularly complex moral issue, so it just devolves into moral crusader wank material within minutes. It's much more interesting for characters to have to deal with a system which is inherently unfair and imperfect. Besides, if it wasn't the case that house elves needed to be bonded, you just open up the doors for whining about how the characters aren't dropping what they're doing to stop some travesty against a handful of plot devices and derailing the story completely.

The only time elves should not have such a trait is in a story exploring the weight of independence, and I'm not sure an HP fanfic is a particularly good place to do that in.

This is exactly the opposite. The position of elves are that way because wizards assume that's how things have to be, that was Hermione's point which Ron aptly proved. Elves aren't bred (nor suggested to have been) and they aren't magical creatures. They're categorized (legally) as "beings", just like wizards. In canon, Dobby had no ill effects to being freed. Winky even makes clear that all that would happen is Dobby would have ended up in front of the Elf Liason (because elves going around asking for payment is deemed bad by society). Yes, I'm aware you aren't saying it's canon, but they end up rewriting parts of canon to make this work so it seems like they just like the idea. Anyway, the bit of me you quoted was more about the fact that it's not even mentioned. If it were that simple, she wouldn't (as I so often see) be completely unaware that purebloods believed bonding was necessary for them to live.

This is where the stupidity of this trope is evident. You complain that it would otherwise be moral crusader-y wank, but there's no middle ground here. The whole point of this trope is to make it OK to have a slave, but all they really does is end up in this weird moral relativism that most people want to avoid, but to try and avoid it they make their story universes transparently shoddy. Like it's literally "We have to keep the slaves or the slaves will die!" That's far stupider than "owning slaves is bad."

This simple solution is to just ditch the bonding crap and just offer them a job. But half of these end up flipping Dobby away from wanting wages so it goes to the slavery thing again. It's just a consequence of inconsistent desires for a story. The MC must be morally top tier and high class, thus need a house-elf. But having nearly total control of another sentient being's actions is extremely creepy, so the conflict is deep.

It comes down one of two options:

- Elves are not biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now good characters are morally obligated to fight that slavery, therefore the story must be sidelined to deal with the slavery, or they're not morally consistent characters.

- Elves are biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now the reader is upset because it's just "an excuse to allow slavery."

Like how it's completely believable for Hermoine to ignore any evidence contrary to her position, your purpose here seems to be to find excuses to validate yours and ignore any argument in which literature can offend your sensibilities without being morally repugnant or "inconsistent." It's a fictional world with fictional rules that exists /only/ for the purpose of telling an interesting story. If that means elves have to be bonded for the sake of telling that story, there's nothing wrong with that. Because elves don't come to life by being written and literature doesn't exist to serve your sensibilities.

But it's not. That behavior is OOC. If anything, Hermione would voice that "I can't believe wizards have perpetrated the idea that elves have to be bonded to live". Mockery of a norm she despises is much more in character. She didn't ignore the existence of the /Tales of Beedle and the Bard/ to dismiss the existence of the Hallows, she tried to discredit the idea and evidence that suggested they didn't exist ("Wouldn't Dumbledore have told you?" Etc.)

But really, you keep mistating my point. I took issue in my OP with people trying to pass off the idea that Hermione hadn't even read that elves had to be bonded. If the issue were so simple she would know because purebloods would have mentioned it in passing.

You are confusing me taking issue with story logic with moral condemnation. People can write these, but they end up in such tortured logic that it seems too silly to bother with. Need a good, rich MC with an elf? The elf works for him. Bam, solved; they have a magic Butler instead of magic serf. Most of them don't need the bonding for anything more than that, it's just a status thing in-universe.

No, it's the /readers/ who demand it. For the sake of "consistency" and "internal logic," which cannot be resolved unless the slavery issue is addressed in the precise way the reader believes their real-world morality should be reflected in a fictional world.

I don't see that. I certainly don't think "Ah, there's a problem of Harry has to solve it." I mean, goblins aren't allow wands but that doesn't mean it needs to be focused on. That's just part of the world and may get changed. We know he has something rather more important in the books.

You really are misunderstanding. The stories I'm referencing essentially say this. Elves have to be bonded. This is an obvious fact in-story. Hermione, despite reading and knowing damn near everything, does not know this. She gets informed that they need the bond, and thus accepts it. It's a story logic gap. If it were obvious in one's story, there's no need to have this weird misunderstanding on her part. It's not presented as her ignoring contrary information, the idea is usually she just didn't know it

It'd be like "Actually Dumbledore, Horcruxes can be destroyed by shitting on them when the planets aline and you have a bucket of selkie intestines balanced on your head. Did you /really/ not read /The Guide to Destroying Horcruxes/ by Jesus Christ???"

The authors obviously accept that elves are in a rough spot and intentionally tell us why it's ok. But it's much ado about nothing if there's a simple alternative that doesn't leave the MC with "I need the slaves and they need me".

It is possible that it some things are passed down as norm through the culture and not is not written down. I'm pretty sure even in our everyday lives we do things because that is how society dictates it and it isn't written down somewhere.

Is the simple alternative it is a job? That leaves a few questions to be answered, such as why don't the house elves just leave, or why they are scared to leave. You're referencing a specific story so I don't know where it starts, but if it starts after Winky, it would need some sort of reason why Winky went full crazy for being fired, and why it would be so hard for Dobby to find job for pay.

The bond trope is definitely a easier explanation than any alternatives out there atm. Part of it has to do with it being so well established.

What? My point wasn't that all elves should be rewritten to be workers. It's that if you want you're MC to be believably good yet have an elf around, the bond thing is the most contrived way of doing so. Just have the MC offer an elf a job. The problem with dobby was that other wizards did not think elves should be paid. That's exactly the problem, elves don't need a bond, wizards demonstrably just view them as inferior so don't like it. Dobby was obviously surviving without a "bond". Winky didn't go down hill because she lacked a bond, but because she was ashamed of having been freed, especially so publilcally. This is in GoF, Dobby says it outright. The bond is established fanon, but it's contrived and unnecessary for what it's intended to do.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Possible, or at the same time it just doesn't.

To play it out, let's say the book does summarize about it, the MC hires an elf and Hermione goes ahead and tries to free them all. Now you need a back story to how they hired the elf and some sort of society for elves. If it happens off screen, that is lazy because it plays against the norm. If it happens on screen, you have to make sure you're filling up every plot hole you just opened up. That's a lot of extra work if it isn't a major or minor issue of the story.

If the book doesn't summarize it and you want to make it a hire and not slavery, same problem as above.

If the book doesn't summarize about it because it just is something everyone knows but doesn't write down and it is a lighter MC with the story not focused about house elves, now you need a way to make the MC owning a house elf morally justified without it being a hire.

#+begin_quote

We don't know if it mentions their treasure, just rebellions. For all we know, the books don't mention what goblins consider treasure.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Honestly, this isn't the simpler alternatives because it creates issues. I'm not saying you shouldn't use it as the alternative, just that it isn't simpler. By hiring an elf, you need to create a backstory, that's just how it works. I haven't read a fic where it was as simple as 'MC hires elves no questions how' because why else would there be house-elf slaves.

#+begin_quote
  Dobby was obviously surviving without a "bond".
#+end_quote

Can we at least agree that Dobby is definitely an outlier of an house elf. Sure he was surviving, but how do we know that without the bond, a house elf won't go crazy? Winky could be used as a demonstration for either way to be honest. Without the bond, her being ashamed could have been magnified and she went off tilt for all we know. A majority of the elves we see in canon tend to be a little crazed. The fact is a majority of the elves that we know of (Hogwart's elves) do not want to be freed and there has to be some reason for that. I think there is a very good chance they were brainwashed into being enslaved, but that doesn't mean the trope isn't a different possible reason.

Yes the bond is established fanon, but not it is not unnecessary or contrived for what it's intended to do. It is intended to be a extremely simple way to morally justify an MC having a house elf without creating a backstory or plot holes.

ETA:

Meant to ask, where are you going with the spell enslavement reason. If that is why house elves are slaves and you want your MC to hire an elf, still need a backstory of how you're getting elves that can be hired in the first place which can create issues.

Morally top tier MC's are for the lighter fanfics. The trope is evident even in grey/darker MC fics. I don't read the trope as explaining that slavery is good, it's just used as a way of explaining why house elves don't want to be free. Sure it could be brainwashing, but if it isn't a major focus of the story, it's a decent trope to use as a throwaway explanation.

For the high class part, it's been stated that house elves usually are part of old manors, castles, etc that type of stuff. It makes sense that house elves are for the high class.

You know this is BS. Elves almost cannot disobey. Magic forces them to physically comply unless they find a loophole in the order, and if they fail they're forced to hurt themselves (or have been so thoroughly brainwashed that they do so). That's not even comparable to what you mentioned.

Fair enough, but then it becomes where would you get the house elves? Do they have a community that you can go to so that you could hire one? If you're saying just use a throwaway "oh I hired the elf" that doesn't do anything for the story except make it so the morality of the MC isn't questionable, which is what the trope does the exact same of, with more open ended questions.

...Erm, yes? This is an odd complaint. That aside, it's not even pertinent to my post. These stories simply use such a contrived method to make owning someone OK (so the elf can be nearby) when there are simpler solutions that also exist in canon (i.e. hiring an elf). It's just silly and is used in a way that creates numerous gaps in the logic of the story.

The being addressed by surname thing is.a stupid complaint on the part of those who make it. I mean, teachers do it all the time, even in HP, so it doesn't even sense for them to make some kind of appeal to equality...
