I recently had an idea float through my brain, and was wondering if anyone knew of any fics that fit the bill.

[The Idea] The horcrux in Harry's head is not idle, but instead is fully sentient aware of its existence. However, it is not like Voldemort despite being part of his soul. Instead being a companion and ally to harry throughout his life. Sometimes behaving in a somewhat more malevolent manner due to its origins, but nevertheless loyal to Harry.

The reasoning for this is in four parts.

1. Voldemort never intended to make the Horcrux, and as such it is not immersed in the same type of magic as the others.

2. Being unintentional, the horcrux would have none of Voldemort's memories, or abilities. Instead it would simply have the same affinities for magic that Tom had, still needing to learn and essentially being a blank slate.

3. At the moment just before Voldemort cast the curse, he was thinking of his childhood. About the orphanage and how he hated the children's cries. As such, the horcrux would be fairly juvenile in nature, both due to the fact that Voldemort was thinking about his childhood, and because he would have wanted to seperate himself from that time of his life resulting in it separating in a very literal fashion. This juvenile nature would let it mature and grow in a different way to Tom himself.

4. Growing and developing in close proximity to Harry would alter the way the Horcrux developed, causing it to be able to see things from Harry's perspective, as well as having the remnants of Lilly's magic introducing it directly to the concept of love, even if it is in only a very distant fashion. I believe this would be the most important part, as Tom riddle never had even the most fleeting experience of love, not even having been concieved out of love, or even lust. Instead by manipulation, something that without doubt had magical significance.

I am not expecting there to be a fic where a bit of Voldemort's soul is all chummy with Gryffindor, or even mostly pleasant. But instead I expect it to be somewhat darker in nature, if anyone has ever read "cage and key" by Faromir, then something like "The entity" would be ideal. Although less evil. In general I expect that Harry would be influenced by this, being more manipulative, more willing to wield darker powers, and more level headed (Tom was known for his cool demeanor), in general I expect it to go as you might expect to go, but with the main difference being that the horcrux would be good in the end, rather than evil.

I know I am asking alot, but if anyone has ever read anything even vaguely similar to what I have described, please tell me about it.
