I don't recall how, but I recently came up with the idea of Hermione and Lavender putting aside their differences and becoming friendlier with one another and I've come to love the idea. Lavender playing with Hermione's wild hair, placing bows or flowers in it, showing her that it's okay to be girly. She could lift Hermione's moody spirits, just as Hermione could ground her gigglyness. Plus, if canon is any indication, Hermione could use another female friend in her life. I think they'd be good for each other. I haven't decided if I'm making a request or a prompt, but I suppose it cold be both.


** One of the things that pleasantly surprised me about Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived was the friendship that eventually developed between Hermione and her roommates. (Sorry I can't link right now)

*** Oh yes, the “Won Won” episode is hilarious in this fic.

Sophie Roper is her roommate too and rather well developed. Another OC Euterpe is one interesting character too.

[[/spoiler][Lavender died a heroic death in the Final Battle, and Hermione decided to name her daughter “Rose Lavender”.]]

**** I've read most of the other works in the universe and get less out of them since I am not a Buffy Fan (Though I am familiar with the World of Alex Mac--yay growing up in the 90s) . I am still holding out hope for the sequel.

** 1. I am really a big fan of post-War Lavender in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=northumbrian&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=Lavender+Brown&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc&commit=Search][stories by Northumbrian]], so I a way prefer Lavender actually surviving the Battle of Hogwarts (yes, I know there is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Lavender_Brown/Archive_1][the endless discussion]] on whether she actually did survive or not), although she is severely traumatized from it.
2. I think there must be some relationship between Hermione and Lavender with Paravati: you don't for six years with somebody in one room and hate them all the time, besides, that charm throwing Fenrir Greyback over whole hallway had A LOT of intent behind, it didn't like from somebody who has no positive feeling about Lavender. Of course, we know nothing about that relationship because all books are only from the Harry's point of view (and we also know nothing about Hermione/Ginny relationship).

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
