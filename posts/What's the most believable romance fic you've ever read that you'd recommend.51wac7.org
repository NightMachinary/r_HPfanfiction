** linkffn(Grow Young With Me)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

linkffn(Contemplating Clouds)

To me romance is best when people meet and become friends and let it grow. I'm usually put off by the dramedy formula for people not realizing they like each other which is too common even in fanfics.

**** The pairing is Harry/OC. The OC is my favorite or 2nd favorite, competing with Abby from Grow Young with Me.

HP & BWL is about Harry having a twin Nathan who is the boy-who-lived. I mean the actual BWL not the wrong-BWL idiocy. Harry in this fic is a tier 1 wizard. Like a young Dumbledore or Tom Riddle or Grindlewald. The story is about him, exploring a new environment and with new characters, and an expansion of canon magic.

  What happens during the year after the battle ends? Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco pick up the pieces left behind in the post-war Wizarding World-a world where they are adults and Voldemort is gone in body but not in spirit... This is *mostly* based off of book canon and what JK Rowling has said in interviews. Rated M for some lemon-y scenes.

  Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy seek each other out in the dead of the night at Hogwarts during sixth year for some quiet respite from the drama unfolding in their lives leading to a secret relationship between the two. Full of Dark Marks, grief, teenage angst awkwardness. Arts by the lovely FreyaIshtar!
