Hey HP writers, I hope this is within bounds -- I posted something similar in [[/r/Fanfiction]].

I'm heading up a fiction imprint called Back Hall Press, and I'm looking for new authors and manuscripts. The whole project is driven by a love of fandom and the belief that fanfiction is a treasure trove of untapped talent waiting to explode. So here I am, creeping around the internet hoping to recruit some dope new writers who want to get published.

Back Hall Press is also highly invested in diversity and inclusivity. You can read more about our mission and values on the website, backhallpress.com.

I'm looking for both A) original works from fanfic writers looking to crossover, and B) AU or otherwise convertible fanfic works to scrub the serial numbers off of. Yes, the 50 Shades model, if you will.

Now that I'm running this thing and receiving manuscripts from all over the place, I'm more amazed than ever by the quality I've become used to finding in fanfiction. Like, goddamn! If only the average manuscript submission were as good as the 120,000 word fics I find by sorting by kudos on Ao3.

Anyway, I hope it's cool to post this here. I'd be thrilled to chat with any and all of you! Hope you check out the site, ask questions and say hi.

What do you mean by this exactly? Considering your website also just makes a mention and doesn't go in further detail, I'm suspicious you're just using them as buzzwords to attract your target audience.

*** Nope, but I respect your suspicions. I wrote that copy and it is aimed more toward writers than readers. It just means we hope to support and promote diversity in the writers and content we publish and will be looking for ways to actively court, for example, submissions from writers of color, or stories representing GLBTQ relationships, or working class women, etc. etc.. Not intended as a radical or buzzy message, but I admit it means little until we prove we mean it!

**** I want you to clarify something, how exactly will your company get a good reputation if you're admitting you're not really looking for what's best? How will people feel when you contact them, and then find out that they were picked for their race/sexuality instead of the quality of their writing?

It's funny because you're acting like the publishing industry is prejudiced against fanfiction writers, when we have The Mortal Instruments and Thirty Shades of Grey being best-sellers, and J.K. Rowling (which according to your definition is "diverse" for being a working class woman, somehow) being one of the richest writers in the world.

As I said, it does look like you're just using buzzwords to capture the attention of clueless fanfiction writers for some dastardly reason. I don't think people will fall for it.

***** This is the first time I've gotten this response, and I'll be thinking about it. But we are not "picking" any manuscripts based on anything other than quality. We don't do memoirs, so there's no real benefit to us contracting a manuscript based on the author's identity.

The bottom line is that we hope to see a diverse array of submissions from a diverse array of authors. Don't see anything wrong with that. Although FWIW, those aren't exactly the kinds of company values known for making dollar signs appear in the eyes of investors, so let's not get the motives twisted here.

I get that you're not buying it, though. That's cool. I will say that I don't think fanfiction writers are clueless, and I don't really expect them to fall for anything. Again, nothing we say means anything until we prove it, so only time will tell.

** This is a very interesting idea and after reading over the sister post on [[/r/Fanfiction]] I can see the value that you might add for the authors (over and above simply choosing to self-publish).

Of course it means little to me, I don't have any significant original works and my fanfiction is very closely tied to the fandom worlds to the point where attempting to decouple it would be both futile and damaging to the story in question. That said, one thing I see a lot of while perusing the various fanfiction sites is people looking to get into writing original fiction that they can actually publish. It in no way surprises me that you have been receiving a lot of manuscripts, after 50 Shades there has been a very real interest in making the jump and if this gains traction in the larger fanfiction communities I can see you getting swamped.

I wonder how discerning you are intending to be. Your site says you do not discriminate between the various genres of fanfiction, and that is to the good, but just how good do you think a story has to be to see any real success in the dog-eat-dog world of real publishing? It seems to me that in many ways quality isn't all that important, in truth. Instead it's about some kind of x-factor, or simply momentum. 50 Shades did well because the fanfiction community gave it the kick-start needed to gain visibility among the thousands of books published each week. Will you be reliant on that same mechanism for the works you publish, or do you have other plans on how to promote the stories you end up publishing?

Basically, are you going to be aiming for quantity or quality? Are you going to publish all the books that reach certain standards and simply hope that one or two make it big or are you going to focus effort on a few stories that you think are exceptional?

*** So, this is basically about me, because I'm the sole captain of acquisitions. And here's the thing: I am a writer first, and a reader. I am not a publishing executive. The entire reason this press came about was because I had a great relationship with a publisher I work with, and we had a lot of conversations over drinks about my self-published fiction, my thoughts on things like 50 Shades, and my obsession with the world of fanfiction.

I had never once considered starting an imprint until my publisher started bouncing the idea around. I was just someone who had read some fucking mindblowing fanfiction and couldn't shut up about it.

So my point is, I want to publish that mindblowing fanfiction. I don't know if it will make lots of money or not. I certainly have to hope so. But ultimately it just drives me insane to compare my favorite fanfics to the manuscripts I've seen behind the scenes while working as a freelance writer and editor.

I mean so much fanfiction is just so fucking good. And I love fannish communities and all the different subcultures, and I would just be thrilled to see all this talent and uniqueness kind of break into publishing and claim a space.

With all that said, we do have to also consider quantity at the beginning. Not only because we're brand new and I have a quota to meet, but because we're not yet getting nearly swamped enough by submissions. The more submissions I get the pickier I hope to be.

I like cult hits and niche stuff. I know good, weird books can succeed. Maybe not on the 50 Shades scale, but enough to be worth publishing. I would much rather focus on exceptional stories than throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. That's been something I've stressed throughout the development of this idea, so we'll see how much I get yelled at for it in time, haha.

** The other post is really informative! It'd be great to have that information more readily available somewhere on your site. I don't have a manuscript yet, but your imprint's mission is exciting and I hope your first releases do well. I've planned to convert one of my fics--but in a total rewrite, almost as if I'm writing an AU of it, keeping only the character shells and beats. Fic's been a great outlet to go nuts with story lines; it's a very first draft-y process for me.

Some general questions: When querying and submitting to presses, those that don't look for fic authors specifically, is there a particular way we should sell these manuscripts? Especially if the fic is popular with a sizable readership (and what would they find sizable?). What about a social media presence? I've gotten really lucky with building an audience and I wonder if it's anything that can give an edge in proving my story has a market.

I've heard these converted-fic stories are a hot new thing, but it still feels like there's a stigma attached to them. What's the general feeling in the industry right now? Also, all of the ones I've heard of seem to be Twilight/50 Shades-esque. Are they just scouting for that type specifically? In any case, I'm glad your imprint is looking specifically for offbeat titles. Fandom excels most at telling stories outside of the mainstream.

Also interested in how you plan to market these stories, but Steelbadger asked it better.

*** Hi! Thanks for that feedback -- there's an FAQ in the works and I was wondering if I should incorporate that topic. :)

A lot of people do that kind of rewrite with their fics! I see a lot of people turning their Twilight AUs into significantly reworked New Adult romances. As a writer I love hearing fanfic authors talk about the things it's helped them develop. It's such an interesting way to play and grow as a writer.

To answer your questions, which I love: The general feeling in the industry regarding popular fanfiction is intense hunger combined with total bafflement. I think fanfiction is better understood by authors, at this point, and maybe agents, than it is by the editors and execs in charge of founding new imprints and approving new categories and such.

I don't know why exactly so many of the conversions seem to be Twilight/50 Shades-esque. There are a few possible reasons. One is that romance is a really dependable genre, and Twilight/50 Shades themes are undeniably popular with readers right now, so these books seem like a safe bet. Another could be -- and this could be a totally meaningless coincidence I've observed -- that Twilight fanfic writers seem to convert and submit their fics more? I've had by far more queries from Twilight fans than any other fandom.

When querying and submitting to presses: If you've written a hit fanfic and have numbers to show for it (likes, shares, reviews, whatever), the best thing you can do is convert it, write a sequel, and pitch a series. Publishers love series, and that feels like a sure thing to them because they can assume a good portion of the first book's fans will likely buy the next -- sales in the bag.

As for just taking that popular fanfic, converting it, and selling that, you would definitely want to tell whomever you're pitching that it was previously published as fanfic. If you've got good numbers, definitely tell them. Some agents/publishers will be eager to jump on this (though they'll almost definitely ask if there's a sequel in the works). Some won't see the point. They'll think "What if everyone who'd buy this has already read it for free?" (That could be another reason Twilight fics are often converted -- they can become mainstream romances easily, and that's a vast audience. Something more niche would be like, "Will enough more people pay for this offbeat story?")

But numbers are always helpful, ESPECIALLY social media numbers. Social media savvy authors can sell a lot of books, and publishers now expect a lot of the promotional work to fall on authors, unfortunately. Budgets for PR and marketing have shruuuuuuunk because bosses are like "JUST LEARN TO USE TWITTER." So. Yes. Building an audience will definitely give you an edge in many cases.

On that note, how we plan to market these stories: I'm not gonna blow your mind with this, but social media is a big deal for us. This is an indie press, so by nature and necessity we're really pushing multi-platform exposure, building a presence on Tumblr and Twitter, and promoting word of mouth through popular book bloggers and reviewers (particularly on Goodreads). Because we're pursuing some fairly niche categories rather than like, idk, HuffPo readers, we will be targeting audiences and influencers according to the title/genre. For example, a certain type of hungry M/M Romance fans congregate en masse in a Goodreads group and on Facebook, while specifically fans of New Adult-ish M/M are all about Tumblr and Twitter. Along with that we will be sending out press releases to online news outlets and blogs covering fandom, fiction trends, etc.

Did I miss anything? Stigma! Yes. There is a stigma. A lot of people still don't get it. People who haven't actually spent time browsing fanfiction don't understand the quality that's out there. I think 50 Shades has made this a little worse in a way, because people assume its success means "fanfiction people" consider it the cream of the crop. So they think it's more likely to yield a commercially viable novelty than a high quality novel. Which could not be farther from the truth.

Sorry this got so long but thank you for the great questions!

**** Thanks for the detailed answer!

It seems like ebooks are popular for only a few genres, primarily romance-themed ones, and maybe it's because I've never read digital-only books, but they don't seem well-known otherwise. Intuitively, fanfic readers and ebook readers don't seem like overlapping audiences either -- fanfiction and genre fiction fulfill a similar binge-reading need and the former's audience already has a wealth of free content. On the other hand, I think fic readers are more likely to support an author they like, but that requires preexisting popularity on the author's part. Fandoms are becoming very mainstream though, and I've been curious about how publishers and other content gatekeepers will try to monetize the fan material coming out. There's been buzz here and there, wattpad-like sites and such, but no one's been consistently successful yet. Good luck to you and what authors you find! :)

** As far as I know Anne Walsh is looking to get her originals published. She wrote the HP au known as the Dangerverse.

I can't speak for her though, so I'll refer you to her site ([[http://www.annebwalsh.com][www.annebwalsh.com]])
