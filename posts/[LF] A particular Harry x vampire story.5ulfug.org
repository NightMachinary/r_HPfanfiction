Looking for a Harry x vampire story I read a while back. She finds him by accident, he offers her his blood. She becomes his Hogwarts dada teacher. They go to Japan later. Please help!

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!
