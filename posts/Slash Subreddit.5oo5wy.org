After some suggestions to start a subreddit dedicated to slash pairings, I have started one! It is [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. To be more inclusive, this sub will be for any LGBT pairings in Harry Potter fic, not just male slash.

I really know nothing about running a sub so I would love some advice (especially about adding a theme) from any experienced mods.

Also, if any of the active slash-shippers on this sub would like to be mods, let me know! And of course, even if you don't want to mod, you should subscribe! It would be great if we could be at least as active of a sub as [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] or [[/r/hpharmony][r/hpharmony]].


** Hi, I'm the mod of [[/r/marvelfans]], which I started because the main Marvel subreddits weren't very friendly to fanfiction, let alone slash. We're quiet, but still trucking along almost a year and a half later. You have to be prepared to do a lot of posting yourself, though.

Feel free to advertise your subreddit at [[/r/marvelfans]], and I'd also suggest you contact the mods of [[/r/fanfiction]] and [[/r/fandomnatural]] to see if they'd be willing to let you advertise.

** Gotta be honest, it's not a good idea. Neither [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] or [[/r/harmony][r/harmony]] could be considered active, and there's a reason for that. The HP fanfiction community off of FF.net is really tiny. Individual forums and subreddits just don't make sense anymore, besides for places like SIYE or DLP which have independently developed their communities for over a decade each.

I'm not shitting on the idea because I don't like slash (hell, I'm bisexual), I just highly doubt it'll work out. When you take an already small community and start dividing it (especially along LBGT lines on Reddit, which is dominated by mostly straight males), it just hurts the community overall.

Someone on this sub once described the HP fanfiction community as Detroit. Once it was gigantic and filled with people. Now we've got a bunch of burned out houses, a much smaller population, and we're basically huddled in the city center just to keep the lights on.

More power to you if you can make it work, but I'll be harsh and bet 10-1 odds there are less than 5 active posters in a month, it'll likely be completely dead in 6 months.

*** Ahh well honestly I think you're probably right. I'm just sick of every post saying "I'm looking for xyz, no slash." And getting downvoted for posting a slash rec on general threads like "what's the best fic you read this year." And Ao3, the main place for slash fic to be posted these days, doesn't have forums.

If it fails, it's really nbd because it's not like I put much effort into it. It only takes about 5 min to set up a sub.

Also I see a lot of hate on slash just for writing quality which is crazy to me. There is terrible writing in every ship and so much slash is really really well written (esp. in the Drarry ship bc its the most common). When people say that I feel like it's because they haven't really read much slash.

****** Yeah, this. I'm honestly a little sad I don't like Drarry just because the quality of the fics can be so high. I know multiple authors whose origific has been on the NYT bestseller list who write (or wrote) Drarry fic. Luckily, I've shared other ships with some of them.

Exactly. It doesn't bother me if straight guys dislike slash, but it does bother me if they bash it just because they read a couple horrible fics once upon a time. So, you had bad luck, doesn't mean the whole genre sucks!

I think [[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/men-are-sabotaging-the-online-reviews-of-tv-shows-aimed-at-women/][some people]] also just can't accept that certain things aren't written for them, and that's okay and doesn't mean it sucks, it just means it's not for them.

***** I think it's probably just because reddit fandom has a much higher proportion of straight cis men than most other fanfiction communities, and slash fans are typically LGBT men and straight and LGBT women. There was a survey of AO3's userbase a couple years ago that found more people who identified as genderqueer than cis male, for example.

I wish non-slash fans would feel less compelled to shit on slash fics (and fans, too, for that matter), but then, there's plenty of "ew, het" people in slash fandom, too, so I guess it goes both ways. Personally, I like both. And gen and femslash and poly, so I get to read the best of everything. :D

****** I really wish that people here weren't so against lgbt relationships in fics, saying that it's out of character for those characters to be lgbt, when I've found plenty of content here that I don't understand - people request out of character (superpowered) Harry penty, as well as harems, which is ??? to me.

M/M and F/F fics are as good as any others in any fandom; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][Sturgeon's Law]] applies in all cases. I understand why some people don't want to read slash - if I find a story with a summary that says "rated M for yaoiz!" I know that the author can't write an lgbt relationship respectfully (and they don't understand what yaoi is). Some lgbt readers (myself included) don't want to read a story with Bad Tropes.

I find that a lot of "ew het" people in slash fandom are straight girls who aren't fans of women and are fans of fetishizing gay men.

Lucky you, I dislike romance on principle. So I have gen which can be annoyingly hard to find. I can only filter out romance and hope because it's almost never labeled, you kinda just have to hope no pairing shows up.

There was a community on LJ that focused on HP gen fic and art and had some pretty good stuff. It's been dead for years now, but you might be able to find something there that's interesting.

****** It's also because a high percentage of slash fics have Harry paired with either Draco or Snape, and most people don't like them. Not to mention the Sirius and Remus fics with the crappy pup and werewolf instincts. Although to be fair, the pup and cub crap happens a lot when either of those two are involved, whether it's slash or not.

That's the part that a lot of the slash haters don't seem to get - yes, there's tons of dreadful slash, but it's not uniquely awful, or even worse on average. I dislike Drarry and Snarry myself, but fics for ships like Draco/Hermione and Snape/Hermione rely on pretty much the same tropes and are, imo, as bad or worse in quality. For another example, harem fics seem super popular here and really, which aspect of Harry's interactions with either Cho or Ginny made him seem like the kind of guy who'd be capable of attracting or keeping a harem? Making him gay or bi is no more fundamental a change to canon than that! In fact, I'd argue that there's /more/ canon evidence supporting the interpretation that he's bi than that he'd be the type of guy to have a harem. :P

Personally, I've always wished Harry/Neville had taken off more, of the younger generation. In the older generation, I ship Remus/Sirius, but I (mostly) left the fandom before A/B/O got popular so I didn't have to deal with much of the pup and cub stuff you're talking about.

******** For what it's worth, I would read a Dramione or SSHG fic as soon as I would read a Drarry or Snarry fic - which is to say probably never. Draco and Snape are just so unpleasant in canon that glorifying them or pairing them with the main character (no matter how well-written the fic is) just doesn't sit well with me.

***** There was a comment a while ago who said they basically just didn't like romance-centric plots, and stories with slash tended to be /about/ the slash. And, they had a point on that one.

And I can understand preferring to read action, or mystery, instead of romance. But they didn't want to say no pairings, because there are a lot of het stories where the relationship is just background.

***** As someone who has no problem with lgbtq and even helps organize protests against homo and transphobia but still does not like to see slash fics recced here i will explain. It all boil down to slash overload and peronal preferance. On sites like ffn.net i feel like it is a pain to sort through 2 slash fics for every cis fic, and over years of doing it it becomes a pain in the ass. So when we se a slash fic in a thread specificly made to find a cis fic it pisses us off because it feels like you are wasting our time, thus downvote.

** Ive noticed a few comments on this thread talking about slash being hated or down voted. I personally don't down vote slash unless its recommended in a request thread that clearly says no slash. And I dont discount that there are high quality and amazing slash fics out there.

Now for starters.... I am a guy.

I have zero interest in "M/M Slash" myself and don't like to read it and for whatever reason it bothers me some. Let me be clear though, I don't mean I am anti-LGBT... and in fact have several very good gay and lesbian friends. Personal choice is personal choice and i respect that, and a person is still a person. I just don't have an interest in reading about it and don't like the idea of it. When I read a story I am immersing myself within the story and feel connected with it and so such a relationship makes me uncomfortable as it pertains to myself. Its hard to explain but it is what it is.

Now... perhaps typical to a guy, I do not have an issue with lesbian relationships within fiction. This is likely for 2 reasons. One... because as a male it is easier to separate my mind from it somehow when reading and immersing myself within the story. And two, because as a guy its kinda hot. I know I know...

Point is... I would NOT AT ALL be surprised if there are many many other readers out there like me. People who probably don't have an issue with slash or specifically male slash itself as a concept, but simply have no desire whatsoever to read it or see it on a recommendation thread that requests no slash.

In addition OP... if the demand for slash is not here, it likely wont show up on a new subreddit. This community is pretty damn open and tame and relaxed about such things compared to MANY of the other fan fiction communities. Dont stress about the few down vote trolls, and remember that sometimes the down votes are for a legitimate reason, such as a recommended slash fic on a thread that specifically requested no slash.
