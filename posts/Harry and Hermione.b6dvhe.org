I usually dont like this pairing because its usually involves a harem or weasley bashing but I found a really good one that is making me reconsider these type of fics. Any well written ones over 100k words would be appreciated.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Harry/Hermione without bashing or harems? I can do that! Here's some of my favorites off the top of my head in no particular order.

- /Coming Back Late/ by alchymie. Totally awesome fic. Deathly Hallows and politics and wonderful characterization. Sadly, it's been abandonded, but there's enough present to provide an exciting read, the story's climax, and a good bit of the resolution. Several points are left hanging, but what'cha gonna do? One of the best HHr fics ever written IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- /Time in the Fire/ by Odment Tweak. This might be my all-time favorite fic. It's not perfect, but it knows how to hit you right in the feels. It's a time-travel fic with a twist. I've probably read this one 50 times. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- /Resistence/ by lorien829, or really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][loriend829]] for that matter. She's got several wonderful fics that are all worth reading, this is just my favorite of the bunch. It was written before Deathly Hallows - so there's some differences there. It's from Hermione's perspective in a world where Voldemort won the last battle, and it follows how the surviving good guys continue the fight. It's pretty awesome. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Notebooks and Letters/ by chemprof. This is the fic that got me interested in the HHr pairing years ago. The premise is that the published HP books are an embelished telling of the events that really took place. Hermione sits down with her daughter and gives her the real story through reading her old diaries and letters. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione. Written before Deathly Hallows, so again, some differences there. The author is excellent and her characters are spot on. She also adds some new and very imaginative elements to the HP world. She also plays with the soul bond and love potion tropes in a way that is incredibly creative - it's the only time I can think of that they've been done well. Excellent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- /Returning to the Start/ by timunderwood9. A time travel fic wherein Harry goes back in time and Takes Care Of Business in a somewhat believable manner. Bonus points for him not getting into a creepy relationship with Hermione while she's 13 and he's mentally 30. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Origingally published on the now defunct Portkey.org, this fic adds some changes to year 5. Because of some tricky magic with unintended consequences, Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's. It's a great story. I remember following it as it was being published and the excitement that came with each new update. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- Finally, if you're looking for something on the lighter and/or funnier side of things, check out what [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876][kyc639]] published back in the day - again originally on Portkey.org but now archived. He wrote Harry with a great, sarcastic sense of humor. Well worth checking out. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876]]

- And then of course there's my humble addition to the fandom: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) It doesn't really stand with the above fics, but I'm adding it anyways.

Enjoy!

*** I really tried to get into Notebooks and Letters, but ultimately I just found it to be canon with Hermione substituted for Ginny. With a certain amount of canon-bashing for promoting Harry-Ginny. Those who are strongly committed to Harmony already would probably like it, but for me it lacked any real hook. I like some stories /with/ Harmony, but not specifically /because/ of it.

**** Fair enough. As you said, /Notebooks and Letters/ is definitely a HHr story, not a story with HHr in it. It's been a while since I've read it, but I don't think I'd call what's going on in the story "canon-bashing." Rather, I think the author is trying to tell a more realistic story. It's certainly not a perfect fic by any stretch of the imagination.

Interestingly, If you read chemprof's early stories in chronological order, you can literally almost see his development as an author from a Harry/Ginny shipper into a Harry/Hermione supporter. It's neat to see that mental process play out on the page, as it were.

Anyways, of the fics I linked, both /Notebooks and Letters/ and /Time is the Fire/ are definitely more focused on the relationship, while I'd say the others are more plot-driven with the pairing as a secondary concern.

***** If you're curious, my own view is that H/Hr could be considered aspirational. Canon!Harry with canon!Hermione would not work, but if you improve one or both of them a bit, maybe put them through some life experiences that would shape them for the better, then it might. If Harry paid more attention to his friends' problems and tried to help them more (canon!Harry really doesn't do this). If Hermione would really listen and consider others' points of view before judging and speaking. If Harry swallowed his pride more often to take good advice. If Hermione learned to laugh more.

With that being my view, I'm not really sympathetic to the idea that Hermione was robbed and should have been the canon ship all along, which is pretty much what Notebooks and Letters is about. But it's perfectly reasonable to me that fics which adjust characters' personalities can do great things with H/Hr. So a transition from writing Harry/Ginny (more like canon) to H/Hr (branching out) makes sense.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I am usually more for Hinny, but linkffn(11916243) and its semi-sequel linkffn(12373273) made me reconsider. Just mild and compassionate Weasley bashing.
