  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle.

Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** My favorite recently is a next gen series, starting with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). The author is on the last book, the seventh book of the series. There is so much to read because of that--all six years! The one drawback is I think the first book is way too slow and plodding; however, it gets much better later on.

But, as someone who has been learning Japanese for quite a while, it's pretty spot on - he's not just saying things are kawaii every other paragraph or something like that.

****** I mean I'm rather familiar with the language, but I don't know it. I picked things up here and there and I can recognize enough stuff that I've been able to watch an episode of an anime without looking and mostly get an idea of what's going on. I don't mind random bits of japanese even, but there's certain key words I see being thrown around in chapter 1 that are the ones that don't really impress much (basically words like kawaii and kakoii being used along with english as opposed to entire phrases). It also doesn't help that the oyabun is apparently named Musashi Miyamoto of all things and I still don't quite get why he was in England. It just comes off a bit awkward or maybe I'm just holding things to high standards still after reading PotDK

******* I'm not sure what PotDK is. Prince of the Dark Kingdom? If it is, then it might just be the different styles holding you up. Both authors do (in my opinion) a good amount of world-building, but their actual writing styles are just...different? I don't how else to describe it. The only thing I didn't like about 893 is more of a criticism of fanon in general, where people act as if Hermione never interacted with anyone within 10 years of her age as opposed to not having many (or any) friends.

**** Blindness comes off as a lot more wholesome. While on the one hand it unfortunately turns into Super Harry (with a weakness to be fair), it just makes magic seem so beautiful and magical that it draws you in even during those parts, despite that fact. I think what happened to Hermoine was interesting too.

For other or no pairings, I just remembered The Green Girl, Sympathetic Properties, and Renegade. And, to top it all off, there's the Dangerverse . Geez, given how much I love to read, it's a miracle that I've accomplished anything.

** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). I re-read it recently, and it's insanely good. Great, great dramatic writing by the author - she really makes you /feel/ what the characters feel, and that's what I LOVE about the writing in this fic. It does have some angsty stuff, but it never becomes bathos or Narmy at any point.

Oh, and the Alexandra Quick series is unbelievably good. If you can get past the first book.
