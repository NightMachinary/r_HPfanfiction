I would love to know what are your favorite Marauders fics, that you think are well written and the characters behave realistically (no like calling McGonnagal Minnie and other silly things like that).

Would really value if it is in audio form (podfic) but I accept all recs! Thank you x


** so this one is from a different angle, mostly looking at Regulus, from an older Sirius' POV, but I found it to be extremely credible.

Regulus in this is a precious bean but not in the ways it's usually presented. poor kid.

Though if you're a snape fan or overly armoured with the marauders, you may not enjoy it, even though it's from Sirius' POV

  Sirius never stopped to think that his brother may not have joined the Death Eaters of his own free will. Or just how thorough a tragedy his death was. Oh the secrets a diary reveals and the unique opportunities a deadly veil offers.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights]] is absolutely brilliant. The characters are very well-written, and they act exactly how I imagined. No stupid nicknames and obnoxious pet names for teachers, no love at first sight for James and the story focuses on other things than "pranks all the time". I highly recommend the story even if it will have wolfstar in later chapters.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/chapters/33372651][The Mapmakers]] was a nice surprise. I read it recently, and though some plot-points seemed a little too far-fetched, I enjoyed the story very much.

** I love linkffn(Dirty Blood) . It is brilliant, even if it is still just in the 5th year and hasn't been updated for some time, but I don't give up hope. The characters are all brilliant and realistic and they read as teenagers, without being terrible cliches and they all feel unique and the characters never feel one-dimensional. It gives Lily some female friends without them being Marauders in pink

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.
