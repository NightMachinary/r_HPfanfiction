  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

**** I read it a year or so ago so my memory may be a bit blurry, but I don't like the pairing either and I remember it being not particularly important to the story. I think it was nearer the end. There was definitely nothing explicit. Anyway I quite liked it, I'd say try reading it!
