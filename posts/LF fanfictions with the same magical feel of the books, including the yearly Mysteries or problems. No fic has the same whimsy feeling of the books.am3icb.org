By mysteries I mean the philosopher's stone, the chamber of secrets, who the half blood Prince is, the Goblet of fire, etc.


** So, a modern, currently updating story that does this rather well is linkffn(What's her name in Hufflepuff)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

** One of my favourites which stands out on that regard is linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

It's an Albus Potter fic but it's well written, introduces new elements and has a strong mystery element. Really underappreciated imo, probably because nextgen fics aren't popular.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** These were always my favorite too. I never had much luck finding good ones outside of some H/G stuff after OotP and we all know how polarizing H/G material is.

I came across this one a while ago. It's not perfect but I thought it was an enjoyable read that tried to stay within the spirit of HP:

** linkffn(weasley girl by hyaroo) has, IMO, a VERY similar feel to the books without being just a total rehash. It's Fem!Ron with no other changes; they get very different information due to the butterfly effect and things turn out very different.

​

linffk(the unusual case of sally-anne perks) has a solid mystery, a longer-ish one shot.

​

There's an abandoned fic I'm thinking of where the other hogwarts founders made their own rooms (the chamber being slytherin's and the room of requirement being ravenclaw's) but I can't remember the title. This wasn't "What you leave behind" by newcomb, was it?

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Super late, but I find linkffn(7613196) very magical! It definitely has that sort of growing up aspect to it (although the characters seem pretty mature right off the bat, there's some huge character development in terms of understanding the world around them), and unique yearly mysteries. Not sure about whimsy feeling though ://
