Like with no Muggle inventions at all, because even the most prolific wizardwank fics have all the canon Muggle inventions (Knight Bus, Hogwarts Express, cars cameras, wireless, lifts, gramophones, etc) in them, which I find funny because if wizards are supposed to be superior, then why use Muggle ideas (even if they've been magicked up)? Wizards have Portkeys, Floo, Apparation and Vanishing Cabinets, after all, so why not use them? Or a wholly magical transport system, like a Vanishing Cabinet that can go to multiple locations?

So yeah, are there any truly magical AUs where after the SoS is signed (or even before) there's no cultural/invention crossover?


** The Knight Bus is for «stranded witches and wizards», who probably can't apparate and are far away from any Floo access. I doubt Vanishing Cabinets are common, considering the only pair we know is in the Room of Hidden Things and at Borgin and Burke's (who specialise in trade of «rare and ancient» (read; dark) artefacts)

*** Instead of a mechanical bus, they could have, say, a carriage that's bigger in the inside. It could be drawn by thestrals like the Hogwarts carriages, Abraxians like the Beauxbatons Tri-Wizard carriage, or even goats like Thor's chariot.

*** Instant Portkey station?

There's magical equivalents they could use.

**** They require special permissionfrom the Ministry. And how are you supposed to get to this portkey station? Good idea in theory, but almost the same limitations as the Floo

** Ummm... The Firebird Trilogy, maybe?

Though it does follow the canon story, to a degree, so you still have the muggle world parts of it; there's a Lot of fanon AU stuff there.
