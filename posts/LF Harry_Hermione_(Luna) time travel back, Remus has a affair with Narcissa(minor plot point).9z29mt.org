I remember a story with HP/HG/(LL?) where they came back in time.

And in the course of the story, we see that Remus is boinking Narcissa, it's not a major plot point as both of them are supporting characters.

I'm not entirely sure if Luna was a Main Character, but am certain Harry,Hermione were


** Hm. I remember that Remus and Narcissa hooked up in "Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood", where Harry, Hermione and Luna are the main characters, but that's not a time travel story.

*** This story might be it, but I'll wait for any other suggestions until I mark it as solved.

** Maybe it's linkffn(A step to the right by CatsAreCool)? But this is a dimensional travel instead of time travel and I believe that Luna is not involved at all.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

** So I don't remember the Remus having an affair with narcissa (could have.... Or maybe the completely wrong fic, it's been a while since I've read it and very long fic) but lunar harmony and time travel sounds like death's pride by Paladeus
