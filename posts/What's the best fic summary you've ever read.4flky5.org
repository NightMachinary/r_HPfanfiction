Disregarding if the story itself was well-written or not, what fanfic summary made you immediately start reading?


** These are all fics where I read the description and thought, 'Yeah, I've gotta read that.' Some are clever, or funny, or they just convey the story in an intriguing way.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]]

A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]

Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]]

Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]]

The Hallows were not an ending. Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest after the Battle and finds the Stone -- the start of his salvation and the path to his damnation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]]

Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]]

He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10767751/1/Empathetic][Empathetic]]

Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][Whiskey Time Travel]]

When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]

Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  "Losing his virginity was a bloody good time; waking up the next morning, however, next to a man's ribcage - that was a bloody bad time." Draco is a Veela and Harry is his mate. Crack!Horror. Dark humor abounds. One-shot, complete.

  Lupin works the night shift on a golden oldies radio show, learns how to do his laundry, and eats his own sofa. Takes place just prior to PoA. Parody of angst fic. No slash, no het, just Lupin. Oneshot.
