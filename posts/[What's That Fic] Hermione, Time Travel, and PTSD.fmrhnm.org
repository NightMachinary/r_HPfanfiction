:END:
A while ago I read a fic where Hermione was sent in time to the marauders time. I can't remember specifically, but the accident involved a woman who was struck with grief over someone's death. Basically this woman captured Hermione and used a time turner from the department of mysteries to send her back in time.

Again I can't perfectly remember... She meets some of the original order members, suffers from PTSD and Depression, stays with Bathilda Bagshot in Godric's Hollow, and makes potions? She befriends someone... Sirius (or maybe Snape). Basically she is trying to work through her PTSD, but the first war is starting.

At the time it was incomplete, I don't know its current status.

If you might know what fic that is, thanks!!!
