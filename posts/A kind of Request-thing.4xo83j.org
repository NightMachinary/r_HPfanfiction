I'm curious as to what fan fictions many people want written (for example, a certain plot that nobody has tried, or maybe has tried but it wasn't very successful) that they haven't really seen a large selection of, and would be very open to reading, if in the near future, one was written. Give me plots, AU's, pairings, I want it all! :)


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of the Past by Lord umbrex) - complete AU.

Linkffn(Harry Potter Hit Wizard by DobbyElfLord) - this one hilarious. Crack fic. Sequel of linkffn(Harry Potter Mercenary by DobbyElfLord). The writer has a different series of two more oneshot where Harry is hitman - linkffn(The Sniper by DobbyElfLord; The Sniper II: Babylonian Nights by DobbyElfLord)

Edit: sorry. Commented on wrong thread.

**** No, I never have... the maximum I think that I saw was one where Lily had a secrect child with Severus... but I don't like that because Lily knew (obviously!) that she was mother of a child and deliberated abandoned them. For me, this is extreme Lily bashing.

On the other hand, if James could have a child from a one night stand with another woman while he and Lily had broken up after a huge fight or something. This wouldn't be James bashing on my opinion... men can have a child without having any knowledge of it; on the other hand, woman will always know.

This other half-sibling could be written in soooo many ways... could be someone from a Dark family, could be from a relationship with a muggle.... I believe that a very talented author could turn even a main character into Harry's half-sibling...

***** I always imagined James to be a good-hearted man (after, of course, his school years when he would be horrible to Severus), so the idea of Harry having a half-sibling from a one night stand of James WHILST going out with Lilly would be repulsive to me.

However, a child form a past relationship or something when Lilly and Harry hadn't been in the scene yet would be quite an interesting read.

Or... some witch could have spilled something interesting on his drink to take him to bed... or... a Dark witch on a mission using Polyjuice to impersonate Lily ended up having sex with him. So many different ways to make this happen! Shame no one seemed to have thought about this as a possible plot yet...

** A Harry/Luna that actually works would be appreciated. Those that work are rare. Not a purely romance fic though.

A Sirius/Pomfrey, again, not a purely romance fic.

A fic where Harry come back in time to do something else than kill Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry is arrested and thrown in Azkaban, after leading an insurection agaist a totalitarian, pureblood ministry. Most of his friends, his wife and children are killed. He finaly manages to escape, and finds a way to get back in the past, not to help in the war against Voldemort, but to prevent the future oligarchy to take the power thanks to the war.
#+end_quote

A time travel story where Dobbie the house elf sends his mind back in time to save Harry Potter, sir, and help him defeat Voldemort. Actually this one from Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas, but I would love to see a full fic about it.

This one I posted in another thread yesterday, but it's really too much developped, I put it in case you find something interresting in there:

#+begin_quote
  One day when Harry is 7, the Dursleys go too far. Harry discovers magic while locked hurt into his cupboard. He discovers that he is a lot more powerful than the people around him. Affraid, he decides that since he's so much more powerful and strong than the others he'll have to be a lot more cautious as well. He will not interfere in the affairs of others, always try to avoid confrontation and always fight his own anger, for fear of hurting somebody. As a result, he won't be sorted in Griffindor, for lack of courage, but in Ravenclaw (where he can best avoid others). Dumbledore will have to take him under his tutelage far sooner than in canon, to reverse the blocks Harry has put on himself. Harry will have a really hard time accepting that he has to eventually face Voldemort. At first he'll be friendly with Hemione, a bit of a outcast herself, but her personnality will soon be too much for him to bear, they will finally put up but only in the later years. Harry will be more or less alone in his first year and then will befriend Luna and Colin Crevey in his second year. It will become better for him after he meet his godfather at the end of third year. He will be a target for Draco and his goons as well as Ron and other Griffindors who don't anderstand why the boy who lived behave the way he does, but will eventually become good friends.
#+end_quote

And just because someone told me today that this ship is nothing but wish fulfilment with glorified self-inserts, so something along the lines of:

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy never antagonized the boy who lived as much as in canon, eventually, he has his rebellious phase against his parents during which he rejects everything they stand for. That's when he becomes close with the grey faction of Slytherin, as the scion of a pureblood familly, he can relate with their traditionnalist views and his racist bigotry doesn't survives the contact of actual muggleborns. He rediscovers what the values of Slytherin (guile, ambition, cunning) really mean, and decides to lie his lives following these principle. Draco will never be the servent of anyone, not even a self-proclaimed Dark Lord. In his fith year, his ambition attracts the attention of Ginny Weasley. This is not a redeemed/Draco. He doesn't join the good guys. His relationship with Ginny is really shaky. He still has a certain taste for violence. But he must lose his arrogance as he grows and learn, often the hard way.

***** Well, the ships could be written in the way of a movie that I watched one time, in which all the ships are involved, and throughout the fic each part of their lives is shown at stages, and the last two synopsis could be involved as well by having the ships set in that time period, and write around those themes. It would be quite a large project, and obviously not a large amount of attention would be focused on one side plot. It would work kind of like a pattern of excerpts from peoples lives, but with enough info each to create an interesting and captivating novel.

******* Well, for starters I think it would be a good idea to decide what characters would be in a romantic position, what characters are in a enemy-like position, and what ones are just friends?

And what would happen to Hermione? Would she be kept as a very prominent character, or just a minor one?

I'm also assuming that this kind of fic would be quite AU, considering Sirius and Pomfrey. After all, if he is brought in around the time Harry meets him, would he still be considered a huge criminal? It would seem quite strange for a school nurse to be romantically or platonically interested in a murderer, would it not?

I would agree with you when you say that this type of fic would be very complicated. If I myself attempted it, or you, or any other fan fiction writer, it would be a huge task and would most likely take A LOT of pre-planning for pre-plans and then more planning (with a bit more planning on the side).

** This may be a bit of a self promotion, but when the books originally came out I was very curious as to what it would have been like if Sirius Black had broken out a year earlier, during the Chamber of Secrets, and was widely thought to be the Heir of Slytherin. Since he was from a known dark family who had, except him all been in Slytherin. Just get Wormtail in that photo Harry took with Lockheart and BOOM, you've got a messed up mass murderer on the loose and no one would think that Slytherin's monster is unrelated, would be a great way to throw a reader off the scent and give an interesting B story to the book.

I figured it would make a lot of sense. I ended up writing the first bit about two years ago, of how it could plausibly happen, but have hit a hard wall of writers block since.

It's frustrating because I've never seen anyone else write this particular plot and I don't really enjoy writing, though reading it later can be equal parts fun and embarrassing. It's called Harry Potter and Plot by Fridge.

I'm no S'TarKan and I haven't updated in far too long, but I think it could be a very interesting AU divergence point that people could run with and remake into their own set of tropes, like how soul bond fics became a thing or Harry going back in time working out, learning hand to hand, and declaring his eternal love for (insert ship here) became a thing.

*** I think that if written fully it would have the potential to become a popular trope, but I mean, it would probably have to be written extremely well with a lot of planning and writing done BEFORE actually uploading it to a fan fiction website.

And of course some people may dislike it, because Harry would be in second year and they may feel it's a tad early for him to be finding out everything that he's supposed to find out in The Prisoner of Azkaban, plus everything from the original story line of The Chamber of Secrets on top of that, it could prove to be a lot of work, like some of the previous suggestions in this thread.

Why didn't you enjoy writing it?

**** I just don't particularly enjoy the writing process, I like the end product. I've actually got more chapters drafted, but for far later in the story. I started with a rough idea of how it could happen, but I've been struggling to figure out how to connect the things initially at Hogwarts.

Harry also wouldn't be learning quite everything he did in his original third year. It'd be a big mess come end of year though, and that's part of what seemed so interesting about the scenario.

***** It definitely is quite an interesting scenario, no doubt about that, especially when you think about people's reactions written from YOUR point of view.

Are there any other scenario's/ship that you haven't seen written (or have, but rarely) which you would be happy to see a rise of?

****** Well, I speculated badly when I was waiting for the fourth book. I figured Pettigrew (if he returned) was going to Polyjuice as Cedric to kidnap Harry for voldemort. It would actually be pretty funny, I think, for Pettigrew to secretly be a competitor in the Tri-Wizard tournament.

edit: Or as Cho Chang, the ultimate unexpected. Feel bad for harry though if he kissed her.

******* I have to admit, the Cho Chang one would crack me up! Thank you for all the interesting information, and I hope one day you strike gold as a fanfic writer! :)

** I had an idea. Usually when Harry goes back in time, he has pettigrew arrested/killed/kissed/etc. What I want to read is where Harry captures him and as a civilized discussion about his motives o betraying the Potter family, which ends with Harry forgiving him(not forgetting) and getting an Oath from Peter to spy on Voldemort.

*** There actually is an interresting Pettigrew goes back in time and saves his friend fic out there. I can't remember the title at the moment, though.

*** I don't know about forgiving, but an actual conversation would be appreciated, and some other motive than just shear boring cowardice or jealousy. Maybe Peter was the victim of a imperius/confundus/potions/whatever. Maybe he was targeted and turned over time by a romantic interest. Maybe Peter has his own secrets that were discovered and used to turn him. Maybe his friends unknowingly (or knowingly?) did something that he considered a betrayal.

The story didn't go far enough to have the details though. I think it's the fic I'm the most desperate for an update about.
