I am tired of Severus losing his snarky attitude just because he is now nice to Harry. If he won't be snarky to Harry let it be with others lol.

Many of the Severitus stories I read, the Severus likes him now and mentors him happens too quickly for my liking. It should be a slow and gradual process.

Severus hates Harry because of James, I think it would be more believable that Severus feel satisfied that Harry is being taken down a peg or two by the Dursley's. So I don't want stories where he hates Harry he sees abuse and then decides he loves Harry. Hatred is a strong emotion. Sure if Harry was being tortured I could see Severus trying to get him somewhere safer jic they kill the boy in a fit of anger. But after seeing just how much Sev despised Harry in the books, I don't believe making Sev care about him because he saw a bit of neglect and abuse as in anyway realistic.

I eventually want him to love Harry as a son. But it needs to be gradual. It needs to be well written. There needs to be things througout the story that has even Sev evaluating his opinion or wondering about Harry.

This next condition is optional. I'm curious to have a Harry that weird's Sev out. A Harry that likes to weird him out by doing what Sev wouldn't expect.

E.g.

Thanking him for protecting him from falling off his broomstick (the philosoper's stone)

Oh my gosh Snape Snape I can hear voices in the walls.

A Harry that gives zero fucks and enjoys making Snape be like dafuq?

Sev in book 3: You should be thanking me on bended knee Potter.

Harry gets down on his knees and thanks him.

I'd honestly love a Harry that deliberately acts in a way to make Sev and even others go dafuq? Just because he can. Just because he gives zero fucks.

Goblet of fire when Harry is hiding under his invisibility cloak and "Moody" vouches for him.

Weird Harry throws the cloak off and says "sorry professor Snape I got stuck in the staircase."

If Harry makes Sev laugh or smile in vindictive pleasure over it, it makes Harry secretly happy because he likes to turn expectations people have of him on their heads.

Sev would have thought Harry would stay hidden. But Harry is just like "lol no"

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** linkffn(Stronger than Hope) I believe this fic is more of a Snape guardian story instead of one where he treats Harry as a son but it's really good in terms of Snape staying in character and not becoming all nice for no reason.

linkao3(A year like none other) At least I think he doesn't lose his snarky attitude, it has been a while since I have read it. The writing is good though and has good characterizations.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Not finished and not exactly a Severitus, but has elements of that. Super gradual and not finished, but their interactions in this fic are amazing with lots of snarkiness and sarcasm from both of them. They are close in a distant kind of way though.

linkffn(Red Sorrow) Another not really Severitus fic, but may be getting there. This is an AU where Snape has a daughter so the fic focuses a lot on her and Snape. Harry is not in the fic until later but it does seem like it's heading in the direction of Severitus type relationship eventually. Can be somewhat angsty but Snape does more or less stay in character.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
