Are there any fanfics that relate to the topic. I've only read some that has fem!harry to be relate to the topic. But trying to find if the whole school along with ministry find out about Harry Potter 'The Boy Who Lived' along with his twin sister 'Real Girl Who Lived' it tells by reading about their truth of how they were treated and also reads through the deathly hallows.
