** The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter is pretty good, although it's as AU as AUs get and the author is only on the third year.

Edit: Accidentally linked the second story. Let's try again.

****** okie, thanks. I read the description, does [[/spoiler][Voldermort go back in time, or cast some retroactive spell? Or is it more of a "From this point on the series, there are problems"?]]

There are so many gems buried in ff.net, but I haven't the time to shovel through it all.

******* it starts after the ministry fight. Tom tries a potion enhanced attack hoping to reclaim the horcrux in harry and nab some of harry's power. The attack backfires with some spectacular effects and side effects.. (sorry)

It's by no means a perfect story but I like it. ymmv.
