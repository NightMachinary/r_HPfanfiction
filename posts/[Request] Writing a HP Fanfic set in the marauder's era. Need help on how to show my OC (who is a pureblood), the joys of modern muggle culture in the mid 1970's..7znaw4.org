** Be careful you don't stray into Americanisms - drive ins have never been common in the UK. But going to "the pictures" (movies is American and has only been used in the UK for the last couple of decades) would be exciting enough for a Pureblood I think. Also while fast food was a think in 1970s Britain, it was no where near as popular as in the US.

Vinyl and cassettes definitely, maybe a Muggle concert? Music and youth culture was BIG then, think mods and rockers, punks, etc. Maybe a football match too? Culturally very important in Britain today as well as then.

Slightly more boring, but the 60s and 70s was a period of huge economic transition. The increasing availability of things like Hoovers, microwaves and washing machines liberated women from domestic management and introduced them to the workforce. I always got the impression that although chores can be done by magic in the wizarding world, the spells can still take a while and can be hard to get right. Not to mention contraception being made available for unmarried women, abortion being legalised and so on that led to a generally more liberal experience of being a woman, with more acceptance of revealing clothes and so on that would look quite different to the robes witches commonly wear.

** Well, assuming this is set in the UK in the mid-late '70s? The point about drive-in movies has already been mentioned. But you want the 'joys' of muggle culture? I suppose the music was better and there were interesting counter-culture things happening (free festivals, CND marches, hippie communes, etc) but apart from that I can't really remember any. It was a grim time. Unemployment was rising, price inflation was out of control, manufacturing industry was in decline, sexism, racism, and any other sort of ism was rampant. And there were only three channels on the telly. It was an angry country.
