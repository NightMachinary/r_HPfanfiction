:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Need some help finding this fic. Here's what I remember:

In this story Harry, Neville Luna and Hermione are the heirs to the founders.

Harry found a Trunk from lily that had creature eggs in them.

They also had a room where they could watch Dumble In his office.

The room was in a trunk Harry had and the trunk was placed in the RoR.


** The only story that I remember reading where Harry has a trunk that allows him to watch the outside world while he is inside it is Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny by Wheezy1. It does have scenes where the trunk is in the RoR, and has them watching Dumbledore. The pairings are harry/hermione and Neville/luna but I can't remember if the are all Founder's heirs.

** EDIT: found it linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spiritual Heirs)

I read this a couple months ago and really enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure, unfortunately last night I was also looking for it and couldn't find it.

In addition to what OP said, there is a wolf and a falcon familiar involved, and a scene where Harry trains against himself using time travel. I think there is a full apartment in the trunk and Dobby recruits an army of elves to adapt it for the four of them to train.

The trunk slows down time and the fic takes place sometime between fifth and sixth or sixth and seventh year.

I'll keep looking for it but hope this helps anyone who knows what it is off the top of their head. Think it was recommended to me on here but I could have found it on FFN search.

  Post OotP. Harry inherits more than gold from Sirius and his parents. Now he must train to fight Voldemort while fighting against Dumbledore's manipulations. Full Summary inside. Slight Dumbledore Weasley bashing. Review!
