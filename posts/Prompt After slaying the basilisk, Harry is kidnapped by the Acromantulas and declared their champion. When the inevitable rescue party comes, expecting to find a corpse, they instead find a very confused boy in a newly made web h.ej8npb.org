*** Into the spider verse anyone?

Edit: Now I really want to see this done. Like a good and proper fic. Not like 100k words but like 20k at least. A Harry Potter married to the daughter of aragog (um...little wierd and more creepy than I can deal with). Maybe make Aragog a spider collector or something? And then do a crossover with Spiderman into the spider verse.

Who do I pay to see this done? Like really. I'll pay.

Edit 2: I'll pay for this to be done. Nothing crazy of course. But like seriously, contact me.

**** All right, people, let's do this one last time. My name is Harry Potter. I was married to a magical spider, and for the last seven years I thought I was the one and only Spider-Mage. I'm pretty sure you know the rest. You see, I saved the school, fell in love, I got married, saved the country some more, maybe too much, my marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices - don't invest in Hagrid's skrewt-themed restaurant. Then like fifteen years passed, blah blah blah super boring, I died a couple times, a Bludger flew into my face, I buried Aunt Petunia, my wife and I split up. But I handled it like a champion.

#+end_quote

'Cause you know what? No matter how many times I get hit, I always get back up. And I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself. Did you know that seahorses... that they mate for life? Could you imagine a seahorse seeing another seahorse and then making it work? She wanted kids and it scared me. I'm pretty sure I broke her heart. Flash forward, I'm in my apartment doing Charm drills, doing counter-curses, getting strong -

  (Harry is actually binging Chocolate Frogs)
#+end_quote

...when this weird thing happened. And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot. But this was /real/ weird. You see, I was in Hogsmeade, but... things were different. Also I was dead. And not cripplingly addicted to spider sex. I was kind of... perfect. It was like looking in a mirror.

  (Harry, covered in scraps of webbing and chocolate stains, looks at Daniel Radcliffe)

I have a feeling the thing that brought me here was the thing that got him killed.

*** Shortly after, Firenze the centaur shows up, and announces that James had, under similar circumstances, promised his future firstborn to a marriage contract with one of Firenze's daughters.

Some fast talking by Dumbledore gets everyone to agree to put their claims on hold until Harry turns 17. Things settle down into a tense but steady state, with Harry regularly discovering an acromantula sneaking into his bed (though the silk sheets she gifts him are *amazing*). And, half the time he goes outside, he is accosted by a centauress wanting him to ride her, in both meanings of the word.

So it goes, until the Triwizard Tournament. While in the Black Lake, Harry is helped by a mermaid, who steals a kiss and tries to pull him down to her village. But then, the gillyweed runs out and she has to let him come back to the surface. It turns out that James also once went for a swim that almost ended in tragedy...

A year later, Hagrid doesn't have much to say when Karkus the Giant pulls out a certain betrothal contract from a decade and a half prior, and asks whether the firstborn in question has been born. Hagrid never learns that the reason Golgomath kills Karkus that night is that he has a similar contract for his daughter. (James had to bribe /two/ giants to get away, you see.)

The less said about what happens the first time Harry visits Gringotts (under his own name) after turning 17, the better.

Also, in this AU, James was a [[https://ranma.fandom.com/wiki/Genma_Saotome][panda]] animagus.
