What if Harry can talk to snake isn't because of some BS that Dickless accidentally give Harry some of his power, but because the Evans originally came from Egypt and were the pharaoh royal mages and were known for talking with snakes.


** Yeah I think I agree. What if Tutankhamun was Lily and Petunia's father? But he was also a mummy as well.

**** I wouldn't know since my mom didn't allow me to watch horror movies at the age I was in the 90s but if he's wrapped in bandages then it's him.

****** Well if it's the movie with the guy with big eyes that might have been in early 2000s. Still I wasn't allowed to watch it because of the guy that gets eaten alive by scarabs crawling under his skin.

** I honestly don't even acknowledge the idea that he caught it from Old Maude like a cold lmao.

I think him receiving it in genetics somewhere makes more sense. Mostly because of the idea that a language is a magical trait itself, which means genes, right? Maybe it was somehow unlocked by Voldie somehow, but that's the only thing I can see happening
