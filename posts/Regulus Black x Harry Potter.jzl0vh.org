I'm looking for books where eather harry brings Regulus back from the dead or harry time travels (some way or another) and saves regulus and they end up together.

I would love Sirius and Regulus' brotherly bond being repairing in the story.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
