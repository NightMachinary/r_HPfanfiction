*** I read it from start to finish months ago. Wasn't crazy about it. I'm sure it's a well-developed romance but god is it fluffy and slow.

** Heh, decent, but very slow, apart from one thing. [[/spoiler][Albus being a squib, for right now (canon divergence), is something that was probably expected, and it makes sense when Abby enters the picture, she can show him that he can be a successful person without magic and all that.]] I just think that the tone of the story has shifted a bit. It wasn't all sunshine and daises before but the last few chapters have been very heavy and pretty depressing. At least the second half of this chapter TRIED to return to the whimsy and fun of the first ones. As it comes to the quality of the story, this one was a bit of hit and miss. As it comes to the quality as a fanfic: God Damn this is wonderful!!!

*** I agree the last few chapters have been dark but I also think it's clear Harry has not grieved the death of Ginny. Abby and teddy have both combined to force Harry to start to grieve and it brings in some dark moments. I have friends who I have seen grieve and conversely those who chose to bottle it up and Taliesin19 is doing s great job of portraying Harry as one who bottles it up.

He admits that Abby was a pretend world for him but now he wishes for her to be more. By accepting that he is accepting her opinion and she asks hard questions.

If I had to a wild guess I have two ways this plays out:

A) Abby gets the pianist role in the wizarding orchestra and Harry buys her that grande piano

B) Abby doesn't get the part and Harry marries her before she can get obliviated.

I hope it can get back to the whimsy fun too but I suspect it will require Harry to start facing his demons before we can see that. Not to mention Abby still has her whole family stuff to deal with too

**** While I agree that he has to confront his thing with Ginny, there is the matter of Albus as I said in the Spoiler. Also I don't see him marrying her anytime soon, even to save her from Obliviation, his children come first and she's not really mum material. I just miss the light feeling this fic had at the start (sort of, the angst was always there). Also, Harry's feelings are all over the place. I think this will boil down to Abby vs Albus, since she is the only one of his friends that can show him that Muggles are worth anything. I really adore this fic, I hope it will be continued.

***** It will definitely be continued. Taliesin19 has already confirmed she will probably start the next chapter in the next week or so and it will be written much faster as she has graduated school now.

I don't see Albus staying non-magical as it just doesn't fit with things. But I think this opens the door for Abby to really become a part of their family as, like you said, she is the one who can talk most realistically to Albus. Who knows he may even develop a love for music.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
