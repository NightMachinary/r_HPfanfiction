I'm bored and looking to read a new fic. Powerful Harry would be nice or some innate magical ability but simply no Harry/Ginny pairings.

Thanks


** The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts).

Its fairly new, powerful Harry, and not to spoil it but he is up to his eyeballs in magical abilities.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

Not immediately powerful, but he gets up there. Magical abilities include animancy, parseltongue, and some nebulous pagan moon magic. Brace yourself for a LONG read though, and probably unfinished.

The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher).

Despite how awesome this fic is, I rarely see it mentioned here and I think this is almost criminal. Extremely powerful Harry, some of the best fights I have read in fanfiction, excellent world-building, and a slow building mystery. Crazy Harry is always nice too.

Hogwarts Battle School linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

You ever read the Ender Saga? Its sort of that plus magic. Harry is powerful, but not unbeatable, which is better.

By The Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song linkffn(By The Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song)

Book 1 and 2 in an unfinished trilogy. AU universe, Harry is a talented apprentice to Dumbledore, Neville is the boy who lived. Pretty interesting turn on the WBWL story, and Old Magic is pretty interesting in the stories.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** A good trilogy about Harry who acquires some swell demon powers. Technically it's a crossover but I wasn't familiar with the other book series and still enjoyed the Denarian Chronicles immensely.

Dark meaning it starts off with the protagonist (fem harry) as a former worker in a child brothel called candyland wherein she is the mother figure for the other workers after having lived and worked there since she was like seven. With all that entails.

She's there cause dursleys are pieces of shit and she gets rescued by Sirius after he is released due to further investigation.
