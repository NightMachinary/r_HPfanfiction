First and foremost we must recognize that Minerva McGonagall is a teacher. This means her primary duty is a caregiver, being responsible for her students safety first and foremost. Something she totally and completely fails at on multiple occasions. Let's explore this shall we.

Page 14 of the Philosopher's Stone. The placement of Harry Potter with his muggle relatives. But [[/u/moomoogoat/]] c'mon now you can't seriously be falling for that trope. I would lose my job if I failed to report suspected abuse. Teachers are mandatory reporters; if we even suspect child abuse we are /legally mandated/ to report it. McGonagall not only allowed Harry to be placed in their care for eleven years but does not check upon him once. Even worse she allows him to go home to that every single summer.

/She chooses what is easy not what is right./ This theme manifests itself not only in this decision but in future ones as well.

She ignores Harry and Co year 1 about the Philosopher's Stone. That is inexcusable. The very vaunted defenses she is relying on are obviously compromised; how else would a group of first years know about them? Surely she should take action. But no. She does nothing, forcing Harry to confront Voldemort.

Year 1-6 Snape's treatment of Harry. How can you allow your colleague to do that? Harry is a member of your house and you allow him to be consistently mistreated by a member of the staff. A member of the staff whose primary duty is to protect and nurture all students. As the second in command at the school how is it not her responsibility to deal with staff members abusing their power? But rather than stand up for him she does nothing. Yet again she chooses to do what is easy.

Years 2 and 4. The mistreatment and bullying of Harry Potter. Bullying is not acceptable, much less on a schoolwide scale. How can you allow this to persist? What part of you thinks this is acceptable? Yet again I (a teacher) would lose my job if I did nothing to curtail the rampant bullying of a /child./ This is her responsibility, she is after all the Gryffindor Head of House. Doing nothing is far easier than taking a stand is it not?

Year 5. Umbridge. Before you say it isn't her fault she's the Deputy Headmistress, it's her responsibility for what Harry had to go through. The repeated detentions were obvious signs, if one cared to look closer. As to Harry not going to her? /Why should he?/ When has she ever stood up for him before? /She cared more for her position than for the safety of her students./

Year 6. Doing nothing about Draco Malfoy. Yet again Harry confides in her, telling of his suspicions about Draco Malfoy giving her the necklace. She dismisses his concerns, doing what she is best at: nothing.

Year 7. Allowing Death Eaters to torture students within the confines of a school setting. This goes without saying; if your maintaining your position is more important than standing up for (the safety) your students you are not a teacher you're a coward.

Many of you may take issue with these, however it comes down to the words of Dumbledore. There is a different between doing what is right and what is easy. When put in these scenarios McGonagall usually chooses the easy way out, doing nothing; allowing the safety of her students to be compromised.

I would ask you when does she stand up for what is right? When is she willing to display that vaunted Gryffindor courage? Only in the DH does she manage to do so after the Death Eaters have tortured students for three quarters of the year.


** There's no real in-character reason for this. She's a victim of plot-induced inactivity (LIke Dumbledore). If McGonagall did her job it would derail the plot and the kids couldn't be the heroes. So she has to be a useless adult.

** 1. McGonagall takes her misgivings to her superior from the start and he persuades her. Dumbledore then places Mrs. Figg to watch over him, so as far as she knows, Dumbledore has it handeled.

2. She sends him back because they are his guardians AND he shows no outward signs of abuse. Harry keeps almost every single bit of it to himself.

3. McGonagall isn't given a reason it would happen that night or soon, just that they know about it. Furthermore, she DOES catch Harry and Ron standing "guard" so she also DID go to the corridor afterwards.

4. Snape's treatment of students would be filed to Dumbledore who does nothing to curtail it. She already knows the Ministry is corrupt and would not go to them.

5. The students did not outwardly bully Harry in Chamber and the closest they got in Goblet was the badges. Otherwise they flat out ignored him and whispered behind his back. Neither of which she could stop - you can't force people to be like someone.

6. McGonagall did not know what Harry had to do in detentions AND she knew he got them because he kept rising to provocations. Furthermore, Harry answered this to his best friends as "doing lines". She isn't omniscient.

7. No one believed Harry that year because Harry accused a sixteen year old of being a Death Eater. PLUS Draco had an alibi during Katie's bad fortune (he was in detention).

8. We don't know what McGonagall did during the last book to even judge this. The only ones we saw hurt were those that point blank defied them. Furthermore, an open defiance would have brought the Death Eaters and possibly Voldemort onto Hogwarts without time to properly prepare and without a means to win. Lastly, when the Carrow WAS going to harm innocent students she geared up to attack right then and there.

Not in the UK they're not. There are occasional attempts to get it passed, but child-protection specialists argue against it as it makes abused kids more likely to hide what's going on and not seek what limited help they do.

** It's a children's book. You and a billion other people are taking the story too literally. /Of course/ McGonagall is doing nothing about these things; if she were doing something about them there wouldn't be a story. If you don't agree with it, the solution isn't to discard all of their canon characterization and pretend they're evil, the solution is to write a piece of fanfiction where their motives and actions are self-consistent, and then build the story up around that. "I can't forgive this character for neglecting Harry." and "It's in canon, so it's undeniable that they're neglectful." are both incorrect attitudes, because they ignore that you're very obviously /not supposed to notice or care/. Not to say you can't care, but treating them as deliberate is a deliberate misread of the source material.

** I thought I would add my two cents to this discussion because your view of McGonagall seems to based entirely on things we only know because the books were written from Harry's point of view.

We don't know whether or not she checks up on him during his tenure at Hogwarts. All we know is that when the initial question of leaving Harry with the Dursleys came up, she strongly objected. She couldn't do more than that because she didn't have the authority to, it's not like she could have just snatched the baby from Dumbledore and run off with it.

Why on earth would any reasonable adult believe that an eleven year old had not only figured out an extremely sensitive and convoluted plan put in place by talented wizards and witches but also knew that those same defenses would be penetrated and when? She didn't send Harry off to face Voldemort, she had very little information to go on and didn't know that Quirrell was under Voldemort's control. Come on, man. She's not all knowing.

McGonagall wasn't present for every single interaction that Snape and Harry had together. How was she to know that Snape mistreated Harry in his own class? Furthermore, as someone else in this thread already brilliantly brought up, everything we're reading is from Harry's perspective. Teenage angst does not mix well with perceived wrongs - some situations could be exaggerated.

What bullying are you talking about? The fact that people would sneer at him in the dorm rooms and the hallways sometimes? The Potter Sucks buttons? I'm not saying that Harry had an easy time growing up but being socially ostracized at certain points of his academic career does not equate to rampant bullying that McGonagall could do anything about. You can't force teenagers to like each other. And I feel this has to be said again, McGonagall was not present at every, or even the majority of events that occurred between Harry and his classmates. She is the head of Gryffindor house, not just of one student.

What you said about Year 5 is just bullshit. McGonagall stood up to Umbridge frequently throughout the book, most famously when the subject of Harry's career advice came up. Harry did not have obvious signs of what was happening to him in detention with Umbridge and he told everyone that he was just writing lines. How was she to know?! Also, the reason Harry didn't go to her is not because she hasn't stood up for him before (SHE HAS), but because Harry never goes to anyone with anything. Why start in year 5?

When Harry confided his suspicions to her, all she heard from her side was a teenage boy with a chip on his shoulder and a small bout of paranoia. It was an outlandish thought that Voldemort would really pick Draco Malfoy for a task, why should McGonagall have believed him?

Again, what was she supposed to do?! Had she started fighting against the death eaters they likely would have killed her and then what kind of help would the children have? She stayed at the school and didn't cause an immediate scene so as to be able to help as many children as possible. By not sending them to detentions with the Carrows, for example. And when she had more resources at her disposal, she joined the fight with vigour.

The answer to your question is that she always stands up for what's right.

** There are two ways to look at Harry Potter. Everyone is an idiot is the first and the second is maybe there are reasons behind things that Harry as an unreliable narrator doesn't notice.

Harry's placement? You mean the placement with his relatives who spoil their child? The people who also in the real world would have gained custody and the people who in the real world would not have received a visit of an old school teacher of the biological parent?

Legally mandate? Not in the UK which is good because the mandatory reporting system doesn't do the children any good while its prono to abuse. It was a symbolic gesture at best...

Why doesn't she report it? Because while it's very visible from Harry's eyes its most likely not something others noticed. Neither his friends nor his muggle school teachers.

Does she ignore them in first year? Dumbles gets informed while traveling to the ministery. While the Stone was perfectly safe in the mirror. She just doesnt share her actions with 11 yr olds.... As she shouldn't.

Harsh charcter building was and is in no way uncommon in English boarding schools

Bullying is an interesting topic and a topic that gained a lot more attention since the Harry Potter books came out. Here is an important cultural difference between the USA and the UK. Especially in the USA there has been a rise of a whole anti bullying industry. (Which has really no impact on the problem) The english attitude against bullying is very different especially in boarding schools where what american's call bullying is actually instituionalised character building. And the English lack the school shooting problem which has been partly attributed to bullying they arent so hysterical about the issue.

Umbridge? You mean the powerless school teacher should do something against the ministers right hand who got full power to clean house at Hogwarts? She did what she could to keep her students out of trouble. Harry doesn't see that he only sees a target to fight with......Minerva tells him to keep his head down...... What does harry do get detention almost on purpose..... While telling nobody about the blood quill....

Do what about Draco Malfoy? An important piece in Dumbles plan to die and have Snape do it. Would have been pretty unresponsible of her.

You mean the year in which she shields the children as much as she can? Instead of walking away and let another DE in the school ?

Nah she does what is right not what is easy.

Why exactly do we assume there's anything she /can/ do? It's common fan-logic to assume that blood quills are illegal or not allowed at school. There's no evidence of that, particularly since apparently she invented them herself. And that's beyond the fact that she was literally the vice-minister for magic and was appointed by ministerial decree despite the headmaster's wishes.

What do you think would have happened if she did anything? She'd have gotten killed and replaced by another sadist, most likely. If she's lucky she'd have been able to escape, but that still wouldn't really help the students. While she was there she could covertly help.

In general, a lot of your issues come down to that there's really nothing she could have done. Snape, for instance. She probably did speak up about him, even though I don't really think he was especially bad. Where are they going to get another potions teacher, though? It's no secret that Hogwarts has a severe staffing shortage, due partially to the fact that the magical community is so small. McGonagall, for instance, teaches at least 12 classes, grades essays for those 12 classes, patrols the hallways at night, helps with the administration of the school, and if she has any time left she acts as head of Gryffindor house. Now, I can't say I actually understand how Hogwarts scheduling works, but at my high school, teachers were only allowed to teach three classes --- though they did have each class every day. Snape, in addition to working as the head of house of Slytherin, patrolling, and also teaching and grading 12 classes, presumably also brews potions for the hospital wing. In order to replace him, you need to have someone who is a good enough potioneer to take on the position, which requires an interest in the material, raw talent, and significant training, but not so much interest in the material that they'd prefer to actually brew potions as a career instead. They'd also have to be willing to work extremely long hours for very little reward, where the slightest screw up means that a child might die. That type of person isn't exactly a dime a dozen. And even if you could, they might be a bad teacher. All available evidence (which admittedly is quite limited) shows that Snape's teaching results are excellent.

I'm not saying that McGonagall doesn't have the "plot-induced inactivity", but pretty much every character on Team Good has that, because Rowling thinks of inactivity as a virtue and ambition as the greatest evil in existence. This /is/, after all, a book series where the seventh book literally relies on them sitting around in a tent until the bad guys screw up again.

** It's very easy to dislike McGonagall, but it's also pretty easy to turn her into a good character, too.

And it's worth pointing out that McGonagall was correct; the stone WAS safe. If it weren't for Harry, Voldemort had no chance of getting the stone out. There was zero hint as to how to get it out, and a good chance that it would have kept him busy for far longer than it took for Dumbledore to get back. The first set of protections were clearly a trap. Dumbledore himself was surprised that Harry was able to get the stone out. I mean, my number one hearts desire would probably be for Voldemort to never figure it out....not to figure it out and take the stone first. Being that I was tied up and all.

I'd also like to point out that the protections were mostly one way. I suspect if Quirrel tried grabbing the mirror and running - assuming they escaped it's delights - they'd find the traps became much harder. After all, how do you get back through the fire? Potion would have worn off. How do you get through the locked door? Flying key is on the other side. What about getting through the trapdoor? Sure there's brooms, but that's after you escape the attacking keys. Did you think to grab one?

The black players probably are enchanted to be better players, so while white got beaten by Ron, going back could be way harder.

Basically, Harry ruined the Mirror protection by assuming HE could protect it better than Dumbledore, and of course, it was so traumatic and Dumbledore is such a softy, he had to pat him on the head and tell him he did well. Because you don't tell an 11 year old that they nearly ruined everything and killed for nothing.

*** Also, McGonagall never gave any indication she believed there would be abuse. She watched them all day, and thought they were the worst sort of Muggles...because they were so cookie cutter, unimaginative, and mundane. She watched them spoil Dudley all day. She just thought they'd raise Harry to be boring and bland, not chuck him into a cupboard and try suppress his magic!

Do you remember what 90s fashion was? Oversized, battered clothes were cool. Harry probably looked like one of those white hip-hop boys, not a Charles Dickens urchin. Fits the bad boy image, and I bet you anything cool cats like Lee Jordan dressed similar.

Why on earth would a secondary school teacher check on a baby every year? They gave him to his relatives. Why do people assume school teachers can just decide a kid's life for them?? She was hardly Lilys surrogate mother figure!

Year six: she had six years of Harry and Draco accusing each other. Draco had an alibi. She's not the police. She's a teacher.

Of course, there's no warming charm in canon either - the nearest is a hot-air charm Hermione casts. In fact, as with time-telling charms, characters undergo a great many inconveniences that make no sense if such a charm exists.

** I'm going to level with you here dude.

When I read this diatribe, I am reminded of something I often here. People in the modern world balk at how stupid or backwards people in ancient times were. How the Egyptians used to worship cats and possibly bury their servants with them alive. How Chinese emperors were fools to believe ingesting mercury was the key to immortality.

Or how people today look poorly at other societies because they are "backwards" or "uncivilized." I can name a half-dozen countries I saw on the news *today* where exactly this was insinuated.

Thats what this sounds like to me. You really don't know the circumstances here. What we do know though is that the shit Harry gets up to during the year is so far outside the norm that you couldn't spot it with a pair of binoculars.

McGonagall didn't listen to Harry about the stone. Why would she? He is an eleven year old kid that just helped commit an act of possible international animal trafficking across multiple countries.

On Harry and Snape. See, the thing about it is its really all told from *Harry's* viewpoint. When your a teenager, its always the teacher's fault. They are always at fault, and stupid, and inept.

Why didn't McGonagall believe Harry ever? Here is Harry's track record on predictions (there is a pretty obvious red herring in every book, even when I was eight it was obvious):

Snape's trying to steal the stone? Nope it was Quirrel. Snape was saving Harry's life.

Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin? Nope, just an loudmouth ponce. Turns out it actually was the quiet one for once.

Sirius Black betrayed Harry's parents? Nope, it was his best friends pet. No, really, its just as dumb as it sounds.

Snape might have put Harry's name in the Goblet (Harry really wants Dumbledore to tell him Snape isn't reformed)? Nope, polyjuiced defense teacher in the form of the last person you would believe, which means it should have been the /first/ person to believe.

Snape is weakening Harry for Voldemort? No, he may have actually been trying to teach Occlumency, but Harry didn't care that much and/or didn't possess the temperment for it (which Dumbledore pretty much admits later).

Draco was doing something sinister in Hogwarts, and Snape was helping him? Yeah, see here's the thing. The one time Harry was actually right, it turns out to be ANOTHER red herring and Snape was acting under orders to prevent the worst outcomes.

In short, Harry is not a good source. He jumps to conclusions and dives in without looking. I wouldn't trust him either.

But more importantly, what authority does McGonagall have anyway? She basically manages the sorting as Deputy, and takes over if Albus is out galavanting around. Thats it, thats all the power she is shown to have besides head of Gryffindor house. And the houses are notoriously competitive, so its likely they were set up by the Founders to not have authority over one another except in emergencies.

**** When you were there and objected. Also, Harry's appearance once he goes to Hogwarts would be a dead giveaway. Rich family giving him shabby clothes and the whole malnutrition thing.

** Disliking McGonogal is a good step towards being absolutely redpilled in regards to HP. She's a complete disgrace, "while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts", what a useless diatribe.

Remus Lupin is another character that takes a while to hate properly, but that's exactly what that whiny man-child deserves.

Let me just applaud you, you're well on your way to hate all adults in the Potterverse. o7

**** What's to like about a craven "woe is me" coward, who pities himself for 13 years, while the orphan son of his supposedly best friends deals with life threatening situations and ... you know.. being an orphan? Did he ever visit? Did he write even a single letter?

Oh, and then, he doesn't decide he's been an idiot long enough on his own, no, he gets hired by Dumbledore and is basically *forced* to interact with Harry Potter. Of course after being slapped awake by Dumbles he immediately tells Harry who he is and how close he was to Harry's parents... oh wait no, that's what a decent person would have done ("Oh hey Harry, nice to meet you, I've been basically inseparable with your parents for 7 years, lets have a cup of tea I'll tell you about them"). Maybe he just got mad, because he didn't get the Godfather job and is acting out of spite ("Hah, they gave Godfather to a murderer and betrayer, those idiots, fuck 'em and their stupid child").

If you need to know more about the man just look how he jumps at the chance to abandon his pregnant wife too.

***** Dude, come on. Where on earth do you even get the idea that Remus Lupin knew where Harry was? Nowhere in the story are we told that he was with the Potters or even around their home on that night, and afterwards Hagrid collected Harry and took him straight to Dumbledore waiting on Privet Drive. I don't think there was any detours made just to inform Lupin what was going on so that he could not write letters for 13 years.

Why would he go straight to Harry and tell him who he was? Who just goes up to random teenagers and starts talking about their backstories? He knew that would completely freak Harry out and so he tried small interactions first.

You think he was pissed that he wasn't asked to be Harry's godfather? Again, where are you getting that from? Remus, Sirius, and Harry's parents were all living through a war at this time, I doubt that was foremost on his mind. He spent thirteen years mourning the loss of the only people that were ever accepting of who he was, all while living with the terrible effects of lycanthropy and not having enough money to help himself in any way.

As for the last statement, you cannot just say that he jumped at the chance of abandoning his wife. As far as we know this was the first instance of a werewolf reproducing - can you even imagine how terrifying that must have been for him? To not know whether the horrible condition you live with was passed down to your child, to not know whether your wife would survive childbirth? He was terrified and made a mistake. The important point is that he came back.

** Exactly Moomoogoat! :( I have never liked McGonagall for any of this, even though I do recognize it was because of plot reasons.
