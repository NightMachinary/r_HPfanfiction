Could be for one class could be for all classes. But they either are a bit better than her or tied for first and she has to handle having a intellectual rival. The other person may or may not be the competitive type but she might get competitive with them. It should be someone her year and be a canon character not oc or self insert. Doesn't have to be someone in her house.

Preferably not one where she ends up romantically with the rival character but becoming friends is ok.

No major character/OC ships No major character/self insert No character of harrys gen / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older

preferably No Draco/Hermione

No genderbender ( trans characters are fine i dont consider genderbenders trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused and/or plot focused.

Edit: for the record i consider genderbender anything where a canon character is born a different sex than in canon so for example fem! harry. I guess sex swap is more accurate. Identifying as a different gender down the line as a character growth thing does not count as my definition of genderbender which i really should have called sex swap to begin with sorry for the confusion


** I read a fic where Hermione is replaced by an OC with a different family and a more... combative? ruthless personality? The point was that she would realistically go into Slytherin because she hadn't some kind of hero worship towards Dumbledore and instead of pacifying the blood purists or letting herself be a punching bag like some fanfics would make her be she would face head-on Draco and others and hit just as hard if not more right from the beginning. But on to your request, she develops a rivalry with the Patil twins that becomes so intense that Daphne started calling it indecent. Pansy was also some kind of rival in Transfiguration along with Padma because she had been tutored in the subject before Hogwarts or something like that.

This rivalry with the Patil twins is such that Valeria and Parvati are qualified as the two students that have the most problematic relationship along with Harry and Draco by the time of the inauguration of Lockhart's duelling club and it incites Snape to call them for an exhibition duel along with the two aforementioned boys. It's really interesting to read about the 'brightest witch of her age' still having rivals who sometimes win. The story is linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House). I know it's not exactly what you asked, but it's the closest I got and it's hands down one of the most well-written stories I've read. The first chapters are, allegedly, a bit rushed because the author wants to get to Hogwarts quickly, but this, in my opinion, along with some errors are nothing compared to the way the author shapes the story to differentiate it from the original and the way magic is used is really creative and the possibilities are explored while still sticking to canon or semi-canon material except when the author has to create it completely.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Not sure if Victoria Potter counts as genderbender since she was born biologically female and stays that way, but it's a good "female Harry" fic that includes what you've asked: linkao3(13795605)

Victoria gets into something of an academic rivalry with Hermione in the classes they have together.

No shipping yet, and if I know the author it probably won't happen until the inevitable sequel-fic.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

**** Thanks. With the clarification, disregard my suggestion - though it /is/ really well-done, it would still count.

I see 'genderbender' used more in the Ranma 1/2 way - a character changes genders in-story, either temporarily or permanently.

** It tends to happen a lot in non-Harmonian smart!Harry and fem!Harry fics. I don't have any recommendations off the top of my head, but by searching for those keywords and excluding the Harmony 'ship, you'll find quite a few. In my experience, it usually ends up bashing Hermione or at least rubbing the rival's superiority in the reader's face a lot, but if you're into that sort of thing, who am I to judge?

Generally, my sense is that Hermione's canon personality isn't actually that aggressively competitive: she just doesn't resent others doing things better than her, and she doesn't prioritise being the best at anything, just being good for its own sake. For example, after Harry mastered the Patronus, she didn't rush to learn it; and after Harry got a better DADA grade than Hermione in Year 3, she proceeded to spend a big chunk of Year 4 helping Harry get even better at DADA. In Year 5, she could have probably maximised her own DADA proficiency by organising a small, easily hidden, study group of the best students in the year and inviting some NEWT students to tutor them; but instead, she tried to organise education of as many people as possible.

The only time she resented someone doing better than her---Harry in Potions in HBP---it was because she viewed the HBP book as recklessness and cheating.

Had she been sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, she might have acquired a more "Best or Bust" attitude over time, but that didn't happen in Gryffindor.

That having been said, if events had conspired to put her into a proverbial arms race against one or more rivals or enemies, that could lead to her doing interesting things; I'd read that.
