I get a bit annoyed when fics automatically make Harry and Hermione friends. In HPPS, Harry and Hermione are both kinda desperate for friends, and even then it takes the troll incident for a friendship to form. If they're in different houses, or Harry is more abrasive, it doesn't make sense for them to be friends.

So... I've founding myself enjoying elements of fics where the protagonist (usually Harry) has a schoolyard rivalry with Hermione.

The only such fics I can think of are linkffn(Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts), linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) and linkffn(Growing Up Black).

Can anyone recommend any other fics? No smut and no bashing please.

*** This is a pretty good fic, though flawed (probably the biggest of them is it's too wordy with action scenes - or just too wordy in general). Shame it's been dormant for so long.

** Not directed at OP but similar concept. I remember a smutty story of Harry and Hermione, older like 6th of 7th year maybe 5th, having an academic rivalry, they place a bet and Harry wins, eventually they have Sex and sort of develop a friendly (with benefits) rivalry involving betting sex and stuff. If anyone can find that, It's shortish and I'd like to read it again.
