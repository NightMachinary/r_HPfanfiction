Hi,

I've been looking for a fic for a couple weeks and wanted to ask for help. This fic has Harry and Hermione in love, most likely with a soul bond. However, Ginny refuses to accept this and attempts to separate them. One way this is done by giving Hermione a diary with a cursed medallion embedded in the cover. This was bought from Borgin and Burks by Fred and George. I don't think they were in on it though. Hermione ends up finding out about it and fights it off but is almost killed by a horcrux she was researching at the same time.

That is really as much as I remember about the fic and hopefully it wasn't on Portkey.org (RIP).

Thanks in advance!

Found it! [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/4941/1]]


** I have no idea idea which fix this is, but most of Portkey was archived so you might have some luck there.

*** Thanks, I'll take a look at that. I have an archive of most stories that were on there but didn't know about the website.

** Well I finally found the fic. Turns out it was Harry Potter and the Circle's End. Only took me like two months. Thank God! The fact that I could not remember was driving me insane.
