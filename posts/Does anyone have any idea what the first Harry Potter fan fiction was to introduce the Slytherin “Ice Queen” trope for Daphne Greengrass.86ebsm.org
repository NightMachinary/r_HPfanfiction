****** No idea. Could be that the first fic I read with her in it had her with black hair, which while it wasn't Perfect Situations, could have been influenced by it. Could be that it didn't specify her hair color (or even picked another hair color) and my imagination just decided on black hair for some reason.

***** I always picture her with black hair and either green or blue eyes, even when the story describes her differently. Blonde hair makes her seem more social, extroverted, loud, etc.

***** Huh, okay. That's where I read it earlier but didn't think it was the original version. My bad.

Do you have any idea if they've done any other stories (especially with Daphne as the pairing), besides the sequel to Perfect Situations, which I just finished (I wish there was more than the 20? chapters though!)?

**** I'm a Slytherin. I used to bake cookies, brownies, and other food / sweets and bring them to class to share with everyone. Being charming, generally polite, considerate, and well-mannered also helps others to automatically assume that you're sweet, caring, and kind. Appearances, however, can clearly belie the brains that lurk just beneath the surface...

Another good example of this, in canon, is Tom Riddle. Practically everyone at Hogwarts worshipped him, save for Dumbledore, when he was a Hogwarts student...and yet, he was also a Slytherin. He even managed to fool young Hagrid, Ginny, /and/ Harry with his charm and friendly appearances.

*** She is only mentioned as a name in passing in the series. The most notable thing about her in canon is her sister ends up marrying Malfoy. Her family has mentions in Pottermore, but nothing about her specifically. There is no indication as to what she looks like like, how she acts or if any extra was meant to be her in the movies.

As for lords, Pottermore mentions "the sacred 28" which is just 28 tracably pure-blood familys according to some book. This doesn't make them Lords or any other nobility. I think a lot of that fanon comes from the name "The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" and the general superiority purebloods tend to convey in the series.

All the Lords, inherited Wizengamot seats and all that nonsense is pure fanon.
