** I cant remember the name of it but I come across it every now and again. I can remember snape is married and his wife saved him after he got tortured after being found out as a spy. I think her name was Serena and she became the potions mistress. Pretty sure it was Harry/Ginny.

** linkffn(Reign of Power by Fyrning)

I consider this the pinnacle of indy!Harry stories. The writing can maybe be considered bit dated (15 year old story and all) but the content is superb.

It's worth noting that this story is probably a trope-setter for a very many tropes, though it used them far better than later attempts - not limited to lordships, manipulative dumbledore, parselmagic, soul magic between Harry & Voldemort, a third side to the blood war and many others.

** One of my favorites is complete and it was published on The Sugar Quill a million years ago. It's a Snape/OC romance, but super well written with everyone in character. The OC is really lovable and believable, and the author did a great job of preserving Snape's abrasiveness without going overboard and making him abusive. It's just nice. Harry is written adorably in it too. It's called Beloved On This Earth.

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.

** linkao3(c'est la vie by cywscross)

I've read this at least once a year since the last time it updated (since I found it back when chapter 9 was first published on ff which was...2009 iirc). It doesn't matter that it's unfinished and unlikely to ever /be/ finished. I love going back to it.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** linkffn(Ectomancer) was really interesting. Also haven't heard about linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) on here in a long time, it brought in some nice concepts and did them well.
