I feel like it's a very explored, but incredibly flawed subject. I know that there's crap, but are there any good ones?


** It hasn't updated in a while and I haven't gone back to re-read it lately, but I remember linkffn(Strange Visitors from Another Century) being a good take on the founders.

** Of a linear circle has the founders as a huge part of it. Not the only part, but a huge part. And that whole story is brilliant.

Book 3 focuses on Founders Era. You don't need to have read the preceding books (but obviously it would help and would maybe spoil the story somewhat) but you can read it as a standalone story.

The founders are incredible. They're period accurate to the 10th century. They're from all over the world. Salazar is just amazing I love him. Helga is norse and terrifying. Rowena is stern and commanding. Godric is a beast ðŸ˜Š. It's the 10th century so there's an insight into language, land, kingdoms, titles, Lord's, general living conditions. It's wonderful. I love it so much.

The author also has other side stories that are just about the Founders and how they came to Hogwarts you're interested.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/][Basilisk-Born]] by Ebenbild. Has Harry time traveling to the pre Hogwarts era, then living through the centuries to the present. Some interesting ideas involving the founders. WIP. FFNet
