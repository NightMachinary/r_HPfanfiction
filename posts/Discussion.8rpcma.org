In light of Hermione getting the law passed for better conditions for house elves, what do you think would be a reasonable rate of pay for house elves (including days off). X amount of galleons/ sickles per hour? Per day? What would an elf do with their pay? (providing housing is included in their work) TIA


** A couple of things I think you should consider here, that sort of make what you are saying, and by proxy what Hermione is trying to do in canon, look...fairly arrogant and narcissistic even:

1. This is a problem LOTS of people have, but the idea that house-elves should not only be treated as equals to humans but held to the same standards as humans. Why should they only be paid in galleons? All of what you are proposing /presumes/ that house elves, when given equitable treatment, would want or even desire the same thing as wizards/witches. Its a lot like the conflict Bill mentions in DH: wizards treat purchase of objects as their's for all time, while goblins see their craft as only being 'loaned' to that particular wizard/witch. You, and by proxy Hermione, would be doing the same thing: assuming that /of course,/ given fair treatment, they would want/desire the same things as she or others would. Its a very ethnocentrist viewpoint, which the centaurs are pretty on the money about honestly.
2. Setting a specific 'standard' for how much you pay house elves is perhaps even worse. Think about this: what do you think would happen today if a country decided to pass laws setting a 'minimum' wage or whatever for a specific ethnicity, but was different from every other? Now imagine that the only people who /make/ those laws are not in that ethnicity and have had, on average, far less interaction with that group than others (Hermione's a muggleborn, Harry was muggle-raised, etc.). You may be trying to improve their lives, but what you're saying is trading what master-slave contract with a broader contract, neither of which had anything to do with WHAT THE HOUSE ELVES WANT.

Improving their lives, getting them fair treatment, these are good idealistic goals. But that kind of high-mindedness, where of course you know whats "best" and "right" for others and don't need to ask them because they're slaves and brain-washed, is vain in the extreme.

** In theory an elf shouldn't need to be paid even if Hermione's laws passed. They are housed and fed by the family. If i was Hermione i'd try for stricter laws punishing abuse of an elf rather than try and get them wages, especially since the elfs really don't have anything outside of say food that they'd want to buy.

*** The teachers are housed and fed too, but I still assume they make money. Housing and food justifies a lower wage, but not its complete absence. Maybe they'd want hobbies, or to buy clothes for themselves, books and games, or even just free-time and leisure money. Not treating them like dirt is a start, but slaves that go unharmed physically are still slaves.

**** What I am saying is they are a species of indentured servants that have always been indentured servants as far as we know. We don't know what they like, their is no industry for them and their is no products for them. This isn't like slavery of other people where they can slowly and seemlessly (in theory) start transitioning from being a slave class to being paid lower/middle class where the industry, jobs and other things are basically already their. You would have to work for decades and i mean decades to start training young free elves to start their own inudstry and other products specifically for elves so when you start making laws to free elves they can actually start working and making a wage.

That's why I think Hermione's plans are flawed, she needs to start slowly instead of jumping head first like she normally does, You can't just say "these laws are now in effect House elves should now be free and paid" and enforce them especially after a war. You need to slowly start implementing change over time, What should happen is introduce humanitarian rights for house elves first, say things like "House elves should be given periods of rest of no less than 8 hours a day from working" and "No house elf shall be without food or shelter as it is inhumane" or "Self Punishment and death penalties are now illegal against house elves" once you have those set up you start working towards giving them more things like money and such, but as the wizarding world is now especially in it's current recovery state their isn't much she can do, especially since it is shown that the wizarding world is still recovering from Voldemorts war even during her tenure as minister, she needs to focus on the current wizarding economy before focusing on a minority class, yes she can implement the "human" rights for house elves that are in service, but i highly doubt that she can realistically set laws to free them, give them all jobs/government aid, and set up new markets for them without destroying wizarding Britain's economy first.

** Depends what they do, I suppose, and how many of them there are. You'd have to consider supply, demand, and how much the elves themselves want.
