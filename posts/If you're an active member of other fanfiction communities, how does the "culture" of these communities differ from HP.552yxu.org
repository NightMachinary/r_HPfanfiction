For example, I went through a brief Twilight phase, and honestly, I think Twilight (ironically) spawned some of the best fanfiction out there.

I think it's because while HP fics are constrained by canon characterizations (and departures from canon have to be supported in-universe), Twilight characters were so flat and poorly characterized that it was really easy to just take the entire cast, remove the vampire element, and plop them into a new setting. There were a million different combinations, running the gamut from the pleasantly smutty Bella as Edward's barely legal intern to the genuinely moving Bella/Edward as childhood sweethearts whose marriage fell apart after barely a year. And writers weren't really bound by canon characterization because there wasn't much of it to start.

Obviously it was a pretty brief phase, but even at the time I noticed how different it was from the HP fandom, which operates in a much more intricate (and therefore much more constrained). On the other hand, HP has such a huge number of characters that there are a lot of opportunities to explore and tell the stories of secondary and tertiary characters.

The problem isn't this, I feel. We know that she's hot and that's reason enough for a teenager (or an adult...) to want to date her. Add on the fact that she has a shared interest with Harry (Quidditch), broadly shares his world view (consider reactions of Ginny vs Hermione to Harry cursing Malfoy in HBP), and that they have a history (Chamber of Secrets events) and it's no surprise that Harry ended up dating her.

The problem isn't that they dated. The problem is that they lasted as a couple and got married. But that's a problem with HP generally: far too much successful young love.

I can imagine that Harry wanting to be a part of the Weasley family in a more permanent way as well as desiring to be loved by Ginny due to his crummy childhood. I tend to enjoy post epilogue fics where they spilt up for this reason, I can see the marriage happening but not it lasting forever and ever.

Don't know where jealous comes into this, but when we meet Ginny she's 10 years old wanting to see the hero Harry Potter, then she's still 10 when she sticks her elbow in butter. Then she's 11 when he has Voldemort possess her and almost kills half a dozen people. Then 4 years later she and Harry start dating.

Your complaint of it happening too fast doesn't hold up, that isn't opinion there are years between when she is the awkward kid we meet and when they get together.

I also say she's jealous because imo she uses her first two relationships to get Harry's attention. That's probably more of an interpretation then a fact though.

******* You're absolutely right about not having enough character progression with Ginny, I don't know anyone who would say otherwise. I do think its unkind, and definitely not canon, to say Ginny only dated other people to get Harry's attention. What we do see of her character is that she is a very outgoing person. Dating two boys when she is 14 and 15 is normal behavior.

JK didn't write any romance, and despite having a pretty large number of characters very few have any depth. The only female character who got any significant time is Hermione. After that Ginny, Luna, Fleur, and Tonks are all similar levels of not much for the time they're present.

I admire her that instead of becoming a stalker or a mopping mess, she actually resorted to strengthen herself, make herself useful for his cause, become his friend, and improve her overall standing among the student body.

Some readers expressed dismay that this transformation of Ginny was not written EXPLICITLY by JKR and thus not credible. I disagree. Small hints are occasionally given beginning in GoF, and they became quite extensive in OotP. Also, just because something is not explicitly written by the author, doesn't mean you can't deduct it from other given facts.

Ginny's transformation from a silly fangirl to a strong young woman and finally to a heroine is the key reason I like her so much.

I didn't really like JK's characterization of Ginny or the nature of their relationship. Seems like Ginny is a really safe choice for Harry and it makes a lot of sense for Harry to join the Weasley family. It just seemed to inevitable after HBP, and it wasn't nearly as interesting to read.

That being said, there are some really great canon-compliant post-Hogwarts fics like linkffn(Strangers at Drakesaugh) and linkffn(The First Day) that are good reads.

** I read a lot of Worm fanfiction and i think the biggest difference is the interaction between authors and readers. Most worm fanfics are posted on SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity and it's very easy for fans to ask questions or make suggestions to the authors.

It's a lot easier and more convient than the review section on ffnet or AO3.

The other big difference is that worm fanfic hardly ever gets finished. I believe that's mostyl due to Worm's ending which just isn't all that easy to replicate if you don't want to follow canon to closely and the main antagonist requires a very specific powerset and setting to defeat.

Most fics just focus on the main character getting a different power and/or changing something slightly in the beginning and see how the changes would affect the story. There aren't all that many big AU's and while HP fanfiction often focuses on romance it mostly plays a background role in Worm, if there's any romance at all.

But yeah, the Worm fanfiction community has the distinction of being /the/ place to go if you want to do more than just write some fics in that Universe. That's the upside of it.

The downside is the sheer amount of thought you have to put into even a minor fic as each canon character has such a diverse set of abilities and characterisation (this includes PHO, which could be said to be a character in its own right) that giving your main character a badly thought out power set will get them killed before you've finished writing the intro (which is kinda hard, given that the first real station in canon is a fight with a raging Dragon-man that gets bigger in size and power as the fight intensifies, even the weakest villain on display could tear through a Death Eater squad as if they weren't even there and oh yeah, your average antagonist [Kaiser, Coil, Lung, Jack Slash, Nilbog, Mannequin, Bonesaw, Shatterbird, Echidna, Teacher etcetera] makes Voldemort look like a pussy-and the Endbringers make THEM look like chumps).

And may Khepri help you if you get a character's characterisation or actions wrong without justification.

So to sum up, it's hard to get going but damn it's a fun sandbox to play in! It helps that the whole thing can be found for free [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][here]]. It's a long goddamn read, but oh so worth it.

***** If mrs.insaneone is the author I am thinking of I really like the premise of most of their stories, but their actual writing isn't really to my taste. Lots of telling instead of showing.

*** The Twilight community is a lot less harsh when it comes to judging how someone decides to write a story. Which can be pretty nice but I kind of dislike how quickly good stories will be published but other than that it's pretty great.

** Naruto Fan-Fiction felt very similar, but Worm is radically different. It's a small community, and the canon text is both massive and complex. It's most popular on sci-fi creative writing forums. This all leads to some very detailed investigation into canon mechanics and character development that can get pretty intense.

Most of the works tend to focus on the same main character as the original works, but the ending to canon and the degree to which the community relates with her (at least initially), means that post-canon works are grilled like you wouldn't believe. Heaven help you if you mess up her character. . .

** FFN did a lot of good in bringing communities together and letting them find each other.

But it did kill a few other communities.

Ranma was one of these.

The number of FF written before FFN took over versus the number it holds is night and day.

But in Ranma there was a sense of what ifs.

Since Genma set up so many marriage contracts we usually played in the Which Tendo Girl now? Or Who can Ranma beat up next?

It was a pretty good community to be in. Even the Akane lovers versus haters didn't divide us.

***** It's primarily a plot driven story. There are character building episodes, but they don't really have time to build up people that are likely going to die soon and keep the intensity of the story up as well. I imagine it's a tough balance to write and direct.

** For the most part, I'm a part of the Twilight, Harry Potter and Castle (TV Show) communities.

As mentioned, Twilight is in my opinion fairly receptive to out of character writing, though I'd qualify that as if you're well known within the community, if not, it's difficult to break through. I will say that for all tye types of Twilight fic, there is a dearth of Science Fiction based stories, but also cross overs. That said people will mess with things to a certain degree. To those who might be familiar with fics, try to find a good Lauren or a good Jane. It's very hard compared for some of the other characters.

The other community that I'm a part of is for Castle. That community for all the AUs seems fairly rigid, perhaps on the level of the Harry Potter community or worse. I can't help but feel they don't quite understand the butterfly effect and how that changes things. To give an easy example, in the show Kate Beckett's mother is murdured that becomes the onus for her to drop of out school and attend the police academy, eventually becoming a detective. If there's an AU where she lives, Kate is still oftentimes a detective or an attorney (her parents are/were attorneys so this seems natural) with the same drive. I personally feel there would be not small differences in her personality, but the community won't have it.

** HP fans are very protective of canon in general, and do not like to see any variation. The only variation they seem to accept is a more powerful version of Harry.

On top of which, they have a really strict definition of canon that includes not only the books and movies, but all the stuff on Pottermore as well.

This really limits the writers overall (to really just alternate perspective fics) and harry Sue stories.

It's kind of annoying to me, since the world does have a lot of room for exploration, but non one want to read it.

As for other fandoms: My Little Pony fanfic writers are the only ones allowed to do crossover: and they do a lot, some of which is really good. In fact, I've seen a lot more high-quality fanfic out of that fandom than any other I've seen.

*** I'm one of the ones who preferes HP fanfiction to stick to canon, simply because it's easier to know what to expect from the story. Not that I don't love unexpected plot twists. What I mean is something like this: A story lands Harry in the hospital wing soem ten or so chapters in. The diagnosis is this; his magical core is depleated, because he overexerted himself durring (insert whatever). At that point at least one reader's first thought is "his what now is what?". That's not a nice break to have in your reading experiance. Especially if whaterver story element it is that breaks you out of your flow is something that has never been mentioned before in the story but apparently every reader is expected to know about. "I made an AU and things are this way now because I say so." is a fine concept for fanfiction but a bit of explaination is necessary. If there isn't any it's like playing a game you don't now the rules for. For me at least, it's like this; I will read any number of AUs, UAs, crossovers, anything if they are either well written or explained well enough. The problem is that most aren't, so I usually go for the canon compliant stuff. Also canon compliant FFs tend to have less bashing. I cannot stand bashing. Even just mention of "manipulative old goat Dumbledore" has made me drop fics.

**** I think you have to treat it like you're reading an entirely new book. The first time you read the HP books you probably didn't stop reading to ask questions about what random spell x or y was. You figured it out using context and your understanding of the words.

You kind of have to try and do the same thing with AU fics I feel. The better written ones will help you out, but with the others the onus will be on you.

**** I hear what you are saying. I don't think I have read anything about magical cores, but I know there are enough of those stories out there that it seems like those sorts of tropes have rules of their own, which I don't choose to buy into. And it's as if you have to know those rules to enjoy some of those stories.

I don't ship anyone per se, but I have written several different nods to Dramione simply because I didn't do the right thing as many of you do and ask what was decent to read first. I read awful stuff and then thought about how it might be remotely possible to put those two together. (For many of you the answer is NEVER; I wouldn't try to convince you otherwise.)

I'm sort of curious about bashing, the whys of it. We all probably have that thing we do when we'd rather punch someone---I write stern letters to my governor. Is that what craving bashing is? Or is it something else? That is off-topic, I suppose, but I wonder.
