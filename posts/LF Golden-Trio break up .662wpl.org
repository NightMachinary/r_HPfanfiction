Hey guys,

I am searching for a fic where Harry has a falling out with Hermione & Ron in his later Hogwarts years. Minimal bashing would be appreciated.


** I'd check for Harry/Daphne fics; many authors get rid of the trio so Harry can be with a proper pureblood princess who can then teach him all about how wrong Dumbledore is, and how the mudbloods are ignorant barbarians.

** linkffn(11446957) is one that I am enjoying quite a bit. Starts in his fourth year and he takes a slightly dark path. Not to become a dark lord but more using all types of magic to defeat Voldemort and protect his loved ones. I am a big H/G fan but this is anH/F pairing and seems to be done well.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
