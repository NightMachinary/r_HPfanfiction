I'm imagining it sorta like he'd be able to literally create magical creatures that didn't previously exist, yet in a fight with Voldemort, he'd blank completely and fail at coming up with any ideas.

For example:

Harry stood in front of the Dark Lord, staring at the feared man with wide eyes.

“Uhh...” Harry blurted, “poof?”

A little puff of smoke came out of his hand and dispersed.

Edit: typos


** This sounds like it could be a really fun fic. He does all of these amazing things in class, but as soon as there's a test or it's exam time his mind goes completely blank and he struggles to even do the bare minimum.

Have it as a running theme throughout the story.

But when it's someone else in danger he forgets all about the pressure he's under and pulls something out of his hat.

** So basically the opposite of canon? He's not described as especially powerful or smart compared to others, but outside of Year 5 he's basically /at his best/ when the defecation hits the oscillation.

... My writing skills are, sadly, drawing a blank. I do like the prompt though, it'd make an interesting read to see how he'd make it through year after year of extreme pressure while being completely unable to cope with it.

**** I agree. I think part of his forced mediocrity is his desire to be normal combined with the fact that the books are from his perspective and he sees himself as “just Harry”. He also doesn't really push himself in subjects that he doesn't enjoy. I think overall Canon Harry is more of a people person. When his loved ones are in danger or the world in general, he can summon massive amounts of power from nowhere to protect them, but the everyday stuff he has to work at. He enjoys socializing more than schoolwork and is great at teaching and leading.

**** Grades wise yeah he's mostly average only excelling in DADA (debatably could be Ron's influence, most visible in his choice of electives). Power wise, well we don't quite get a lot of proper comparisons aside from him beating Voldemort at Priori Incantatem, his casting patronus in 3rd year when many NEWT students supposedly can't cast it (albeit that could be some kind of skill/talent instead of raw power, and then he teaches a bunch of kids in the DA which waters this one down), and that he pulls off two of the three Unforgivables with only some minor difficulty.

One major thing to keep in mind is that Harry **wants\** to be average, and as 95% of the books follow his perspective, I suspect that tints the narrative somewhat.

***** I think we've got a good idea. In DH, Voldemort manhandles McGonagall, Flitwick and Shacklebolt at the same time, and Harry was giving him a fight even without the Brother Wands.

As for teaching the other students, Harry got his down very quickly in PoA, he just struggled to use it with the memory effect. Teaching it isn't hard, it's being able to use it when in the presence of Dementors which most of them couldn't in DH. He, comparatively, did it even with a few dozen focused solely on him.

I think the problem isn't just Harry's confidence issues, it's that he compares himself to the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort and even Hermione, with their wider knowledge of magic, and doesn't realise his own strengths in combat magic and combat.

***** Him teaching those students is a testament his talents though. He was tutoring seventh years when he was in his fifth. And in doing so turned seemingly hopeless cases like Neville into proper badasses. He might not have a wide variety of spells, but he was good enough at the spells he knew that he's basically responsible for the training of the bulk of the forces that fought during the Battle of Hogwarts.

** Harry: um, so what do we do now?

Voldemort: I will kill you, but to show my power we will duel and show that I can best anything you can throw at me. Let's see what the 'boy who lived' can really do!

Harry: well, um, expeliuarmus?

Voldemort: that's it? my spies in Hogwarts say you're able to summon dragons from thin air. I guess the reports were exaggerated.

Harry: summon dragons? Yeah! That's a good idea! [summons 3 Hungarian Horntails, they proceed to burn, crush, and eat Voldemort]

** "In today's class, we will discuss Gamp's Elemental Laws of Transfiguration. The first of which is that you cannot conjure food or transfigure non-food objects into food." McGonagall said.

"Why though?" Harry asked.

"Gamp and many other wizards have attempted this over hundreds of years, Mr. Potter. None have been able to do it." She answered.

"But that doesn't mean it can't be done." He argued.

*waves wand and conjures a whole roast pig, apple in mouth, the works and all.*

*entire class stares, jaws drop.*

"H-h-how did you do that?" McGonagall asked.

"Well, we can conjure and transfigure live animals and plants, can't we? Why not dead ones with a few little plants thrown in?" he responded.

later

"Let's duel, Harry Pottah!" Voldemort said.

*Harry proceeds to run around like a chicken with his head cut off.*

"Is this all you've got? You haven't even cast a single spell! I heard that you can break the laws of transfiguration!" Voldemort roared as Harry ducked behind another grave.

"Thanks for the idea!" Harry called.

He stood and ran for the cup, blasting food at Voldemort, managing to spear him through the chest on an ear of rather sharp corn on the cob.

*** As humorous as this is, the law is that you can't conjure or transfigure real food. Any food you do conjure is practically empty, lacking any nutrients, and permanent transfiguration is really really hard, so it wouldn't be worth trying on food. Any partial transfiguration from, say, a plate into a steak would turn back later, cutting up your stomach with shards of plate. So yeah, don't magic the food.

** There's an old fic by Jeconnais called "this means war". It's not on ao3 or ffn, buy if you Google for it it'll pop up. Everyone communicates by email (Mail, excuse me) and Harry's denseness is practically a super power - he can do anything because he doesn't know any different.

The "really bad in a crisis" bit doesn't come into play here.
