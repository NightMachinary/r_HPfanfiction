:END:
1. Series rewrite, quirrel & maybe someone else attack harry in class, and by the time lupin gets there and tries to talk to him after class, no one leaves and they end up with a whole contract/agreement for him not to harm harry. Eventually they talk under a silencing charm with someone else there too.

2. Harry has a special bond form with someone, idk who, but it's similar to one ron has with the twins. Whenever one of them is in serious danger, ron feels it and gets clingy. It's like a twin bond, but amped up and they're more like triplets despite the age difference.

3. I only remember one scene, but it Sirius lives in a cave for a year, and harry gets 2 house elves to help him. Later hes talking to the elves grandparent or parent, and sirius asked who they're talking about. Harry confronts him, saying something like "they helped you for a year and you dont know them?"

4. It's a trial of someone, probably dumbledore/light people, and it brings up figg/filch. Their names are anagrams for something, and they were part of something like a squib extremist group.
