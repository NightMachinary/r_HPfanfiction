All the ones I've found so far have sucked donkey dick. Have any of you read any that you'd recommend? My only real story preference is no slash.


** Honestly, there are only like half a dozen good PJ ff and the only decent hp crossover exists on DLP unpublished.

Aside from that, the only pure PJ fanfic on ffnet I can recommend is linkffn(son of the western sea). The writing is superb and the interactions between characters surpasses every other PJff out there.

  All myths are true. Outside the borders of Western Civilization lies the rest of the world. After the Second Olympian War, a restless Percy Jackson sails for the horizon, and never stops. AU after The Last Olympian. Percy x various mythological figures, het and slash.

** So long as you don't mind them being incomplete (like you could find a complete PJ /anything/) there are a few that I particularly enjoyed.

linkffn(The Aftermath) is a particularly fluffy piece featuring a fem!harry.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze) has some super!Harry and is essentially a fixer!fic for PJO's problems but I still find it fun to read.

linkffn(Godling Ascending) is also a good one. Fem!harry

linkffn(Fenrir: The Rise of the Wolf) is short and slow to update, but very interesting despite that.

Also anything born from the "Twice-Blessed Half Blood" forum challenge is worth a look at the least.

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. There's back-story in the beginning but the main story's post-Hogwarts. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.

  Plans within plans. Wheels within wheels. These were the thoughts and actions of Kronos. A direct assault on Olympus wasn't his only plan. He had contingencies. Unfortunately for him, one particular back-up plan had slipped it's leash some time ago. Now Olympus will see the results of this project. Will it be an enemy or an ally? With the Giants rising, they can only hope.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

  After the defeat of Gaia, the seven heroes finally get a normal life. Or is it six? Find out what happens to Leo and how he'll get back, if he does... Set after The Blood of Olympus by Rick Tiordan. Percabeth, Jasper, Frazel, and Caleo. Rated T because I'm crazy.

** Perseia Jackson has one on ffn where fem!harry is Poseidon's daughter and Percy's older sister. It wasn't bad if I remember, but I can't recall the title. If you search the authors name you might be able to find it, I think it might be a series but I'm not sure, it's been awhile.

*** linkffn(The forgotten daughter by perseia jackson;the sea's daughter: the lightning thief; the sea's daughter: the sea of monsters). The first book is all childhood + hogwarts and the last two is post-hogwarts closely following canon. I don't recommend it since its basically a canon rehash. If you don't mind reading the books again (Most are a direct copy and paste from the books) go ahead,

Engineer4Ever has some, The Ever Twisting Winds is very much like canon however the other two diverge greatly.
