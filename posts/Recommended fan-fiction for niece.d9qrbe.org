I'm looking for some fics for a 12-year-old niece, with high-quality writing. It should be age-appopriate, and preferably not centred around romance. Any suggestions would be appreciated!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351]] was written for an early teenage daughter of the author.

And as always I think stories [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] are the best start for beginners.

Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** linkffn(12713828) Victoria Potter, it fulfills all your requirements, and the protagonist is also 12 at the moment, though its still ongoing.

Otherwise there is the Perfectly Normal Series, it should also fulfill the requirements, while I am not a fan it should be a good read for a twelve year old.

There is pretty much nothing in there, that wouldn't have been in the normal books. The closest scene to violence until now was the troll incident. There are a couple moments with other dangers though, but its nothing that would be too explicit for younger readers.

This is an old one, but I like it. It's a story focussed on Teddy Lupin and his friends and the adventure they get into in their first year of Hogwarts. It gets a bit dark towards the end, but if she read all the original books, well, it does not get truly darker than that.

** What is your preferred rating for your niece? I know its different for everyone. I will probably provide a lot of story with a T (Teen) rating, which vary from author to author on how bad. But if you want a specific rating range that would be nice to know.

If she is a Marvel and Harry Potter fan then Heros Assemble!, linkffn(12307781), would be a fun story for her. Plenty of action throughout the whole story.

Harry the Hufflepuff, linkffn(6466185), and its 4 sequels might be something else that she would like.

Inspected By No 13, linkffn(10485934), is also a fun story.

Make a Wish, linkffn(2318355), is a story I highly recommend. Its a fun story, but there is a reason why its a T rated story. I suggest reading it yourself and seeing your niece could handle it.

Dear Order, linkffn(3157478), is another story that is humor base.

That's the best list I can think of. Hope this list helpful and I think its pretty cool of you to recommend fics to your niece.

**** So after reading through all of them again, which is why it took so long to respond, it doesn't get any darker then the first fic. However there are moments of violence however those are brief and can be forgotten underneath the everything else. I suggest reading it yourself to see if you are comfortable with it. However, if your neice has read most or all of the Harry Potter books then it shouldn't be anything to bad. There are some adult jokes, but unless you know what they are talking about they will go over any kids head.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.

** I don't see why you wouldn't just recommend her normal fics. Maybe not graphic violence or smut but generally those aren't in top tier stories. She's 12 not a child. At 12 I'd already read LotR which is a much more complex read than almost any fic unless they're being retarded and using purple prose to make themselves feel smart.

I'll edit tomorrow with a list once I have time to actually think about it

*** ah, that would be great, thank you! I read many fics, so I don't remember which ones don't have smut/references to smut/too much violence, so I made a post here for some recommendations that would be appropriate.
