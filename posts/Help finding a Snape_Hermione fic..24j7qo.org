About 2 months ago I read a Snape/Hermione fic that I can't get off my mind.

For some reason though all I can remember about it is a scene where Hermione had to stay at Hogwarts over a break and during dinner time she and Snape, after a offhand comment from Snape, started to recite what I believe was A Christmas Carol.

Thank you whoever finds it.


** Oh man. I've totally read this and now I can't remember which one it is. Could it be "Chasing the Sun"?
