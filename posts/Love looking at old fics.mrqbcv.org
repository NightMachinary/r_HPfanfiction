I don't know why but especially after a long time of reading your basic OP Harry Romance whatever it's one my favorite thing to find an old fic. Seeing it was written in 2003 and an Authors note saying how excited they are to pick up half blood prince from Barnes and nobles. I can't think of names off of the top of my head but there were some great fics that were completed before HBP and seeing the different paths people took is so refreshing. Seeing not only a non horcrux Harry but just no Horcruxes, it's a great feeling reading a fic so dissimilar to cannon and it being a great fic.

**** The /Psychic Serpent/ trilogy is a good example of this.

The second installment actually deals with an "House of M"-like scenario, and it's darkly rivetting and unlike anything I had seen before or since.
