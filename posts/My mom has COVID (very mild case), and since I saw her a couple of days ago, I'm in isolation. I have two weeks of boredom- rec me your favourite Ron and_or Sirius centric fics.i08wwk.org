** It always brings a smile to my face when I see a thread like this. Here's my personal recs with a brief description. There's a mix of stuff unfavourable to Hermione but there's a warning added jic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. Updated today!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). It has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Hermione/Ginny-bashing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

(SELF-PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?

  “You can't just burst into my home, Sirius.” Remus's voice quavers, even though he's trying so hard to keep it even. Sirius can see he's exhausted, his face pale and his eyes bright atop heavy, tired bruises. He wonders how long it's been since he properly slept. Not last night, he won't have, but maybe not the night before either, or the night before that. “Would you have let me in?”Remus's silence speaks volumes. Sirius spreads his hands as if in victory.
