** I personally don't know of a fic that fits specifically what you want, but I could make a recommendation. The Harry Potter fandom is a really great stepping stone to fuse with other fandoms. So not specifically a crossover, but other fandoms that are mostly canon with the added HP magical elements.

I definitely agree with you that the world-building potential of the wizarding world is off the charts. Off the top of my head I can recall a few fandoms that pair nicely with Harry Potter elements, though you could most certainly make it work for any fandom. Sherlock, the modern BBC show specifically, has many fanfictions in the canon Sherlock show universe with the added element of magic---John secretly being a wizard the whole time for example. Hannibal, the modern tv show, has multiple stories depicting either Will and/or Hannibal as a wizard. Attack on Titan has majority AU fics with lots of HP fusion options.

If this is something you're interested in, I could recommend a few down this route. So maybe not exactly what you're looking for in terms of OC or minor HP characters, but the ones I'm referencing all usually have little or nothing to do with the canon Harry Potter timeline. If not, I wish you luck in finding what you're looking for! :)
