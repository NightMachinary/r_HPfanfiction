** There is one I'd probably call my absolute favorite: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). linkffn(The Skitterleap) is also pretty good.

For AUs that follow canon a bit more closely, or are point of departure fics I recommend: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; What You Leave Behind; Forging the Sword; By the Divining Light; Conloadh's Song; Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone).

For outside Britain, there are the Alexandra Quick stories set in North America in, I think, mid-2000s early 2010s: First is linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

I'm sure I will think of more later.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

Total AU (canon characters in medieval times, or the muggle world, or whatnot) or divergence (what if Snape hadn't joined the Dark Lord, what if the Potters' had survived, what if Harry was a Slytherin)? Time frame (Riddle Era, Marauders Era, Trio Era)? Etc etc.

** I think my favorite AU ever (and it is /very/ AU, which I honestly don't typically enjoy...but this one is amazing) is Runaway Love by WhtChoc. It's a Marauder's AU, but there's no magic...I think the reason I like it is that it does something very different with the characters, but at the same time those characters still /feel/ like they aren't completely OOC.

  AU. At the prestigious private University of Percy Academy, James Potter is a rich, hotshot second year grad student who has no time and patience to deal with lowlife rejects like Lily Evans.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor]]) This is completely AU but my god it is one of the best Harry Potter fanfics I've ever read. Very realistic, rational and absolutely amazing politics and innovation. Loved it, try the first 3-4 ch before judging.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
