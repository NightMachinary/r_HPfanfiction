"Ah the Devils Snare just wanted to give you a cuddle, it wasn't trying to kill you" "Oh the Willow was just trying to give you a High Five Harry" any dangerous plant, Neville is somehow breeding it, friends with it, and makes excuses for it when it's clearly dangerous to others.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

**** They're just friends. Truth be told, the real reason that all of Harry's friends are female is because I find it easier to write girls. This is more than I would usually say, but I may as well confirm now that it will not be a Harry/multi fic

** "And here we have the Gympie-Gympie," Neville started explaining. "A rather beautiful plant native to Australia."

"But isn't that also nicknamed the suicide plant," stated a young second year voice fearfully. "I heard from my pa that some soldier killed himself after using the plant to clean himself."

"Nonsense!" Exclaimed Neville. "This plant only wants some love, and care. That poor soldier was probably defending this plant from some enemy soldiers, and sadly died," finished Neville.

Most of the kids seemed relieved after that explanation, but the young second year girl knew differently. After all, she was a transfer from Australia, and the Gympie-Gympie is a plant that her pa has warned her about plenty of times. Was Professor Longbottom trying to kill them all, or did he truly not see the dangers some of these plant pose to us...?

*** "Kids I have something to tell you about uncle Nev"

"What is it da?"

"Never listen to him when it comes to plants and the like, he's like... He's like my friend Hagrid with animals"

"Ohhhh but are you sure? I mean all your stories about Hagrid like the Hippogryph and the Dragon and the Black End Screws? I mean they all aren't THAT bad"

"It's Blasted End Skewts and that's because I tone them down because you're not a adult, you remember my scale with Hagrid if he tells you about a beast?"

"Yeah yeah, if he says it's gently its deadly, if he says it's interesting it's dangerous, if he says its cuddly it can hurt you without noticing and if he ignores it, it's likely not that bad but keep an eye on it"

**** Nah, Harry is the boss of the group because they all use him as the Guinea pig. Medical? Obvs reasons why. Animals and plants? He is ambushed by them always, due to his shitty luck. Thus, Harry always carry around a flask of alcohol. 'Too sober for this shit'

***** the group of unlikely people flock to the guy who most likely will survive anything. People thought Harry was the most normal person until they realized that Harry's choice of friends is same as Hagrids choice of pet.

"Exploding Seamus, mad medic Hermione, every creature is cute Hagrid, terror twins, Gluttony Ron, Plant demon Neville, unstable prison escapee Black, loony Luna, red hot Habanero Ginny, crazy dragon guy Charlie, crazy free elf, unstable black elf, mad eye moody, and tomb raiding curse breaker Bill, it's a sad day where the most normal is the werewolf Lupin. Yeah, Harry thinks his friends are just quirky and kind people who will never hurt you. Yeah, Harry choice of friends is as skewed like Hagrids cute pets. If he was normal he won't collect the most unlikely heroes. Crazies attract crazies."
