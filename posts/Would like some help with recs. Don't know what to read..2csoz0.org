So I recently found this subreddit and I gotta say I've been impressed with some of the recs here. I have a pretty set taste on what I like. I really don't like super powered Harry where he can kill Voldemort with a snap of his finger. I really like James Spookie and his stories, also stories by Zeitgeist84 are among my fave stories. Just recently finished His Angel by durararaaa, and I gotta say Fleur and Harry are a GREAT pairing so does Harry/Daphne and Harry/Susan. Obviously if done correctly, then again so goes with any pairing. So if anybody has any suggestions that feature Harry that isn't GODLY powerful, but REALLY good at what he does as an Auror like in Zeitgeist's stories, has a long length, 100+, good pairing/romance (no slash please nothing against it but it doesn't suit my preferences), and it is complete. Thanks everybody that helps!!!!


** I recommend Dumbledores army and The Year of Darkness. It's Neville's year at Hogwarts under Snape and the Carrows and it's wonderful.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]

Epic adventure with some romance (Harry/Fleur). Harry is really powerful, but so are his opponents. It's really fucking awesome, imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]]

Harry kicks a bunch of ass in this one too. All kinds of powerful, but again, his enemies are too. You'll have too endure some bashing as it's an older story. Harry has a few short relationships with OCs.

*** For Bungle in the Jungle, be patient with the bashing. Without giving spoilers, Harry suffers from a bad case of unreliable narrator. Not everyone is /actually/ cartoonishly evil.

*** Try Bungle in the Jungle. It might not catch. I say, let it sit till you're at a lull of good fanfic, and give it a good try. It's what I did, and it takes some getting used to. It's hard to get started. But once you've started, it's truly awesome.

**** This finally convinced me to start reading Bungle in the Jungle. I avoided it for the longest time as I usually dislike how people write Luna.

Grammar and writing are sometimes somewhat poor, but I've seen much worse stuff, and I love the plot!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][The Hero Trilogy]] by joe6991

Haven't read it myself, but it's an epic trilogy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by jbern

Very good, Harry gets his fathers memories after third year and teams up with a vulgar Sorting Hat to kick ass in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry/Fleur.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight The Coming Darkness]] by jbern

It's weaker than his other big stuff, but it's still pretty good imo and it's Harry/Susan.

I'll trawl through my favs later.

** Heyo! I actually started a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1u5d2k/looking_for_fics_with_unusual_or_noncannon/][thread]] months ago for non-canon non common Harry/? pairings. This includes Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne. If you thought "His Angel" was good, you'll definitely enjoy the other H/F stories I listed (because His Angel is terrible, and the ones I've recommended are about a thousand times better in terms of writing quality, cliche management, and character development).

*** I saw that thread, and I found A LOT of the recs to be really good. I've read The Lie I've Lived and all the usual suspects that come to mind. So I'm looking for anything more. I find it surprising you find His Angel to be bad. I quite like it. Fleur is imho well characterized, the only few things I find disagreeable is that it is quite slow, and that Harry is a bit too meek.

**** To each his own I guess, I couldn't enjoy the fic. I tried at least 5 times, got to the point where Mrs. Weasley tries to steal Harry's cash and wants him married to Ginny, and I just quit for the last time. To me, it's the quintessential HP fic that gets so many reviews and views despite it being absolutely horrible.

When A Veela Cries is /amazing/ (especially after chapter 6, where it hits a huge spike in writing quality).

Also, if you like Game Of Thrones/A Song Of Ice And Fire, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]] is legendarily great. It's an amazing HP/GOT crossover, featuring Harry/OC. I check it daily for updates, and have read it like 10 times. It's so fucking good.

*** I have....unfortunately most HP/F are harem stories and Fleur is made into a super bimbo. Really off-putting imho. HP/D on the other hand are a bit hard to come by. There was a wonderful thread I found earlier, however not all of the stories are to my liking :/

**** The only good Harry/Daphne story I know is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Contracts][The Marriage Contracts]]. I haven't read it in a while though, so I can't really vouch for its quality.

As for Harry/Fleur, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] which is pretty light and has some good wit.
