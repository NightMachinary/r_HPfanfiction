** Colin had found his way around the 5th floor looking down into closed off courtyard. He could see no entrances or exits. In fact it was only this window he had found on accident behind a portrait that could even view the courtyard.

It had a broken down statue in the courtyard. Glancing down he set up his camera to take a photo of this hidden little courtyard.

"Strange, I thought it was looking the other way?"

The statue was turned towards him its angular face staring at the window with a malicious smile.

Lifting up his camera he frowned again. On looking closer it was an almost mocking smile in fact. Snapping off a photo he shrugged and moved on.

It should be interesting to see what others thought of this statue. While it was creepy what harm could a picture of an angel be?

**** I know for a fact that there's at least one Dr. Who crossover featuring a Weeping Angel on the loose in Hogwarts. Can't remember what it's called, though.

There's also a chapter in the epilogue of The Arithmancer series where a boggart turns into a Weeping Angel during Defense class.

** Colin was walking down the corridor, taking pictures excitedly, eager to show his father more of the Magical world, when he heard a noise and took a picture, not seeing what it was, he later checked out his camera, and then proceeded to ask the Mediwitch for a cure for his pain. He'd accidentally taken a picture of Professor Umbridge in the showers. The only cure, Obliviation and burning the Camera, it was tainted by such an evil sight.

** Colin was strolling down the Hogwarts corridors, when he found a window upon the hallway. He had taken at least 146 photo's that day, and had decided to make it an even 150. He stared at the beautiful sight the window provided, leading to the Hogwarts grounds, covered in snow. It truly was a beautiful sight. After taking his photo's he had realized something odd when he had reviewed the photo's though, it was a small patch, close to the Forbidden Forest. He could see the faint outline of something, perhaps another's body? It seemed to be a small detail that didn't matter, so he decided to try and walk on, to ponder the conundrum later.

But that's when the screaming started.

He had heard screams before. Some of when he had entered a room at an inopportune time. Others when they were scared to death, he had even heard the screams of a young Mandrake, but these screams scared him more than others. They sounded like someone that had a furious anger at an unfortunate fate but held fear and pain within it. Something caught his eye through the window, A figure bounding through the woods. From the blur, he could discern a lanky figure, it's arms /far/ out of proportion with the rest of it's body and a unnaturally large jaw, and it was sprinting directly towards Hogwarts.
