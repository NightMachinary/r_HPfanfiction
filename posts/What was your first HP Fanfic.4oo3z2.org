To steal a topic from the Naruto FF subreddit, what was your guys' very first Harry Potter Fanfic? What was you're experience with it? Was it good, bad, or disturbing?

Personally, I think it was either [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]], or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]]. For HPMOR I liked it for quite a while, then stopped liking it as much, and eventually I dropped it. Oh God Not Again had me laughing my ass off for hours, and is probably part of the reason I love comedy based fics.

** Mine was some fic where Vernon beat Harry until he passed out and was somehow saved by Voldemort, who had somehow fallen in love with Harry.

Yeah, NOT a good fic.

** Mine was linkffn(Echoes Of Power), I really liked it but it is sadly abandoned. It's worth the read anyway, as far as I remember.

  Harry mysteriously disappeared at age 6, and then benefited from years of tutoring from an old family friend. With the return of Voldemort, it's finally time for 15 year old, trained, somewhat cynical and sarcastic Harry to return. Full summary inside

** Mine was a nineteen years fic, cant remember the name. I had just finished the books then and i was like 'Noooo. This can't be it.' So I hit the google. It was all i had before I realised it was 'fanfiction' and discovered what that was. In hindsight, it wasn't very good.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
