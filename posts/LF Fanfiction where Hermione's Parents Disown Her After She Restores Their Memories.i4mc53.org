Either Hermione gets disowned by her parents or gets into major trouble by the Ministry for memory charming her parents. I don't mind anything as long as Hermione pays for what she did to her parents.

** Does it have to be the focus of the fic? I am currently reading one (a Star Wars crossover) where Hermione's dad dies while mindwiped in an accident, so when Hermione restores her mother's memories, her mother blames her for her father's death and also, the whole mindrape thing, and demands Hermione wipe her memories again so she doesn't have to know Hermione.

*** Does Hermione do the logical thing and remove the memory of her confessing?

**** Like I said, it's an aside. She's very hurt, and does exactly what her mother wants and leaves her mother in Australia. Then she finds a way to travel to the Star Wars universe. This is in the first few chapters, and I'm still reading it.

** The way you phrase it makes it sound like she was being malicious... she was saving their lives.

But I'm not against the premise of the fic, it's a neat idea.

*** Wasn't it malicious though?

It isn't discussed too much, but what reason would she have to erase their memories so drastically as to wipe out their personalities?

If she convinced them of the danger and they just moved, they'd have been just as safe. That implies it was done against their will, which imo is one of the worst things you could do to someone.

**** No, because by erasing their memory there is nothing for the Death Eaters to obtain. If they went into hiding it could work. I honestly think she wanted them to just have a happy life and not have to mourn their daughter. She was ready to die like Harry was

** Little nitpick, given that it's impossible to restore obliviated memories short of torturing them into insanity, that Hermione's parents had false memories implanted instead of simply missing memories, and that Hermione later says she has never performed an obliviation, Hermione likely used a different spell than Obliviate, along the lines of a spell that implants false memories.
