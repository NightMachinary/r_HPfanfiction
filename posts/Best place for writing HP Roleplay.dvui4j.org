Tumblr used to be great for it but there are hardly any Harry Potter rp blogs that aren't cosplayers. Looking to rp as a canon character, not an oc.


** [[http://www.enchantedhogwarts.net][Enchanted Hogwarts]] is very good. Forum-based, rather than a blog. Takes both canons as well as OCs. Everyone starts out with an OC though, so they can be sure people will stick around for long enough to play the canons, since a lot have intertwined histories and all.
