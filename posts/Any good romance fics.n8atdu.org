I dont really care about the pairing, just a long slow burn romance. I don't want any of that shit where they get together after like 3 chapters into the story. there needs to be chemistry between the characters and actual tension. any recommendations?


** linkffn(contractual invalidation) I love this one. It's possibly the only married he contract fic worth reading.

linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) Almost but not quite a romance. Well worth the read. Two people just as broken as the other and so, so beautiful.

*** Heh, for your tastes, all kinds of stories are too slow ;). But I definitely second the recommendation.

What I will say is, Don't pay too much attention to the summary; I reckon it's misleading. It makes the story sound really melodramatic like a soap opera, which it isn't. The best way to tell if you'll like it, I think, is to just read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.

Take a look at [[http://commonplacebook.com/art/books/word-count-for-famous-novels/]] ... is the plot really sufficient to carry novel as long as The Order of the Phoenix (257,154)? This is really simple boy-loves-girl, girl-loves-boy, they-have-their-issues-and-then-they-get-together. Nothing against that, it is a sweet story, but in length it should be somewhere closer to “Sense and Sensibility” (119,394) and certainly not twice as long, and it shouldn't be also longer than three-stories-in-one “Jane Eyre” (183,858) or “Little Women” (183,833).

***** I enjoyed Sense and Sensibility, and Jane Eyre, but I don't have a problem with books being longer than them.

/Could/ it be trimmed and still convey the story? Certainly. Would that be /better/? Debatable; some would be more inclined to read it because it requires less investment of time, others would be saddened by the loss of details. Is it /essential/ to pare it down? I'd say not.

****** I am not about loosing details, but every sentence either helps to carry the plot (and that includes building characters, tension, everything, I am not an action-hero simpleton) or it bores a reader uselessly. Every plot has only so much text it is able to give energy to: if you prolong the story from Christmas to June, just because you don't know how to write “And then for five months nothing serious happened.” (looking at you linkao3(17777138)), then you have some seriously pissed of readers. Or if you cannot decide which of the fives takes on one story you make, so you put all five of them in your story (linkffn(5141159), and I blame the sin of serialized writing here), then you can destroy even a lovely story. “Grow Young With Me” does nothing so obviously horrible, but there is a lot of fat to cut and lot of unnecessary subplots to remove.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

** If you have any interest in Wolfstar, I'd highly recommend All the Young Dudes as a largely canon-compliant slow build romance (among other things) and Blends as a non-magical AU slow burn romance. Both feature excellent chemistry and lots of tension between Sirius and Remus.

Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??
