*** It's weird. Hermione doesn't appear to possess any emotions in this fic.

** If you don't mind crossovers, I just found a fic earlier today that pretty perfectly fits what you're looking for: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30306/DreeHarper+A+Moment+of+Grace.htm][A Moment of Grace]] by DreeHarper. Its a crossover with the television show Angel.

** As I wrote on the other thread, canon Hermione is plenty pragmatic, cunning, and even socially savvy (later in canon, anyway); more so than canon Harry, Ron, and Draco put together, anyway. It can be hard to remember that, because a lot of fanon has as either

- an inflexible, authority-worshiping rule-monger, incapable of independent thought (until the protagonist teaches her to "think for herself"); or
- an overly moral and moralistic ing√©nue who can't hurt a fly (and desperately needs a strong protector);
- or both;

so, frankly, I'd settle for her displaying those "Slytherin" traits up to her canon level, but where she isn't anybody's sidekick.

There were threads asking for recommendations on Slytherin!Hermione a few days ago and a few months ago ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ai5ww/can_anyone_point_me_towards_any_slytherin_harry/]]).

I guess one could add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons][Remedial Lessons]] to that, because Hermione, while still a Gryffindor, is utterly ruthless in it, though that fic is a bit of a hodgepodge, being a one-shot that got extended.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/][/A Necessary Gift/]] just updated. It has a Hermione in Slytherin (albeit with a sort of a protector in the form of time-traveling Harry), but in the latest chapter, it looks like the author might be doing something interesting with that, so we might get a Slytherin!Hermione. (Well, that, or she might get fridged.)

** It's not Slytherin!Hermione but A Simple Case of Death features a close relationship between Hermione & Snape that is turning into a romance - this is set like 10 years after DH though so no creepin, it's actually believable and I usually abhor pairings like that. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10982480/1/A-Simple-Case-of-Death]]

However, it is a WIP, updating regularly and currently though, and is also a crossover with House MD, and I know that sounds unbelievably stupid, but it's quite good.
