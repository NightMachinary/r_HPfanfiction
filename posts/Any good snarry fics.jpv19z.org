** Just one question:

I don't blame you nor care for your preferences in fanfiction material... But for the life of me, I can't understand the Snarry pairing it just doesn't make sense to me I read one on accident because it was a WBWL story and I had no idea what Snarry ment so please can you give me a reason why this pairing should work in any way shape or form?

***** As I said it's fiction. He doesn't have to be 18 years older, doesn't have to hate him, doesn't have to have been in love with his mom. Even then plenty of people find enemy to lover or teacher/student relationships entertaining as long as they're fantasy/roleplay.

****** I know that it's fiction but there has to be a reason why people read and enjoy it hell if you google "Harry Potter WBWL fanfiction" open the "Twins, Twins, Twins" fanfiction.net page sort fiction rating "All" and sort by Reviews it's the second one from the top.

- there you go another Snarry fic for you

******* Well it varies from person to person and my experience isn't universal. But as I said some examples are people who like enemy to lover and teacher/student stuff

*** There are all sorts of readers out there. I'm not a Snarry shipper but I am a Drarry one and many similar questions are asked about why people ship them (usually in a much more judgmental and contemptuous manner than you). Yet I see people shipping Harry/Bellatrix and Harry/Narcissa and I don't go and harass them about it. (Not saying you're harassing anyone - you're not - but just in general.) There are people who don't like romance at all, people who don't like fluff, time travel, OCs, etc.

Taste is subjective. I see people saying 99% of slash is trash but I see them recommending fics where Harry is an edgelord with a harem who doesn't resemble Harry at all except his name (which is probably Hadrian so not even then). I'd like to see them reading a quality slash fic and then saying it's trash.

Also, while I agree the part about Snape being Harry's teacher and having loved his mom can be seen as perturbing, I don't think it makes them being in a relationship completely implausible. There is a certain appeal (not saying I feel it personally, just in general) about authority figures and the whole enemies to lovers trope is a huge thing. And there are time travel fics where people get around that.

**** I don't get Harry/Bellatrix, Narcissa, Harem either Harry/Draco I can understand if both characters are gay, I don't read them because I don't enjoy boy/boy stories, ! but to each their own ! , I generally have a problem with a ship if it doesn't make sense, for example, Harry/Luna whilst luna is a nice girl I just can't see them as more than a Big brother looking out for his little sister who gets bullied for her weird obsession.

Thx for answering my question.

  But to each their own

Yeah, I think that's the kind of attitude we all need to have. I don't really get Harry/Luna either; people talk about them like she's perfect for Harry and they had an amazing connection in canon and I'm like...really? Yes, they had some sweet moments but they screamed platonic to me. I think it's obvious Harry likes popular, athletic girls like Cho and Ginny while Luna is way better off with someone who shares her passion for the fantastic like Rolf Scamander. I get Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks even less. But everyone likes different ship dynamics and the beauty of a huge fandom like HP is that there's something out there for everyone.

  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

  Upon waking up, Severus finds himself not recovering from Nagini's bite, but healing after a long-term mysterious illness. Not only must he uncover the mystery of the cause of his affliction, but also deal with his lover, who is the very last person he wanted to ever see again: Harry Potter.
