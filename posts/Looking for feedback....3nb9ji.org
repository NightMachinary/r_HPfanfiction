Okay, first something needs getting out of the way.

This is an alt account for [[/u/PredalienPlush]] who many months ago asked for feedback on the first entry into this, so I'm not taking credit for his work, as I /am/ him It's been over a year but I'm finally back at it. I just thought I'd make an alt account to deal solely with the fanfiction community as I thought it might get confusing having a separate reddit account name from the fanfiction name. That and... well, I'll be honest, alot of my friends are hardcore LOTR fans who would love nothing more to see me posting here by the account name they know and trolling this place about how "better LOTR" is.

Anyway, with that out of the way, here's the link to the story. Hoping for some feedback, constructive criticism (plus this would get it a bit more views than usual) Any and all comments are vital. Enjoy, and maybe view the original story if you haven't, several distinguished fanfiction authors gave me crucial advice on it the last time I asked, for which I am still grateful.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter of Slytherin house's second year begins off hectically, to say the least. Isolation from his friends, ominous warnings of a danger to Hogwarts and all of it's inhabitants? It was sounding like this year would be even more eventful than the last.
