** Probably because a lot of us don't even know who this "DR" person is. I assume it's from Cursed Child, but I only know enough about it to know I don't want to know more.

People aren't going to down-vote a pairing they know nothing about, but HG/SS has a long, divisive history, and people have a lot of strong feelings without really needing any more information.

** It's okay because Delphini Riddle isn't a real character... because The Cursed Child isn't real either. :)

** I personally haven't seen a single hp/dr pairing post on here yet, but hg/ss is seen often.

Canonically makes 0 sense.

Is weird.

And this is the worst excuse to defend your fav pairing that I see often. "But this other fucked up pairing doesnt get as much as much hate as my fucked up pairing so what's the big deal guys?!??!"

** I've literally never seen that pairing, but I pretty much only get fic recs from this reddit. So I don't think it's the community here that doesn't like SS/HG that are fine with HP/DR.

However, I do think HP/DR would be less creepy than SS/HG since Snape was Hermoine's teacher since she was 11, and Harry wasn't Delphini's teacher.

** Literally no one asks for DR fanfics, though. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=delphini&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][Delphini is rarely, if ever, mentioned on the sub.]]

** I've literally never seen a Harry/Delphini fic (probably because I avoid anything CC-related), but this sub is perfectly fine with Harry/Bellatrix, for example, while downvoting HG/SS to hell, and doesn't it stink of hypocrisy?

I don't read Snamione anymore, but from what I remember, most of the fics take place post-Hogwarts when the characters are both adults or have Hermione time-travel to the past. So this knee-jerk reaction people have is completely unwarranted. What happened to the "ship and let ship" concept?
