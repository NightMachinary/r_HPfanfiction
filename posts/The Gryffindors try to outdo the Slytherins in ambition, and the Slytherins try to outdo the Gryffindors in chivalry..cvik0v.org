Tired of pureblood politicking and backroom schemes, the students of Gryffindor set out to beat the Slytherins at being Slytherin, setting out to invent, innovate, and make Hogwarts (and soon, the /world/) a better place.

But independently, tired of their high-and-mighty and patronising attitudes, the Slytherins set out to out-Gryffindor the Gryffindors, setting out to be dignified, polite, helpful to other students, and bringing as much order to Hogwarts as possible.

Not sure any of those are traits of the stereotypical Gryffindor.

*** Well, the point /is/ that the Gryffindors aren't being Gryffindor enough, so the Slytherins are being /more/ Gryffindor to show them up.

**** But he's right, Gryffindor's trait is courage. Chivalry is brought up all of once., and dignity, politeness, helpfulness, and order aren't even a thing at all. In order to be the platonic ideal of Gryffindor, you have to perform a lot of brave deeds, the thing Gryffindor prized most and wanted to admit students based on.

***** ~checks the sorting hat songs~

Fair enough. But, what kind of opportunity for bravery should there be in a school? I suppose there's the traditional 'The DADA teacher turns into a villain' at the end of every school year...

****** The tradtional DADA teacher attack, the traditional Voldemort/Death Eaters attack, the traditional Care of Magical Creatures lessons with Hagrid attack, the traditional going to class risking your life on the moving staircases attack. Really, just going to Hogwarts is an act of bravery, the castle might as well actively try to kill the students.

****** It's can also be brave to not hide who you are and to campaign for what you believe in. So the strongest of Flat Earthers, the most ardent anti-vaxxers, the most leftie of liberals, the most free-market of capitalists, and most whale-saving of environmentalists (it is the 90s), etc.

And probably someone standing up for those people who just want to go about their schooling in peace!

*** Mm-hmm. Originally I was going to repeat my '[[https://redd.it/6jx3m2][Slytherins are hilariously ambitious]]' request from a while back, with the wacky (and doomed to failure) attempts at world domination and everything, but I figured that asking for a twist like this would be even better.

** You know, i always had a very odd thought. The House's are split.. but we barely see any of the characters. What if.. 95% the students.. the say 1900 not named over years. are just calm relaxed and no where as brash, dueling etc. lol

â€‹

Not saying they aren't in the house's for reasons.. But syltherin wall flowers who great at manipulation and ambition, Gryff's who are calm and brave, but dont end up brash. Raven claws who are smart but dont love books and are shit at applying themselves lol or hufflepuffs who value hard work, and honesty, but crap at teamwork.

** Slytherin's always got the rough end of the deal when it came to houses. I mean, if you want to be cunning, resourceful, amitious, and be a good leader, aren't people skills the first thing you'd think of to develop? But why are all Slytherins brainless snobs (or, in the case of the movies, dim-witted, brainless snobs)?

It's pretty obvious that they just needed to be the bad guys for plot reasons, so I welcome any attempt at showing them in another light. Slughorn, as feeble as he is, is pretty much the only genuine Slytherin in the entire series, maybe disregarding a young TR.
