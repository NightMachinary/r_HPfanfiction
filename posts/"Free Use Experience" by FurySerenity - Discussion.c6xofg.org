** The "Free Use Experience" - a 297,797 word smut fic about a free use fetish in which not a single one of the hundreds of sex scenes involves free use.

*** Huh, that makes it sound better. The whole "forced to volunteer" thing seems so abhorrent to me.

** Oh dog, is that the one with the horrible, terrible, very bad worldbuilding trying to justify why Hogwarts would allow this, and why students would want to participate?

It's been ages since I looked at it, but it came off as a drawn-out bait-and-switch that built up for several 100k words but never actually went anywhere. All bait, no switch.

*** Yeah, it's one of these smut fics that feels like it still needs to pass through all the indy!Harry stations (or at least their AU equivalents), including extended multi-chapter courtroom scenes, with most chapters either starting or finishing with a fairly generic, quite repetitive smut scene.

All of it ostensibly building up towards the titular free use experience--but the moment said experience arrives, the fic is promptly abandoned.

**** Yeah, the pacing was so bad in that one. I recall that the first part of the story was set in the summer holidays, which dragged on and on and was chock full of exposition. I skipped to the end out of morbid interest and wasn't surprised at what I found, basically the author's self indulgent fanfiction checklist.

** It's one of those smut stories that really tries to flesh out the world of the characters. Unfortunately that world is a ridiculous farce that gets stupider the more you think about it and you will feel more shame in actually reading it than you will for wanking to the decidedly average smut.

** Among all other stories why is this the one that deserves discussion?

The guy is stuck in teenage fantasies and doesn't like when other points obvious flaws in his plot and logics to the point when he just removes comments he dislikes.

*** Someone made a request thread. I had something I wanted to say about it. I couldn't say it in the request thread because of Rule 9. Thus this thread.

*** I hate authors like that. Removing abusive comments sure, but regular criticism should never be censored.

** Is it too late to mention all the fics that the author writes, but he never finishes one.

Smut filled with cliches and bad writing.
