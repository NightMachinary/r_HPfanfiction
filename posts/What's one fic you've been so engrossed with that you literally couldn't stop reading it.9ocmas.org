A fic that you found so engrossing and so mesmerizing that you couldn't stop until you've read all the chapters that existed. The dialogues and words that you followed with abated breath keen to read on and find out more. The characters that you followed with anticipation not because you liked them too much but because they were just so interesting. The plot that glued you in place making you more and more excited as you read on.

What was the story that made you feel this much?


** Blindness - linkffn(10937871). It was completed recently, and I have a strong "Can't start a fic unless it's completed" policy. I plowed through it in... 3 days? Four? Somewhere around there. Around work, school, and such, it's all I was reading.

10/10, would read again.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I stopped reading it early on, not sure if I should pick it back up, my main problem that stopped me from reading more was a chapter where *Spoiler* Remus and brought from the veil Sirius talk about "Mia" and a time turner, with the implication being that in the past this Mia/Hermione character told them it, and how Hermione is going to seek it out in their future. But this means that whatever this MIA has done when Hermione traveled to the the Marauders era didn't actually impact the future. I do not feel like reading a time travel story where the main characters do not want to "mess with the timeline".

So my question is, with as little spoilers as possible, will Hermione be seeking to change the future? get rid of Horcruxes/Voldemort? stop the death of James and Lilly etc, or will she just try to keep things the same as they happened in the timeline before she traveled in time?

**** Um. Yes?

I guess, and obviously spoilers ahead, very limited things change, and virtually nothing does before PoA ish. That's not to say she doesn't want and try to change things, but the fic sticks to the idea that some things have to happen to ensure the triumph of the Good. Most of the “present day” stuff revolves around emotional matters, with much more happening in the “past”. It's actually more a Marauders era fic than anything. I really adored it.

** Personally I felt this when I first read The Prince of Slytherin. The plot with its foreshadowing and mystery. The characters that were familiar yet differrent and kinda realistic too. The writing style and the delivery was just too brilliant. It was just so interesting, just so exciting that I couldn't put it down, staying till 3 am when I had morning classes the next day just to finish it.

And more recently Reign of the Serpent made me feel all those things all over again. I entered not expecting much and on the 1st chapter I was hooked. I had to know what would happen next. I had to find out what was going on. I just couldn't take my eyes off. Every new chapter bringing new anticipation and new eagerness within.

Of course there are a lot more stories I've been engrossed by but with the rare few it was just too impossible to put down.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** For me, it was more the fics I saw early on that I couldn't put down more so than their quality. HPMOR, which I still mostly like, was that for me. But I also tore through an alarming amount of robst's stuff before I knew any better.

Fics that I couldn't put down /and/ would still unambiguously recommend include Browncoat, Green Eyes, Nightmares of Futures Past, and the Protection From Nargles duology.

** Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills by Jocelyn. It's still one of my favorite fics ever. It has one of my favorite interpretations of the Snape and Harry relationship, a believable Harry/Ginny, no needless deaths (but believe me, there were a few tearjeakers, and developed a Hermione/Ron relationship that I truly enjoyed. My only complaint was that the ending was a little rushed but that's because so much took place in the sixth year. Ugh, now I want to read it again.

** I will never stop talking about how much I love linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation). The writing quality is really good, it's dark but in an interesting and in my opinion realistic way after the war, and I'm engrossed every time I read it. It's incomplete which drives me crazy but otherwise my all-time favorite. Secondary shoutout to linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) which someone else mentioned, but I just re-read it since I learned there are sequels and wow is it good also.

** "Secret Language Of Plants" by Endrina. It's on Archive Of Our Own and it is probably the best fanfiction I've ever read. It's in three parts, the first part being "The Meaning Of Dandelion" iirc. The three parts are "The Meaning Of Dandelion" "The Meaning Of Mistletoe" and "The Meaning Of Geranium" is the last part.

It is long. Like 200k words for the last part. And it's AMAZING. A retelling of Harry's entire life, but with one change - when Harry was sent to the Dursleys, Snape checked up on him, out of grief and guilt, saw that he was being abused and then kidnapped him to live with the one person no one would consider he would work with: Remus Lupin. Snape isn't shitty although he was still a Death Eater, he has a real redemption arc and is much better. Snape and Lupin actually fall in love and therefore Harry is raised knowing he is loved and important and should never be harmed and so he doesn't have that sense of sometimes-dangerous pride, suffering in silence type thing. Basically Harry is raised away from the Dursleys and also hidden away from Dumbledore and the Order too because Lupin and Snape won't allow him to go back.

Omg please read it. The OCs are flawless and amazing. There's no bashing of any beloved canon character except like, Lucius Malfoy and some Dumbledore (because he left Harry to be abused. He tells Snape later it was the only way and Snape responds that he is Slytherin- we can always find a third way.)

Any questions just ask!

** I usually prefer longer fics (>100k), but a short one that really sucked me in is /Mandragora/ by NothingPretentious. The atmosphere is set up so well, the horror mixed with daily routine.. It's not even my prefered genre, but it made a really strong impression on me. As for longer fics, some that haven't been mentioned yet are /Running on Air/ by eleventy7 and /The pure and simple truth/ by lettered. They're not perfect, but both set up the atmosphere really well in different ways and they sucked me right in. (as an aside, both are H/D slash, so disregard if you can't look past it... but you might be missing out on some good writing). If nothing else, read Mandragora ;)

I could NOT put down my phone while reading this series, even during classes I had a hard time staying away, and I try to make a point of not using my phone during study time. Nice AU that admittedly plays on a couple fanon tropes but none to the extent where it becomes distasteful. First fic I've read with a new school founded in it and I was quite surprised to find myself more endeared to that school than even Hogwarts. Generally follows canon at first but with plenty of deviations and plot points planted here and there that sprout into some lovely AU goodness later on.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

Oh my god. It is brutally long but the world building that goes into it is intense. I will admit I don't like the relationships subplot but everything else is brilliant. It's basically Harry Potter but with a realistic, messy war. The main focus is Hermione.

** The Green Eyed Monster. One of THE BEST Harry Potter twin fan fictions I've ever come across. It's so canon and flows well to flow with the story to where it doesn't change it drastically; it does it just enough to have the twin there. The characters are not at all Ooc. AND the cherry on the cake is that it's still updating and on it's 99th chapter.

** It's always be my favorite fanfic of all time. The plot is so tense! It was supposed to be a drastoria fanfic, too bad there's (almost) no romance between them in the plot. I ship theodore/astoria so much in this story <3

I just want to say reading this fanfic is like reading Deathly Hollows from the Slytherins point of view. If you're bored I suggest you read this one at least once! The only 1 thing I can't accept is Blaise Zabini took the dark mark.

** I hope it's ok to answer this question. My answer is below, but I found you by your comment when someone was looking for a good Severus fic. You said, "I'm a sucker for Snape fics weather it be Time Travel and second chances or just divergence from Canon by something." I don't know your tastes in full, but I wanted to share with you this story, in case you could enjoy it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15208766/chapters/35274458][Masterpiece - Severus]].

My answer to your question is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]], by sebastianL (felix_atticus). It's about Draco having survived the war and becoming a mentor to a group of young American youth when he is exiled. It's novel-length and beautiful. Severus does not play prominantly in it, but it took me by surprise, being a very quality and fulfilling read.
