** For time travel and AU, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13232688/chapters/30268506][Rewriting Destiny]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] both meet that criteria. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14461941/chapters/33410025][The Eagle's Nest]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16821571/chapters/39485710][The Gloriana Set]] are two eighth-year fics that match the requested length. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11163924/chapters/24917385][Détraquée]] does as well but it's a WIP with an emphasis on a slow burn. 278k words and the ship isn't sailing quite yet.

Finally, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12272349/chapters/27892320][An Unexpected Malfoy]] falls shy of 250k but is still in progress and is very likely to meet or exceed that amount going forward.

**** Np! It was a surprisingly hard request. I've read a fair amount of the ship but there's not many which get up to 250k.

** I haven't read this fic but have heard good things and I've read other Dramione fics by the writer that I've enjoyed.
