:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't know if the fic was removed or if I just don't know how to find it - but I remember reading a fic summer 2020.

Severus has to make a choice on who he serves, Voldemort, Dumbledore, or Harry. He chooses Harry. And then Harry has to decide...something, but he picks Voldemort over Dumbledore.

That's about as much as I remember, unless it was a fever dream...if anyone knows anything like that please feel free to let me know.

Edit: I somehow found it? I'm not sure how but it's Crystal Crossroads by Genuka. Harry Potter/Voldemort/Severus Snape. Switch!Harry.
