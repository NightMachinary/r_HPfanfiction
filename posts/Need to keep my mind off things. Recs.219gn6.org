** I'm sorry you're sick :( Have you already read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? That's always a good read, and it definitely sucks you in.

***** I started rereading the whole HP series last week and I literally haven't touch my current book since I opened that link lol. I need to finish the rest of the series so I can delve back into the fics. I swear I've been living under a rock, that was the first one I've ever read.

******* I'm excited to! I'm so glad I stumbled my way over here and found this post. I HAVE to finish the rest of the series first (I'm halfway through the fifth book) and then I will absolutely pm you for some more. I'm afraid if I do it now I'll never finish!

******** haha you won't fanfiction is endless and it's sooo easy to just continue reading new fics and not go back to the books for a while. I think the only reason I have reread the original in this last year is cause I listen to the books on my Ipod when I work out and sometimes need to brush up on things for my own writing.

*** Yes, it is one of my all time favorites. I have also read Sluagh but I could not make it through A Peccitas for some reason. I just read it over such a long period of time that I forgot most of the major plot points halfway through and lost interest.

Thank you very much though :)

Saving Connor is the first one in the series. It is Harry/Draco pairing with Harry being in Slytherin. Very AU. Starts year one too! If this is not something you would be interested in I can recommend something else, but I really like it.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][HP and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by CambAngst

Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in an action-packed battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world that they worked so hard to build.

It's a long, sprawling story involving Harry and friends, their kids, their /grandkids/ and some really intriguing and believable mysteries involving a revived Deatheater cell. Canon pairings.
