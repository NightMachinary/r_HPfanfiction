I'm curious: how many people here chiefly writers of hp fanfiction, and how many are mostly here because they are interested in recommendations of fanfic to read?

I am sure that there is overlap between the writers and readers . . . . but I'd like to know where we fall in the spectrum.


** I am a reader, and I suppose on the anonymity of the Internet I can confess that I write as well. I subscribe to this subreddit to remind myself that I'm not alone in the hp fandom! Recs are just lovely too of course!

** Wow! I assumed most people here were writers, too. Do you guys mind when I post links to my stories? Or should I cut it out? I also rec other people's stories when I find ones I like a lot. ;-)

** I'm a reader, and I read /a lot/.

I wish I could write it, though. It's not like I don't have good ideas, and I think I'm pretty good at setting tone, world building, and at least adequate at putting things to paper when I have a good idea at what's going to happen next. The problem is, I'm shit at figuring out what exactly would happen next.

Starting with an interesting idea (my ideas as pertaining to HP fan fiction are all AU), I then think, well, how would the world be different because of this change? I quickly find a solid ground there, and I have an okay idea of who the protagonist is at that point, too. Really, most of my ideas start centering around a specific character, so that doesn't seem to be the problem. With that, I'm able to maybe write out a rough first chapter, and that's where I get stuck. I think, well, now what? And I don't seem to have any ideas on how to get from point A to B, if I can even really figure out where B is.

I think that I might get somewhere if I had someone to really bounce ideas off of, or maybe if I wrote something with someone, but I don't even know how to start looking for someone to collaborate with. So I pretty much just stick to reading, and apparently I also start bitching about my issues with writing when given the opportunity.

** I read and read until I stopped finding things easily which I would enjoy. Once I was fed up with the selection I began writing my own. I have several stories in progress at the moment, but I haven't written in months... after my first story was 560k words I think I psych myself out.

But I enjoy writing just as much as my readers, I have only a vague idea of what's going to happen until it hits the page. The characters take over and it is all I can do just to write it down as it happens.

I think it was Stephen King that said, "when you tell the characters what to do you are a writer, when the characters tell you what to do you are an author"
