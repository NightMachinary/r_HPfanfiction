So I've had this thought for a while. It always seemed to me that Rowling spent too much time and writing in Snape's whole redemption thing when it would have made more sense for it to have been done for Draco. He was the one that was part of the new generation after the 1st war and was alive after the 2nd. The biggest point of their generation always seemed to be that they would be different from the one before instead of repeating the same mistakes. If it had been done and started earlier on, it also would have really shown that Slytherins were more than just evil bullies because I've always felt like none of the books truly showed that. What are your opinions?


** Draco would have been a much better candidate for a redemption arc, Zuko-style. For one thing, it probably wouldn't be trying to apply it retroactively so it wouldn't have wildly contradictory evidence to the idea he actually redeemed himself.

Snape didn't need a redemption arc, and I'm convinced the only reason she put one in was because Rickman became so beloved.

He voluntarily joined the magical Nazis and then abused his students. I feel like not only did he need a redemption arc, but also a prison sentence.

**** I meant narratively speaking. Retroactively explaining that a dead dude was actually secretly only mostly a sociopathic monster instead of a complete sociopathic monster doesn't really serve any purpose.

**** Definitely deserved the no acclaim.

So keep the Nagini ending and his efforts aren't acknowledged.

** I was not convinced by either redemption because neither really changed his ways. Snape was an absolute asshole to his students and Draco only chickened out, we never saw that he had a change of heart regarding the ideology. A good Draco redemption would have that followed by him preparing a set-up with Dumbledore where they (and Harry) turn on the Death Eaters who came with Draco and then use some information he provided to delay Voldemort's takeover.

** Snape had a redemption arc?

I see how she started it, but he nor she finished it. Even on Pottermore she states that he placed the sword in the lake to be spiteful. Imagine, in the middle of a war, you place something you've been told is imperative to winning said war in a frozen lake just to be an asshole?

Ugh.

Anyway, redemption was started for the both of them, and for Regulus, but none of them made it to their finish line (in the books). I can accept Draco like I can James, but not the other two.

She did, kinda. Slughorn teeters on "you're so articulate/well spoken for a(n) _______" but he wasn't an evil bully. I do wish she would have done more with Andromeda.

** I am relatively new here, only a couple of months, so I must ask - does the comparison come up every other day really or is it only like that now? And what is the reason people compare 16 years of penance for a mistake that resulted in another's death, while risking your life to protect another when you could be completely safe (at least after Dumbledore dies), to roughly a year of realizing your only chance to stay alive is if you switch sides and pray that it works out?

I feel for Draco, honestly, but redemption takes work every day like any big change does, Draco is not redeemed so much as deprogrammed. Which is great, but its not a redemption. He has a lot of work to do still, off page.
