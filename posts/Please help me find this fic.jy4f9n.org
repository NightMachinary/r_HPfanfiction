:END:
Looking for a fanfiction where Harry gets kidnapped, goes to Malfoy Manor (?), and is riding a broom in the artrium.

What I remember is that Harry gets kidnapped, but I have no idea when the book is supposedly taking place. I think Harry puts Lucius Malfoy in a body bind after he tortured Harry. So then he found a broom, got on it, and was flying throughout Malfoy Manor. I remember he specifically casts a disillusionment charm on himself to where he blends in with the shadows and Death Eaters shoot spells at him while he flies through the rafters in the atrium. Then he dives behind a statue on a little ledge-corner area in the rafters and hides there. He's loosing blood fast and all, so he has to leave quickly. I believe he flies to the library and flies through the glass and escapes that way. There was definitely a scene with him jumping out of the windows in the library. Then I think he falls asleep on his broom and he's lost while he's trying to make it back to the order.

I could be wrong, but that's all that I remember. It will most likely be on Fanfiction.net. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Thank you!
