The story is mainly a journalist's report. Neville apparently snapped because of the incessant bullying by Slytherins and kills multiple students. I think it's a fifth year story?

Any similar stories about Neville or Harry would also be nice.


** Okay, I found it.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.
