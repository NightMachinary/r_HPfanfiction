** I can see that being a fun snippet fic. First year, Harry burning the flesh of Quirrell leads to Harry losing his eyes (maybe Quirrell lashes out and literally melting/burning flesh hitting Harry in the face has some effect and since it's weird magic that caused it, Poppy can't fix it) and he gets a massive Mad-Eye like prosthesis with an enchanted emerald sphere for an eye there.

Lots of running jokes throughout the rest of the series, akin to that ditzy pirate eyeball guy from Pirates of the Caribbean. :D

**** Cause if you could have just a massive emerald orb instead of an eye, wouldn't you want that, presuming both work the same.

****** I used to know someone who had a lost an eye. He apparently had several prosthetic eyes with different "looks," including a black eye with white skull-and-crossbones, but I never saw him with anything other than the one that matched his remaining eye.

I was also told that it was a mistake to ask him to keep an eye on your drink when you went to the men's room.

**** A bit of what shadowyeager said, but also the fact that it'd make the change more interesting and impactful on Harry's life.

Just having a bright green gemstone eyeball isn't that much of a big deal, aside from noticing other people staring at you and they did that to Harry already. But imagine having this big eyepatch apparatus that you've gotta take off to sleep and strap back to your head every morning. That'd change your life and mindset a lot more, in the vein of any person with a significant prosthesis.

Has a somewhat similar story point, even if it's not really concentrated on: Harry lost his eye, replaced it with the resurrection stone... so now when he has a new body he pops over to Gaunt Shack and replaces his eye with the stone
