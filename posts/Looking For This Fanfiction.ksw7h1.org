:END:
Hello. I'm looking for a one shot that someone asked me to find.

This is the description they gave me: Snape find out about Umbridge using the blood quill on Harry, but never sees the "I must not tell lies" scar. Snape then magically turns into a pretty boy to get Umbridge to stop. Harry and Snape get close, which results in McGonagall suspecting that Snape is a pedophile (not true). She talks to Harry about it and they have a miscommunication making McGonagall believe her suspicions are true.

The Professor confronts Snape and the communication gets cleared up.
