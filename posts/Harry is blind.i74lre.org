Is there any fic we're harry becomes completely blind. I'd prefer if Luna has a role in the story because she's my one of my faveorite characters.


** Linkffn(Blindness)

He is completely blind, does not cure himself, develops a kind of magic sonar to move around and can see magic. Eventual godlike OP Harry, super smart, morally ambiguous experimentation.

Definitely Harry x Hermione

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** “Completely blind,” is a bit of a reach and “magic sonar,” a bit of an understatement.

The man can damn near see perfectly, minus a few restrictions that are basically removed when he enters a magic-rich environment.

** Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone is a good blind!Harry fic. Luna doesn't play a major part, but she is in there. Pros: it's well written, has a good plot and updates semi-regularly. Cons: a lot of OCs (I don't mind that, but I know some people don't like it) and it is really long (464,000 words and nowhere near the end), in the sense that it can be a bit slow moving in places.

**** To my great shame-- okay, my mild shame-- I ship Harry with one of the OCs in this story. They're very young for shipping, but the OC is such a cutie (without being a Mary Sue, the OCs in the fic generally have flaws).

**** No, don't worry. I hate that pairing too. No pairings (yet). Basically, Harry is blinded in his fight with the Basilisk and he goes to a centre to learn to adapt to his new disability. No bashing, but definitely a realistic look at some characters' flaws (Ron, Hermione and Neville's reactions are interesting) and not sappy at all.

***** Awesome it remindes me of “a second chance at life” I recommend it its really good. Harry basically fights of Voldemort's assassins and decides to leave Britain to Canada and learns “akren”.
