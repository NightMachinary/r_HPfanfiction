** Honestly I imagine hermione would be the kind of person who would post in that sub

and when people tell her she is in the wrong she would argue.

ron wouldnt post there in the first place. and harry would dislike reddit because everyone reminds him of a more smug draco

Absolutely. Although I'm not sure she's have ever posted something like that, because she always thinks she's right and doesn't need anybody else's validation.

** I have read most comments on the original post too, and it strikes me how different the responses are. On this sub people seem more critical to Hermione's reaction in this situation, while a lot at the HP sub there were less, and more people defending Hermione. Anyone else agree on this?

*** It's because most people on this sub dislike Hermione, so all of her actions are viewed in a more negative light. In the other sub, they like most characters who are good guys, except Snape and (sometimes) Dumbledore.

*** It's interesting, isn't it?

Fundamentally, it comes down to what how much you value individual freedom compared to the responsibility everyone has to try and minimize the suffering of those around us. I'd be very interested to see responses for this question mapped against things like nationality, or political affiliation.

I suspect that individualists are more likely to focus on the fact that by reporting the issue to an authority figure, Hermione is overriding Harry's wishes and undermining his personal freedom to choose. Why is Hermione more worthy to make such important choices for Harry? She isn't, these people would say, and thus she is in the wrong.

At the same time people with a more collectivist or socialist world view would instead focus on Hermione's duty of care to those around her. Just as they would argue that society must sometimes curtail the freedom of the mentally unfit for their own wellbeing, they would also argue that Harry is, due to his age and general lack of critical thinking ability when confronted with a /super sus/ gift, not intellectually capable of making such an important decision. They may even argue that Hermione is not the one making the decision for Harry at all, she merely deferred the choice to someone else who is both capable, and in a position of responsibility (McGonagall).

Others probably haven't thought about it all that much and simply have a knee-jerk reaction to Hermione 'telling' (tattling, grassing, etc) on Harry to the teacher.

** Invert the situation. Imagine if he went to a teacher and said she was ruining her health trying to do all of the electives?

She would effectively feel the same betrayal. Probably more so. Since out of context, education is worse than death /s.

And why are they tearing it apart anyway. This is something you go to the manufacturer with. "Hey, I got this under suspicious circumstances, has this been tampered with? My teachers are threatening to tear it apart to inspect it..." They would jump right on it. If the Nimbus 2000 had protections against tampering, the Firebolt should too. Why would they let any random person tear it apart and potentially learn their secrets, when they could use it to test for tampering, potentially improve their techniques, AND help the boy who lived? If there's no tampering, they helped the boy who lived, that's good press. IF there's tampering, they help the boy who lived AND gained knowledge on how to improve the anti-tampering techniques. And in both cases, none of their secrets get out.

*** Don't you know? It's because canon magical knowledge trumps any speciality. The Hogwarts staff is well capable of remaking a Firebolt.

If you went to canon post epilogue â€˜I have a Dark Magic book in my office bookshelf' Hermione, she would be able to improve any broom in 10 minutes, never losing the disapproving expression in her face meanwhile.

** YATA.

As much as you only wanted to protect your friend, you had no right to betray his trust and go behind his back, mainly when the gift was something clearly important to him.

You should've talked to him about it first and together come to a compromise that he would talk to a teacher about the matter instead of just running off without even warning him that they'd take it away from him to examine it.

Even if I understand the motivation behind your actions, I can't agree that what you did was 100% right, that you didn't want, deep down, even just a little bit, show off how mature you are to your teachers, instead of worrying about your friend's emotions.

** Yes you were. You should have told him why you thought it was dangerous, and he should have made the decision to go to your teacher himself. As it is, you betrayed his trust, told him effectively that you and you alone knew more than him what was good for him, and proved that you do not believe he's able to survive in society.
