  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

*** I have this in my list like forever and never started because of its length. Is it well written, not particularly slow paced?

**** It's well-written. The fic is long, but it's long because a lot happens in it.
