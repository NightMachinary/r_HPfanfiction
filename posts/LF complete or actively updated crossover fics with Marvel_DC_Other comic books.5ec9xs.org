I'd prefer longer reads (20k+) and no slash.

Something like linkffn(Child of the Storm) would be awesome.


** I found both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to The Future]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8687160/1/Rise-of-Arcane][Rise of the Arcane]] to both be enjoyable reads.

*** Heads up, Third Path to The Future has slow updates, mainly due to the length of the chapters, and Rise of the Arcane is fun but abandoned, and the rewrite is abandoned as well.

#+begin_quote
  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
