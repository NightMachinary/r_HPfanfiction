*** For some reason my favorite one was the one from Mrs. Flamel to her husband:

"Thank you for the adventure."

Imagine them laying side by side and holding hands, she turned to him and said that. So peaceful yet so sad.

** Quirinus Quirrell, to Sibyll Trelawney

Travelling will bring great peril, indeed. I'm sorry I laughed.

I don't understand this one, afaik they didn't have any interaction at all

*** quirrell met voldemort while travelling in albania, which eventually caused his death

the author is insinuating that quirrell had laughed at trelawney for saying something along the lines of 'travelling will bring great peril,' which could have been some time pre-sorcerer's stone as quirrell was previously the muggle studies professor

*** Trelawney has been in Hogwarts even before Harry's first year. Her not being mentioned in book 1 was explained away as Trelawney not liking socialization and not coming down from her tower for meals and stuff. So she's most likely interacted with Quirell before, even if she's not mentioned in book 1.
