Particularly about the process of becoming an Animagus. It can be about McGonagall, the Maurauders, set in the canon timeline or about the next generation, I'm not picky. I'd like details about the process itself, what it feels like to change and the reasoning behind wanting to become an Animagus in the first place.

Thank you in advance!

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter) has an interesting approach to it, where the process to becoming one is a lot more spiritual than usual and continues to play a role over the sequels. It's not the focus of the story though and it takes a while until characters even begin speaking about it.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, And That's Okay) Harry, the POV character, is not an animagus, or at least he doesn't think so. All of Harry's friends become Animagi though, it goes through the whole ritual and everything, but that's quite a ways in until you get to it.

*** Damn, I didn't realize you recommended it already. But yeah, I think this is a good one for scratching an Animagus itch, especially since they regularly use their forms after acquiring them. Is it just me or is that nowhere near as common as it should be?

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** It's not a central focus of the story, but linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay) eventually sees most of Harry's friend group become Animagi. Not only that, but they regularly use and refer to their forms, which in itself is unusual since it seems most fics that have someone become an Animagus go on to basically ignore the ability until it's plot-relevant.
