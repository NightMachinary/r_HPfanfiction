And I absolutely despise Connor. I actually hate him more than Dumbledore and Lily combined. I've never wanted a character (especially a child character) to kick the bucket as much as I want him to. Did anyone else feel this way while reading Saving Connor? No spoilers, please!


** Is that the one where Harry swears to protect his idiot brother?

Lol it's been almost a decade since I read that one. Idr why but his name brings up some arghhhh feelings so...yep, I guess he infuriates me a bit.

Edit: I'm also suddenly feeling really old.

** It gets better after year 3. I don't remember much about year 4 but I think their relationship got better during the triwizard tournament. I do remember by year 6 both of them has a pretty good relationship.

Connor is just a kid who just imitating the adults whom he trusted. I actually hate Lily more than anyone else. What she did to Harry is inexcusable.

***** Is it, though? His relationship with his family is one of the main plot lines of the series. And since the only thing OP asked about was his relationship with his brother it seems reasonable that his request of no spoilers was targeted at people that were going to tell him how that relationship ends up. You generally don't need to tell people not to spoil an entire series for you if you've already said you haven't finished it.

*** Saving Connor is a fanfic series. A very long one. It's an au that follows the whole series. Connor is Harry's brother in the fic. The people here are discussing how much they dislike him as a character within the third book of the series.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** He's a twit but eventually straightens out, so. The point where I dropped it was when it became clear Draco was a massive ass who wasnt going to change his behavior, in either 5 or 6. Can't remember which.

*** I actually am now about a quarter of the way thru the fourth installment and OOH BOY I cannot agree with you more. Draco and Snape are being particularly infuriating right now, while for once in the story I find myself actually hesitantly liking Connor. I'm also getting mad at Harry for being such a self-sacrificing idiot, even if it's not really his fault. Ugh this fic is giving me emotions.

*** Oh, this was the first complete 7 part fanfic series I've ever read. It was pretty awesome. The author really established a lot of common genres and ideas in future fanfics. I think everyone should read it, just to get an idea of where some established cliches came from.

** I really disliked this series. It was well written (or I thought so at the time, it's been a while) and the plot was good and made for a really interesting take on the not-the-boy-who-lived storyline.

But I could not deal with Harry's complete and total inability to ever put himself first. There are a lot of fics that have Harry as someone who is incredible self-sacrificing, always putting others first and convinced of his own worthlessness. But there is a limit to how much I can take and this series went way over it.

I hated Connor because he was a self-entitled little shit. But I hated Harry just as much because he helped perpetuate that behaviour. I never actually managed to finish the series because of just how much Harry's attitude annoyed me.
