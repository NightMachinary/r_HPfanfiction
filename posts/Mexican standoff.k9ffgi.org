Are there any stories where there is a Mexican Standoff between The Order, Death Eaters, and the MoM surrounding a Marriage Law? Something along the lines of: the enemy of my enemy is my friend?

Extra kudos if the Order and Death Eaters team up against the self-serving (not DE themselves or DE puppets) politicians.


** In my story "Divided and Entwined", there are four factions in the civil war: Order, Ministry, Death Eaters and Muggleborn Resistance, with variying alliances - not officially, though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
