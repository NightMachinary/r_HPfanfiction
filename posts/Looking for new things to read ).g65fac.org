**** Not smutty. A little innuendo but it's really well written. Some pureblood politics. Adult harry raising kid harry. The writer uses a lot of stuff the Rowling has realease after like info on Harry's grandparents or different bits of lore. Not finished yet but something like 200k words so far

** Wastelands of Time and Arcanist are both Eldritch-ey world-built fics.

Petunia Evans is an Archaeologist thing with a sequel that's very worldbuilt.

Wise One series has a lot of international worldbuilding. Same with Accidental Animagus (eventually).

** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]]? It does contain some popular tropes (Manipulative, but still good Dumbledore, and Super!Harry), but the author does a pretty good job of adding more conflict to the story, so Harry is still challenged. Oh, it also has quite a lot of politics

#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
