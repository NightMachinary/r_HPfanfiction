I'm not looking for gruesome or horror fiction. But I never really read any where the Durslets get what they deserve. A paragraph how they are arrested, or maybe someone else mentions casting a curse. I want to see a fic where Harry confronts them and they have to answer for their crimes. Adult or kid, don't matter to me.


** Proper flair is request not recommendation.

*** Oops. Thanks. I thought it meant I was looking for recommendations. I'll try to edit it!

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
