So a few days ago, I made a thread mentioning the idea for a fanfic I had where Harry escapes from the Dursleys upon discovering he has superpowers (not yet knowing it was magic), after he spends a while developing them, and will end up survivng on the streets for sometime before being finally discovered. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7wph01/harry_runs_away_using_magic_suggestion/]]

So today I got around to typing up a first chapter for the idea (my first HP fanfic!), called "Break the Limits". I'm not sure if it's any good or if I'll continue it, but let me know what you think!

** A. You may want to get a beta (possibly British) because as an American, I noticed a lot of Americanisms in your writing. There were also a few grammar mistakes here and there. Overall, it's pretty good, but you may want to have someone else look over for you for any grammar mistakes you may have made.

**** Thanks for the input. I did consider have someone British going over it, but since I wasn't sure I'd continue it is didn't bother. xD I'm glad you liked the premise. Hopefully the 2nd chapter, once uploaded, is to your liking as well. I'm a bit nervous since I got some positive feedback in the reviews, but I suspect a power Harry gets in the next chapter might be a bit much for readers (check the linked thread in the OP for the power). I can't think of how to make the premise believably work without it, lol.

** It's a nice start, I liked it. Grammar and writing was good and it didn't stretch anything out more than it had to. I'll keep reading.
