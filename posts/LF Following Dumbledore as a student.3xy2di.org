Looking for Dumbledore-centric fics that follow Dumbledore as he explores the world of magic during his time at Hogwarts.

Non-slash.


** Taure has a fic that goes over Dumbledore's history but sadly it's not Dumbledore centric. I'd still recommend you read it though, his take on it is fascinating.\\

** There were three stories I recall, each detailing young Dumbledore's first three years at Hogwarts, which were quite decent.
