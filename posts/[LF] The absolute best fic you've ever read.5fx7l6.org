** If you want a fantastic read, then I must recommend /Stages of Hope./

It is funny, it is absurd, it's..rather loony. It is sad, it is hard, it can be grim. But it has heart, and catharsis, and perhaps one of the most tender depictions of a friendship between Hermione and Harry, that stays /platonic,/ I've ever read.

**** Absolutely! The ending is heartfelt, without feeling too sad--which is why I used the term cathartic.

And what really sells it for me, is the friendship between Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna. The devotion is deep, the physical affection is achingly beautiful. These four are willing to die for one another. And the romance between Neville and Luna is understated, which makes it all the sweeter.

And Luna's use of fairy tales as a defense mechanism, my God, it's one of the best fanfics I've ever read.

** Gryffindors Never Die, by ChipmonkOnSpeed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]

I'm really not the person to reread stories, except for a select few that I can read over and over again and never get tired of. This is one of those.

It's a very non-cliched harry-goes-back-in-time-to-younger-self fic, starring 50 year old alcoholics Ron and Harry being sent back because Lily is very persuasive, even with the forces of the universe. There is extremely mild romione and hinny, but only like a paragraph each, in a 74k fic. It's Canon to the epilogue.

** One of the best post-battle, angsty Harry/Ginny stories I read was [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/601124][Inner Demons]].

It makes Ginny tough to read at times but is so engaging and includes plot lines that you rarely see but make for compelling and realistic stories.

There is a first part called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/571142/chapters/1023212][Starting Over]] that is good but not as good but you should read to better understand the second part.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

Something Wicked This Way Comes by the Mad Mad Reviewer. I don't know what about it's so great, but I end up rereading it every 3-4 months. It's a good merging of worlds, it's actually complete, there's romance but it doesn't feel forced, and everyone gains several levels in badass but it doesn't feel boring to wait for.

Oh right, summary: After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

#+begin_quote
  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care. Drarry, Words: 88722.
#+end_quote

At a glance, this looks like a cheesy Drarry full of smut and nonsense. It is NOT. I don't know who wrote this, but if you're interested in Potions theory and application, this is amazing. Harry actually decides to become a Potions Master, apprenticing under dead-in-a-portrait Snape. The chemistry of it, the study of Potions and how it works and how he learns is perfection. So detailed, not a wasted sentence in sight. I learn something new every time I read it.

No, I don't practice Potions in my free time. But science!

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.
