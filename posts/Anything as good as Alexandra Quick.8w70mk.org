I know this is unlikely, but if there's anything novel or series-length as well-written as Alexandra Quick set in this magical universe(not necessarily about Harry or his relations, but in general), I hope you will let me know.

If not, tell me about similar books from other universes that you enjoyed as much, though I'm not sure if it's permitted to ask such a thing(feel free to PM me if so inclined) :)

And thank you to the author. I look forward to reading the fifth novel.


** You know, there is a subreddit ( [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]]) where you might get some more pertinent information. If you want good novel length fics, trust me when I say this fandom has plenty.

However, it would help to clarify more what you are looking for. There are literally /millions/ of Harry Potter fics (though 9/10 are immediately discardable), and anything to discriminate would be more likely to get responses /and/ to not waste your time with something you may not want anyway.

Just saying it would help.

*** I was under the impression from the posts I had read in this sub that AQ was up there at the top in terms of popularity amongst HP fan fics.

I meant just what I said. I want something as well written as AQ, preferably a series. I'll leave it to the replier to determine that.

If I would discriminate, I would simply ask for something similarly detached from HP's world, and only sharing in the rules of the universe, the magic, and its history. I say that because I noticed the author excelled in their own "original" series, in a way they didn't with Hogwarts Houses Divided.

It seems too good to be true, if, as you say, there are plenty of other novel length books that share the quality of this one set in this Universe. Please name at least a few of your favorites, if it's not too much to ask.

**** First, you have to understand that AQ is a respected series, but it is also a /divisive/ series. I would say its fifty-fifty on people who like or hate it, mostly because of Alexandra herself.

Now I can provide you with several series of fics, but the problem here is you still did not really offer much to clarify what you want. There are multiple series out there:

- The Albus Potter Series by NoahPhantom: starts with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). A seven-year set of fics where Albus goes through Hogwarts as a student. Possibly better than AQ, frankly, though the Lily Potter series seems dead now.
- Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger linkffn(Shadow of Angmar): Harry is MoD living in Middle Earth 1000 years before the LoR trilogy began.
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): an AU where Voldemort won and remade Britain. Voldemort is possibly the most interesting incarnation ever in this fic, and it follows Harry through his time in Britain and at Hogwarts, up to the end of 6th year (word count its more than 4x the length of OOTP, and the pagan/celtic religious elements are rather detailed and a great part of the fic).
- Heart of a Lion linkffn(Heart of a Lion): a founders era fic with decent writing, the group meet up in this fic.

And a number of others. These are just some examples of fics with good/great writing and well-developed though still HP like world building (although SoA has a lot of Tolkeinverse mythos invovled).

***** Thank you so much. I will check out all of them.

Do you know of any HP fanfics that continue from OOTP without Sirius dying? I know that's a long shot, but just in case. I am really interested in something where Harry takes more of a central role in the fight against Voldemort, and where the war is described at greater length than Rowling did.

I think I have already read some of the Albus Potter series a long time ago if I'm not mistaken, though I don't think it was finished at the time perhaps. But I think I'll enjoy rereading it.

The LOTR one sounds weird, I have no idea how it would make sense, but I think I'll try it, same as the others.

Is there any archive of sorts where I can see many titles? How do I look for novels in the Potterverse(if I'm using the term correctly? Do I just browse the posts on this sub?

****** I am going to give you an honest opinion here. Please do not take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you do not have a large amount of experience with the wider HP fanfiction community (not an insult, merely how it sounds from here). These are not novels, these are fanfiction, regardless of length and novel-quality writing in many cases.

While many there are many cases of the things you are asking for, I think it would help to gain some knowledge of the type of material available in the fandom, so you can narrow down what you are interested in.

1. I would recommend starting at the low-end, with material closer to canon. Possibly some post-war fics, like the Albus Potter series for instance. Alexandra Quick is an AU, but it does not affect canon at all so its fine. Some alternate POV of canon will also work (ex. Ginny or Neville's perspective during Deathly Hallows linkffn(Not From Others)).
2. Then, start looking into more AU changes: what if X happened in canon instead of Y style fics. Some noteworthy examples include: Harry sorted into Slytherin in canon linkffn(On the Way to Greatness), Harry choosing to kill Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets linkffn(Forging the Sword), and what if Lucius Malfoy took over after Voldemort's defeat linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)
3. After that, you should be able to look into more alternate universe (or AU) style fics. These are where there are significant changes to the world in canon. Some noteworthy examples include: Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore in 1945 linkffn(The Skitterleap), Neville was the Boy-Who-Lived linkffn(By the Divining Light), and what if Muggleborns were much rarer than in canon linkffn(Patron).
4. Once you have seen the major canon, you can begin to look into different genres and tropes that interest you: time-travel, comedy/crack, romance, adventure, dark, etc. Once you have an idea of what you want, you can more easily ask questions here about what you are looking to read or not read.

I hope this helps you. I took a bit of time to write this all out since I feel it would be more helpful than shooting names in the dark for you.

******* It's appreciated.

I don't agree with your dismissal of Inverarity's masterpiece as mere fan-fiction. I have not read much HP fan fic, but I have read enough to be able to appreciate AQ for what it is.

AQ is barely AU. All it shares with HP is its history(only implied by the mention of Voldemort). On a more relevant note, the thing it takes from Rowling's world is its magic and the rules that accompany it.

And now we come, perhaps, to part of what I am seeking, and of which I am sincerely skeptical is to be further found out there. An original series that doesn't describe the lives of any of the characters mentioned in the original seven Harry Potter novels, but new ones, in a new setting, that rival the original in their deep and rich world-building. Inverarity hasn't merely taken what Rowling has so conveniently provided and played with ideas about what would some characters from her world do, as so many other authors I notice have done, but has added to her world of magic in their own unique ways.

But I admit I am ignorant of much of what comprises the fan literature of HP. I am simply not as comfortable classifying AQ as mere fan-fic. I feel it deserves a unique consideration among others, until such as I've seen something akin to it.

It is very much a novel in my opinion. With a proper publishing agency, Inverarity's AQ series would perhaps be even greater than Rowling's. Such is the original depth of their world - we cannot simply dismiss it by putting it next to something like the Albus Potter series(however good that series may be on its own).

I would very much like to read HP fan fic, in the meaning of relating the stories of its British characters mentioned in the books(whether past, present or future), if there are any such that are original enough to rival Rowling's creation at least in scope and ambition if not necessarily in practice. But I am far more interested in original takes on the main element of the story with which Rowling has gifted willing writers of all stripes. Her type of magic. The rules by which it abides. Its magical creatures, items and its wizarding history and culture. That is what fascinates me, not the fate of Ginny/Hermione/Ron and company...

If you honestly hold such a low opinion of AQ, I can only think one of two things. You haven't read them or payed attention to the incredible depth and originality added on top of Rowling's canonical descriptions of the world of magic. Or you know there are many others which do the same just as well, in which case I would rejoice and ask you to name the best, assumming you haven't just done that.

I am not looking for flavor fan fic. This coupling or that one. This historical event or that one. I am looking for quality. Something I didn't think I would have to describe, but would be understood intrinsically by comparison with the series mentioned in the OP.

******** To be honest, *that right there is dangerous territory regarding publishing rights*. There is a reason most authors put a disclaimer in their chapters stating that they do not own the material and all rights belong to JK Rowling.

Inaverity could get in serious trouble if she tried something like that, and when people have done similar things like Patreon for chapters, it has never gone well. Besides which, many writers have actually gotten started in fanfiction (ex. joe6961, White Squirrel I think). Fanfiction is a polishing ground for that.

BUT I can offer you new explorations of the magic and world of HP that should be interesting, and I would heartily recommend looking through them for this:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) has Harry as a twin brother to the Boy Who Lived. However, he decides to go to Durmstrang instead. There, he meets new characters (some good OCs too) and slowly begins to explore all that magic has to offer. Highly recommend this one.
- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is an AU started back before OotP came out, and is one of the /best/ examples of a Hero's Journey style fics I can think of. Harry is sent on a quest away from Hogwarts, then spends the rest of the story trying to return to Hogwarts. Everything past Goblet of Fire is scraped, and many of the OCs are the best in the fandom (ex. Danny Oakes, Dahlia, Andross Gallowbraid, Magnus Aragon, Lyle).
- Forging the Sword has a much more in depth exploration of magic and the systems of teaching Hogwarts.
- linkffn(The Mind Arts) is one of the best fics currently being produced. Harry has a talent for mind magic (Legilimency) in particular, and it focuses on his exploration of magic and his time learning from Dumbledore.
- For developing the world of Harry Potter, my personal favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), which has more world-building and exploration of the Harry Potter universe than any fic I have read.

It may be easier though to post another request (or several different ones) asking for specifics like: exploration of magic, world-building, different schools from Hogwarts, etc. That way you can narrow things down.

********* I never implied anywhere that Inverarity should or anywhere said would try to monetize AQ. I have merely expressed my opinion on the series from a literary standpoint. I don't know how you got the former from the latter.

Thank you for the HP recommendations. But once again, like I said previously, they are, in order, Harry, Harry, Harry, Hogwarts, Harry and Harry.

There is 0 mention of Harry Potter in Alexandra Quick. That is its greatness. That it did that and wasn't a massive failure. It is riveting and completely original from the character standpoint and partially from the cultural one(less so from the world-building pov, but there too).

I will take your advice and post a better ask next time, perhaps, though that wasn't necessarily the only thing I was looking for, and as such am plenty pleased with all your recommendations to date. I will check them out.

I am sorry that "looking for a set of novels/series that shares Rowling's magical universe but not necessarily its characters and is as good from a writing standpoint as AQ" wasn't clear enough.

********** Read Heart of the Lion, its in the Founder's Era so its a thousand years before Harry was born.

Also, there are a few fics out there that I cannot recall at this time that focus on the period during Grindelwald's War (mostly continental Europe), but the quality of those fics will vary much more. Still interesting stories though.

Also, the fic linkffn(The Ollivanders) revolves around an OC son of Ollivander before Harry was even born, and dives a lot into Wand Lore and the like.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

********* I would also add, as an after-thought:

Rowling did not invent the idea of wands, of spells, or of Wizards.

If I, say, or anyone else, intended to write a series of novels involving all of those things, all I would have to change is perhaps the names of the spells, and some other such arbitrary things, the list wouldn't be all that long. I don't know how far you'd have to go to not be liable to prosecution, but I don't imagine all that far indeed. So perhaps you overestimate the power Rowling has over this type of fantasy. Just because no one has emerged to write something as popular contained within a very similar world, does not mean one can't. And I do believe we will see much of this type of literature in the future, as soon as someone does it first.

It's really too bad the author can't monetize on his novels. They deserve as much recognition as Rowling's, IMO.

******** I think you should wait at least until you finish the second book before you make a conclusion.

IMO you won't easily find a story this deep. I can understand certain people not liking Alexandra's personality(I actually like it, but I see enough who don't), but I also believe this series really does get better as it goes on. It would be a waste not to read it because of a premature judgement about the main character.

I also get the impression a lot of people give up on it too early, before it gets interesting enough that they don't mind what they did initially anymore. It's a very very rich and deep story and you'd be missing out if you didn't hold out a little longer. :)

I would answer your question more directly, except I don't see her as having an impulse control. What you and others call that, I understand as instinct, and in many cases, a lack of other options. I think Alexandra is more tragic than bad in any way. It is easy to not see that because of her hard, uncompromising attitude.

Also, if I made more excuses for her, which you no doubt will understand yourself soon enough, I would spoiler everything for you. There are good, deep-seated reasons for why she is like she is, and that's why I love her. Because it's genuine and thought-out, not merely something "edgy" the author imposed on one of its characters.

Let me know if you've kept with it, I'll be curious to know. I would love for there to be more of a community around AQ. It's so underestimated, IMO.
