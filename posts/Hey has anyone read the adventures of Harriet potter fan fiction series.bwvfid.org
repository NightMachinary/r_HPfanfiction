In some contexts the fic is well rounded for what it is. The only problem that I found would be the character of Finn; in some cases the character feels two sided and really doesn't fit into its own cannon. The fic clearly states that the hog warts is defended from muggles but the Finn the main character can walk it halls. In fact the character feels as it was written to perfectly with vert little flaws. In one seen he seen as the perfect gentleman, in another he is seen as the guy that steps aside simply because she didn't write back. The few interaction that they have is not enough to build a character.


** I think I've read this but I can't find the specific fic you're talking about. Do you have a link or author?
