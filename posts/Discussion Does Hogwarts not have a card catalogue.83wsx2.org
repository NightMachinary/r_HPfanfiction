So while writing a fic, I created a magical card catalogue for the library at Hogwarts. I thought it was just a nice little fun addition that didn't affect canon in any way... then I realized. Hogwarts must not have a card catalogue because Hermione would have found Nicholas Flamel way faster (there's no way he doesn't have a biography on him). It seems bizarre that they wouldn't have some kind of central categorization system.

What do you guys think?


** JKR said this about the library in [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0802-radiocityreading2.html][an interview]]:

"I thought you were going to attack me for Madam Pince and I would like to apologize for you and any other librarians (crowd laughs) present here today and my get-out clause is always if they'd had a pleasant, helpful librarian, half my plots would be gone. 'Cause the answer invariably is in a book but Hermione has to go and find it. If they'd had a good librarian, that would have been that problem solved. So, sorry."

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** I agree that it seems weird that there wouldn't be a card catalog, especially a magical one. I don't know what mechanism you chose, but I could see one where you pull the card or tap it with your wand and the book flies through the library to you. Plus, it's a lot of work for Madam Pince to go hunting down all of the books that the kids want or need.

As far as I know, the Dewey Decimal system is used in the UK and it would be interesting to see a magical spin on it. I think the lack of a card catalog was JKR needing to find a way to delay discovery of the Flamels to serve the plot she'd created.

Regarding your creation, don't feel like you have to take it out because it's not strictly canon. It sounds like a fun thing!

*** It's worth noting that Pottermore implies that you can use the Summoning Charm as also a searching Charm:

#+begin_quote
  *When you can summon any book, instrument or animal with a wave of the wand and the word Accio!*; when you can communicate with friends and acquaintances by means of owl, fire, Patronus, Howler, enchanted objects such as coins, or Apparate to visit them in person; when your newspaper has moving pictures and everyday objects sometimes talk to you, *then the internet does not seem a particularly exciting place*. This is not to say that you will never find a witch or wizard surfing the net; merely that they will generally be doing so out of slightly condescending curiosity, or else doing research in the field of Muggle Studies.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/technology]]

You can summon books, therefore the internet (which is strongly associated with searching for information) is not interesting to wizards. The fact that these two are considered causally linked implies that the internet provides nothing new or better compared to the Summoning Charm. While it's not explicit that you can use the Summoning Charm to search, the implication is pretty strong.

So fourth years and above would have a much easier time of locating materials.

**** That's true. Isn't that the way that Hermione got all of those books about Horcruxes before they left Hogwarts? I still think a card catalog would be useful for summaries if nothing else. Why Summon a book that's not going to be useful? I kind of miss card catalogs from my days of working in the library in high school. Though more often I'd get in trouble for reading the books I was supposed to be shelving!

****** In theory you may be right, but from canon it doesn't /seem/ like books are cheap as dirt. Note that the Weasleys, with their tight budget, opt for handed-down textbooks, which I don't think they'd bother to do if books weren't rather expensive. I assume the fact that /Gemino/-multiplied objects decay faster is involved, and maybe wizarding editors charm their books to be unduplicable just to be safe?

P.S.: IIRC you /can/ multiply food, though, for the record, you just can't create it out of nothing.

*** Maybe I could get around it by having the card catalogue not be obvious or look like a muggle one. Hmm... then the OC could ask Hermione why she didn't look in the card catalogue for Nicholas Flamel and Hermione could have an amusing reaction...

As far as canon, maybe there is one but Madam Pince doesn't let the students use it because she's a control freak?

** Well, I was going to discuss the history angle, but it appears that though the Dewey Decimal system wasn't invented until the 1800s, central categorization system are older, so wizards would have known of them in the 1600s, when International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was signed.

Most likely, the library didn't have a card catalogue because of plot reasons, and because JK didn't think of it.

I can't think of a real reason why the Hogwarts Library wouldn't have one.

You're acting like the Hogwarts Library was /made/ in the 1600's. There's no reason to assume it hasn't been around since the Founders, and if so, then I would actually be more surprised if Hogwarts /had/ followed the times in /some/ way for a change. Wizards just don't like change as a culture, and if they all fondly remember their Hogwarts years with that sweet old messy Library as part of it, then no one is going to listen to that stuck-up Percy prat who says the system should, what, /make sense/? What a laughable Muggle idea.

*** I agree. The only reason I can think of that might explain why they don't have a similar system set up at Hogwarts is if there's some magical way of catagorizing the books that required Madame Pince's help or in some other way left a record of the search. While this would be a terrible system for a school, it could be supported by the fact that Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew that Pince could have helped them in a second, but they intentionaly didn't ask because they wanted to keep their search secret.

And to supplement this, again, wizards and logic are distantly estranged relatives. The same wizards who think time-travel is a valid solution for a scheduling issue, Lucius Malfoy was /clearly/ innocent, and their students' sports tournament to promote international goodwill should be a rivalry-fueled blood bath, would /not/ grasp the concept that an orderly Library would be preferable. They would accept the messiness of libraries as an integral part of libraries, without which a library would not be a library.

** It would be thematically inconsistent.

In the Potterverse, a lot of magic is readily accessible: you're going to learn a good set of charms and a decent range of transfiguration as a student. You have to make a pilgrimage to Hogwarts, of course, and endure the elements of the Scottish winter, but it's a good amount of power for work that's normal and feasible for schoolchildren.

Beyond that, you can increase breadth by inventing things, like the Weasley twins. And you can increase your power by hunting down old, usually forbidden knowledge.

If the book's just available and easily accessible and findable inside Hogwarts, that doesn't give you the hunt for forbidden knowledge. So as a compromise, since the plot can't have schoolkids running across the country hunting for libraries and forgotten grimoires, Hogwarts doesn't have a card catalogue.

*** The library at Nineveh in 700BCE had a catalogue. Its clay tablets were organized according to shape. The library at Alexandria also had a catalogue. I know that the magical world is behind the times where sense and sensibility is concerned, but 2700 years should be long enough for them to accept the idea.

But it would be thematically inconsistent. HP-verse rewards the search for knowledge. Anything readily accessible can't be powerful.

** Your question presupposes Hogwarts exists to provide an excellent education to the population of Wizarding Britain. I'd argue a compelling argument can be made that this is not the case. Hogwarts exists to /socialize/ the population and to give everyone a basic education sufficient for them to function without breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Beyond that a Hogwarts education seems laughably limited. Magic is steeped in a tradition of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow]["Things you're not meant to know"]] and the magical powers that be have little incentive for any more than an elite few to really delve deeply into the arts of sorcery. (And what is sorcery anyway? Mentioned in Dumbledore's titles in book 1 and never again...) The library is deliberately set up to make obtaining dangerous or powerful information difficult, and Mme. Pince is one of the gatekeepers of the power elite of British wizarding society.
