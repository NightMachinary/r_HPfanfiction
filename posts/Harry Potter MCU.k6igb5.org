Any fics out there that has a realistically powerful Harry Potter becoming more of a street level hero on the likes of daredevil but can still kick some serious ass


** Unfortunately I don't think this exists, Almost all HP/MCU stories have a Master of Death Demigod Harry who can one shot the entire MCU. A street level HP hero would be very interesting to read.

*** I'd like to see a subversion of this: Harry /is/ some sort of deathly demigod, but he does his best to live a normal life doing regular normal stuff, including having a family with someone, having a regular job, et cetera.

Characters that are "in the know" about the more cosmic things from various settings (depending on the crossover), such as Diana of Themyscira or her mother, or Thor/Odin from Asgard, or John Constantine or Zatanna, recognize what he is and proverbially shit their pants on finding out he's involved or just in the nearby area (such as walking home from buying groceries, et cetera), and that sparks off things like an ever escalating ping-pong match in the setting.

Harry, meanwhile, just does his job, goes home to his wife/family, and does regular stuff while the world, unbeknownst to him, is going nuts at "Death walking the streets!".

**** I've been noodling around with an MCU crossover similar to this. In one version, Harry is a Columbia University professor, has Teddy and SHIELD is loosing their minds trying to figure out wtf to do with him, while he just rolls his eyes and goes on with life. Also includes Loki pissing himself laughing at the idea of SHIELD actually "managing" Harry, a scene I'm rather proud of tbh.

The longer (and well, complete but unposted because I'm unhappy with it) version has him as a bartender giving advice to Coulson, while only Thor and Strange realize who he is.

***** Ya know, Harry just casually outing the surveillance teams would be hilarious. Like, he walks by bushes and just leaves a cup of tea or coffee there. Or he waves at the rooftop teams on his way to work.

This one reads like a Harry Potter Avenger origin story. A TON of fun imo.

*** This one was good until the author felt the need to add this weird Felicity character. She's such a clich√©, completely one-dimensional and incredibly annoyingly written.

We get a speech about how his magical books are unique in this world, but he doesn't bat an eye to seeing a stranger root through the place those books are stored in. And of course, the character is the insanely boring "sexualized, teasing, cold-blooded killer" archetype that dudebros use when they want to write a powerful female character.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
