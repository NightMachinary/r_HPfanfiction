I know it's a bit strange asking this kind of fic. But all I want is how the characters built and changed. The points of the story : - Severus Snape & Harry Potter (main characters) - NO romance - Snape was cruel like he usually was at the beginning of the story but he changed slowly that's why he developed relationship with Harry as mentor, or father, or at least an ally - More than 50k words
