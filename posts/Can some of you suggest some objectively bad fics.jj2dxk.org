I've only started reading Hp fics and I want to see what the worse looks like.


** In FanFiction.net you can search stories. If their summary is something like "Sry for bad grammar this is my first fic just read the story plz review" you can be sure reading it will not be a pleasant experience. However, they are not bad in an interesting way.

Some of the interestingly bad stories are deceptive. You really need to analyse them to realise what is wrong. Many people, especially young people who are interested in romance between two specific characters, fall in love with bad stories that feature such a romance. That way a bad story can become very popular indeed, and more critical readers get annoyed by it. It feels wrong that really flawed stories get more credit than the rare quality stories.

Here are two examples of deceptively bad stories:

*Harry Crow*. The main character is a Mary Sue type who triumphs every challenge he faces, is loved by everyone but his enemies, and is depicted as a hero regardless of what he does. The moral system of the story is that the main character is always in the right and thus can do whatever he wants. His enemies are totally inept, but somehow he doesn't get bored winning. There is drama for the sake of drama, because if the "hero" doesn't get to beat someone up every second chapters, the writer apparently thought it would get boring. (I only read twenty chapters or so before getting too disgusted, I can't know if it continues like this, but I strongly suspect it does.) I suggest you avoid this like the COVID.

*A Cadmean Victory*. This is another really popular story for no good reason. It has unpleasant characters, pointless filler parts, one-dimensional romance, plot that is shoehorned to follow the Station of the Canon, and world building that contradicts the Harry Potter universe. I actually wrote a review of it last months, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ikpo3l/critique_of_a_cadmean_victory/][here is a link to the review]].

** It seems a little mean-spirited to recommend specific stories that aren't parodies or trolls, but I agree with Gavin_Magnus that non-summary summaries tend to accompany not-so-good stories (e.g., "I'm bad at summaries", "This is my first story be gentle", "no proofreader sry for bad grammar", and similar). You could also look up sporks, which is a mocking review of a story that often goes line-by-line criticizing the plot, characterization, etc.

I personally think Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a pretty awful fic, and I'm comfortable saying that given that the author is an awful person in real life, but I don't know if it's objectively bad. It certainly had a large fanbase. My Immortal is a parody of bad fic rather than a genuine effort, but it's a classic if you've somehow never read it. Oh, man, and Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles; it's another parody but it's such a delightful mess.

*** I strongly disagree. Its plot, writing, structure, characterisation, world building, foreshadowing, practically every aspect, is of high quality. Many people dislike it because they don't like the theme or the personality of the main character, but that's a /subjective/ view. This topic is about /objectively/ bad stories, and that means focusing on things that are of interest in a literary scientific way.

**** As much as I hate MoR I have to agree. It's not like it has bad technical writing. Its structure, plot, etc. are not nearly as impressive as you make it out to be, but even then it lands firmly in the category of ‘mediocre.'

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

** I can't remember what the writer's name is but there is this one who always has ensembles of male characters who do some sort of training and have lots of gay sex (like I love slash but this is just, not written very well imo) and it's mostly just really horrible lectures on magical theory; like the worst smug mansplaining ‘I know more than you' kind of thing for chapter upon chapter. he also has Regulus Black and his son smugly saying that them having sex is totally fine and normal lmao, and lesbians can't do this special magical bond thing because they apparently don't have dicks.

I'm also traumatised from some really fucked up scenes involving statutory rape and assault, but that was at least written as a bad thing and the dude was on trial

I have no idea why I read so much of their shit. the premise is often interesting but the writing is so indulgent in male slash and long winded explanations that the fics are ruined

they're not the worst I've ever seen, but I keep coming across their stuff, so it's the first that came to mind.

super prolific though. Like they're doing what they want and obviously enjoying it so power to them tbh
