** A year or two ago, I would have said that a fic like this can't be real.

Now, I simply shrug my shoulders and upvote.

**** It's like a closed ecosystem that keeps evolving weirder and weirder shit. It is equal parts fascinating and revolting to watch, but I can't turn away

** Fanfiction has a wide array of fanfiction which brings about many a reaction. Some of the stories are amazing to the point that I would say, the authors that wrote it should be writing professionally. While others are a train-wreck which you cannot look away from. This is a train-wreck that cannot be looked away from and just brings about a laugh.
