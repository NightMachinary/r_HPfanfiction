Obviously, nobody wins, everyone loses. All it takes is one dumb fuck to release fiendfyre and let it ramp up to take out an entire continent, really, and on the muggles side it only takes one dumb fuck to launch a nuke, then every country starts launching nukes, and next we're in the fallout series with magic deathclaws. Nobody wins.


** Nuclear weapons are unlikely to be used en masse. Wizards don't have enough population centers and strongpoints to make “apocalyptic nuclear exchange” a viable strategy. It would be much smaller than that.

It's also unlikely that fiendfyre would really eat an entire continent, given that this hasn't happened already over the (at least) centuries that fiendfyre has existed.

Crabbe is known as being one of the dumbest people in Hogwarts, so it could be that, it also could be the horcrux vicinity to the casting throwing it off, nobody can really tell, but in history we don't really know because it isn't fleshed out all that well, though I suspect massive rituals could stop a catastrophe of that level, it would require knowledge that it was happening. It is certainly possible that people have lost control of it in the past, and there simply aren't records of it, because it could have destroyed everything.

TL;DR: yeah, we really don't know much about HP history, but you could be correct and it had happened before.

********* War is an extension of politics, in many ways. To reduce it down to "Wars start because people are stupid" is not a good way to do so.

For instance, let's look at the first one you gave as an example. Why did WW1 start? Well, the immediate cause was the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, which started a crisis between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, which escalated through a web of alliances into a full fledged war. That was allowed to happen because all sides involved had reasons for that war.

Germany was the largest single nation pushing for that conflict - by supporting the Austrians and famously issuing them a blank cheque for full support, knowing that it would almost certainly force the Russians into war. Why did they do that? Because if a war were to happen (and by that point, with how tense the situation had grown and all the alliance webs at the ready, it was very likely to happen), they wanted it /now/ - because they believed they were at their relative strongest compared to the Entente (with training, weapons, etc) - which was very possibly true.

The tensions that had grown in the decades earlier were all from long standing friction and nationalism and policies - they weren't as simple as "people being stupid", and often times people making mistakes don't have to be doing them for stupid reasons.

A better word for what you're describing might be flawed - and yes, everyone is flawed. That's part of what makes history - and the world - so interesting to explore and learn about, and what can make it so hard to improve.

** I think the question "which one would win a war" is asked by people who think warfare works like a video game: both sides are instantly and totally unified in purpose, allowing quick action. In real life things would be different.

Muggles are very unwilling to use nuclear weapons. In a war against wizardkind they wouldn't even know where to strike. Many Muggle politicians would point out that since wizards could have enslaved the Muggle world but haven't done so, that means they need not be destroyed. In that case, what do you think British Muggles would do if the USA announced that it would be necessary to nuke London in order to get rid of a few thousand wizards? I think they would say that if the USA nukes London, UK would side with the wizards. That would at least make the USA to think about the consequences, and it would probably be enough time for the wizards to Imperius the American Muggle leaders.

I think wizards would win without casualties. Apparition, Imperius, and Confundus would be all it would take to end the war in a matter of hours.

**** That is of course true, but how realistical is it that Muggles would trust even Muggle-born wizards who offered their help? If Muggles suddenly became aware of the existence of wizardkind, they would probably be the ones to start the violence because of their fear. They are dealing with people who can erase, read, and manipulate their memories and control their minds. If such a person comes to offer help in the fight against their own kin, it would only be the rational decision for the Muggles to open fire at the supposedly helpful wizards before they would enslave them.

Wizards gain their power through magic, but Muggles through the masses of other Muggles they command. That means almost every adult wizard would potentially be an important individual in the war we are speculating about. (By important individual I mean a person who can change the course of the war through their choices.) In the Muggle world of several billion people there are only maybe a few thousand people with enough political and military authority to have the potential to be important individuals. That means in terms of important individuals wizards would actually outnumber the Muggles in a ratio on 1,000:1 or so, depending on how many wizards there are globally. So, even if only one permille of wizards would actively participate in the war, with only little coordination they would be able to quickly Imperius the important Muggle leaders or replace them with Polyjuiced wizards.

But all this speculation is for naught, because realism tilts the scales to the wizards' side before any war can even begin. Since Muggles must first be alerted to the existence of wizardkind, somehow the knowledge must be spread. And that is no easy trick.

Scenario 1: The President of the United States announces that there is a secret society of people with supernatural powers and that they must be eliminated. What would almost every other nation say? "This is the dumbest excuse for American imperialism I've ever heard." No one would take the POTUS seriously, and he would have to think for an alternative method of unifying the Muggle world against the wizards. But the wizards would be alerted to the danger, and they would quickly eliminate the danger by infiltrating every Muggle government, military, and intelligence agency.

Scenario 2: The Secretary-General of the United Nations makes the announcement. Every major country accuses him of trying to create an oppressing world government with a ridiculous reason. In the end, the result is the same as in scenario 1.

I agree though, if if happens the other way around: muggles somehow find out about wizards and go for the genocide, then wizards will win uncontested in canon, after perhaps a short initial setback due to surprise (of course, such fics could introduce things like anti-magic devices to make things more interesting).

** Really, a wizard/muggle war would be three sides:

A: Wizard supremacists. Mostly the kind of wizards that have been hating muggles forever. Goal is to eradicate or enslave all muggles. Led by those with the most combat experience, Death Eaters and similar. Mostly attack muggle cities and infrastructure. Like Death Eaters, but operating internationally and with no regard for secrecy.

B: Muggle supremacists. The weakest faction. Mainly consisting of extremists of all religions, barely unified against the common enemy of satanic witches. Mostly spread hate online and sometimes lynch random muggles they thought were witches, but occasionally they do manage to suicide bomb a magical shopping alley.

C: Everyone else. Most wizards and most muggles, including almost all the governments, militaries and the entire nuclear arsenal. Goal is to stop the war with as few casualties as possible. Mostly respond to Faction A attacks, and are always very busy rebuilding the destroyed infrastructure to prevent the muggle world from collapsing. Have a lot of combined technology and magic projects in development that could eventually win them the war, like invisible flying tanks, technomagic "iron man" suits and magic detecting satellites.

** I agree that a total war muggle vs magical would make losers out of both groups. Part of the problem in this type of discussion is it quickly falls into sides where muggles can't defend against this spell and magicals can't defend against this weapon etc. With both sides explaining why their viewpoint is correct.

Where I believe the issues are much more fundamental than that between the "sides". For me I think the prime issue is "when you think about how magicals and muggles interact in the "universe" you envision how pervasive is the muggle's knowledge of the magical world?

From what I have seen those who believe magicals would kick ass also believe that very few if any muggles know about magic and therefore would be completely surprised by an attack. Those who believe that muggles would kick ass also seem to believe that the muggle knowledge of the magical world is much more pervasive than folks think. And I think than many who believe that a total war would be disastrous for both sides lean towards muggle knowledge of the magical world being much more pervasive.

I believe for the magical/muggle universe I envision (and I think canon supports) that the knowledge of the magical world is much more pervasive than many people think. For one thing the british monarchy etc was established several centuries before the British magicals formed their own government or the Statute of Secrecy was passed. That means first and foremost every British Magical was a British subject first and a magical second. That means that the crown/government was well aware that magicals existed and there may have even been magical advisors to the crown prior to the "separation". Basically, there was probably quite a lot of interaction between muggles and magicals for those centuries before the separation.

Now no government worth it's salt would even hesitate to keep track of a segment of the population that could be a threat to that government. So I could see departments within the military, within the intelligence agencies, and within the government itself that is solely focused on the magical world. These offices would be staffed by a combination of muggles and magicals. Obviously any magical who believed that loyalty to king/queen and country came before loyalty to the magical country. Then magicals who left the magical world squibs, muggleborn, halfbloods etc would be recruited. And then you have all the muggle parents and siblings of magicals that could be potential recruits.

And having centuries to build up knowledge of the magical world and with most likely having magicals support those agencies would have developed detailed contingency plans if it ever came to a war between muggles and magicals. So I believe that most magic targets in the magical world would already be slated for destruction regardless of weapons. Again it would be a disaster for both sides.

The second fundamental issue is "for the universe you envision how do muggles and muggle items react to magic?" For instance, we know in canon that the Imperius can be resisted and that resistance is determined by the strength/willpower of the "victim" and the strength/willpower of the caster. And so there is the possibility of the magical being able to resist the curse. So the question becomes "in your universe can muggles resist the imperius and other compulsion charms?"

In terms of muggle item interaction one of the more common questions is along the lines of "can any muggle weapon harm a magical if he has a shield up?"

To me it seems that often those who support "magicals rule" the answer to those questions is No. Muggles can't resist the imperius or other compulsion charms and magical shields stop all muggle weapons. Wh8ch then results in any outright war magicals would win hands down. Of course, for the "muggles rule" group the opposite occurs eg the magicals have no defense against xyz weapons.

For me, in the universe I envision both sides have strengths that would make them a tough opponent. And both sides have enough weaknesses that can be exploited such that the result is any survivors would not be living a pleasant life.

Of course, what it may really boil down to for some (IMO) is the simple premise of "when I read a Harry Potter story the universe I envision magic is predominant and I really don't want to read how muggle weapons would win the day. I really just want to read about magic."

** I still maintain the side with better planning will win.

​

Also, the Muggles would win, at least in Britain.

​

​

I think it is reasonable to assume any war in the books timeline would come as a surprise to one side: Either muggles deciding they have had enough and launching a decapitating strike or a dark wizard government deciding to go full apocalyptic and take control of the muggles.

​

All wizards would have to do to win is give some false orders or cause confusion resulting in the muggles warring each other.

​

All muggles would have to do is explore some of the limits from magic and equip themselves properly. It is quite clear that magicals rely on muggle ignorance, so it is fair to assume that if muggles started actively working against them it would all fall apart.

​

​

But eh, the magicals in the HP series are.. well... grossly incompetent. The setup is basically 'we are maintaining control via raw power', but also 'we don't have enough raw power to maintain control if we were public'.

​

If the actual institutions of the world were turned against the wizards, they'd be minced meat. Hell, I would think one semi-creative banker could put the magical world into full economic meltdown in a few months.

Is stuff (like for example) satellites affected by magic, do muggle repelling charms work against someone monitoring Diagon Alley with cameras and microphones?

The magical might have put the head in the sand and rested on there laurels, but the muggels probably made not one but hundred plans for the worst case scenario.

**** In HBP we learn that the Ministry inserted Kingsley Shacklebolt into the Prime Minister's office for weeks without the Prime Minister being any the wiser.

So yes, it's not only theoretically possible for a wizard to get close to a Muggle political leader without the Muggles knowing, but has actually occurred within the books.

We also see the Ministry arrange, at short notice, for a foreign president to forget to telephone the Prime Minister just so that Fudge can meet him.

The true answer to wizards vs. Muggles is that there was already a war and wizards won. It's just that it was so one-sided that Muggles don't even know it happened.

** Realistically only a portion of the wizard population would be willing to go to war with the muggles. The rest of the wizards would try to keep out of the conflict or work with the muggles to attain peace. The conflict would probably start after some big attack that tears down the statute of secrecy. At that point magical figureheads would contact muggle leaders and hopefully large scale nuclear annihilation would be avoided. After that the situation would devolve to something similar to the war on terror (a perpetual and futile occupation), except these guys are impossible to find... assuming global cooperation to end the new threat.

More realistically every country would try to outmaneuver the other to gain some advantage in the geopolitical landscape. I don't see China and Russia playing nice with the US, EU and UK if there's something to be gained. With magicals cooperating with the governments it would be harder to overrun everyone with imperius. To think about how everything would turn out you have to stipulate what's the endgame for the magical terrorists.

In open war on a field of battle I don't see wizards winning against drones. By the time they hear something it's too late to react and avoid the payload. I mean, it's canon that they were caught in the witch hunts (even if they trivialized the whole burning at the stake thing). Not to mention that spell fire isn't particularly fast since everyone in the series is able to dodge or deflect them. I don't know that an average wizard can take down a combat ready 99 percentile soldier/athlete (take your pick) that's been briefed about what they can do. If teenagers can deal with apparition, so can they. So if the wizard terrorist want to win they have to rely on guerilla tactics and being sneaky.

Better yet, avoiding a war altogether by seizing control of the governments 1 by 1 through judicious use of imperius, but that ignores the hypothetical and that's no fun.

** To be frank, Magicals would /easily/ win based on their skills at infiltration and /just how scattered the magical world is/.

The /vast majority/ of the magical world is scattered around predominantly-Muggle cities and towns. That alone means "superior firepower" isn't really an option for warfare - you can't bomb Diagon Alley without hitting other, Muggle parts of London. If anyone tried the "superior firepower" route, the collateral would cause in-fighting among the Muggles and inevitably it'd be Muggle vs. Muggle, the magical world sitting on the sidelines with popcorn.

There's only so many neat little magic-only villages like Hogsmeade to attack, most of them hidden from Muggles by means that would probably defeat any targeting systems - so there's nothing there to bomb as far as the Muggles know.

Meanwhile, the Magical side of things doesn't even have to resort to Unforgivables to cause enough in-fighting and tactical disruption for the Muggles to self-destruct over it. There's a mind-boggling menagerie of mental muckery that magicals can muster /without/ resorting to Imperius. It's all too easy for the magical side to cause the muggles to de-escalate (or wipe itself out with its own weapons, if you consider "one side doesn't exist anymore" to be the only win condition) with a few well-placed Confundus Charms, obliviations and/or false memory spells.

Plus, /nothing is preventing the Magical side from getting access to Muggle goods/ - by which I don't just mean weaponry. It's damn near impossible to tell whether someone's a wizard/witch unless they dress in outrageously-obvious robes and/or openly flourish a wand, which just makes it even easier for them to hide until the Muggles think they won.

** The devil is in the details for a muggle - wizard war - it's impossible to say outright without that.

The power of magic vs technology is not something that's particularly explored, especially in combat situations, for instance. Different stories could have very different interpretations there, that would make things tilt one way or the other.

Past that, the circumstances leading up to the conflict are vitally important. Who's the one discovering the other? Do they have time to learn/study the capacities of that side and plan before the conflict? How competent are they?

For instance, a situation where wizards are striking first, after actually taking the time to study the muggles and plan out how to do so, they would likely win without any issues at all. However, that would require a more muggle conscious and competent wizard situation (eg, a smarter Voldemort that recognizes the threat muggle weapons could bring).

At the same time, wizards tend to be extremely air-headed towards Muggles, and not be particularly competent (at least in canon). In that situation, it's very easy to imagine a situation where competent muggle forces could plan and execute an attack or operation aimed at magic users. The modern capabilities are far out of line with what wizards seem to expect out of muggles - and the advantage of surprise is massive. The extremely low number of wizards in canon - and the even lower number of /competent/ wizards) is a big advantage for Muggles there, as well.

A MAD scenario like the one you mention seems less likely to me. It mostly seems to require a situation where both sides learn about each other at roughly the same time, but don't have particularly long to identify the abilities of that side before acting - because otherwise full scale war would be at least avoided by both sides, kind of like a Cold War equivalent. It would take a /lot/ of escalation for nukes to be used - and for that to reach that point, it has to be that Wizards wouldn't know about the capabilities and have them disabled.

** While there's some unknown factors about the relationship between Muggles and magic (ie does the Imperius curse work? Do potions work?), I think overall the response time to any threat means that the wizarding world has a huge advantage.

We also know very little actual battle magic that exists. Beyond fiendfyre, there really aren't many mass-target spells shown. I have to imagine there are more though, and they could be used to take out entire army bases at the first sign of orders.

It'd be easy enough for someone disillusioned to spy on every general and major politician in the country and plan pre-emptive strikes. If you can use potions on muggles, you can just hit the water supply of major cities with draught of living death if it really came down to it as well.

The only scenario I can envision a Muggle-side winning is if they were fighting alongside Dumbledore against Voldemort. Or if the goblins could somehow manage to finagle an alliance

** I think muggles would win. Magical Brittain has about 10.000 citizens. I can't imagine they have more than 600 Aurors.

And then look on the official website of the British army: they have 112.000 men on regular and reserve service. Then they have planes and drones and while magic can disturb electronics the drones will be several hundred meters in the air. Muggles also have Infrared cameras, snipers(you will be dead before you even noticed you're dead), martial arts, probably better discipline and strategic.

And on top of that will come the Muggleborn, Half-bloods and Squibs who are fed up with the crap they had to endure in the Wizarding World and will help the military to end them. They could show them the way to hidden places like Diagon Ally, Hogsmeade or the Houses of Wizards and Witches.

I honestly think wizards wouldn't have much of a chance. At the beginning of course, since it will be so strange and new to fight against magic but when they got the hang of it and now what to look for and to do I see not a good future for wizards

The only thing stopping that in HP is that other wizards would stop you - "the other side has magic too". Without that barrier in place, I not only think wizards would win against the Muggle world, but that a /single/ competent wizard would win against the Muggle world.
