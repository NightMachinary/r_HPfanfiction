As the title says, I'm looking for a story where (Harry preferably) controls the body of other people next to his own, with a shared consciousness.

If anyone could help me out thanks a lot!

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.

** I cant remember its name and it was only a couple chapters before being abandoned, but I once read a story where Harry controls both his and Ginnys bodies after the event in the Chamber. I believe in the last chapter posted Dumbledore dies and harry is framed for it.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.
