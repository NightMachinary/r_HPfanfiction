Tom Riddle had a secret fascination with watching the tramps. They were crazy, everyone said. And he had to agree. The Gaunts carried sticks everywhere, and Marvolo, the eldest, was obsessed with a locket, gold with a glittering green /S/ engraved into it.

The girl called Merope had done something both ridiculous and amusing today. She had waved that stick and said a word, /Accio/ he thought, and her pet snake had run to her. He had thought perhaps it was a word the snake recognized, like the way his father directed the horse-drawn carriage, But how did the snake fly?

Tom had to try this. He pulled a branch off the magnolia tree in the yard, and shouted, "/Accio!/" The door swung open of its own accord and the china sugar bowl landed gently on the ground in front of him.

Tom stood there, astonished. He had no idea anything like this could ever happen. Either he was insane, this was normal, or he was special and destined for great--

Was that an owl? With a letter? At three in the afternoon?
