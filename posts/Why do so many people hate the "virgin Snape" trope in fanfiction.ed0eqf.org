** This is the first I've ever heard of that trope, but I'm not really a snape fan so I don't go looking for fics related to him fucking

** By Virgin Snape you mean a Snape that's NOT a sex-god right? Lol I wish I would read a well-done fic on that. SexGodSnape is as annoying as SexGodMalfoy.

** Do they? Where do you find these haters? Maybe the people who just like fanfic for smut want to use every character for sexual adventures, and don't want to hear that it's OOC for Snape to be this experienced sexual virtuoso.

Virgin Snape makes perfect sense to me. The guy was an incel.

** I think some people find a 40 year old virgin incredulous? Personally, I think it's possible, even if only taken from a perspective of extreme paranoia.
