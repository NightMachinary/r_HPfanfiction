Those covers are gorgeous! Especially the 4th cover! I think I have a new image! I now have new image-go-tos for Fleur, Cedric, and Krum. The trio aren't looking half bad either on the 7th cover. Link to an image set below if you're lazy to google.

** My reaction;

1) Very, very nice art.

2) The artist obviously saw the movies, and then still did their own thing. Impressive.

3) Less going on here, but I'm really starting to love this art style.

4) Ooh, nice composition. There's so much going on, front and back. How is “The Goblet of Fire” only 6 characters long!? Do you speak Thai? Can you tell me how to say that?

5) This. This is beautiful. I'm guessing that's the Ministry. There's a great looking Luna, and a very hate-able looking Umbridge. (Edit: Luna is the only one who isn't looking straight on)

6) Young /Tom/ and old Snape, with +Lily+ Ginny over there with the quidditch team, very fitting. Harry wearing his cloak next to Dumbledore looks so amazing. The Inferi reaching for them, Draco looking at Dumbledore, subtle, and sad. Also, that Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is now my headcanon.

7) There's the snitch, and the Hallows symbol, just combined and I love it. Voldemort has a nose, and is still snake-like. Yes. That, is amazing. The four house animals all leaping together, house unity!! Sword in the hat, and Nagini looks so great, with Neville +crouching there ready to cut her head off.+ Above her with the sword in hat right next to him. (Edit: +The Ron here contrasts so well with the Ron back at book 4+ Nope, that's Neville.)

The sword in the hat made me look back and notice all the fricken details in the embroidery in the solid colours. Just. Wow. Please, someone, publish this in English.

Edit: my number 1 take away still stands. New headcanon images for the cast and I'm adding the façade of WWW to it.

My image quality isn't great, so I can't appreciate the art of some of the smaller characters, but looking made me notice that there's always something in the picture /curving/ near the title which is also curving. It's way more noticeable in the last 4.

And on the chamber of secrets cover (I assume I don't speak Finnish but its the second one), I assume the person grabbing Harry is Lockhart? And what's with the dark haired guy and boy in the background? If the cover is supposed to be set in Flourish and Blotts, via context that is presumably Lucius and Draco...so why aren't they blonde?

Apart from that they look alright if a bit childish but they're a lot better than the Bulgarian ones. Thailand wins this one hands down though I think.

I love how the artist packed so many details and clues into each book cover; the Triward Champions all together but Harry still in the center of book 4's cover; Luna on the back of book 5; interesting how Lupin as werewolf was done on book 3, and I like how they made Voldy's skin snakelike on book 7's cover.

I think they made Ron a bit more handsome than I imagine him on book 7, and Cho looks different in my imagination too (book 5 cover off to the side, I think), but that's alright. Great covers! Beautiful, and exquisitely detailed.

Apparently they hired some 70-year-old guy who has been defacing children's books for decades. It got so bad it was even on the news. Some people even defended these monstrosities. I'm so glad I learned English years ago so I just ordered the house editions.

It's obviously meant to look like a child did it since it's a series for children. That's decently common for kid's books, I think. It's not to my taste, but it's a consistent style, not the kind of thing that happens by accident to people who are actually bad at art. Since this guy is a popular illustrator, I guess people there are used to his style. I do like some of the more unusual scenes he chose, like Hagrid's brother getting attacked by the centaurs and the grindylows going after Harry.

** Very charming art style, and I love all of Harry's outfits. They're awesome. I want these covers on my English books, lol.

SS/PS:

- I love how the Sorting Hat blends with Hogwarts to make it look like Harry's wearing a castle on his head. It's hilarious and adorable.

CoA:

- I love spiders and the movie's ten-foot wolf spiders didn't bother me at all, but that giant weaver is kind of creepy, lol.

- Dobby's adorable.

- So are those pixies.

- So is the Burrow. :P

PoA:

- Buckbeak looks /epic./

- That Patronus is beautiful.

- Tiny Peter-rat running on two feet like a cartoon mouse, lol.

GoF:

- The Quidditch World Cup gets more attention on a book cover than in the movie. Still mad about that. >:(

- They went with the movie direction of making the Horntail a wyvern instead of a dragon, but I guess that's just canon now. :/ Looks great, anyway.

OotP:

- Umbridge looks a little like a cross between my headcanon image and the movie version, and it's awful and creepy, and I love it as much as I can love anything to do with her.

- I'm guessing the tertiary character (to the right of Sirius) is Cho?

- That phone booth just floating there like a red TARDIS, lol.

HBP:

- Pfft ahahaha they did it again with blending the castle into Dumbledore's head. That confirms it's intentional, and I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything when I saw it, because I'd have spat it all over my keyboard.

- Weasley Wizard Wheezes' storefront makes me uncomfortable, but it also makes me want to laugh. So I'm kind of just laughing uncomfortably. :P

DH:

- Snakedemort looks awesome.

- Hedwig looks like a sparrow next to an anaconda. :(

- I love the tiny detail of the House animals leaping into action with the Founders' objects above Ron/Hermione's heads.

Just gonna point out that there is no actual dragon canon. Dragons look very differently around the world, and european definitions aren't the be all end all.

Nevermind that this distinction doesn't actually exist. They're both just dragons.

And there /is/ a commonly-accepted distinction between dragons and wyverns; dragons have four legs, and wyverns have two. Just because movies have decided to ignore it as of late doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

*** Same!

It puzzles me that there it is not a common thing for book publishers to make the most of cover art by issueing it as prints or posters. At least for a big fandom like HP, they'd surely be popular!

The points of the triangle of the Hallows having the wand, cloak, and stone; the Founder's relics being held by the animals on their crests; the silhouettes of Death holding the stone and wand on each side of Harry to mirror him possessing the cloak; Hermione and Ron with their bequeathments from Dumbledore and of course, the snitch in front of Harry; Hagrid carrying Harry's body out of the woods; the dragon rescued from Gringotts; Neville with the outline of the Sorting Hat and Sword surrounding him; Harry burying Dobby; and finally, the golden frame around Harry (a repeated motif across all covers) has the lightning bolt symbol.

** Couple thoughts:

Wow these are beautiful.

It looks like the 'villains' for each book are all in the top left corner on the front? Diary!Tom, Sirius (basically the villain for PoA), Moody (would be a huge spoiler if these weren't 20th anniversary versions), Umbridge, Snape (turns out to be working on Dumbledore's orders, but still the villain of HPB), and finally Voldemort in all his glory. Love it.

The only thing is that Dumbledore is in the same spot for PS. Is...is Dumbledore the villain of the first book?

** The covers are beyond amazing!

The only thing I have a little issue with is the face of Voldemort on the DH cover. He looks almost like a snake. Voldemort was supposed to have /snake-like/ features, almost stripped of humanity, but essentially a human devoid of empathy and absolutely immersed in evil. His plans and designs of power, domination and supremacy are that of a human's. It's an important thing to bear in mind while picturing Voldemort.

Kudos, once again to brilliant artwork and design though. I'd definitely buy the books once again if they released them with these covers!

** Yeah, I'm liking these. Dumbledore with the beard that just goes everywhere is pretty neat, and the triwizard champions look amazing. Krum's got that daedric armor. And I really like this version of moody. It emphasizes the eye while not overstylizing the rest of his character. It always struck me as odd that the films made him such a ragged and personality-driven figure that his eye basically went unnoticed. But that's a general gripe I have with those, everything in those movies just seems somewhat dirty to me - all the places, all the characters. It's like they've never even heard about combs or sweeping brooms. Even malfoy looks filthy, and Harry himself remarked on how neatly combed back his hair is.
