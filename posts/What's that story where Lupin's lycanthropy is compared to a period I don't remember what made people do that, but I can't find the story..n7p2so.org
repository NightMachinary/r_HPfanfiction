** Many times. I am not sure which one it was, but good!Petunia there remarked that there is really not much difference from her only that once a month he can actually bite everybody elses' head off.

    1. Chapter 6: Chamber of Secrets I:

    Rising Phoenix: Why is Remus "Fuzzyfather"? Well, Sirius was trying to obliquely poke fun at Remus's 'monthlies'... you know, the ones where he sprouts fur, fangs, and claws, and howls at the full moon...

    1. Chapter:

    "Oh, well, if you're sensitive about it, I won't mention it, but really? It's a disease. It gives you monthlies that make what normal girls have look mild. Not that I know yet, thank goodness, but why would anyone care?"

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.

** First one I recall was Cloudy with a Chance of Freedom by SakuraDemonAlchemist over on ffn. Told to Snape by Harry as a tag line for Wolfsbane potion, partially to prank Sirius and Remus. I, personally, think it was fine just to give a half decent reason for a gut wrenching laugh come from Snape's mouth.

Dunno if that's the first usage, but it's the one I recall most.

** Is this the one where Lupin is handed medication to help with cramps by a sympathetic upper year girl and it turns out to actually help? If so, I don't remember but wish you luck in finding it. RemindMe! 5 days.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
