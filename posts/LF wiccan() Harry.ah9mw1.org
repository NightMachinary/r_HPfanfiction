Looking for a storty where Harry kinda realises that he's different before Hogwarts. I mean, his hair growing back and being able to appear on a roof-top starts him on investigating things.

I think a natural place to go to would be wiccan (or whatever, I don't know the names and details about those beliefs, but the point is the same) - or similar to a wiccan place to learn magic before Hogwarts.

It doens't have to be wiccan or whatever, but something where he seizes control of his magic earlier.


** I'd also be interested in a Harry who is quick to get rid of his muggle upbringing, including spirituality. If that starts to happen before Hogwarts, even better. Unfortunately I have nothing of the sorts remembered.

I got distracted part was into my search and discovered the second ever slash-fic I could actually read. I'll link that if I'm asked for it, but I know people tend to despise it(I do too), so otherwise I won't.

  The title says it all really. Too much more and I'd give away the story. There is no point to this one though, just a random thought turned into a fic.
