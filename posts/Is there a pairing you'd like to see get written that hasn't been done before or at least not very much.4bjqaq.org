In my case, I'd like to see more HermioneXLavender, just cos that would be beautifully entertaining. Wouldn't even have to be done well to gain my enjoyment.


** Ron/Luna. I think they're hilarious together.

#+begin_quote
  “I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle's low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I... must... not... look... like... a... baboon's... backside.”

  Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing. Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs and on to the floor.

  “That was funny!”

  Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and forwards, clutching her sides.

  “Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her.

  “Baboon's... backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.

  [...]

  “I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commentates from now on... Loser's Lurgy...”

  [..]

  “Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.

  “You're making fun of me, aren't you?” she said. “Everyone says I was dreadful.”

  “No, I'm serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can't remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?” he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.

  “Oh, it's a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. “You can keep it if you like, I've got a few of them. They're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.” And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.

  “You know, she's grown on me, Luna,” he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. “I know she's insane, but it's in a good ---”

Unfortunately, it is hard to find a fic where it doesn't play second string to a Harry/Hermione relationship. There are a couple of good ones though. linkffn(Disbelieving in Trees) is hilarious and linkffn(Of Bare Feet and Blubbering Humdingers by A Million Ways) is decent. [[http://rwll-ficathon.livejournal.com/3045.html#cutid1][Drifting]] and [[http://rwll-ficathon.livejournal.com/3969.html][Loony for Luna]] are enjoyable oneshots.

Edit: Some other couples want to read about: Ron/Tonks, Ron/SlytherinGirl, Ginny/Seamus, Ginny/Dean, Bill/Fleur, Harry/Molly Weasley (preferably with time-travel).

  Non-epilogue compliant. Four years after the war ends, Ron quits the aurors and moves back in with his parents. Luna has returned from her world travels, older, wiser and now her owl has low self-esteem. Oh, and Harry finds the whole thing hilarious. A Ron/Luna fic because it's weirdly perfect.

**** I think the triangle Hermione - Ron - Harry is often very dependent on subjective experiences. I'd argue that both pairs would work, but harbour great potential for total failure.

Especially when it comes to Harry and him not having goals, the single fact that he killed Voldemort would open up an entire cosmos of new things for him to consider. When all he ever wished for before was peace/Voldemort dead, reaching this goal would certainly change him. Depending on how you write it it would make the relationship more or less difficult. Same with Hermione of course. You don't get tortured, fight battles and loose loved ones without something in you changing. This is one of the reasons I prefer post-Battle HHr fics over pre-DH ones.

When it comes to Ron I see the relationship working if he gets over his jealousy, and I see it failing if he keeps playing down the accomplishments of others to make himself feel better.

Bottomline is that I'd see HHr working before I see RHr working. But my favorite outcome would've been if each of them ended up with someone outside the trio.

***** Not much, sadly. There's a few cute one-shots.

Chivalry by Rozarka is stupid cute, despite only Viktor and Professor McGonagall having any screen time. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/474798]])

The Language of Flowers is another short, cute one. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/474711]]) And I'll also recommend one more Rozarka, More Than Kisses, as well linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/474762]]). She also writes smut, but I'm not as fond of it, for whatever reason.

I vaguely remember reading Looks Can Be Deceiving linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3630213/chapters/8016714]]) and finding it rather intensly fluffy, with overpowered protagonists, but it's also one of the very few long fics with the pairing. And the writing style is reasonable enough. You could do worse if you're in the mood for a very long fluff fic.

Your comment inspired me to read Spoken and Unspoken linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8242796/1/Spoken-and-Unspoken]]), which is why it's taken me so long to respond. It's a fairly straightforward romance, but the charactizations are some of the more true to canon that I've seen (I particularly like Ron, actually, who has his canon flaws but also that endearing quality that almost never makes it into a fic, and particularly not a Hermione-centric one where she's paired with someone else). I really, really like how the author captures the awkwardness and overconfidence mixed with vulnerability of teenagers. I'm not sure if it's compelling enough to lure new people to the ship, but it's definitely enjoyable if you enjoy VK/HG, and it lacks the sort of irritations that drive someone away from a fic. It's the only longish VK/HG that I'd recommend, really.

** Harry x fem!Tom Riddle or fem!Voldemort. I think I've seen this all of twice.

Harry x Cho. Shamefully rare. There's room to do so much for Cho too -- she didn't get a fair shake in canon.

Hermione x Luna. Talk about opposites attracting!

Luna x Ginny. Way more appealing than canon ships will ever be to me.

Harry x fem!Neville. I have no idea if this even exists but I want it to.

Sirius x Remus x Tonks. Have yet to run into this, surprisingly.

Harry x any male character where neither of them fall into slash cliches, yaoi lies, or mpreg. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] by Carnivorous Muffin is the only one that comes to mind that I've liked, probably because the author writes the characters as if they're actually people instead of an assemblage of LGBT stereotypes. (It helps that it isn't a romance-focused fic.) This may seem harsh, but I'm a queer dude-ish person, so I really /cannot/ stand seeing horribly inaccurate depictions of m/m relationships.

** I'd like to see more Harry/Gabrielle. I like the pairing because some of my favourite stories are Harry/Fleur, but one of the few canon pairings that I agree with is Bill/Fleur. There's not much of it and only a couple that I personally enjoyed reading.

Edit: FanfictionBot went out of Order. First story is Broken Pieces. Second is A Wizard's Fairytale. Third is the New Dark Lord. Forth is Back to the World.

This is one of the Harry/Gabrielle stories that I enjoyed reading. Shame it hasn't been updated since October, after having been started in July. linkffn(11372848)

I personally enjoyed reading this story. However, it's incredibly AU, contains a lot of bashing, and is on hiatus. linkffn(7997729)

This was a good one, albeit somewhat cliche ridden and contains bashing. The description says that it's in progress again, but I wouldn't count on many updates. The author effectively gave up writing after all of the hate he got for the depressing ending of one of his other stories, but has posted one more update to this story since. Personally, I liked the ending to his other story, but my favourite fanfiction is When a Veela Cries, which is effectively an everybody dies story. linkffn(9458931)

This one's a one-shot. A 20,000 word one-shot, but it's a one-shot. linkffn(11326267)

*** There is SO much potential in Hermione/Tonks. I love the dynamic that's explored in "Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation", except it could never happen in that fic.

Hermione/Bellatrix is wonderful too - my favourite fic in that pairing is easily linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). You've probably read that, though.

I'm not sure if I've read THAW before - I might have started and stopped. The only other Hermione/Bellatrix one I can remember is when there was no Voldemort and Bellatrix was an auror, but I stopped mainly because of the abrupt time change.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Rowling's [[http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a8/Pagenotes.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071015200310][original list of 40 students]] gives a bit more info than the first book.

- Mandy Brocklehurst is a half blood

- Su Li (who isn't even mentioned in the books) is also a half blood

- Morag MacDougal (using her name in the book, not what Rowling originally listed) is a pure blood

  Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope

** I don't see nearly enough time-travelling Harry/Sirius, where it's Harry who takes the dominant role. Usually it's Sirius, and sometimes they're creaturefics where Harry is super-submissive.

No. I want to see powerful Harry coming back to get what he wants, and Sirius (and the rest of the Marauders) adapting to this changed world--child soldiers whose war ended before they got to go off and fight, and who now face a peaceful world as warriors. I want to see Harry lured closer and closer to the Dark by the realisation that he has the strength to take whatever he desires.

Doesn't matter whether this ends in a downward spiral of angst, or by some miracle/deus machina is resolved happily. I would even take poorly-written crap. I read a one-shot that tackled some of it, but it didn't take it far enough out to really satisfy.

ETA: I'd take any sort of dominant!Harry/Sirius, really.

** I'd like to see more Harry/Narcissa. Post-war coping of both characters can have them come together wonderfully. I've seen it done well once: Narcotic Effects. I'd like to see more and with different takes on the characters and situations that evolve from post-war magical Britain.

Also Harry banging Draco's mom is hilarious.

Harry and cho they went out and if you write her non weepy then she has so much potential! Harry and Parvati have harry get to know Parvati and actually pay attention to her during the Yule ball

Get away from the giggling gossip girl and give her an actually interesting personality and you have a lot of potential

** Harry/Canon Blaise Zabini

There's some out there, but I haven't found one I really like. Firstly, I can't go back past HBP because that's where we really meet him. Before that, Zabini's characterization varies wildly. I also don't like Indy Harry or overpowered Harry fic, and that seems to be the norm when pairing him with a minor Slytherin.
