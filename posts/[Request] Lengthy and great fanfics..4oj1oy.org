Hey fellas!

I just finished reading Dangerverse, which has a few faults, but is a great story overall, atleast to me.

I've also read the Psychic Serpent story, AlexandraQ, the one about Connor Potter, HP and the Methods of Rationality, and one where they were all pagans.

I find myself craving one or more fanfics that cover several years with original characters/NextGen/Marauders or just simply AU with semi-decent characters.

The important part that they're atleast 150k+ words a "book", with several books.

Any tips/recommendations?


** Try the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][series written by murkybluematter]] starting with "The Pureblood Pretense" - it's an AU!genderbender where Hogwarts only accepts Purebloods, but Harriet Potter wants nothing more than to study to be a potion's master under Professor Severus Snape, the youngest/best potions master. She swaps places with a (male) relative and they pretend to be each other while at school (so it's a genderbender within a genderbender). Not all 7 years are covered yet but it's definitely worth a read.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** The first fic that came to mind is A Second Chance at Life linkffn(2488754), which is a trilogy, very AU and explores other magical societies.

I'm not sure what you like, so I'm just going to leave some various different types of fics, all lengthy, but not all of them are complete yet :) I can't remember enough about them to introduce them all, but I saved these for re-reading so they're (probably) all great!

*AU*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/979216/1/The-Dragonmasters]]

*Romantic, but AU and very well written:*

*Semi-AU of Harry with alternate upbringing:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black]] (Pureblood culture)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7724057/1/Family-Bonds]] (Severitus)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/Gabriel]]

*Dimension Travel, all AU*:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7319686/1/Old-Souls]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6147206/1/Wand-Cores]]

** Have you read linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie) ? It covers the Marauder and 2nd war period, but it's time travel. (Smut and romance warning)

If you liked the interesting magic and original characters aspect of Dangerverse, you might like linkffn(Resonance by greengecko) . Fair warning, the third in the trilogy was wrapping up but incomplete. No word on if something happened to the author.

**** The first is extremely long, if you can make it to part 2, that's where the real plot kicks in. The second one is longer than it truly needs to be, but for me the concepts made it worth it. Others may not feel the same!

I'm currently halfway through linkffn(the unspeakable files: godspell by anotherspoonybard) and so far, I'm really enjoying it. It's got interesting magic and magical theory, it's an au mystery with mythology twisted in it that's ~8 years after the war. The listed ships though are Draco/Luna and Snape/Hermione, but at the point I'm at, it's barely hints. Only 100k words, but complete, so it's not quite what you're looking for. Maybe something to go on the list though!

** Linkffn(Gray: Scorpius Malfoy and the Blood Runes)

Yet another next-gen fic series, this one with some of the most developed characters. Stick with it at the start, it gets better and less confusing. The first book is the worst and the seventh is poor as it hasn't been edited yet, but the rest are all amazing. I hope you like flashbacks.

P.S. You specified lengthy? Several million words and still being updated with 8 books overall.

*** I can't agree less. [[http://blog.ikeran.org/?p=201][The worldbuilding is too poor]] for me to tolerate it.

Maybe the third book made it all make sense. Maybe I forgot something in the second book that explained it all. But that's poor writing.

**** Really? I thought it did fine establishing a parallel orgin mythos around which all the conflict in the series emanated. I mean, theres plot holes and lots of poor choices made by a whole lot of people but thats not necessarily bad writing.

The source of conflict is okay. Makes me think the author is a fedora, but I could ignore that.

Practically every aspect of the story requires me to wonder: is this strange behavior a plot hook hinting at another actor, or is it that the author's bad at worldbuilding? On a reread, I found myself wondering that about an entirely new aspect of the story more than once per chapter.

Yes, it's bad writing.

Any Harem, including this one, is an instant "the author is a neckbeard" flag for me. Im with you there.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

*** I want to second this. The series is really good. It goes slightly off the rails by the end, nothing too egregious, but the harem part is never a problem because it /makes sense within the context of a vastly alternate universe/ and is one of the main things which drives the plot forward.

** have you tried Bobmin's Sunset/Sunrise? I don't care for the disclaimers but they can tell a pretty good story, imo. Not sure it reaches 'great' status but.. It's a super!harry but not god!harry. it's got a super!voldie as well. YMMV, hope you like it.
