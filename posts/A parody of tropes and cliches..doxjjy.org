** Huh. Well, if I were going to go by the title alone, I would have suggested [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]].

But hmm...a parody where Hermione is explicitly sidelined to let Harry shine? I can't recall one like that...\\
Do you remember which site it's on? Or how long the story is? Was it a one-shot that raced blisteringly fast through the plot or multiple chapters that systematically parodied canon and its fanon twists one after another?

*** It was in FFN and it was multiple chapters that parodied canon. I took a look at Potter Ever After and while similar, it's just not it.
