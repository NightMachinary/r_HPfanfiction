I know I've read one already, I just can't remember where. In it, Hermione marries a muggle as intelligent as she is and is happy. She's working in the magical world, her husband's working in the muggle world. She's happy because they respect and accept each other even if they're from different worlds.


** I remember that it was a one-shot and written drabble style.

I'm still not able to locate that fic, which makes me think it might have been 1) a figment of my imagination, 2) part of a collection of plot bunnies (which makes it hard to find) or 3) Hermione's name was not explicitly stated; it was just implied that it was about her and a Muggle.

Oh well... Any thoughts about this? Or anyone here who knows stories about a wizard or witch marrying a muggle and the story focuses on how they get along with each other?
