:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a harry potter fic, Harry is a succubus (I think) draco is a vampire, they are mates. Harry is in a band, they visit Hogwarts. But the band plays in clubs. The author added actual song lyrics to the fic. Anyone know the title or author? I've been looking for a while and can't find it


** this sounds like...

you want to use the “What's that fic” tag instead of the “request” tag. The former indicates a single fic you're searching for, while the latter is for broader searches, e.g. “Harry/Daphne fics”

*** It is, but it was part of the plot that he was a succubus not an incubus
