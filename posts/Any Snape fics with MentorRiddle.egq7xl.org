As canon also emphasizes, there are quite some similarities between Snape and Voldemort's origin if you don't go into the details. I wonder if there are any Snape-centric fics that kind of lead into a darker timeline where Snape studied and developed under Voldemort's influence. I think I don't care where the endgame is, Snape finding hope in himself or diving into despair as long as the story is well written.

Honestly, I don't have too much hope for recommendations but would love to be pleasantly surprised.


** Well, Benefits of Old Laws has hints of that. In it Voldemort regains his sanity and he's nice to Snape. I know it's not what you want, but it's similar, so, sorry in advance. linkao3(10691892)

*** You're right it's not exactly what I want but I am still separately interested in it. Can you give a brief summary of the premise? The official one doesn't tell me much. Thanks.

**** So, Voldemort after resurrection somehow regains his sanity as the diary had been destroyed. Then he makes Snape brew a potion to help him gain a proper body. After this, he manages to get cleared by the wizengamot using the old laws, gains guardianship over Harry and regains Snape's loyalty. The remainder is about how he manages to further his agenda politically and also about how he comes to terms with his new found morality and attachment to Harry.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5601229/chapters/12905599][The Carriage Held]] explores the idea that Voldemort had a closer, mentor-like relationship with Snape before his demise.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]
