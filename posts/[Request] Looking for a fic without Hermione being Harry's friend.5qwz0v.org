** I love Hermione, but I've also read some decent fics without Hermione being Harry's friend:

"Emperor", linkffn(5904185): Harry didn't know her.

"Gothic", linkffn(11922116): Hermione appeared only briefly, Harry didn't know her.

"Harry Potter and Death's Ultimatum", linkffn(8286141): Hermione left with Ron, Harry was not pleased, they made it up eventually, but were not close anymore.

"Inverted", linkffn(4849382): IMO megamatt09's best fic, and has the most evil Hermione I've found so far.

"The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House" and its sequel "The Hogwarts Six and The Darkest Wizard", linkffn(11677935;11280068): Hermione didn't exist.

"The Red Knight", linkffn(12141684): Ron was the MC, and Hermione has been the main antagonist so far. Although Violet (Harry) still remained friend with her, their relationship became strained.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(For Love of Magic) comes to mind, mostly because I'm reading it right at this moment. It's pretty great so far, though Harry gets sexually active pretty early. If that squicks you, I'd pass it by. Fun rune work, though.

*** The method of writing her out leaves a lot to be desired. I don't mind if you don't like the character or the demands of your plot require her absence, but I can't help but feel that it doesn't serve the plot here.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
