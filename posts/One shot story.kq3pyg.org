Hello, I've been looking for this one specific story I read a while back. From what I remember Harry isolates himself from society due to the war and his friends dying. His only friend is Daphne, I think, and eventually they get him to do something idk. At the end he intentionally traps himself into a illusion or like dream thing so he can be with his friends and family. That's all I remember any help would be appreciated, thanks!
