Hey yall,

Scorose is undoubtedly my favorite pairing of all time, but I feel like I've hit a wall in finding new fics to read and am hoping to garner some recs here.

My all time favorite fan fic is the Stygian Triology (literally cried the first time I read it) and other favorite authors on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] include Languidbones and GraeLiars, off of the top of my head, but plenty others I am leaving out here.

I prefer novel length since I tend to bury myself in a fic for as long as possible, but open to well-written one shots or vignettes. I do love if there is something else going on besides the Rose/Scorpius relationship--why Ignite is one of my favorites--but I am also okay with that being the main focus of the story.

Any recs deeply appreciated!

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
