This is both a prompt and a discussion. I have long been curious as to what Dumbledore and/or Harry would have done if the Wizengamot had been either more corrupt, less understanding, or less believing with regards to Harry's use of magic against "supposed" (in the Wizengamots view) Dementors at the start Order of the Phoenix.

Would Dumbledore have been forced to take action to prevent Harry being arrested or his wand being snapped? Would he have been able to offer refuge at Hogwarts somehow (at least initially) since he makes it clear that in his view, the Ministry has no say about suspending students or interfering with the school. Would Harry himself have tried to take action? Would a revolt of any sort have developed then and there between factions within the Wizangamot?

Thoughts or responses?


** Dumbledore points the Elder Wand at Harry's snapped Holly wand, "Reparo."

Handing it back to the young man. "Harry, as you are no longer a student, I wonder if you might do me a favor. You see, I'm in need of someone to fill the vacant post of Professor for defense against the dark arts." Eyes twinkling, Dumbledore smiles, "Know anyone?"

*** It is a rather cool prompt and it would work with fanon, but probably not with Canon "Order of the Phoenix" Dumbledore, as he feared the whole book that Voldemort had too much influence over Harry.

And giving Harry the teaching position that Voldemort always wanted would run contrary to that imho. Though he would surely offer him a place at Hogwarts, so that he could monitor him more closely.

I could rather see that Harry has to become Severus's assistant to make both of them miserable XD

** The Wizengamont doesn't have the power to expel students, only the Headmaster does. Removing such a popular Headmaster at the time would have been political suicide for Fudge, which is why he tried to slowly chip away at Dumbledore's influence using Umbridge (unsuccessfully it must be added). Even if the expulsion stood, Dumbledore would have every right to keep Harry on as a "member of staff" like Hagrid. The only other option would be to order Harry sent straight to Azkaban, but then sending the Boy-Who-Lived to prison for underage magic might have had even more disruption both politically and in the press.

*** Yes I pointed this out somewhat with:

#+begin_quote
  Would he have been able to offer refuge at Hogwarts somehow (at least initially) since he makes it clear that in his view, the Ministry has no say about suspending students or interfering with the school.
#+end_quote

And I agree that Fudge in Canon would not commit political suicide at the time by removing Dumbledore.

But also keep in mind that this is also a prompt, and I am implying in it that the Wizangamot is either more corrupt, or more anti Harry, or simply different enough to be willing to convict Harry. If they are as I say, would they not also be willing to ship Harry off to Azkaban or at the very least a wizarding prison of some sort?

And if so, how would it have changed things?

** It'll probably be another Hagrid case, where Dumbledore takes Harry on as another member of the staff, maybe even fixing Harry's wand with the elder wand, and telling him to use it discreetly.

Harry would probably become the next Defence Professor, so in this timeline, Umbridge wouldn't. He would be forced not to use magic in front of the students, but given how great he was at teaching in the DA, I think he'd be fine with that.

Though I don't think the Ministry has any right to interfere with expelling a student, so in that case, I could see the other professors, as well as Dumbledore helping Harry pass his classes

Edit: He'd probably have help from Dumbledore himself, so he's not overwhelmed with teaching so many kids. I'd actually be interested in reading that...

Though alternatively could also have Kingsley Shacklebolt or Moody or someone to potentially help Harry with the overload as well.

**** Only reason why I didn't say Lupin, was because Snape told the school that Lupin was a werewolf, but if it was just to help with the lesson plan, I could see it happening.

After he taught the DA, I always thought that he'd be a great Defence Professor, and it'd be a perfect little revenge, becoming the Defence Professor in canon, after killing Voldemort, since Voldemort wanted the position but Dumbledore turned him down. While I'm fine with Harry becoming an Auror, I do wish he would have become a teacher.

*** One can truly care about more than one thing. In canon, Voldemort took over within two months of Dumbledore's death and within a few days of Harry turning 17. If Dumbledore abandons the country along with Harry, Voldemort has no reason to wait. If you were Dumbledore, how many Muggleborns and blood-traitors would you be prepared to sacrifice to protect Harry?

***** I think this quote is actually helping my case more than [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]]'s:

1. It shows that, contrary to [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]], Dumbledore /already/ truly cares about Harry, perhaps more than he should given his other responsibilities.
2. From the way Dumbledore says it, it was a narrow decision, and he isn't necessarily proud of it.
3. At that time, Dumbledore was weighing the certainty of burdening Harry with unbearable responsibility against a distant possibility that not telling Harry would maybe hurt others in the future. In [[/u/Miqdad_Suleman]]'s proposal, Voldemort is already back and actively gathering forces, and so fleeing with Harry would be a near-certainty of those nameless and faceless people's and creatures' slaughter.
4. As far as I can tell, in Dumbledore's ethical framework, causing harm through action is worse than allowing equivalent harm by inaction. Not telling Harry is an inaction; taking Harry and fleeing is an action.
5. Arguments in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ewsrlf/at_the_disciplinary_hearing_of_harry_potter_on/fg56l9f/][my reply to the sibling post]] also apply.

****** I'm not proving his point lol. I was answering your question about how many Dumbledore is willing to sacrifice to make Harry happy.

I think the biggest problem with your argument is that Dumbledore, in OoTp, was gone from Hogwarts and the Ministry from the end of March/beginning of April to the end June. Voldemort didn't step out of hiding until his plan was a near success. Why? Because Dumbledore wasn't /dead/.

******* It's still a useful quote. However, it's not about Dumbledore being willing to sacrifice, it's about him willing to risk. That's a pretty big difference.

Dubledore in OotP was gone from Hogwarts, but he was still around to show up and foil any major plan of Voldemort's at a moment's notice---as he did, at the end of that book. On the other hand, publicly leaving the country with a defenceless adolescent in tow could significantly increase his response time (depending on the availability and the range of communication mirrors, speed and range of Patronus messengers, and range and accuracy of Phoenix teleportation). It would also send a very different message to, his allies, his enemies, and those undecided.

***** Not really. The prophecy only matters to the extent to which its subjects care about it. If both Harry and Voldemort both choose to ignore it and stay away from each other, they can both live happily ever after (literally). So, Harry and Dumbledore can go on their merry road trip, while Voldemort consolidates his power over Britain and purges it of anything he perceives as Muggle influence.

Or, maybe Voldemort doesn't accept their retreat and ends up chasing them all over the world. That would be better for Britain, but it certainly wouldn't be safer for Harry. Harry, by abandoning 4 Privet Drive, will have lost the only truly inviolable sanctuary he has against Voldemort and his agents.
