Why? What appeal do you see in an 11 year old acting all suave and political and having 11 year old girls hang off of his shoulders? I can't ever take these fics seriously, because let's face it: having an 11 year old acting as such would look utterly ridonkulous. No one would take Harry seriously in a million years and he would probably sound squeaky and pompous.

I can definitely appreciate the whole "it works if it's written well etc" but I can't really dig HarryxHarem in any premise.

Also while we're here, I just wanna say: I HATE daphne/Harry fics with a passion. I mean, we literally don't even know what she looks like! Like bruh it's so physically painful to sit through descriptions of "daphnes violet eyes and pitch black hair, her cold demeanour and overall perfection" bah! For a character that's basically an OC she's dreadfully idealistic.

Okay I'm tired, rant over, peace. Leave negative comments down below x.


** Not a fan myself, but I take it as a power fantasy. It seems to go along with super! Harry who is the rightful heir to every or blood family fortune and probably knows Kung Fu for good measure.

*** It absolutely is a power fantasy, often written as much for the writer's sake as for the reader's. I find that really cool about stories; they can help us overcome difficulties in our lives just by reading/writing them. Though the harem stories certainly aren't for me.

** The idea of an 11 year old being suave is hilarious and any fic that has 11 year olds being sexual at all, let alone in a harem, is ridiculous. You want to start your harem that early? They better be very innocent friends until 4th year at a minimum and even that is pushing it.

The harem stories I enjoy tend to not take themselves too seriously, such as The Poker Game, and Too Many Dates.

The reasons for liking harem fics in general? I suppose part of it is wish fulfillment, the idea of multiple partners wanting you and being allowed to indulge in such. Some of it is being able to see more than one of your favorite pairings in one place. Sometimes it is just nice to read a fic where Harry gets a nice large support group instead of being dumped on for the whole story.

*** You will definitely like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784785/1/Lets-do-the-Time-Warp-Again][Lets do the Time Warp Again]]. He pokemons it hardcore, and you can tell it's bashing the harem stories. Harry even invents up a fifth house, exclusively for his harem. And pulls weird stuff out of nowhere to add more girls. Like a potion to make Moaning Myrtle Mortal, or some de-aging potion.

** I like 'em for exactly the reasons you say - though I do prefer them to be done well or in an interesting/fun way. Only if it's not just porn though - I am hella asexual and I just end up skipping the porny bits.

IMO, you're not getting the appeal because you're trying to take them seriously. I just picture tiny "But I ca-can't be a-a Wizz-ard!" Harry doing all of this and find it unbearably hilarious. Look at it like the 'crack taken seriously' genre and you might find it more entertaining?

** Why Daphne? Because she's different. Besides Pansy, Millie, and the Carrow Twins name a Slytherin female. Daphne. Millie is ragged on for her less than stellar looks. Pansy is a twat, and the Carrow twins are twins. You can't separate identical twins like that. It's heresy. You would have to take both.

Besides the not taken seriously fics, there is political reasons. Rune Stone Path did this decently.

** I like Harry/Harem fics because I ship Harry with a LOT of people -- like Hermione, Ginny, Luna, etc. However, in a lot of Fics that center on just one of those pairings, I've noticed that the other female characters are pushed off to the side or outright bashed and I don't like that. With the harem stories that I like, this doesn't happen and I get to read about some fun (and some not so fun) interactions between the girls, so it makes it worth it to me.

** I do think it's worth mentioning not all harem fics are for wish fulfillment. A lot are just the author having lots of ships, say you like Huna but also Hinny and Harmione and you can't choose which to write so you just do all three simultaneously and throw in some narrative bs for why they're cool with it.\\
As for actually enjoying them, eleven year old harem fics which take themselves seriously are usually very dumb but I think eleven year olds acting like adults is somewhat justifiable for if you want to write an adult fic with a setting that doesn't make sense outside of the early books. Some authors do the whole 'Hogwarts University' thing but seeing as that vastly changes canon I can understand the eleven year old adult thing, it doesn't make sense but it's needed for some plots and if you can ignore that they're eleven the plots are still good.\\
As for enjoying the harem and politically suave part, I think it it's well written ie everyone has a clear character which can stand alone and sensible reasons for being in the harem, then there's no problem and I can enjoy the fic (that said, I have to admit that I cannot think of an example of that). Being politically suave is fairly realistic too if Harry has that kind of background although he usually doesn't. In general harem fics I've enjoyed don't come close to the standards I've set out here but I think that's just because I've got fairly low standards in writing quality (I mean, I made it through almost whole five chapters of Harry Crow). Anyway, I think harem fics can be well written, most are shit but enough are close enough to well written that people with standards as low as mine can enjoy them. And as for the power fantasizes with the girls relegated to macguffins whose lives revolve around Harry, no idea.\\

** Okay, I don't typically like them, I just object that they are all 11. If it is before they are 15/16, it just doesn't make sense, not that they do otherwise either, but I have known some people dating multiple parties whilst they all knew.

** Because they have good erotica and I don't watch porn because sexual exploitation of pornstars.

Edit: Just clearing up, I only read Sixth and Seventh year harem fics, 11 yr olds should never be in harems.

** I don't like them even if they aren't 11 years old. I can never believe the whole sister-wife thing applied to HP fanfic. If I squint really hard, I *might* buy two wives for two houses, but even that stretches my belief in the relationships. In general, I don't care for romance, and I certainly don't want romantic drama from a triangle. Those stories are usually "tell not show" and therefore I can't summon any caring for the outcome of the relationships.

** I think that if you like HP/Harem fanfiction, you'll probably like other harem fanfiction featuring your favorite franchise.

I get it, as i do enjoy some harem fanfiction every now and again. If it's 'decently' written, it has the potential to be absolutely hilarious and sometimes kinda cute.

The fantasy, I believe, hinges on a need for acceptance. People develop fetishes based on past experiences. So do they develop biases, fears, the list goes on. I like the genre because the main character gets all the love he craves. If you spent a childhood unloved, bullied, or otherwise isolated or alone, this resonates at a personal level.

Yes, in real life relationships are difficult, but I don't think harem-stories are meant to really be believable. That's not what they're for. If we're talking about HP fanfiction, it's just entertaining to see Harry get all the girls. You can disagree with this, but I think if you have a strong negative opinion about the topic you've already kinda missed the point

** ACTUALLY, we do know what Daphne looks like in the movies, she may not have been depicted in the books but she was seen in the movies.

She's blonde, don't remember the eye colour

Agree on the perfection thing, absolute rubbish

*** Some read those only just because it has that 'forbidden fruit' situation, like it's not allowed so they want it more.

Kinda like how idiotic it was of Dumbledore to say ‚Äùthe third floor corridor is out of bounds for any who don't wish a most painful death‚Äù that's basically an invitation to some idiotic teenagers

** I don't know. I could never personally see Harry at any age being slick enough to manage more than one relationship. Hell, I see Harry being awkward even in one relationship, given that he had such a bad childhood and affection wasn't exactly something he was used to.

I also don't get why certain character pairings cannot seem to exist much outside of harem fics. You look up Honks fics and you get some but most are Harry/Tonks/Fleur. Why? If it is the whole "But she is a Veela sex goddess" nonsense, Tonks could literally become that in a blink of an eye. Why is it so hard to find normal monogamous single pair relationship fics for certain characters? Ugh.
