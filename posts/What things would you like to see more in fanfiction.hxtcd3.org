We haven't had one of these threads in a while, and I'm curious what trends in interest have arisen during the whole Quarantine period. So, what things would you like to see in future fics?

Could be *big broad stuff*, like "I wanna see more Pureblood Lordship fics" or "I want more ship fics not featuring Harry".

Could be *smaller stuff*, like "I wanna see more characters lie and be deceptive." or "I really wanna know about magical painting".

Could even be *writing technique or stylistic stuff* like "I want to see more unreliable narrators." or "I wanna see more non-traditional story formats like personal journals or news articles".

Anything and everything you're interested in is on the table here, because I'm asking what you'd put there if you had the chance. :)

Specifically stuff you *want* to see, to be clear - *not* stuff you don't want to see. Dislikes have been established enough already in recent weeks - we have more than enough threads against the 'Terrors of Fanon Nicknaming'. :D


** • More pro-Ron fics. AUs, canon-divergence, post-DH, whatever works. Giving him a character arc and more interests other than chess and Quidditch would be nice, maybe starting from 3rd or 4th year.

• More fics where Hermione's flaws are highlighted in a critical/non-bashing manner. Fanon Hermione is everywhere. Even gods and goddesses came down to Earth every once in a while.

• More fics where Muggles/wizards aren't complete idiots. Canon had dumb Muggles and dumb wizards, but fanfic tends to fix one and not the other. I want to see a mix on both sides.

• More Wizarding world creativity. Fics where they don't use Muggle inventions like the Express, wireless, Knight Bus, camera, etc would be cool to see.

• More journey fics (authors taking their time to develop/build characters, plot points, interactions, magic, etc) over the standard "instant Lordship/shopping spree/three spare wands/apartment trunk/unlocked magical core/Dumbledore bash" fics.

• Preteens and teens acting their age.

• Wizards helping their Muggle relatives with magic (potions and enchanted objects, mainly).

• Fics that develop wandless magic better and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of it.

• Crossovers with the DCAU. Wizards, Muggles, metahumans and magical creatures teaming up against an alien threat and the aftermath.

• More fics with a developed magic system (no magical cores or mana bars).

That would be good. I was talking about something like this with someone on another thread, actually. Developing Ron in an interesting way - imagine if Harry stayed dead when he died, but Voldemort became vulnerable and then Ron got the final blow on Voldemort. It'd be a great development for him - getting his achievement that outshines his brothers in every way, but losing his best friend in the process. I can imagine that being so deliciously poignant and melancholy.

Definitely seems like a pattern. People are getting tired of the same old 'Magic is a tool and barely a system' thing and wanted some more interesting ideas, huh? Is it specifically "Magicals using original magical items and not just magical versions of muggle ones" you're looking for, or do you mean a broader 'use magic in interesting and clever ways' type of creativity?

Very tragic. "You never know what you have until it's gone."

Yeah, because all the "technology" wizards use are stolen Muggle stuff that is either enchanted to the gills (Hogwarts Express) or starts to run on magic over time (Colin's camera). I want to see some originality. For example, an all-magical transport system that incorporates the benefits of the Floo Network, Vanishing Cabinets and Apparition. You step into a Vanishing Cabinet, say where you want to go, and instantly arrive at one of several locations (Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, the Ministry, etc). Cleaner than the Floo and more comfortable than Apparating or a Portkey, and you won't risk ashes in your mouth or losing an arm. Kids could use it too. /That's/ the kind of stuff I want to see in a fic, not the Muggle transportation rip-offs.

That's a really interesting point I hadn't really seen before. That's very 'Fae' of the Wizarding World, isn't it? Creative parasites, imitating and developing on the works of others, but not really coming up with much on their own. Huh.

That'd be cool though - more fics like those intermittent movies about crazy inventors or historical innovators coming up with their big thing. Magical Doc Brown would be brilliant. :D

The garden fic is called RuneMaster and involves Harry extracting Essence from things. It's weird.

** I want to see more stories where Harry and Ron are bros, getting out of mischief etc without Hermione being a crutch. I want to seem more stories where Hermione is not a god either. I want to see more talented Harry stories where he is really good at school and magic, but not in an over the top way, but in a way that He's Voldemort's equal without some sort of deus ex machina. To be honest, and this is subjective, i want stories like that because I have never related to the everyman ‘I'm mediocre at most things' Harry. I went to a school that expected you to excel, and i want to see a Harry that fits into that. He believably excels in his schoolwork, without being reclusive.

I want more Harry and Dumbledore mentoring and adventures like Magics of the Arcane.

I want to see a War thats actually a war, with actually scary Voldemort. An insidious, charming voldemort who hasnt becime a cartoon villain.

**** Yeah. There's a lot i want to see. It could feasibly come together. A realistic war is exactly what I want. I would like to see a Civil War, that isnt just a couple of acts of terrorism and a big battle for a finale. It's a war, there should be massive destruction, and no small amount of trauma. More ‘pitched' battles too.There should absolutely be a healthy dose of stupid optimism, the ‘I want to do my bit to fight Voldemort', and so runs off to ‘join up' only to be woefully underprepared for the reality and end up dead two minutes later type. Hard decisions have to be made. Scary Voldemort means that he'll wipe the floor with everyone who fights him.

The whole Harry being good at magic comes from the desire to see someone explore the three way parallel between Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry. There you have three brilliant wizards of the same calibre, but they all take different approaches, why? Because ‘it is our choices that make us what we are, far more than our abilities'. Better than trying to parallel two geniuses and a lucky idiot. It's far more compelling especially in a brutal setting where those choices hold people's lives in the balance.

***** That does sound very cool. I think I've read a couple of Grindelwald 'Great War' ones that take that sort of vibe. And there's a Magnus Archives episode called The Piper that has that feeling too. Hopeless idealism and all that. :)

Would you want the Muggle world to catch on to this, or would you see it being still hidden?

That'd be a really great three-way parallel-dynamic, yeah. Very much hits that old Choices line in a fascinating-to-explore way (and makes Harry more interesting). Especially if you combine it with the Civil War thing. I can see that 'Great War with Great Generals' sort of vibe really working - with Great being in the Ollivander definition, anyway. 'Terrible, but Great!'. :D

****** Ideally, I wouldn't wanted Muggles involved at all. When i read Harry Potter i come for the magic, having the muggles involved sort of ruins it for me. I like the canon interpretation that they are notice but in a bemused and baffled way.

E.g. Massive wizarding battle on the Isle of Harris involving massive element powers?; It's the Western Isles, they get battered with storms all the time.

Explosions causing massive casualties in York. Its a Gas explosion.

The thing is, Magic is Magic. It's a realm unto itself with pretty much infinite potential, it should handily outclass the capability of Muggle technology, and just because it does that doesnt mean you'll have a utopian society. Humans are Humans after all.

**** For the Basilisk one, it's just plain impossible to keep it under the wraps. It just doesn't make any sense. Like, no matter what you do, it's going to come out. Do you remember just how much of a deal it was that a monster was killing muggleborns in second year? The school was almost closed. And after Harry kills the monster, no one even asks about it? Like, what was the conversation like,

Fudge: Hey, Dumbledore, I'm really sorry to do this, but if the monster is still rampant-

Dumbledore: Oh, you don't need to worry about that. We took care of it.

Fudge: Oh, that's good then. Have a nice day.

As for Harry's home life, I think it'd be interesting to see people's reactions to Harry's early life being a complete 180 of their imagination.

***** Ah, okay. Do you really think they couldn't keep it a secret? Maybe not the events themselves - I definitely agree that students would chatter, at least during the holidays, and maybe even send letters home during the active year - but as far as I remember only Harry and Co ever really had confirmation it was a Basilisk, so I can see them being able to cover that much up. The students writing home probably didn't have much more to say than "Potter. Students. Petrification. Monster. Cats!" and it took Hermione to come up with something more than "We have no idea. Close the school!"

I imagine they'd have to have come up with one hell of an explanation as to what it actually was though, in order to cover it all up. Can't deny shit went down, but you can deny what precisely it was.

There's actually a very applicable bit in an old show called 'Yes Minister' concerning 'The Rhodesia Solution'. It's a delightful political method of obfuscation and basically amounts to exactly what you just said.

It'd be really interesting to see it get out, though. Especially if the powerful folks don't want it to. I just imagine Harry walking into the great hall, late for breakfast, and having it be entirely silent as everyone just stares at him in amazement and horror. :D

Same with the home life thing actually. And I'm really surprised that hasn't come up in fics more often. I've only seen a couple, mostly revolving around someone spotting his scars and ordering a medical check-up and having very little 'public reactions' to that.

Do you have any ideas or preferences on how people might find out either thing? Rita Skeeter strikes again? :D

****** I think the Basilisk one is easy. There is no reason to hide it. So Dumbledore just reveals the story as Harry told. And also, takes the reporters to the chamber with Harry and shows them the Basilik. Harry, the Boy-Who-Lived, saved the day again. Why would Fudge or anyone have any problem with that?

However, here's where the interesting stuff starts. Dumbledore tells them about Voldemort, which of course Fudge doesn't believe. But he can't deny the 60 feet giant snake's dead body. So now, does Dumbledore tell about the diary or not? Because Fudge can easily just put all the blame on Ginny. He most likely wouldn't. But I think he would keep warning them that Voldemort is not gone.

Harry's home life is tricky. I guess anyone from the Weasleys to Hermione to Lupin to Sirius to Dumbledore to McGonagall can find out about it individually or even together. The problem is none of them would want to reveal it to the public. The only way they would is if they want to take legal action. But I want the ordinary students to see it first hand somehow, not in some newspaper article. The only solution that comes to me either Draco or Snape get hold of Harry's memory somehow, not knowing what it actually is, just that he doesn't want it to be revealed. So they purposefully show it to whole class wanting to humiliate Harry.

I mean, if I were in his position, my problem would be "Well, why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier? Our children could've all died!", but I see your point. It's more of an advantage to share that Harry did it again rather than hide it.

It would be interesting to see the outcome of Fudge being told that from first year - especially if the events of Fourth Year still happen and Harry comes back talking about Voldemort again. I wonder if he'd believe them with four years of circumstantial and secondary evidence behind their claims that he'd returned.

That's an interesting idea. Can definitely see that being "A special demonstration for today's potions lesson, provided by our own Draco Malfoy" or something similar. I remember in a couple of fics, some of Harry's traumatic backstory was unintentionally revealed by a potion - one was fem!Harry going through a new Triwizard Task, the other a male Harry in an antagonistic Weasley Twin prank. Not his abuse, just 'you got bit by a fucking basilisk?!' level stuff, but still. That kind of accidental side-effect approach could work as well?

***** Ah, yes. I try to avoid those fics. Imo the canon abuse is plenty or perhaps a little 'canon implied'. They're worse than ignoring the abuse entirely because it suggests that the abuse Harry faced wasn't bad enough.

If they're teens or the like and one reveals they had been sexually abused, neither have to be removed if it's not deemed to be a current risk, however. This might sound mad, but this actually happened to me - I ended up moving out as I was 16, but my younger brother who I suspected but couldn't prove was still being abused was deemed safe to stay there as he said he was fine. If the parent seems sufficiently contrite and dedicated to trying better, they will try to keep the child at home.

I've also worked with children who don't have a bed, or whose parents are under the influence when they collect their kids, children in dirty ill-fitting clothes, or whose parents are openly aggressive to their children. Even then, you're looking at months - years of input if anything happens at all.

Ideally, there would be more early input and support to ensure the kids have everything they need and then support for parents in crisis to reduce the need for care, but you do find yourself absolutely boggled at what is deemed passable for kids to stay at home. Some parents, like one of mine seemed to view support as a game to convince SW and mock me but I appreciate that for most children the ideal outcome is staying at home.

Anyway, I agree that in the case of toddlers in that situation - you absolutely would expect both to be removed and the only reason I can imagine it wouldn't happen would be strong prejudice against muggles.

Edit: I would, of course, want both Dudley and Harry to be taken together at any age because Harry's treatment is not ok. I can imagine, however, that Dudley being at boarding school most of the year would dramatically lower the risk. Hell, if they could get some minimum standards for Harry - being fed, not being locked in a room, I reckon they'd have him stay.

It would be an interesting story too, if it was a problem - I read a teacher-student Pitch Perfect fic once and it was a really interesting exploration of the "I love you, but if anyone catches us I'm going to end up on a fucking list somewhere" internal debate, so I can see it being an interesting read if there was a relationship despite legality.

******* Age of Shazam in the real Britain is 16, so it would be completely legal for him to have sex with someone in their twenties or even fifties at that point. Since age of majority there is 18, and only 17 in Wizardland, age of consent is probably 15 in Wizarding Britain. Which fits with everything else we learn about 5th year.

Looking at the current [[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/abuse-of-position-of-trust][position of trust]] law, which is afaik stricter than that at the time the series takes place and anything the wanders are likely to come up with, I don't think Tonks would be in a PoT relative to Harry in most stories. He isn't under the custody or direct supervision of the DMLE, she isn't an employee of Hogwarts, and she has no direct professional connection with him. Even if those do become true during the story, a pre-existing /legal/ relationship explicitly preempts PoT applying.

That's not actually how translation works with a lot of old languages - there's a lot of context and educated guesswork involved to make things make sense. The same word can mean very different things in different contexts in certain languages. So, yeah. Ancient Runes are hella important for not dying in tombs. :D

*** I'm gonna preface this by saying this is my first attempt to write really anything.

Harry walked into the forest seemingly alone, but there are shapes crawling through the underbrush. Ron, hermione, Neville, dean, Luna and Ginny were wearing ghillie suits to avoid Voldemort noticing someone using magic to hide.

As Harry arrived into the clearing Voldemort was standing just a few feet in front of his amassed death eaters. Harry stands there staring for a moment at Voldemort before saying, “I am Harry Potter and you killed my family. Prepare to die.” He then draws a pistol from his pocket and aims it at Voldemort at the same time his friends rise out of the bush's with rifles, pistols, and one rocket launcher, all aiming towards Voldemort and his death eaters.

Voldemort just stood there staring at them for a moment before bursting into laughter. “Do you honestly believe we are afraid of some pathetic muggle weapons? And what is with those ridiculous outfits, you need to cover more than sight-“

Dean Thomas had gotten tired of waiting and fired. This was the queue for the rest of the group to open fire. They fired until they were out of ammo, waiting for the dust to settle.

Then they listened in horror as a familiar voice came from the dust.

“It is rude to interrupt someone when they're speaking.”

Then, a green flash of light erupted out of the dust and Dean Thomas lied dead.

When the dust finally settled, every death eater was standing exactly where they were with no damage to them or even marks on their clothing.

More flash's of light erupted and Harry stood alone, shocked and horrified at his friends agonized screaming.

“Harry, Harry, Harry. Did you truly believe pathetic muggle weapons would be able to get through a simple unbreakable spell?”

The death eaters all laughed at that. As Harry stood there, a gun he recognized as useless now and his friends all laying on the ground.

Dean Thomas had his arms ripped from their sockets.

Hermione had blood pouring from her eyes and nose.

Ron was all over the ground, the result of so many simple cutting curses.

Neville lake there barely able to breath, his lungs pierced.

Luna was crying on the ground, covering her ears yelling “MOMMY”

Then Harry was hit with a spell and the bones in his arms and legs simply vanished.

“I believe you may remember this happening Harry? Though I don't believe skelegrow will help soon” Voldemort mocked.

Then with a flash of green light Harry died.

I was gonna stop with just Harry and co dying but figured the death eaters wouldn't be especially kind to their victims and give them quick deaths. Plus it was actually fun to write this.

How did they find out about muggle objects (or how did a muggle realise and then accept magic was real and then explain to their friends in a secret manner while wizards go around obliviating - I think it would be more interesting from the wizarding side.)

Why do they fail? Does a friend turn out to be a snitch? How do they justify themselves? What goes wrong with the muggle technology and why? What works? (I think complete failure in all areas of muggle would be more dull than a muggle technology plan where bits work but as a whole the outcome is failure.) What changes are made after the failure?

Your list of ideas does have a bit of a Cold War Spies vibe to me though - I could see a Star Wars Rebels-against-the-Death-Star meets Atomic-Blonde-esque storyline going where some vital information or other is smuggled and transported around only to have it fail in the end when the attack is thwarted by Magical Protections.

** - More Crossovers to Marvel and DC that make use of those worlds and everything inside of them to allow Harry to Shine by himself without being Tony Starks or Thor's side kick or be raised by Batman. Harry fight Classic Marvel Giant Monsters who are waking up around the world, he can travel to Madripoor and fight the criminal underground in search of a magical criminal. He can Land in Opal City and decide he is going to become the super hero there, he can Travel Travel to the far future to battle a magical threat with the Legion of Superheroes. Harry doesn't have to be there when Batman gets his Back Broken or Iron man fights Whiplash because he can be off fighting Xemnu the Living Titan and it's attempts to control a small town or hunting Skyhook trying to prevent the demon from taking any more children.

- Less of a focus on Studying, honestly it's annoying reading how all writers want Harry to do is sit in the library and study with his girlfriend and occasionally make out. 1 it's boring and 2 that's a terrible relationship plan. I never wanted to associate my girlfriend with homework in high school but that's honest all Harry seems to do, whether it's Hermione, Luna, Daphne, Padma or anyone other than Ginny. Seriously find another character trait for Harry's girlfriends other Than, smart and complaining that Harry doesn't study.

- a distinct lack of Rough Housing, I get that many writers are women but even then so many writers try and give Harry male Bros and it's a lot of just walking around and talking about their girlfriends or lovelifes, why are we not just entering the scene with Harry holding Neville in a Headlock or Neville making Harry give with a Knuckle Lock? Ending scenes of a slightly soft conversation with Neville hitting Harry in the arm and the giving him 2 more for flinching? For get acting like kids, most of the males in these stories don't act like men.

- I get that Magic is powerful, but it's not Omnipotent nor is it Omniscience nor is the wizard wielding it, so yes allow them to be truly put in danger by things the Fandom has already decided aren't threats like Vampires and Werewolves and Trolls. We read for tension and adventure not for the main characters to stand there and huff, smirk raise a wand and solve their problems in a second. Put characters in danger of other things that Death Eaters, Dragons and for some reason R*pe

- In Crossovers, I get you want Harry to be cool and powerful but he doesn't need a massive trunk with all his potions ingredients and every book known to man. He also doesn't need to lose his Wand and forget about magic and focus on his new abilities you will inevitably give him. Yes he's in Skyrim he doesn't need to be the Dragonborn, Yes he's visiting the Soul Society he doesn't need a Zanpakto

Definitely agree with this. Even if it isn't canon, it's more interesting to see Wizards actually struggle against something than curbstomp everything in sight. And even if you can heal serious wounds, you still need to get the potion to heal the wounds, and potions take time to make, so there's still some danger there too.

I would also like more fics with ancient runes being used. That class always sounded so cool and it just got glossed over. This sort of goes along with what someone else commented about how they want to see more "Wizarding world creativity." You literally have MAGIC and you expect me to believe you have used the same spells and things for centuries and arent doing more? Nah, there would be a ton of exploration going on.

I would also like more apprenticeships or secondary wizarding education, like a wizard college or something.

Also, I would like more artistic outlets in the wizarding world. Why in the world didnt Hogwarts have an art/photography class that encorporated magic? That would have been really cool! Dont even get me started on magical tattoos. Your tattoos could move or change colors or so many other things. I do understand that maybe there is a tattoo stigma due to the Dark Mark but the art of tattooing existed and was popular long before Voldemort.

I admit, I don't agree with you on the magical-exploration-would-definitely-happen note - most wizards seem to take an 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mindset to life and I can imagine them going "Well, we have all these spells that do everything we really need, let's go play Quidditch!" and the only research we ever see is entirely new things (the Wolfsbane stuff) or secret stuff (the Department of Mysteries) - but it'd definitely be interesting to see. Wizarding world creativity is definitely a cool factor.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** If you write to appeal the readers do read this, if you write just for the sake of writing don't. However feel free to upvote.

A fic should be relatable to real life. I mean JK Rowling added these small day to day problems in school life and stuff but most fics forget them or write a very very short passage and forget them. And also relatable like Fred and George talk about vanishing Montague through the vanishing cabinet and in the sixth year Malfoy uses the same cabinet to admit Death Eaters In Hogwarts. So yeah, something like that. Less of the super powerful! super smart! Lord Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. In these types of fics Harry is usually characterless. I mean story starts like- 'I have been acting dumb for 3 years now.... ', Wtf is this fic?? I mean how smart are you and how much can you do at the age of 14???

More of a story where a character is slowly developed and does not start acting OOC from midway of the story. Also, more of Hogwarts content. Like classes, Snape, Malfoy, Internal mysteries and small side stories.\\
And for one time a good Dumbledore. I mean Good. Dumbledore fics are countable on one hand. JK Rowling portrayed him like that. You can. Do it too.

Lord potter or Black or both work for me but at the age of 15.

Oh, and try Harry/Daphne pairing if you will.

**** You know, how Harry and Ron kept complaining about Snape, insulting Malfoy, pursuing their girl interests and Hermione all the while forcing them to study, or do their homework or instilling discipline for teachers in the boys while they usually worked to save Hogwarts and its residents from voldy-moldy each year.

Frequently, Harry is an almighty hero in fics who can do anything with a flick of its wrists. And the fact that he is also a teenager is lost. Hogwarts in these type of fics just becomes a residential area which Harry visits just to eat, sleep and if not busy with wizenmagot, then study. Otherwise, Harry rules Hogwarts and becomes well above the normal residents and speaks to others only for the sake of being friends.

There, I explained it my best.

****** Yeah, now you get it.

And for the internal mysteries part, mysteries like why was Snape confronting Quirell during first year or why Hermione looked so tired and was able to take all the subjects all together in third year or why Dumbledore was not attending the Great hall during sixth year, etc.

Now we know the answer to all these questions, however these were just mysteries during the time we read the books. Although they did not hold the main focus during the course of the book but in the end these mysteries affected... the end result you can say, quite heavily. These mysteries were just small Easter eggs on which nobody spent much time thinking but in the end every reader used to be like - "Damn, the answer was just in the front of my eyes all this time."

One of the better reasons why I read Harry Potter. Jk Rowling wrote these books just like a magician does magic, in front of our eyes, but still deceiving them. She did the same with our minds, giving out all her cards to us and the striking the bell in our head at the exact right moment.

Thank you this was a great discussion. Hope you enjoyed it. Ask if you have any doubt still.

******* I did. It's always interesting to hear people's thoughts on stuff and explore ideas. There's always a lot more going on 'under the hood' than seems first apparent and seeing that unfold is always a delight to me. :)

Technically those were clues to the main mystery moreso than mysteries in and of themselves though - they were the magical version of the smoking guns and mysterious wounds and to my understanding that was the intent of them? A central part of the plot, not secondary easter eggs. But even so, we don't get many mystery fics in HP Fanfiction, which is odd, considering how most of the books were really just Mystery Novels.

******** Hmm, now that you say it, I can agree that they were well-disguised clues but clues nonetheless. And yes that was the intention and that they served it well.

Yup, you are right again. Many fics usually revolves around pairing with a rather straight forward plot - harry gets a girl, voldy-moldy is an idiot, dumbledore is sucking lemon drops in a corner, the girl helps harry, voldy-moldy defeated, the end.

Or other major theme, Harry is God, descendent of slytherin, all muggleborns are connected to magical families, voldy-moldy is an idiot, Harry learns unimaginable magic in a month or two, voldy-moldy defeated, the end.

Oh, and it would also be great if you could hook me up a fic that kinda fits the criterias I mentioned above. Those which I have read are all rather popular and keep popping up everywhere I search (usually fanfiction.net). Thanks

I never said Dumbledore is almighty he may lose, hell if he was bad like you say, he would just have had tossed Harry to die in the department of mysteries. Actually JK Rowling introduced elements that she had not thought of from the start and also she made the storyline revolve around three teenagers.

The drawing is because people complain about how untalented he is with wizarding subjects and just learning in general. It's something he could have learned to pass the time in the cupboard so it's plausible. He learns by doing anyway. But mostly, It can be his. He can have just a regular hobby.

****** Lol, do you forget that during the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, there were hundreds of spectators in the Great Hall and they were all good guys

In the Final Battle, Voldemort, Death Eaters, and their Ministry minions were all down in an annihilation battle. If the good guys still had hundreds left after crushing this horde, you are seriously underestimating their strength!

JKR might not have named killed Death Eaters, but that last confrontation was exceedingly bloody so she just skimmed it over in a few paragraphs:

#+begin_quote
  Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.*

  Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.*

  And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry “the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.*

  The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”*

  They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.*

  But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall.*

  Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.*

  Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.*

******* And not once is there even a rough number for people involved. We know who turned up for the battle, the DA, the OotP, the teachers and a few people from Hogsmeade. That's maybe a company of people, most "good" combatants are non-human (or just animated suits of armour).

Also, from what is described of Voldemort, he is slaughtering everyone in reach ("smite" is a bit more than just a stunner). The "good" side is described to have some 60 dead and probably more wounded, out of what appears to be less than 100 combatants. That's not a whole lot left tbh, and the remaining non-humans are of dubious combat value (centaurs are just cannon fodder with their bows and lack of armour).

****** Hmm, not sure what would be a good starting point for a fic like this. I'm wondering if his adventures year 1-3 are a bit too high stakes to admit to himself that he's having fun? Maybe he always feels that rush of pure adrenaline when in danger, but doesn't come to terms with it until maybe the first task of the tournament. Then it's just his own life on the line, rather than Ginny's and Sirius's. And in year one he's literally preventing the return of Voldemort, so that's some stakes as well, haha. I imagine it could be something he'd keep to himself for a bit, to not seem callous.

So maybe a Harry that's always found if exhilarating to run from Dudley, being more daring and cutting it closer every time. Maybe he has Qudditch as an outlet the first years, but during fourth year that outlet is gone, and he finds himself in the tournament. Hermione is completely freaking out about the dragon, but the idea of squaring off with a giant fire-breathing monster stokes that familiar feeling in his chest... And after that it just snowballs, lol.

I think it could be a fun take on a Harry that is a little less angsty about his situation. Like sure, he's in constant danger, but how boring would life be without a couple of near death experiences every year? Could be a nice starting point for a really motivated Harry, who's determined to be the biggest badass on the block, and save the world while he's at it.

A very fair point. "I might die... I'm enjoying this!" is a lot different to "Someone else might die... I'm enjoying this!" and I can see your point that Harry would be more open to the former than the latter - I think I agree with you on that.

Regarding the spells taking up memory I've never read that so I'm not entirely sure but basically moving/creating so much energy with your mind even with a focus shouldn't be easy.

The more magic you use the more difficult it gets. “I'm doing this spell with a lot of effort and afterwards it's going to be more difficult to concentrate”. My favorite idea is that wandless magic is more esoteric. Instead of using spells, you are drawing in energy and manipulating it which is more difficult. With wands acting as a conduit for the magic it's easier to direct it. Both are difficult with wandless magic being more difficult and with both if you practice enough you can get better at using magic without the headache.

******** Exactly. My preference would have to depend on the age of Harry. No 11 year old should be capable of immense magical control right after they find out they have magic. Now after a few years and the readers KNOW that Harry has been spending the majority of his time practicing magic/getting better/researching then it starts getting more acceptable. To avoid Mary Sue status: 1) anyone can do it not just Harry 2) there are likely those with even more control over there power with more combat experience 3) If we know he's being taught by someone very capable (an auror for instance)

Not just a cross and counter but also where proper planning is needed to prevent piss poor performance. Are you going to have an advantage in a straight up fight or will the other person be better prepared. It would also serve as a reason enchanted objects/potions are so useful. While you might be able to cast a shield charm you could also enchant your clothes to be more resistant to damage which would protect you and other things of that nature. Plus it gives other tropes a chance to shine. “Oh you have a sword, so what” turns into “you have a deadly weapon that you can use until you get tired and considering magic is involved you can make that sword so much more efficient”.

********* Yeah. Definitely inspired by Dresden there - "Character is competent and slightly above most people, but still gets his ass kicked in his reoccurring picking-fights-with-people-better-than-him escapades because the heavyweights don't give a shit" is totally a thing there. :D

But yes, that's what I meant by cross and counter. It's all about knowing what your opponent can or will do and acting accordingly - be it before in preparation/planning or after in reaction. That kind of magic would be very chess-like in execution - you make a move, they make a move, you set up a gambit and lure them into your trap, they spin it around and recover, etc. Would actually work with the "Ron is a tactical genius!" thing people have going on these days, given that there's really no tactics to the "Run around and shout things at each other" of canon battles. :D

It'd also cover the disparity in talents canon wizards seem to have. Like, the Weasley Twins make shield hats because most Wizards can't cast them, Harry can cast a Patronus that most people can't do even slightly, etc. It's not that they can't cast it - waggle stick, say words, spell works - but they don't need to push themselves like athletes to get more tolerance of those things, because they're not fighters, so they can't hold the spell for any length of time at all and it disappears instantly. Meanwhile aurors, who fight regularly, exercise that endurance and can keep spells up for longer.

Very fun idea! Might be worth a discussion post to see if we can get the minds of the sub on designing a few actual, interesting systems out of Rowling's toolkit. :D

She is a Giant of Magic, but she's one of many.

Dialogue goes really weird in the latter third of the story, but the plot overall is a really interesting "Gods play Chess with Mortals" sort of vibe. Also has the Marauders AND Snape both being... less than ideal people, which is novel indeed. :D

Same. Especially when it's just /done/ with no lead-up or build-up or anything. If only because it's the dull option - the psychology behind de-culting and de-bigoting is so fascinating and I really wish more fics tried their hand at it.

- Gryffindor!Hermione as a full-fledged anti-hero of the group, getting her hands dirty for the greater good, so that Harry and Ron don't have to.
- Hermione (in any House) receiving personal mentoring in magic from a teacher---probably McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, or Dumbledore---and somehow managing /not/ to end up 'shipped with them.

  - McGonagall in particular seems like a very natural choice, since Hermione expresses particular interest in transfiguration shortly after the Sorting and her being head of Gryffindor is convenient. Then, when/if she ends up in a fight, she makes heavy use of conjured obstacles and minions.

--------------

The "Half-Blood Prince's" book was presently sitting at the bottom of the chest in his dormitory room, but it was still in Harry's thoughts as he tried to study in the Gryffindor common room.

On the one hand, Hermione was a close and loyal friend who meant well, and she probably wouldn't use it against him or any of their friends. On the other hand, there was some nasty stuff in that book, that she would likely use against people who might not deserve it. (He shuddered at the memory of what had happened to Marietta only a few months prior. The girl did tattle on them, but even she didn't deserve /that/.) On the third hand, if he didn't share the book and Hermione found out anyway---and she always found out---then, well, she probably wouldn't hurt him, but she probably wouldn't trust him either. Which was pretty hypocritical, since she had no compunctions about keeping secrets from him and Ron. But on the fourth hand...

"I would be rather more willing to share secrets with you if you didn't slack on your Occlumency practice, Harry," came a familiar voice from behind him, causing him to jump.

"You are leaking thoughts half-way across the Common Room," the witch continued. "And don't worry about the book: I copied it a week ago. Quite fascinating. Professor Snape really is brilliant."

"How did you... Wait, Snape?"

"You didn't know? I could've sworn I'd told you about his mother after I did a background check of all our Professors back in 1993."

How was she not a Slytherin, Harry wondered, not for the first time. Still, reading the book was suddenly a lot less appealing.

"You are leaking again. And to answer your question, did you know that Dumbledore was literally planning to take over the world when he was our age? But, he was going to do it for the greater good, not for selfish reasons, so he was a Gryffindor, as am I.

"And do read the book. There is some useful magic there, but be careful about getting caught casting some of it. The Chosen One should maintain a righteous, pristine reputation."

Confectionary Chronicles has a similar vibe as well, but it's a bit more "Free Range Anti-Bully Vigilante with little restraint" than Yandere Obsessive. Warning for severe bullying and depression discussion throughout and starting with a section of suicide content. It's talked about throughout the story, but the event itself is only in narration the once.

Also a Supernatural crossover, but you don't need to know anything about it to read it - I've literally never seen a single episode and don't know anything more than "There's a gay angel and they meet Death a few times and main characters maybe hunt monsters?" and I've enjoyed it and had no trouble following along.

****** Thanks! As in the snippet, I'd rather see Hermione with a "protective and controlling big sis" attitude towards Harry than as a romantic obsessive, but beggars can't be choosers.

I started reading the /Confectionary Chronicles/, but Holy Pacing, Batman! We don't need to know the details of every legendary library and time/place Hermione gets to visit, every bit of devotional practice towards Loki she performs, nor every random character she encounters that we will never see again.

And, I have mild dread of what will happen once she gets to Hogwarts, given how quickly /Anti-Heroine/ by the same author went off the deep end. I wouldn't be surprised if all the bullies just happened to be from Gryffindor, with Dumbledore as their leader. Is that what happens?

******* She doesn't get to Hogwarts until book 2, but the bullies aren't Gryffindors being lead around by Dumbledore, no. Most of them are Older Slytherins, IIRC. You're right though, half-to-two-thirds of book one is quite meandering - there's far more focus on relationship and background/world building and how Hermione grows as a person than any specific, single, linear plot there. It all ties together quite nicely as it moves further through the story, but it's definitely surplus to the (rather vague) plot. :D

Also, the characters she meets don't just disappear, even if they're never actively seen more than a couple times or only during one 'arc' of the story. She talks about them, thinks about them, introspects and wonders how they turned out (being in the past and all). There's a lot of "This happens to her, she meets these people, things end and she moves on, how does she deal with it?" focus, so it all has aftermath and persistence. All the modern-day God stuff does stick around throughout, though - seems to be the chosen baseline she returns to after whatever trip she went on is done.

Not trying to persuade you to read it if you don't like it, just to be clear - each to their own and all that - just filling you in on the deets as I see 'em. :)

I do seem to have a different perception of the story than you do, which is interesting. I admit, I did enjoy the meandering slice-of-life basically-a-prologue vibe - I have a strong fondness for pure character work - but you're right that a lot of what happens narratively isn't plot-necessary. If I were writing the story, the entirety of Lollies and Loki would've been an actual First Act condensed into about five chapters or so with most of the detail in Cheshire's version taken out, and that detail would remain in my setting-design notes where it belongs. :D
