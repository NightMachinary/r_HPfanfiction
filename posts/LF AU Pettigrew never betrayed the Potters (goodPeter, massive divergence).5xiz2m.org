Peter not betraying the Potters could have been for the better or worse. For example, it could have lead to a total disaster with more or different people ending up dead/alive/insane (Regulus, Bellatrix, the Crouches), or Voldemort lives longer/doesn't die and key people (Weasleys,Bones',Malfoys) end up dead in the prolonged conflict. Huge divergence for the win.


** That...I was going to ask for something like this yesterday.

I'm actually working on a concept where Peter was the Secret Keeper and did reveal the secret (to save his own life), but he honestly believed that they had a second line of defense, guarded by Sirius.

It'd be a point-of-divergence start-of-a-fic at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, in the Shrieking Shack, where Sirius reveals the true course of events, Peter reveals what he thinks what happened, and whoever tried to kill them both 12 years ago (and blew up 12 muggles in the process) has another attempt.

--------------

It's kind of funny how Peter's actions (betrayal) lead to one of the most valuable things in the Voldemort war (a 15 year or so armistice), though. I think there's some biblical metaphor there?

Peter's not really relevant in this one-shot, but it features a Voldemort who survived after Potter & Longbottom, so you might be interested in it.

*** That sounds like a great idea.

I can't think of any Biblical examples that are quite analogous to this specific example, but on the subject of betrayal, there is the story of Joseph and his brothers.

Joseph, the favorite of his father Jacob, was sold into slavery by his brothers, where he was traded in Egypt. Gifted with the ability to interpret dreams, Joseph eventually found a role as Pharaoh's second-in-command and was able to alleviate a horrific famine and eventually reconcile with his brothers.

** The only one I know of was a "What if Neville Was The Chosen One?" that actually focused on Harry and Neville equally.

Peter never betrayed the Potters, because he was never given the opportunity. Sirius and Dumbledore figure this out and Pettigrew, sick with remorse, agrees to accept the role of Spy for the Order.

Snape, never given the chance to switch sides, ends up rotting in Azkaban.

Harry gets younger siblings, including a little sister who idolizes Uncle Peter and softens his heart.

I can't remember how it ends, but I think Peter winds up sacrificing himself for the Good Guys.

Edit: Found it! Got some stuff wrong though, and I'm not sure it quite fits what you had it mind.

  When Harry Potter goes back in time to fix things, we allow that he has to lie, manipulate, kill, and let a few good people die so as to kill Voldemort. Well, Peter Pettigrew once went back in time, too.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

** There is also the Unbroken Universes AU by Robin4. It's quite the long read with 600k+ words, but it's worth it.

The fics are completely maurauder-focused. Harry sometimes appears, but always as James' son and not as a protagonist. If you don't like violence or gore, I'd recommend not to read it, but it really is an amazing read.

It does not completely match up with your request, as Peter isn't really good at the start of the story. [[/spoiler][He still takes the Dark Mark, but eventually confesses to his friends and turns his back on the Dark Lord]]

Really amazing read, have fun!
