There are a lot of super long fics I like, but most of them are pretty bloated and can really be slogs. Sometimes it's because they have too much incidental detail, sometimes there are too many side plots that aren't compelling, and so on.

I'm trying to plan out a long fic and would appreciate recommendations for models that are 300K words or more but have excellent pacing.

I'm particularly interested in examples that deal well with variations in time (i.e., one chapter may just detail a single conversation, while another moves you forward a few months).

I'll be looking at them as models, not so much for personal enjoyment, so any pairing/time period/trope etc. is welcome. WIPs are fine. Competent grammar will preserve my sanity.

Thanks for your suggestions!


** A really long one, (1,166,349 words) But I loved the pacing in this one and never felt like it was dragging on or was too slow. Sometimes the chapters detail a day, a class, an event, or even a month, so the variation is great in this one too.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

** Interesting question, because most long fics tend to have a significant weakness in pacing.

linkffn(Blood and Water by LF74) and linkffn(The Imposter Complex) are recent fics that have particularly good pacing. Neither of them are over 300k but likely both will end up around that point.

I like the pacing, and everything else, in linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) - the author also has a lot of posts on his livejournal that talk about his choices in writing particularly the first book.

Pureblood Pretense is a pretty long series that to me doesn't lag, but others might disagree, so use that model at your own risk.

I will qualify this list with the fact that I enjoy slice of life a lot, so fics that slow down for that don't really annoy me. I also pretty much just went through my downloaded fics looking for long ones that I didn't remember dragging, but that doesn't mean I was perfect with my recall, but I hope these help!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** There are none. I still hold, that all fanfictions longer than one page of printed text could be cut in half without loosing any content. If you want to have good examples of pacing, go buy a book published in normal publishing house. And even better older book, because the latest fashion of eliminating editors and doing de facto self-publishing is now everywhere.

Just reading “Stardust” by Neil Gaiman and try to read linkffn(What If? by Vance McGill) in parallel. It is pure pain: and it is not picking on Vance McGill, the story is not worse than zillion other fanfiction stories, it is actually rather nice, but half of the text should go, in my opinion.

The declared plan of the story was to be better than DH itself. Well, I would start the comparison with 103 chapters and 464,237 words, comparing 36 chapters (+ epilogue) and 198,227 words of the original. Just why? And no, DH is quite certainly not the best written book even from the HP canon.

**** 1. I compared specifically the story which claimed to be rewrite of DH, so it seems fair to compare the two. I was not comparing the fanfiction which covers the timeline of one volume to the whole series. What's wrong with that?

2. I don't understand your sentence “It's disingenuous to pretend that the fantasy genre relies on brevity.” You seem to accuse me of something, but I don't understand of what.

3. And once more, I haven't said that long story is automatically wrong. However, when the story which covers just DH timeline [[http://commonplacebook.com/art/books/word-count-for-famous-novels/][is longer]] (464,237) than whole Lord of the Rings trilogy (455,125) (not mentioning such trivialities as Moby Dick (206,052), Middlemarch (316,059), Anna Karenina (349,736), The Brothers Karamazov (364,153), or Gone with the Wind (418,053)), then I would say there is something wrong.

4. I haven't read the Prince of Slytherin, generally don't care much for Slytherin!Harry stories, so I am saying nothing about it.
