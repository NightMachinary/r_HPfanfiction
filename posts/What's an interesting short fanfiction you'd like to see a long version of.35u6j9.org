*** Related to this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4220317/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marauders-Horcrux][Marauders Map is a Horcrux]]. I'd prefer it be full on murder rather than what happens in this fic and it be more serious but i'd still love more regardless. The possibilities are endless really...

#+begin_quote
  Not just anyone was asked to join the First Order of the Phoenix, only the bold and the brave, the best witches and wizards of their age... They didn't all say yes. Ch 3: Kingsley Shacklebolt arrests James Potter...a lot.

*** That was good. Makes a solid case for a version of the story told by bystander.

Kinda makes me wonder what the Harry Potter series as told by Percy would be like.

Percy Weasley and the year my brother beat up a troll while I was frantically searching for him.

Percy Weasley and the year my girlfriend was turned to stone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] would be an awesome comedy in long form, but by it's nature would be anthology-ish, each chapter being some grand tale of derpery by students and coworkers while Hannah gets less and less amused by their antics.

*** ...These exists after a fashion. There's a few where Petunia raises Harry in spite of Vernon, and at least one where she divorces him, or he dies or... ceases to be narratively relevant.

But, I think this is now one of my favorites of the genre.

I've written a bit more of that particular story since I posted the drabbles. Some day I might post it as a proper story of its own.
