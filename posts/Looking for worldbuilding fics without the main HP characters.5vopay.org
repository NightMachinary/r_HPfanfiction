I'm looking for fanfiction that focuses on various aspects of the HP canon world, with either minor characters or OCs. For example, a wandmaker, a shop owner, a worker at the floo registry, etc. I don't mind if those are short stories or one-shots - I'm not looking for major plot or romance stories, but for stories that focus on the daily workings of the wizarding world. Those are really hard to find, so if you could point me to any, I would really appreciate it.


** While [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harrys-island-home-harry-potter-that-flies-off-the-rails-quickly.325447/]] is a hp dominant story, the beginning is LITERAL worldbuilding by the proprietors of various shops in diagon alley. Incomplete but pretty fun read.

** I'm looking for something similar. It's not strictly about worldbuilding, but I'd really like a story that uses the HP setting, without relying on HP characters or HP tropes.

@OP, my recommendation is Latet Anguis in Herba, which focuses on the lives of 4 Slytherin students in the year above Harry. It's a long series but really worth it. If anyone has anything similar to that (think something like the Alexandra Quick series), please post it in this thread.

*** Thank you! That's basically it, it's such a great world and 99% of the stories focus on the same 30 characters without going further. The reason I'm looking for shorter stories is that most longer stories focus more on the plot and on romance and that overshadows any world building there is. And thanks for the rec!

*** Ha. I was just about to link that, although, actually I'll just link it anyway (in case anyone's interested). The author updated/edited the original: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]. Hmm, as for OP's request, I can't really think of any others, which is a little bit dissapointing, I like the premise. There are fics with focuses on OCs that might sort of fill the request? Maybe check out this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/20pyef/any_fanfics_set_in_the_potter_world_but_with/?ref=search_posts][thread]], there could be something there or check out other OC requests.

** Lady Altair on ff.net writes a TON of stories based around peripheral characters and may do a few that are of her own creation. Here's a link to one of my faves:
