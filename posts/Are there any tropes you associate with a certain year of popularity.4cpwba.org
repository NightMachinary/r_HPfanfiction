Like Indy!Harry being popular around/after Book 5.

EDIT: Not just school year but like 2005/2006/2007 as well.


** Not exactly a trope, but I associate most stories that begin in Book 1 with "will soon be abandoned." Because, nine out of ten times, the author will abandon the story around second year.

**** Much of it has to do with planning. A seven year epic can be done if the author meticulously plans through every arc. The problem is, many times the authors just have vague plans about certain arcs. Then, when they hit those said arcs, they hit a stumbling block that the vast majority are not able to overcome.

*** That's why I decided to omit the first two years at Hogwarts of my fanfic, myself. It just felt like I was copying the books and other fanfics. There was nothing about it that hadn't already been written, and it was a chore to work my way through that before I could finally start writing the really interesting parts of the story.

*** 100%. I always think that unless you've already written half the series publishing individual books like that is a terrible idea. Particularly when you see it's taken over a year to write that one book.

Pity for the readers though.

** Year 4 and 5 are the years of betrayal and azkaban. Most of the betrayal fics I've seen either start up the betrayals with Harry for being chosen as the Tri-Wizard champion or the courtroom scene.

Though there are a few 7th year fics as well, one 7th year betrayal fic I've been trying to find again, where Harry is abandoned during the camping trip from hell, eventually marries and is confronted by Ron and Hermione, and their daughter, who has a prophesy saying that she must kill Harry Potter, weird premise but good fic if only I could find it.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

**** (I have problem with ffnbots)

The three stories I've been following all began in late 2015/early 2016:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11827316/1/Cult-Potter][Cult Potter]]*: this fem!Harry is actually not dark so far, but the story is still early and things could change.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty][Call Me Moriarty]]*: she basically created a Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious situation for herself. She was light side's 'The Girl Who Lived' on one hand, and the Dark Lord Moriarty on the other. This fem!Harry felt overpowered, but the story is very fun to read.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761312/1/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]]*: she is not evil, but fights back ruthlessly and violently. Dead bodies are already piling up by the summer after year 4.

********* There's no issue with Vol de Mort- literally "flight from death". It's just no feminine name will work as a minuscule of Tom. The common nickname trope makes no sense, he's too formal for that, and altering the name would chop away a big chunk of motive and backstory.
