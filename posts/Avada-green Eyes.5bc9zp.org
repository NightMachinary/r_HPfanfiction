Is this canon? I've read so many fics where Harry's eyes are deacribed this way, but if I recall correctly, the killing curse is described in the books as a sickly bright green.

This is not a pretty (or remotely natural) eye color.

Why can't there be two distinct greens in the same harrowing tale? :^(


** The correct shade is actually fresh-pickled-toad green. So cast a killing curse next to the frog and compare the results.

Besides, does the pickling process really change the pigmentation that much? I don't think it does.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her, and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.

  “I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry.

  “You want to calm yourself, */Madam Umbridge/*,” said Kingsley in his deep, slow voice. “You don't want to get yourself into trouble now.”

  “No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes --- you're right, Shacklebolt --- I --- I forgot myself.”

******** “Madam” isn't really anything special, it's just a word you use when you use someone's surname to refer to them and you want to be polite or at least pretend to be polite. It's pretty much the female equivalent of “Sir”.

So yeah, I can see Shacklebolt using that word when talking to her even if she is a nasty crone.

****** No, No, No. The eyes are because of his maternal ancestor Merlin. Who also was the last dragon shifter (And also the last elven king). The girls all get horny because he has the inheritance from his paternal ancestor count Dracula who was a Veela and Vampire hybrid. He also can morph into a basilisk, due to the Slytherin blood he has, because he is his magical heir. He is also the leader of all the magical creatures because he yelled at a goblin instinctively. And that is how it is!! (Pardon me, if I have spelling mistakes. I don't speak English natively.)

** I feel like in some of the edgier fics his eyes are like that because of "magic residue" or something remaining from the actual curse that was cast that Halloween. And to be honest, in a world where magic even exists, surviving an Avada Kedavra directly to the face might leave some lasting effects. A Harry with green eyes the shade of the Killing Curse makes enough sense to not break suspension of disbelief if thought of like this.
