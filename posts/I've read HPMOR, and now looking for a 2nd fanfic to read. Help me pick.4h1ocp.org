The only fanfic I've ever read is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I absolutely adored it, and I am looking for something else to take me back into Hogwarts.

I have no specific requests for tropes or plot developments to ask for, but I have to ask that you recommend me a work that is well written, and has literary value. Something that at least seems to have been edited or *written skillfully*, and doesn't hurt my eyes to read.

A second "request" is that it be reminiscent of Hogwarts, and that it successfully immerses the readers back to the world of Hogwarts. I've got a case of nostalgia again after coming across a flowchart that supposedly recommended books based on what you liked about the Harry Potter series. The question "what is your favourite activity in Hogwarts" sent me spiraling back to the past :P

To answer that question in fact, it would be an account of just "everyday activities" going on, like classes and stuff like that with no life-threatening crises arising. I'm not sure if I'd want a fanfic of purely something like that, but if you know one and you judge it worthy, why not send it my way? :P

*** What I liked about HPMOR:

    :CUSTOM_ID: what-i-liked-about-hpmor
    :END:
I am a science and philosophy nerd, so I really liked this approach to the Harry Potter world. I liked how it made substantial reworkings of how the magic system worked and where it came from, and some characters were much more layered, especially Voldemort. I like an analytical and scientific approach to anything, to be honest. I don't necessarily need a fanfic similar to HPMOR, but if there is, I wouldn't mind it. After all half of the nostalgia is also about HPMOR; reading it was as influential an experience as the original series, and I do hope to recreate /that/ with this next fanfic.

I'm not opposed to romance, but it will have to be well written and not cheesy. I'm not looking for smut or slash, though.

Sorry for the wall of text, and the vague and unclear requests. I hope this provides enough information for any of you to make a judgement about what kind of a reading would be fitting for me. Thank you in advance :)


** People on here tend not to like HPMOR for a variety of reasons. (I would hesitate to say the average user */hates/* it, but many do).

For that reason, I'm not surprised you haven't gotten a lot of responses. I recommend starting in another thread and reading through the recommendations to see if any of the summaries sound intriguing. Here's a link to a random thread that probably has a bunch of good fics listed. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4fz5yb/what_is_your_favorite_harry_potter_fan_fiction/]]

This is a compilation of many of the best HPFF stories. Not all good fics are listed here, but all of these are of high quality. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/]]

If I had to recommend a few fics to a newbie I'd probably suggest:

linkffn(The First Day)

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

** I think Harry Potter and the Natural 20 was the second fanfic I read after HPMOR, and I think it fits with what you've said.

The Metropolitan Man is non-HP, but highly recommended, and similar in some aspects to HPMOR. It follows Lex Luthor in the 1930s dealing with the emergence of Superman, and has 'rational' characters, inasmuch as they are intelligent and analytical, and don't hold the idiot ball.

The Game of Champions by Lamora is a pokemon fanfic which reimagines the universe as a post-apocalyptic Earth where pokemon overran the world. As you can imagine, it's quite a bit darker. A lot of effort is put into making the world make sense, and the pokemon are all imagined in a sensible and rational way. This is my favorite fanfic, bar none, and it fits with what you're looking for.

For instance he gives a encyclopedia entry for a pokemon at the end of every chapter, and this is Pikachu's:

#+begin_quote
  Kanto Pokemon Encyclopedic Index Entry #25 (J. # 22): Pikachu

  Basic Characteristics: Electric-type, quadrupedal mammal, avg. height 1'04, avg. weight 13.2lbs.

  Description: Small, warm-blooded rat-type pokemon. Shares geneology with plusle, pachirisu, emolga and minun family trees. Covered in predominantly yellow fur accentuated by broad brown stripes across the back, whose wideness can determine age and nearness to evolution, such that the nickname ‘brownback pikachu' is given to a specimen who is particularly near raichu age. Possessing of long ears tipped in black, capable of detecting sounds from great distances and limited echolocation and a jagged tail used for grounding electrical charges. Pikachu collect electrical charge in the glands located on their cheeks -- the size and carrying capacity of these glands is dependant on the frequency of discharge and size. This pokemon is an omnivore, capable of sustaining a human diet with little difficultly.

  Nickname(s): The Mouse Pokemon, the Electric Rat Pokemon, pikas, joltrats, shockmice.

  “...Known to be popular in pokemon contests and as household pets, pikachu are an extremely common, social species whose electric abilities and size allow them to outcompete many other rodent and pest types in urban areas. Typically timid, they are known to become hostile when touched around the tail area or cornered, and are capable of significant damage when attacking in collusion with others of their species. Of their species, not many are used in pokebattling -- while they do occasionally demonstrate power disproportionate to their size or initial appearance, trainers typically prefer to wait until brownback age at the very earliest in order to fully utilize their electric potential, if not raichu years; alone, they are pests at the worst and can be safely ignored in most cases...”
#+end_quote

Disclaimer: Whilst HPMOR introduced me to the fandom, and I loved it at the time, I went off it after a while, and never finished it.

*** I really liked that story while it was being published, but I re-read it a couple of months ago and found myself wondering what I'd liked. It was only when I got up to somewhere around chapter 50(!) I started to remember.

The trouble in re-reading is that you know just how great Hermione will become and seeing her as a rather wet and pathetic creature at the start of the book makes you want to get to the good bits.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits]]) is a continuation fic of HPMOR that maintains its spirit.

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation]]) centers on Hermione as a highly intelligent and largely Rational! protagonist. Updates /very/ slowly.

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle, is a non-magical AU, where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training James-Bond-style superspies and related personnel for Britain's tumultuous Intelligence Community, and where skill, technology, and occasional superscience takes the place of magic. Most children who go there come from families in the Community, such as the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", but some common children, like Hermione and Colin can get an invitation if they do something particularly cunning or vicious. The overall plot follows canon loosely (in that the big challenge of each year parallels that of that year of canon), but it's a plus in this case, because it's interesting to see how the magical events of HP canon are reflected in this spy-verse.

- Outside of HP fandom, linkffn(Luminosity by Alicorn24) is a reimagining of /Twilight/ with a rational!Bella.

** While I too started reading HP fics from HPMoR and liked it I rather quickly noticed fic's problems. I also want to warn you about something in advance.

#+begin_quote
  I liked how it made substantial reworkings of how the magic system worked
#+end_quote

While HPMoR made big changes to some magical mechanics (transfiguration being most noticeable) it also generally stayed true to "spirit" of original magic. BuSadly, most of fics really dumb magic down. Even those that are well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] - Alternative ending to HPMoR which spins out from chapter 81. While it have its own problems its better and have much grander scale, that fits final fight against Voldemort better. (Complete)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. (Year one complete, there is a new version planned)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][Arinthmacer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] - This fic is based on arithmancy being method of spell creation, which is rather stupid and doesn't fit with how magic works. The beginning is also rather canon rehashy. So why I recommend it? Initial arc focus strongly on Hogwarts, there is a lot of "education" added, and the writing is technically competent. (Ongoing with regular updates).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - The most famous next-gen fic, and a good one at that, even though it has quite a lot inconsistencies with canon. Focuses strongly on relations between houses, and students conflict with teachers. (Complete, but with sequel hook that probably will never be used)

ffnbot!directlinks

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. (Ongoing, regular updates)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755550/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-cryptographic-key][Harry Potter and the cryptographic key]] - linkffn(10755550) - I'm going to terribly describe this as Harry pranking himself.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] - linkffn(10636246) - I didn't care for the final confrontation, but Hermione's experience in Azkaban and the world-wide dementor battle are must-reads.
- [[http://freetexthost.com/ikucx6nse4][Nonlinear Regression]] - the final confrontation with Voldemort we were all expecting from rationalist Harry Potter, tying in /so many/ of the clues scattered throughout HPMOR -- there are some good reasons why this couldn't actually have been how HPMOR should have ended, but it's still a great read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie][Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie]] - linkffn(10023949) - A one-shot about the nature of HPMOR ghosts.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10446022/1/Continuing-HPMoR-Hacking-the-Source-of-Magic][Continuing HPMoR: Hacking the Source of Magic]] - linkffn(10446022) - HJPEV is a very smart kid. Even so, kids should not mess with reality... Also, ... (not really a spoiler) ... Professor Quirrel was ... Merlin?!

As someone else who entered HP fanfiction through HPMOR, some other works that I have still enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] - linkffn(2919503) - a sweet story with competent adults who actually want to help Harry
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] - linkffn(10595005) - Killing Voldemort did nothing to stop the bigotry and institutionalized prejudice of magical society, until the Ministry goes one step too far...
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] - linkffn(5511855) - Harry teams up with a younger Bellatrix Black

Also, try some of [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/][Yudkowsky's other fictions]], especially [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/][Three Worlds Collide]].
