This basic plot is weirdly very VERY rare, I myself know of two fics like this, and in one of the two the sibling dies at the beginning of it. It's really surprising that there is no fic where Harry has a supportive relationship with a sibling, but after a fic where it's the case, I find myself really wanting to read something like this. Did any of you guys stumble on a fic like this?


** I've seen a few where Harry ends up in an alt world where he has siblings he is on good terms with. Like linkffn(3571753)

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

** To Be A Slytherin is one I'm really enjoying right now, it focuses a bit more on the sibling then Harry but she joins a lot of his adventures. It's a bit too canon for my usual tastes but it's nice to read an OC I don't insta hate.

** It is extremely M but “The Harem War” fits the bill: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639518/1/The-Harem-War]]

Harry has a sister who was separated from him, adopted and raised in another family, and in early mid-fic they meet and have a good relationship afterwards.

Also if you look past the explicit scenes it's a very decent fic with some original ideas.

Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.
