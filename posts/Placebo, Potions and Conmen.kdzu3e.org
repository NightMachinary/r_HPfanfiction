As it seems... are all potioneers secretly just conmen who sell placebo potions which just force a magical persons own magic to heal them. Is snape a fraud.. What kind of conspiracy could be fueling the underground potions trade. I dont know, but some of you clever folks who know how to write could come up with some cool ideas I bet!


** That doesn't explain muggle potion victims, like the muggle Tom Riddle, or Dudley and the ton-tongue toffee.

** Potions themselves aren't where the fraud happens. Potions ingredients would be though. Imagine if there were a way to create potions for anything simply by singing a ditty or lullaby over a pot of boiling water, resulting in everyone except squibs being able to craft them.

Then someone sets forth to craft potions using magically reactive substances so that squibs can brew too and accidentally creates the new, more inefficient way of doing things. They sell the basic brewing sequence to the Ministry for a pittance, who smell a means through which they can finally regulate and tax the creation of said potions. A change in the curriculum, a ban on the older method of potions making and an interdict on using music as a means of casting magic later (plus about a hundred years and several dozen book burning events), the new method becomes widespread enough that the older ways die out.

The old families who still remember the previous method keep their silence, since selling potions ingredients is ridiculously profitable. And as new people enter the Wizarding World, the memory that such methods exist are gradually expunged and turned into the stuff of legend. Anyone 'discovering' the old methods is quickly found and obliviated.

And thus was the potions ingredients market created-an elaborate con designed to collect taxes and make money for the pureblood families that are in on the joke.
