Should the sexy stuff be the main focus, or should it compliment the plot of the fic? In other words, are you just looking for HP characters to engage in sexy activities?


** I think that depends on how canon compliant the characters act, and how interesting the sex itself is.

Post-war Bill/Fleur smut doesn't really need a story can be 100% written porn because their relationship is well-established and doesn't need explanation.

A Harry/Bellatrix missionary scene in a random hotel doesn't really do anything because the sex is boring and the characters aren't explained.

A no-explanation, Hermione and Futa!Luna three-way with Cedric and Nearly Headless Nick as the narrator spying around the corner doesn't need a story because the sex itself is the interesting bit.

** If I'm looking for something like this I want an extremely medium amount of plot. I have no interest in reading a long complex plot that's graphic and sexual. Mature scenes in longer stories are ok, but I don't want to read a "Harry goes back in time, has sex with every witch in the world, 7 year 600k words" story. Those stories are fine on their own, but I don't want to read a smut story like that. At the same time I want a little story, not just something that was written purely to have HP characters bone.

*** Thank you for the great answer! I recently started continuing a Hermione/Pansy smut fic I wrote awhile ago and found the world there to be pretty interesting, but wasn't sure how much I should expand on it if at all. Thanks again!

** How long is the story? I say the longer it goes the more plot gets added till you pass the 65/35 ratio

One chapter story, it's about 95-90% smut. Two chapters 80% and so on. Now you can front end more plot and world building to go full 100% smut chapters later on. But once you are at about 65% Plot and 35% Smut it's just a story with Smut featured (which isn't bad and can be some of the best stories).

** It's not plot/story that makes smut good so much as characterization. (Unless you're writing 1000 words of pwp. But that's not what we're talking about.)

The best I can do for you is throw out a few disparate threads of evidence I've come across---most of them coming from outside Harry Potter, unfortunately---which all point in the same direction.

First, you can go to Literotica and sort by top-rated stories. I'm yet to find a highly-rated story wherein sex precedes the characters becoming reasonably well-established. On the other hand, there are quite a few extremely highly-rated stories that start with telling readers to go elsewhere if they sought immediate satisfaction.

Second: I think we all accept that overpowering Harry such that he trivially overcomes opposition makes a story unsatisfying. But then come along stories in which Harry is comically OP and yet they work. See, for instance, [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]], which features the most OP Harry I've ever read, but it works because the story isn't driven by Harry needing to overcome adversity, but by character interaction. If you're willing to look in the Buffy fandom, please check out M McGregor. In particular, I'd look at [[https://m-mcgregor.livejournal.com/?skip=60&tag=fanfic:%20i%20am%20what%20i%20am][I Am What I Am]], because it has author commentary and is probably his best work, and [[http://xanderzone.osiris-web.com/stories/LoversReciprocation.html][Lover's Reciprocation]], because it's well-executed smut. In these stories, what little plot there is serves only to drive characterization, but it works because these stories aren't about the plot, they're about the characters---and, where applicable, the sex these characters have.

(If anyone knows of any fics that do what Lover's Reciprocation does in terms of character-building from the HP fandom, please *do* comment with recs.)

Third is Mr. Plinkett's discussion of lightsaber duels in his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORWPCCzSgu0][Phantom Menace review]]. If you're not invested in the characters, the flawless choreography becomes empty. This is probably applicable everywhere, but it's particularly important when you're writing smut. People want to have sex with people. Two automatons having the wildest, kinkiest sex imaginable is not remotely as interesting as two well-developed characters in missionary.

So, I don't think you need more than the barest amount of story to given characterization context. In fact, I think having a substantial plot takes away from the story (one of the shortcomings of Hope), since it's neither characterization nor sexy time, the two elements that are necessary and sufficient for good smut. But just because there shouldn't be much plot doesn't mean just write HP characters engaging in sexy activities. Harry Potter is a fundamentally asexual work, which broke broke my suspension of disbelief more than anything else. That's fine: children's stories are under no obligation to maintain an adolescent's or adult's suspension of disbelief, whereas they /are/ required to not contain sexual thoughts typical of an adolescent. But it also gives fanfic authors both the room and responsibility to expand upon the existing characters when writing smut.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in 'subject to entanglement').

** Even if I am in the mood for smut, I want at least decent plot plain and simple. I want the plot to drive the story forward, and to play at least as big a role as the smut/lemons do in the story itself.

*Note that this does not mean the plot has to be entirely realistic or of any particular style.

Also.... to be honest, even if I am not in the mood for smut, I would rather read a mature fic that included smut as a realistic part of the plot/story, than a T rated fic that danced around it.
