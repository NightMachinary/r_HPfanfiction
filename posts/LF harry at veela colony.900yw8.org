Despite several years of reading fanfics, i have yet to read a single fic where harry grows up/lives at/visits at veela colony, so are there any fics where harry spends any time at one of their colonies? Doesnt have to contain smut btw, but i dont really care ^{^} a bit of naughtyness is preferred though! Obv no slash for harry ;)

Slightly above average harem fic (the quality gets alot better as it goes along) that includes an extremely fascinating take on Veela colonies as well as a decent length visit to one. Though you do have to get a significant amount of reading done before you get to it.
