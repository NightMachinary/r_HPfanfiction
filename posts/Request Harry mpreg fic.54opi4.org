I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry and Ron sleep together, and it turns out that Ron does it maliciously. He basically destroys Harry the morning after by being a bastard and has been using Harry for a while. Harry gets pregnant from Ron, and eventually begins a relationship with someone else, but I can't remember who. It's slash, mpreg, and Ron!bashing. If anyone has any ideas that would be awesome! Also, any more obscure mpreg fic suggestions would be welcome, I've read so many but I'd like some new suggestions. Most pairings are fine, except Harry/Voldemort.


** Hey guys, don't down vote things just because you don't like them. This genre is just as valid as any other, even if most of us would rather not read it.

** Someone was looking for something along this same vein on the HP Fic Search LiveJournal Page a couple of months ago. The link to the thread is [[http://hp-ficsearch.livejournal.com/584621.html][here]].

Here are some Harry/Draco MPREG recs ->([[http://my-drarry-recs.livejournal.com/tag/mpreg%3A%20harry][mpreg:Harry]]) ([[http://my-drarry-recs.livejournal.com/tag/mpreg%3A%20draco][mpreg:Draco]]) and also you can check [[http://harrydracompreg.livejournal.com/][Here]] for new stories. All links are to LiveJournal so you may need an account to see the pages.
