** For a few months, I've not been working on my long fic, but for NaNo I've started updating it again! :) I've put out three chapters the past few days, and I'm really pleased about it.

It's a Slytherin Harry AU, and I'm not about halfway into fourth year, now! I can't wait to get onto the numerous character deaths. :D

  By the time Harry arrives for the term of his fourth year at Hogwarts, he's battled doxies, puffskeins, and even the dangerous teenage moodswing. Unfortunately, that's not all the world has in store: his name is dropped into the Goblet of Fire, and Harry's life descends into its usual state of chaos.At the very least, he gets to see a few more pretty girls than usual.[Ships will be tagged once they've been portrayed, so that people don't start reading the fic when their ship of choice hasn't had any "screentime" yet.]

** I'm trying to write what Dumbledore would /do/. Writing what he would say is fairly easy but writing what the man who fooled voldemort would do is a lot more of a pain.

*** I feel your pain man. Writing on the level of someone on a really high level of intelligence can be a pain. I have little cheeky fix for it that sometimes works. I just first imagine Dumbledore as an /incredibly/ lucky guy around whom everything goes according to his wishes. I write all the events with that in mind, then I erase the 'lucky guy' part and then write it as if Dumbledore knew what was happening all along. Like he was the one making it all happen.

Doesn't always work, but when it does, it works spectacularly.

** I'm going absolutely crazy that I haven't had the time to finish the next chapter of my work in progress.... I seriously haven't posted in like two months, and I'm worried people are going to think I abandoned it... But I've been basically working from 8am until 11pm (with a few 1-2 hour breaks throughout the day) ever since the small company I work with had to fire one of their subcontractors. I feel like I've barely had time to eat and sleep, and any writing I have managed to do ended up being crap (like wake up the next day, re-read, go "wtf was I thinking", and delete, that bad of crap). I did manage to mostly finish the first half of the chapter over the weekend (I had most of Saturday off because it was my anniversary), so I'm happy about that. Now if I can just get a few hours of peace, maybe I can finish the rest and actually post it. Along with a huge apology...

And I gtg because I am... at work... fml.

*** I've read a lot of authors who put their reasons for not updating in a while on their profile page with an estimated time of return. The people who really love your story will probably check out your profile if you haven't updated in a while to figure out if it's a dead fic. Have you done that?

** Sadly I posted nothing, bit I did heaps and heaps of writing!

I fleshed out a character for my own novel, which has made me pretty happy since I've done it. I finished his backstory, his likes and dislikes, and his favourite song, movie, picture, memory, et cetera. Half of this will never be mentioned, nor will it be bought up at all in conversation, but it just feels good to have it there. I also worked a little bit on his very sad and depressing backstory.

Aside from that, I also did work on a few plot points for fic ideas I have and neatened up a few older chapters that I should be able to update in a few days (hopefully!)

What about you, OP? You didn't list what you've worked on!

** I'm working on chapter 2 of my NaNoWriMo novel today, which happens to be fanfiction. It's a post-war drama/romance with Hermione, Draco, and Rabastan Lestrange as the leads.

I love the atmosphere that surrounds NaNo because it just gets me to write. The last few weeks I've barely scraped together 1000 words, but in two days I've hit almost 7k. After dinner, I'm hoping that enthusiasm will rub off and I'll get past the problem areas in one of my other fanfictions (not yet posted.)

*Problem Area*

The first part of the story is my OC going through Hogwarts the same years as Luna and I'm trying to be relatively canon-compliant until my diverging point in HBP. I've bogged down writing year 5 & 6. There's only so much interacting with Umbridge that my character goes through and she's not privy to other stations of canon so I feel like these sections are very boring and slow. Boring and slow to write means it's probably going to be boring and slow to read, and so I procrastinate writing them.

Any ideas of what would or could be going on 'behind-the-scenes,' so to speak, of the year with Umbridge and the year after?

*** I'm writing for NaNoWriMo too. I definitely agree with what you said about the atmosphere. I've pumped out 10k in the last 3 days and it feels amazing.

Might I suggest adding small self contained character building moments in the parts where you feel the story is bogged down? Something like your OC encountering a Slytherin 3rd year being bullied by Gryffindors or a Ravenclaw 1st year breaking down under the pressure of his house's reputation, and then her helping them.

Its like the old saying, Character building when plot building's down and plot building when character building is down.

**** That's a great idea, thank you! I think I was stumbling in that direction, but I'm glad you pointed it out.

I think sometimes I've gotten so wrapped up in /Chekov's gun/ sort of thing that I forget that character building is important too.
