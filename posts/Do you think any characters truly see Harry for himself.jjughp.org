Many people argue against the cannon Hinny pairing because of the "Hero Worship" problem - i.e.: Ginny is too obsessed with Hero Harry to be in a functioning relationship with him. However, are there really any characters that are: 1) likely to be in a relationship with Harry (both males and females within maybe 3 years) and 2) see Harry as "just Harry", a.k.a. not the Man-Who-Won, Boy-Who-Lived, etc.?


** This is common in Harmony fics, as it fits the canon characterization. Arguably it applies to all members of the Golden Trio, although Ron is played inconsistently in fanfic. I'd argue he certainly sees Harry as Harry, he can just be a bit jealous of Harry. Sometimes that jealously gets played as him not seeing Harry for himself, but I think that is a mistake.

If anything, Ron knowing Harry for Harry is something that makes jealously worse, or at least more poinent.

Outside of the trio the place I think this is with Luna (Larry?). Although it really depends on which flavor of Luna the author goes with.

I'm not a huge Fluer/Harry fan, but I imagine this is implicit with any Harry/Foreign, particularly if it is framed as "Voldemort is really just a British thing".

Mixed results on Honks fics. For some reason authors like to give 6 year old Tonks a creeper crush on baby Harry. (I groan whenever I see this, just like I groan at the "All mah boyfriends want me to change into someone for dem you da best for wanting my true self" lines ._.). When that is avoided Honks usually doesn't have the hero worship.

*** I like your reasoning. Ron never seems to see Harry for Harry in my opinion. He is often too blinded by jealousy to properly see Harry for himself. Hermione I am beginning to agree with but I still have reservations. Maybe post GoF Hermione but not before. Luna (Huna I think?) I absolutely agree with. I really struggle to enjoy fics where Luna is portrayed as just weird. Tonks (ignoring the age gap) seems ok but I get the feeling that Harry would always be the "Young Legend" sort of character. A prodigy if you will. Side note: I read an odd fic where Tonks wanted people to ask her to change but everyone tried to impress her by asking to see her natural form. I enjoyed the cliche flip but I remember the fic being a bit odd.

**** Eh, both Hermione and Ron start off with a bit of that, but it is really gone halfway through the first book. It depends if you are looking to see a start of a relationship where it doesn't come into play or if you are ok with characters growing out of it.

And as I said, Ron knowing that Harry's shit don't shine and he doesn't piss gold makes jealously worse. He knows Harry is just another bloke like him who actively doesn't want what he wants, but it actively gets given to him anyway. That is why it is so hurtful to Harry when Ron treats him like the Boy Who Lives instead of a friend or even just a dormmate: Ron is doing it to spite Harry because he knows it will hurt him.

Tonks fics usually go for the "I was old enough to remember seeing you as a baby before the event". It can work pretty well. Its only really when the authors pair "I remember babysitting you when I was six" with "And you are my childhood crush" that it gets super creepy.

Hermiones limited "You are a Hero Harry" comes from her reading, most of that is dispelled in the first book, the rest of it is put dead to rights in the second book with Lockheart. It is certainly dead and burried by the time of the Hippogryph ride.

***** As much as I love Honks, if you take the cannon descriptions of both characters it is quite obvious that they wouldn't really work as a couple. I agree that the childhood crush thing is very creepy but I thankfully havent come across too many fics like that.

When I posted this discussion I was firmly set on Hermione suffering from Hero Worship but I think I have switched sides. I think it is inevitable that anyone close to Harry will suffer from being in his shadow and being awed by his feats but I think Hermione is a prime example of a true friend. Kind of sad that they dont end up together because they suit each other far better than Romione or Hinny.

****** Erm, the canon description of Harry is an audience insert who is passive, a bit impulsive and stubborn.

Thus he really fits most pairings depending on the audience. Personally, I never saw Harry/Ginny. But there was quite a bit of where he ended up that made little sense to me. Harry/Ginny, him being an auror (like why), or the fact he doesn't... get the hell out of dodge once he isn't needed in Britain anymore. Eh.

The age gap with Harry/Tonks is enough to put off most fics for me during Hogwarts timeframe (which is most of them) if they don't involve time travel or other shenanigan's. There are a few set after Hogwarts (which is usually a 20y/o with a 27y/o, which is much less offputitng) that I find ok, but otherwise the age thing is usually just ignored (to the detriment of the fic).

******* I dont really care about the age thing. As I noted in a previous conversation about boundaries in fanfiction I think age boundaries can be stretched within reason. Harry and Ginny works if you assume Harry's ultimate wish is for "normality". A normal wife and a normal life seems pretty "normal" to me. However, I do agree that their relationship is a little... eh. Unsatisfactory for many.

*** I think I agree with everything here. Fleur I hadn't really considered but now I think about it, her whole attitude in cannon and fanfiction suits a "Just Harry" relationship. I think the whole understanding thing is fair enough but shouldn't be overused if you get where I'm coming from. Almost every character gets Harry at some point. It's the characters who almost always get him which I'm looking for. Maybe they are the same thing? Your Tonks point is a good one, but I still think they arent very compatible. I'm just being picky now though so I will shut up. Thanks for your input!

***** Very good points. If I'm honest, viability of a relationship almost never comes into factor when I am choosing what fic to read. I merely entertain these discussions and thoughts because it is nice to hear other opinions. If I am reading a serious fic then often I prefer a pairing that seems more believable.

** In cannon Ron and Hermione are the only ones That interact with Harry enough to know the real him. Sirius and Remus see him as an extension of James(especially Sirius), Pretty Much everyone else sees him as a celebrity, Weasleys know him as Rons good friend, Grangers presumably know him as Hermiones good friend but nobody else sees him as the neglected confused youth he is. Fred and George come close and so does Luna and maybe Ginny( cannon does not talk of Ginny much until the sixth book) but only Ron and Hermione really know him.

This is so wrong that I don't know how to begin with, as the best person who can understand Harry's trauma is none other than Ginny:

- They are the only two persons who had been intimately violated by Voldemort and lived to tell the tale. Even Hermione couldn't claim this feat.
- Ginny was a founding member of his student resistance group Dumbledore's Army, and it was her who came up with the name.
- She, Hermione, and Luna were the only girls who had been with him on that ill fated DoM battle from beginning to the end. No other women could possibly imagine the horrors and stress of facing 12 of Voldemort most vicious sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums.
- Next year, Ginny again fought directly in the Astronomy Tower Battle, in fact facing Amycus Carrow directly. Hermione and Luna were duped by Snape and missed most of the fighting.
- She fully understood that Harry had to go on that suicide mission, and she did her own part by organizing the resistance at Hogwarts.

By overcoming incredible odds against the ultimate evil, by becoming a child soldier at incredibly young age, what's the difference? What's the infatuation with "Just Harry" anyway? In canon, Harry muttered this line once in his first year. Do you honestly believe Year 7 Harry was still the same?

People can change, and will change as they grow up even without traumatic experiences. How many of you (especially those above 30) can claim you are still the same as when you were 18, or even 11?

Furthermore, Harry Potter is not just a high school teenager drama. These characters are child soldiers who forged their bonds through immense suffering and struggles. They have little to do with your average teens. Do you even understand what "Band of Brothers/Sisters" mean?

*** First of all: Damn. I wasnt expecting a crusade though absolute respect for formulating a valid argument with cannon proof etc.

I wish to say one thing as a general response: this is all MY opinion.

That being said, you raise a valid argument that Ginny is particularly close to Harry in terms of experience with Voldemort and general life outlooks etc. You are also correct that age and experience factors heavily on opinion and outlook; first year Ginny is extraordinarily different from Post War Ginny. Without my personal context, you are correct. MY context is that I wrote this post after coming across a short discussion about Ginny in book one, and her general attitude towards Harry. I am sorry that I didnt make this clear.

Thank you immensely for your participation in my little discussion, though I never expected something quite so... vitriolic? Extreme? Whatever your background, personal experience, or views are, I have a great respect for someone who defends their view with such passion, backed up with evidence and an explanation.

Just an additional note: my use of Just Harry is less of a reference to the scene in book one and more of a generic belief that Harry, as a character, simply wishes for peace and anonymity in the wizarding world. Yes he fought a war and overcame insurmountable odds, but in the end he doesnt care for the title or the prestige. He simply wishes to be a normal boy with a normal life. I think that is one of the key messages within the whole series.

This is way blown out of proportion in fics. He might have wanted that when he was still a young kid. But after that total cluster fuck in DH, that bridge to normality was burnt forever; they would NOT leave their fate to those soulless bureaucratic Ministry minions again; they would take matters into their own hands and forge their own destiny.

Harry becoming the youngest Head Auror ever at age 27 means that he has accepted his exceptional role. Harry might not care about title or prestige, but he cares very deeply about his family, his friends, and his sense of justice and duty! He will not let those sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis regroup, he will not leave the Ministry at the tender mercy of blood purists again, and he will do whatever it takes to *protect his family, his friends, and his agenda*.

***** Maybe that is the epilogue version of events. If I am honest, I strongly believe that they could never really achieve much beyond winning the war. Harry isnt the type of character to use his fame to do anything and is more likely to sink into depression, as sad as that may be. They are just kids. That is something we have to remember. Kids, no matter their experiences and abilities, are not suitable for government reform and positions. Push a revolution too quickly and you end up creating an unstable government, but dont push it fast enough and it crumbles back to where it started. I dont think that a group of kids, no matter their skill and conviction, will ever be able to make much of a true political change. Sadly, the wizarding world is likely to stay as bigoted as it was. That is just my belief though, and everyone is entitled to believe something different.

My opinion of Harry wishing for anonymity and peace comes from his description in almost all of the series. As far as I am aware, he never tries to use his fame, and he almost always shies away from public attention. Harry just never seems to want to do heroic things, he is just forced between a rock and a hard place, and can only do the thing he knows: being heroic. He is defined by bravery and courage, yes, but equally for his desire for normality and averageness. Maybe that isnt what JK intended. It is simply how I see the character.

All said and done, thanks for your input, it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things. Your way of presenting and explaining points is exceptional, despite your more invested approach. No offence, but you can come off as a little aggressive.
