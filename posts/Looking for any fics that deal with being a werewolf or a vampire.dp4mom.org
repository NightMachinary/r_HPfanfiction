I was doing a bit of wiki walking through the Harry Potter wiki and started reading about them and became interested. Anyone got a fic that deals with being a werewolf or vampire in wizarding society?


** I don't know if you would count my own fic in this category but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16993962/chapters/39948861][Let Slip the Dogs of War]] deals with a lot of Remus' internalizations about the hardships of being a werewolf like how he feels the mornings after his transformations and how people treat him in society because of it. I would also recommend literally anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/fluorescentgrey/pseuds/fluorescentgrey][fluorescentgrey]] who is literally the master of describing the effects of Remus' lycanthropy.

** Self recommendation. I've written some Remus stories, like this, about how much it sucks to be a werewolf. Sure, Rowling gave him agonizing transformations, but I'm cruel enough to also subject him to microaggressions from coworkers.

  Complete! Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
