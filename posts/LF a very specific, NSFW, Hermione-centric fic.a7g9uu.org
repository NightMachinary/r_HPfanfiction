Okay I think the author's penname started with a V. Vela or Vera something?

It was a post Battle of Hogwarts fic that got reaaaaaaal kinky, but was still super plot driven. It was about Hermione dealing with the implosion of her relationship with Ron, Ginny's self harming and/or addiction issues, Harry being kind of a doormat? And Hermione having a host of emotional issues. She uses a time Turner constantly and like ends up living two or three years in the space of what is actually like eight to twelve months?

End game couple was Hermione and Neville. Other side pairings included Percy/Augusta Longbottom, Hermione/DracoAsTonks, Hermione/Draco/Neville, and Dubcon Ginny/Hermione.

There was a scene where Hermione has Draco polyjuice himself as Tonks so that Hermione could have sex with the woman she crushed on.

Hermione has some self esteem issues about Neville being interested in her. Augusta Longbottom is an important secondary character.

I wish I remembered more but yeah. I think the length was at least 60k? It was like 80 per cent done when I read it.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

I've had this fic on my to-read list for a while, but I had no idea it was quite so... /wild/.
