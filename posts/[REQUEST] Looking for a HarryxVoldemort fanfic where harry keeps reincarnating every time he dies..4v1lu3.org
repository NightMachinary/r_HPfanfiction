I haven't read the story in so long I forgot the title and author name. Only other thing I can think of is that Harry disappears from Privet Drive early in his childhood before ending up at Hogwarts and being sorted into Slytherin. He also has a strained relationship with Dumbledore. Any help would be great, thanks so much!


** Is it Again and Again by Athey?

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
