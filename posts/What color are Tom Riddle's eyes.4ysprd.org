This is something that is forever inconsistent in fanfiction and in the fandom in general. As I am working on my own FF it's something that really irritates me when I'm working on the younger TMR.

It's obvious that following his resurrection and the subsequent making of at least 3-4 of his horcruxes, Tom's eyes turned to the color red, however what color are his eyes before then? I went through both the sixth and second books looking for any mention of the color but was unable to find anything and all I know is that they're 'dark', but that could still be black,blue,green or even hazel. Is it actually known what color his eyes are or do we as a fandom just assume they're a dark green, a blue(from the movie's) or black cause of the 'dark' description?


** As you said, we don't know save for 'Dark'.

Personally I can only picture them as a [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Lens5.jpg][dark brown]]. From his magical heritage both Morfin and Marvolo have "bright brown eyes", and I /think/ Merope has 'dark' eyes too.

That said he is a mirror of muggle Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle's hair is black and while blue or other colors are certainly possible I don't think they fit, here's why:

- Magical eye colors, such as Hooch's yellow, are unlikely due to the above 'wish' of taking after Tom Riddle Sr. The same goes for Black and since it is specifically noted and contrasted in Snape and Hagrid.
- Shades of grey occur, but I don't think a grey could reach a point as to simply be labelled 'dark'.
- If his eyes were a (dark) green I would expect it to be mentioned due to Harry's own green eyes.
- If (dark) blue, Dumbledore.
- Comparing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color#Spectrum_of_eye_color][an eye color spectrum]] a dark brown, as I linked above, would seem the most likely.

It may seem boring to some, but I don't think so. If you want to cater then ask the Tom fan community or find the majority in the fics you've read and go with that color.

*last edit... If you wanted 'black' you could have the real life variant, which is black on first impression. Technically it would actually be a [[http://www.hotashi.com/jetaime/?p=3518][very very dark brown]]. That way he'd be a little unique, and the color could play on the light or impression you want to give.

Or do whatever color you want and find a reason or don't. Honestly the less time spent describing eyes the better.

**** Wait.. You mean I'm /not/ supposed to write half a paragraph describing their eyes while making wild and unrelated metaphors about how they make the people around feel?

*** I think this is probably true, most probably see the blue/green of the movies and like that better so they role with that.

** In Chamber of Secrets, in the second to last chapter:

#+begin_quote
  There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
#+end_quote

Later in CoS, TMR tells Harry that

#+begin_quote
  We even look something alike . . . but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me.
#+end_quote

I think this is why people assume his eyes are green.

*** That could be the reason, but there is also the fact that christian coulson, the actor who played TMR has green eyes.

** blue, green, and hazel eyes are typically not described as dark, which would lead me to think Tom's eyes are brown or black.

** I always imagine Tom's eyes as dark blue. I'm not sure why - either actors, or I really like combination blue eyes & black hair for my pretty boy Riddle imagination. Even its not 100% canon, I kinda cringe when they're described as grey or brown. But a big no-no for me - red eyes. Thats Voldemort, most likely after he resseructed himself, not Tom Riddle.

As fan fiction, they're often blue or grey, sometimes brown or red. I don't really remember green or black.

** They are blue in canon, but mistakenly listed as red. I prefer that to red despite the fact red should have came from making horcruxe.s
