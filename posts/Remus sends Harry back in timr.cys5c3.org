I'm looking for a specific fix I was going to read next but I cant remember the name of it. I remember remus somehow sends harry back to the marauders time that's about all I can remember from the description.


** Is it the one where he writes a book that would mimic Tom's diary in the idea that it responds to Harry to feed him information and teach him magic?

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?
