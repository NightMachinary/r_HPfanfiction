I'm finding fanfictions where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, is maybe a Slytherin King, possibly feared or respected, is Voldemort's equal. Orrrr it can be where Harry joins Voldemort as an ally.

​

Another thing I'm searching for is where Harry is the son (Biologically or kidnapped and blood adopted) of O'Voldy, where Harry is dark and merciless or something, maybe a Dark Prince?

​

One more is where Harry is Lord Azkaban and have Dementors under his control. I love those fics.

​

Anyone have any suggestions? Preferably no time travel. So far I've read, and also the fics I really enjoy and recommend:

​

The Nightmare Man (And the prequels and ongoing sequels)

The Prince of Slytherin

Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor

Easy As Falling

Insane Lord Mortem

Heir of Dracula

The Rise of a Dark Lord (This may be the closest to what I'm searching for right now) <- I love this fic btw

Dark and Light

Darkness is my Ally

Dark Child

Master Demense

Uncrowned Lord Of Azakban

Dark Lord

The Dark Child

Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise

The Long Defeat (This is where Harry is a slave, and has powers to disintegrate any living things. The Malfoys take him in because of a life debt they owe him, and Narcissa seems to be the only one that can talk to Harry civilly. What will happen? Afterall, the Malfoys had to give up their vault to the goblins in exchange for Harry...)

The Bone Man

Inheritance

The Vampire Prince

The Final Confrontation (Tempest Novastorm adopted this one on [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]])

Harry Potter the Dark Pixie
