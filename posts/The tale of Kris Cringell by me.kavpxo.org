Kristoff Cringell was a very talented wizard. He received top marks at Durmstrang Institute and was particularly adept in summoning and maintaining a corporeal reindeer Patronus. Born in 1498, Cringell is thought to have created a Philosopher's Stone, though this has not been confirmed. His Pine and Thestral hair wand is commonly used as evidence for this, as Pine wands are said to choose owners destined for long life.

As a young adult, Cringell inherited his family's estate, along with a large number of House Elves. With their assistance, he became one of the most successful toymakers in the wizarding world. His toys were enchanted to be so lifelike that some nearby Muggles who happened to spot a runaway doll were convinced it was possessed by a demon and promptly smashed it to bits.

Cringell was known for his tradition of leaving toys and sweets outside of wizarding household every Christmas. His trademark red and white robes also became famous. The colors red and white are the colors of alchemy and add to the theory that he created a Philosopher's Stone.

Eventually, Cringell began leaving toys /inside/ wizard houses as well as Muggle ones. He would Apparate into each house in the area and leave magical toys for wizarding children and for the Muggle children toys that were not enchanted at all, except for the very high quality. This was generally not protested by Cringell's neighbors. Cringell moved his headquarters frequently, so as to give toys to as many children as possible, wizard and Muggle alike.

When the International Statute of Secrecy became law, Cringell was ordered to cease all activity in and around Muggle homes. Cringell refused, sending to the Turkish Ministry of Magic (for he lived in Turkey at the time) a letter that said only “/Merry Christmas to/ */all/*.”

Cringell continued his tradition of Yuletide toy distribution, widening his range with a sleigh pulled by eight Thestrals, a magically extended sack for gifts, Floo powder, and homemade Time-Turner. With this arsenal Cringell could cover thousands of houses a night. And he didn't stop there.

Eventually, officials from several Magical Ministries managed to arrest Cringell and he was charged with risking the exposure of the wizarding world. He was not imprisoned due to his widespread adoration and the Ministries' fear of what said fanbase might do if they heard that the jolly and devoted gift-giver had been thrown in jail. The Ministries instead exiled Cringell to an island near the North Pole, which was made unplottable.

The following Christmasses were cold and depressing without Cringell's visits. The wizarding world protested Cringell's exile so adamantly that it was eventually agreed that his restriction to the island (commonly called “Christmas Isle”, not to be confused with Christmas Island) may be lifted every Christmas Eve night.

Cringell continues his gift-giving today, but is restricted to wizarding homes only. However, it is not uncommon for poorer Muggle parents to find more gifts under their trees in the morning than they remember buying.

My timeline and setting are probably off but it's a start. Thought this was the right place to share.


** Very sweet.
