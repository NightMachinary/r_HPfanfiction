I can't remember the title, but the story goes something like this: Harry is a slytherin, friends with Draco, and goes to Professor Quirrell for help with every subject during his first year. He would just barge in to his office and bombard him with questions, and would drag Draco along with him. And I think Harry will become the ward of the Malfoys'. Thanks in advance!


** Is it Boys of Crowhill?Quirell tutors Harry and Harry is sort of a rival/acquaintance of Draco.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has Harry being friends with Draco and Quirrel, although he's Ravenclaw.

Also the most controversial fanfiction after My Immortal.

*** The only (vague) point of similarity to OP's request is "Quirrell is friends with Harry". Everything else about the fic does not fit.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
