** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] -- Up there in my all time favorites. It's old, but definitely worth a read. AU/Time-travel featuring HP/OFC. Harry becomes a special agent involved in the war against Grindelwald. That's all I'm willing to say. linkffn(3155057)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6964352/1/Against-The-Odds][Against The Odds]] -- Full disclaimer, I have not read this in a long time. I remember thinking it was good, but it could have been my young mind playing tricks on me. Harry/Ginny in which Harry is a bodyguard. linkffn(6964352)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/2/Deprived][Deprived]] -- Harry/Fleur with Harry as a bodyguard. It's great, but would be much better if finished. I figure it's abandoned at this point. linkffn(7402590)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255377/1/The-French-Connection][The French Connection]] -- I imagine this was someone's attempt at emulating Deprived. Still, an OK though flawed story. linkffn(9255377)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7524127/1/Unspeakable-Potter][Unspeakable Potter]] -- Guilty pleasure of mine. It'll probably never be finished, but I enjoyed it. linkffn(7524127)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Harry Potter and the Summer of Change]] -- Harry/Tonks in which Harry trains to become an Unspeakable. I dropped off after a while as I felt like the plot dragged out a lot. Could be better for you, though. linkffn(2567419)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11054843/1/Homecoming][Homecoming]] -- Harry/Ginny. He's quite powerful in this one, but not overbearingly so. He's worked for a special unit of the ICW for a couple years, but now works for the British Minister's personal investigative team. There's also a real nice overarching crime/mystery plot that adds a bit of spice to the romance story. linkffn(11054843)

** linkffn(9121877;8180049) pretty great bromance between Harry and Ron in both. In /The King of Limbs/ Harry becomes a magical special agent, and in /Midnight Blues/ he and Ron are mercenaries but do some detective-like work IIRC.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
