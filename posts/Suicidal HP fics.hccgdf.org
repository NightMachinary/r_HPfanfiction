Any links to HP fics about suicide or depression? They can be dark and have the character succeed or have the character get better, I'm not picky. Drug Abuse is also a plus. Send me them gritty fics (or hopeful ones)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13610201/1/7-reasons-why][7 Reasons Why]] by xXSnape.HeadXx

#+begin_quote
  I thought that 13 Reasons Why was a pretty good show. So I made a Harry Potter version to see that if Harry had killed himself, who would he blame? Also, Harry is not in love Cho, he is in love with Ginny. The chapters are what all the tapes would say.

#+begin_quote
  A look at the actions of a main character from the point of view of other characters. When death rocks Hogwarts, you'd be surprised who's affected. Chapter Twelve: Rosemary Sprout tends to her garden, the students - and the other professors

#+begin_quote
  He had always liked water. It fascinated him, the way it could change forms in under a minute, the way it could be shaped and sculpted, frozen and boiled. The way it could disappear without anybody noticing. Now, looking at the Black Lake, he wishes he could sink below the dark, chilly surface and never return. ONE-SHOT

#+begin_quote
  Harry is at the end of his rope; he's no saviour, he's just a frightened and hurting adolescent who has been asked to do too much. The prophecy was the last straw. Can McGonagall do something now? Or is it too late? Trigger Warnings on individual chapters although suicide is a strong theme.

#+begin_quote
  A sister piece to Giving Up; the Boy-Who-Lived broke and the shards of glass of everyone else's life still need to be picked up. Because what is there to be said when so many people failed one boy so very, very badly. Triggers; suicide. T for safety and triggers

** This is one of the greatest fics I have ever read. It starts off pretty light, but it gets into depression and suicide, etc. It's done exceptionally, and I don't think enough people have read it.

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.
