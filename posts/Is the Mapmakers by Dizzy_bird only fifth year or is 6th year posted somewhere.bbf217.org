** I've only posted 5th year so far! I'm 3 chapters away from finishing 6th year, I'll post again once its complete. And it'll be part of the same work :)

** Last I heard (about a month and a half ago), the author was still working on year six. I strongly suspect it'll be posted as part of the same story, given that The Mapmakers is currently marked as incomplete.
