Request inspired by the fic Potter Club: linkffn(11987060)

Are there any other fics where Harry takes a similar outlook on learning/using magic? Having fun with it, playing light-hearted and harmless jokes, and generally trying to bring the /magic/ back into it while making friends along the way?

My preferences:

- No bashing.
- Voldemort can still exist and be a threat, but keep the angst to a minimum.
- I'm a Harry/Ginny shipper at heart, but I'm honestly fine with any ships as long as my first request is kept in mind (id est, don't bash a character just to get them out of the way for the ship).
- No bully!Harry, loner!Harry, or Dark!Harry. That is literally the opposite of what I'm after.
- If it's not completed, I'd at least like it to have been updated within the past 3 months.
- Longer fics preferred.

  Seven years is a long time. Especially when you have to do it twice. You know what you have to do and you think you know how you'll do it, so what can you do in the meantime? Live up your family legacy of course. It's time for a changing of the guard; the Marauders time is over, now it's time for Potter Club to step up

** I mean, if you don't mind it being another character than Harry that's doing it, you will absolutely /love/ linkffn(What's her name in Hufflepuff). It's the best self-insert, and it's really good. It brings accross the wonder and joy of magic, and there is a spell club where they explore magic.

I recommend you give it a shot!

  "Well let's see... If you take into account the phase of the moon and the magical properties of the number 23 and the alchemic process that is used to create the Gringotts coins... I would have to deduce..." She seemed to pause for dramatic effect.

  I leaned forward.

  "That I'm a painting leaning against a wall for the last century or so and you are a dull-whited lubberwort if you thought I would know!" Alice began laugh uproariously. "A strange little girl ghost in trousers... yes yes, it shall liven up the place!"

Okay, I love this fic already, just based on that one. Thanks for the rec.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** I have one and it`s a crossover with Marvel. Harry basically summons Loki to help his escape the Dursleys and from that it escalates to the children in Hogwarts figuring out how to travel in space and eventually move the entire wizard population off planet since the earth was so polluted and technology was making it harder to keep their society hidden. I don't remember the name though....

** There's plenty of light-heartedness and focus on actually learning magic in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Most of the canon challenges were brushed aside pretty easily, but what's left is seven years at a magical school full of magical beings learning magic, which is still good fun.

No ship for Harry, but even more friends than canon. Even the Dursleys have mellowed, partly due to the lack of anything (like rogue house elves and inflated aunts) disrupting their normality. Incomplete but very actively updating; if you check the SpaceBattles forum thread, there's a new segment every day or two. They get aggregated into FFN chapters periodically.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
