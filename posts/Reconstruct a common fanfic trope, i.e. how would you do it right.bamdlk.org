'Reconstruction' refers to deconstructing, i.e. tearing apart, a trope and then 'fixing' it to be better.

For example, if it is possible, how would you write an improved version of "Weasleys trying to steal Harry's money"? What about the goblins as allies?


** The "good Slytherin".

Instead of whitewashing the entire house or having that one token good character (eg Daphne), show us some Slytherins who use their traits to do good. Baiting Snatchers, ambushing Death Eaters, giving them false intel, all kinds of underhand warfare.

*** I've only ever read one fanfic where the Slytherins start reading books about socialism, revolution, etc. They join the other houses against Umbridge not out of the goodness and purity of their hearts, but because political revolution povides a quicker (and more or less safer) entry into politics than kissing Voldemort's robes ever could. It was so well done, I've been thirsting for more Hogwarts fanfics with socalist Slytherins.

#+begin_quote
  With Umbridge as Headmistress, everything should have been fine in Slytherin. More than fine.

  It was not. The Slytherins were waking. At last they had found a purpose. They didn't ambition power, though. It was much simpler. Draco merely wanted an answer.

  The question was: Why? Why are we doing this? Who said this was good, that this was the thing to want? Why are we playing along and dancing to their tune?

  This is a very dangerous question to ask.

  It should have ended with two or three Slytherins in detention for disruptive behaviour and nothing else. Few people in Slytherin understood what Draco was talking about (it wasn't difficult, but the explanation was lengthy, or maybe it was difficult. Draco was pretty smart, after all). Regardless, no one outside their house was going to pay attention to them. Merlin, they had joined the Inquisitorial Squad, hadn't they? Who would listen? Yet Draco now saw the stupid badge for what it was, another false prize, another chain to keep them in place. /I have something that you don't so I will fight to hold on to it and you will fight to take it from me and we will not look at the person who gave me the stupid meaningless badge./

  But if it is meaningless, then you don't have to fight for it. You don't have to do any of those things you didn't want to do to begin with but that you were thinking of doing because it is expected and because you are supposed to want the prize. If the goal is meaningless then you don't have to go down the established path. You can choose.

  Most Slytherins had a very narrow path already established for them. This idea of choosing resonated with them. It resonated with Draco, who felt as if he had a porcelain corset constricting his chest, a corset that was now developing cracks at the thought that maybe parents weren't always right. Maybe disappointing them wasn't so terrible, if they were putting value in the wrong things.

  Maybe Draco wasn't a bad son.

  What a thought to have.

  “House pride means nothing!” explained Draco in very loud whispers while he repeatedly hit the Slytherin badge in his robes. “All I'm saying is that the house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights.”

  Crabbe and Goyle were completely lost, but Zabini and Nott were listening and nodding their heads.

  “They are forcing us to compete to destroy any semblance of solidarity, all so they can exercise power unchallenged” Draco went on.

  “I told you to keep quiet during study hour, Mr. Malfoy. Ten points from Slytherin” said professor Willington as he walked down the tables of the Great Hall.

  It should have ended there. Nothing more than a murmur between a few students. But then Draco abandoned the language of his readings and said something easy to understand and memorize.

  “But that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!” Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! “The point system is a lie!”

  Which even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs could comprehend. The points meant nothing. They didn't even hand out a special gift to the house that earned the House Cup at the end of the year. Hurray, you won, you are better, look at his cup behind the glass. That was it. It was just a system to enforce discipline and avoid unionizing by turning the +working class+ students against each other and stopping them from confronting the teachers.

Marriage law fics are lowkey my biggest guilty pleasure and it just doesn't need to be that way ya know?? i listen to the Stuff You Missed in History Class podcast and they did an episode on the Les Filles du Roi a while ago, which was a french program to help populate the french Canada territories and promote growing families in the new world.

Basically the french government found suitable single young women who were usually too poor or orphans or otherwise undesirable as a marriage candidate, and paid for their passage to Canada and gave them a dowry and wedding trousseau to be prepared for married life, and they would live together in boarding houses until they found a husband. I'm just saying, this is an excellent Bill/Fleur AU and I know some creative person out there can make just about any pairing work with it, and that's just one historical example.

** I'm going to avoid the Weasley one and instead focus on the goblin allies.

To me it seems like most writers say to themselves, "Harry should team up with goblins. Lets make that happen quick." We then get a quick, well he was polite to them so there setup.

First, Harry should be the one to seek them out because of something Voldemort did or has. Maybe the goblins will cancel out the werewolves, or they are particularly capable against giants. After we ID why Harry needs them as allies, we need to get them as allies. Well, the goblins have no love for Voldemort, but they'll need certain assurances from Harry. So now he has to do something dangerous for him and good for the goblins. After that happens, they still want more. They'll want a place at a table during and after the war. They'll want power and Harry is the one to give it to them. This sets up a reason for them to participate, a reason for Harry to seek them out, and will have real/lasting consequences.

Marriage Contracts. Can be fun, but are mostly not. How would I make them better? I, personally wouldn't. R-dude wrote Contractual Invalidation linkffn(11697407) which did a phenomenal job at making the marriage contract better.

Soul Bonds. I honestly stared at my screen for 5 minutes wracking my brain. The best I could think up was make them less prevalent in the story? Or perhaps do one of those Harry has a soul bond with someone that he dislikes, but over time warms up to. We could even do one of those stronger together/power of friendship things and that was the 'power he knows not'. Where did soul bonds even come from?

I mean it starts rather nicely (the scene with Sirius in Privet Drive is lovely), but then it turns really really weird.

** Soul bonds? Soul bonds just naturally occur anytime two wizards or witches become close enough, and help them get along better. They form and break naturally, and can occur at different levels. Having one with someone is a good sign you're compatible, but it doesn't force either party into anything.

Goblins as allies? Sure. They're not super-powerful, just different, they want quite a bit in return, and are generally difficult to work with due to cultural differences. Oh, and allying with them alienates basically everyone else. Add to that a whole lot of unforeseen consequences, and it could work.

Weasely's trying to steal Harry's money? Make it part of a larger conspiracy that the Weasely's are actually /part of./ If you want evil Weaselys, go all-in. Maybe Arthur is actually high-up in a secret society that creates and destroys dark lords for their own ends and Molly is literally some sort of demon that tailors her appearance and behavior so she can best manipulate him. Hell, just scrap the whole manipulative Dumbledore for this, have Arthur as the master manipulator, and Molly pulling his strings. Further, they're after Harry's heirlooms or family grimoires or something not his money.

Dramione? Set it in the 2030-2040s after Astoria died, kill off Ron, and have Hermione be jaded and visibly aged by a harrowing career as Minister for Magic, and Draco's gotten over his blood purity. The two of them are both bitter, angry people who want to change the magical world for the better. They do. Maybe they become the new Dark Couple, or maybe they do it in some nice, legal way. The point is, the romance is presented as a side-plot.

[main character] + Bellatrix or [main character] + Voldemort ships? First off, fix up the age difference issue with some time travel. /Forward/ time travel, so you avoid having to make an entire Hogwarts class full of OC's. Drag the not-that-evil-yet, young, alternate timeline Tom or Bella from their fifth year into Umbridge-era Hogwarts and see how the mysterious 'Richard Smith' or new Hermione's new rival 'Carina White' deal with that situation. They wind up motivating one of the trio by being their (relatively friendly) rival, and they keep trying to one-up each other, and eventually, that turns into a sort of friendship, and then later into a romantic relationship. For more interest, drag a couple more characters from their era along with them. Maybe Tom and Minerva, or Bellatrix and somebody else from the '60s.

Time travel fix-fics? Go all-in. The main character is sent back in time, and as a result already knows who to trust and how to convince them. Have them /actually do that./ If there's really nobody who can be trusted, even after some convincing, there isn't much point to the time travel in the first place. On top of that, you're already changing the timeline. So do that. Change the timeline. Go all-in, and full-crazy. The more over-the-top the better. Have them, I don't know, steal the Philosopher's Stone and crush the Death Eaters under inexhaustible homunculus armies and a supply of gold limited only by their ability to obtain base metals?

Arthur can be a total master manipulator, who fools everyone by using self-deprecating humors. If you can look past his "rubber duck" or misspelling "electricity" moments, which might be his acts after all, his canon achievements are actually quite remarkable:

- He raised 7 powerful and competent children, despite meager economic resources.
- He managed to pass the Muggle Protection Act against significant opposition in the Wizengamot, and despite himself ranking not high on Ministry hierarchy.
- He, in his spare time, managed to charm a flying invisible car, who also had developed its own sentience.
- He and Molly actively ENCOURAGED his children to befriend Harry and Hermione, after they displayed significant potentials. (my headcanon)
- Although Molly was loud and domineering, he seemed to be in control of ALL major family decisions.
- He and Bill could both cast the Fidelius Charm with ease.
- He fought in the Final Battle and didn't seem to have been injured at all.
- In the end, Weasleys had suffered the fewest losses relatively, while most other major families were pretty much decimated. They further brought the two stars of the next generation into the family, and built an alliance with the French powerhouse Delacours. He actually got Harry's money (at least partly) without ever going through clumsy theft attempts in those bash fics.

  Dramione? Set it in the 2030-2040s after Astoria died, kill off Ron, and have Hermione be jaded and visibly aged by a harrowing career as Minister for Magic, and Draco's gotten over his blood purity. The two of them are both bitter, angry people who want to change the magical world for the better.

That's also my take on a plausible Dramione pairing in canon universe. But instead of an angry and bitter Hermione, a powerful, but an unhappy and lonely Hermione works out even better.

  Time travel fix-fics? Go all-in. The main character is sent back in time, and as a result already knows who to trust and how to convince them. Have them actually do that. If there's really nobody who can be trusted, even after some convincing, there isn't much point to the time travel in the first place. On top of that, you're already changing the timeline. So do that. Change the timeline. Go all-in, and full-crazy. The more over-the-top the better. Have them, I don't know, steal the Philosopher's Stone and crush the Death Eaters under inexhaustible homunculus armies and a supply of gold limited only by their ability to obtain base metals?
#+end_quote

Rehashing the timeline is one of my biggest gripes in those fics. If Dumbledore can be trusted, the plot should be resolved within two weeks of the time traveler's arrival:

- Let Dumbledore and Snape in their plans right from the start. Try to capture Voldemort, force him to spill all his secrets, obliviate him back to infancy, douse him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.
- Capture Wormtail and free Sirius Black
- Buy a few Goblin made weapons, open the Chamber, use Harry's Parselmouth ability to control the Basilisk, and imbue those weapons with its venom. There's no need for Gryffindor's Sword.
- Send anonymous tip about Barty Jr to Amelia Bones, that should get Jr kissed and Sr locked up forever in Azkaban (as payback for Sirius)
- Having established credibility with the Barty Jr tip, send another one about Lucius's secret stash under his drawing room. That should net them the Diary and Lucy's extended vacation with dementors. Force Narcissa to sell out Lucius for Draco's sake, and confiscate significant amount of Malfoy assets.
- Next, Dumbledore works a little politics to have Lestranges compensate Longbottoms. That would get them the Cup.
- With most Horcruxes and Lucius gone, they now have some time to enjoy Hogwarts a little bit and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- Harry, Sirius, Andromeda, and Longbottoms should control large amount of resources by now and would influence Fudge to behave better. Getting rid of Umbridge should also be easy, or if they were more pragmatic, use her as their 'attack dog'.
- They could further invest their money in tech stocks just to maximize future returns.
- Speaking of the Shack, just burn it down with Fiendfyre or use enough Goblin curse breakers.

**** The thing about love potion Ginny is that it actually makes sense. JK Rowling first introduces love potions as something Fred and George sell(I'm pretty sure these were fake). Then, in a potions class, Slughorn has an entire jar full of Amortentia. Harry develops a “crush” on Ginny(a monster in his chest? That sounds suspicious). Romilda Vane somehow gets Amortentia and accidentally drugs Ron. We also see that Molly used a love potion to get Arthur to notice her(a monster in his chest?). So, as Amortentia is probably restricted, due to it literally letting you rape someone with how obsessed they become, how did Romilda get any? Either a family member gave it to her, or she stole it from Slughorn like how Malfoy stole the Polyjuice. I'm going with stealing. What's to stop Ginny from doing the same, but actually succeeding since she's already close(ish) to Harry? Seriously, jealousy does not feel like a monster in your chest.

- Fred and George love potion are not fake, it would be a pretty bad business model to sell fake love potion as love potion, also would not explain why Hermione is so displeased by the fact they manage to smuggle it into Hogwarts. But I do think weaker love potion are easy to buy and they just propose it because it brings some money and everyone else do it.

- Harry "monster in his chest" happens during the summer, before the introduction of all the potions. While it is suspicious (and a loooooot of people used the "Weasley drug Harry" plot), probably more due to Rowling being bad at romance.\\
- Romilda tried to give Harry "a love potion". We don't know if it's Amorentia, and personally I'm pretty sure it's not. Not only Amorentia is the most potent love potion (there are other that, while weaker, are more availiable) but is pretty distinctive with the whole "odor of loved things".\\
- She didn't need to steal it. Fred and George have a owl service and sell Love potion, she could just buy it. Even if she didn't buy it from them, I doubt they are the only shop in Brittain that managed to smuggle things under the Squib nose.

***** Didn't Harry notice that he was attracted to her before they got to Hogwarts that year? I could see it working the same way it did for Molly and Arthur. Using it to build on an established attraction, or using it to establish attraction before truncating it. Tom didn't have that same attraction, so despite Merope acting as the perfect wife, he still threw her away.

So I think it could be a great plot point, but not such a betrayal of trust that Harry would turn into a dark lord over it.

Also, why would Harry still pine for Ginny (finding her name on the map) during his time spent in the forests? Surely that would've been enough time for the potion's effect to wear off (Love potions aren't indefinite, right. Ron's crush on Romilda eventually wears off)?

***** I think you really just touched on one of the main themes of HBP there and why these things came togther. Amortentia and love potions aren't real love, Merope manipulated Tom Riddle, Romilda tried to do so with Harry. But Ginny and Harry, Ron and Hermione, Tonks and Lupin, Bill and Fleur are meant to contrast and play with real love and how it can present. So it's not an accident that Harry falls in love with Ginny when we see love potions taking such a role, but it's obviously not intended as such because Ginny love potioned Harry.

Elsewise we see that this is clearly not the case as Harry does smell Ginny's scent in the Amortentia (As Hermione smells Ron). He also spends the summer getting to know her and when he's on the train he's dissapointed when she leaves him.

Molly never used a love potion on Arthur that's fanon. She tells Ginny and Hermione about trying to make one but we don't even know if she was successful and it's not linked to Arthur. Fred and George's love potions were real, but not on the same level as Amortentia, probably mostly innocent infatuation. But as Harry left it in his room for so long the love potion grew stronger because it was essentially out of date. That's why it had the effect it had, Romilda did not steal Amortentia which is whole other realm of love potion.

I imagine being labeled as blood traitor could mean they actually sided with the mundane like some MI 6 or sorts. Or just go with the Illuminati that aims for a new world order by shadowy means.. It is stated in the wiki, that Malfoy cursed a British Queen and that Malfoy and Weasley has bad blood. Every Weasley is named after a Monarch or knight. So they could be a family that takes in magical Monarch and the crown takes in squibs.

I have a fanfic idea percolating in my head where the battle of Hogwarts was won but with much higher casualties and consequences (so far so cliche). On the Halloween night in 1998 7 characters send their memories back 7 years, 7 months, etc to the past. Because 7 is a powerful magical number. They don't tell Dumbledore everything as soon as they've arrived because some of their plans are a bit more ruthless than he'd approve of. Neville uses mandrakes to attempt to assassinate Bellatrix and other Death Eaters in Azkaban, Ron "accidentally" exposes Wormtail as an animagus at a convenient time getting Sirius freed much earlier and legally this time, Draco (with Dobby's help) gets his father's secret room raided by the Ministry while he and some Death Eater friends are in it, Luna encourages Xenophilius to launch an expose series on Gilderoy Lockhart's lies, and to start exposing and attacking corruption (Sirius' wrongful imprisonment, discriminatory Ministry laws etc) instead of focusing on magical cryptids nobody believes in, etc. They do tip Dumbledore off by anonymously sending him the diary (and telling him about the diadem) much earlier than he encountered it in canon. The source of tension I plan for the story is that once they've changed events enough, they gradually start losing most of these future memories because that future stops existing. So by the time Hogwarts term starts, these characters are more or less normal children. They feel a connection to each other, like they knew each other in a past life (more accurately future life), they each have an affinity for certain spells or subjects but it's nothing like how overpowered they were with their adult selves' memories. Like, the academic knowledge has faded, but the intuition for how certain difficult bits of magic work still remains. Hermione may have made a magically encrypted book with important knowledge preserved in it as a plot device.

Edit: So a rough outline of my ideas so far -

The kids do better at school partially due to future influence and partially because there are whole years where no school disrupting mysteries happen, the catalysts for the mysteries of books 2 and 3 are removed, Lucius and other pureblood bigots political power is reduced, the Quibbler helps keep the Ministry on its toes by quibbling over its legislation and actions, Dumbledore has more free time to research the horcruxes that he's found earlier. Because of these facts (more free time, Harry displays promise, less interference from Board) Dumbledore actually gives him special lessons in useful skills (like Occlumency). So the heroes have more tools and advantages on their side, and their potential victory doesn't seem like such an asspull.

On the villains side, Voldemort still returns at the end of 4th year, although maybe through different circumstances. He is still extremely powerful, and despite loss of followers retains Rookwood, a senior Unspeakable, and Bellatrix, a powerful dueler, at his side as his main lieutenants (3 being another magical number and a dark reflection of the Golden Trio). With less sway in the Wizengamot and the Ministry less inclined to be convenient idiots, Voldemort launches a guerilla campaign against the heroes instead of the Ministry takeover in canon. With this lessened power base, he can actually be written as intelligent, without the silly mistakes he makes in canon in order for Harry and friends to survive. Rookwood uses dark curses and weird magic that nobody knows how to counter. Bellatrix attacks and kills certain people, causing terror and grief in her wake.

** Harry left in an orphanage.

Which I'm actually sort of noodling around with.

First off, Vernon doesn't leave Harry at an orphanage because they no longer exist. Harry is left at a police station/fire station/hospital but without the letter that comes with him. Appeals to the public are made but nobody comes forward so Harry (who unfortunately would end up with a different name) goes into the foster care system.

Ten years later he's happily living with his adopted family (shockingly, Death Eaters haven't been able to find him since he's not named Harry Potter and nobody in the Wizarding World really knew what he looked like apart from the scar), he's just finished Year 5 at his primary school (his age was guesstimated as a couple of months younger than he actually is, making him one of the oldest students in a Year 5 class instead of one of the youngest in a Year 6 class) when he gets a letter addressed to 'Mr Harry Potter'. He and his parents assume it's simply a wrong address, so it's sent back with 'no such person known at this address' on it. But then more appear, beginning to come from places that aren't the postman and his parents are actually quite annoyed about the whole thing.

Finally , on July 31st, Hagrid arrives, only to be baffled when Harry's parents say that there is no such person as Harry Potter at that address and that no they are not Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Hagrid goes away and McGonagall and Dumbledore turn up instead.

What follows is a revelation for everybody. Harry finds out he's actually two months older than he thought he was and that his parents didn't abandon him, they died saving his life. His adoptive parents find out that their son is named Harry Potter, magic exists and that Dumbledore wants to remove Harry from their care. Dumbledore and McGonagall find out that the Dursleys didn't take Harry in and instead abandoned him. His parents are adamant they are not giving up their kid and that he is their kid.

Basically Harry explores the magical world and deals with the identity crisis that comes from discovering he had a different name, parents and birthday which the wizarding world seems utterly obsessed by while he's still pretty sure he's 'whatever his fake name was'. Also, Philosopher's Stone in the context of McGonagall and Dumbledore being much more aware of Harry and Harry being more likely to trust adults.

It's still a very vague idea at the moment, but I'm mildly tired of orphanages.

Just to give you accurate notions for the time and country, that would be the end of third year primary, rather than, as in canon, the end of fourth year primary. 'Year one, Year two' is a 21st century way of referring to school years in England (not sure how the rest of the UK do things).

'Bog standard' school ages in Surrey in 1981-1991:

Nursery (optional) Age four on September 1st.\\
Infants. Age five or six on September 1st. Two years lumped in together.

First Year Primary. Age seven on September 1st.\\
Second Year Primary. Age eight on September 1st.\\
Third Year Primary. Age nine on September 1st.\\
Fourth Year Primary. Age ten on September 1st.

First Year Secondary. Age eleven on September 1st.\\
Second Year Secondary... and so on.

Private and public schools have and had different systems (for example, Eton, where Justin Finch-Fletchley was put down for, starts age 13), but for the grammar-school-or-comprehensive system those were standard in England in the 1980s and 1990s.

BTW, I wholeheartedly support your story idea, it sounds great.

Turns out that Harry is the BWL, and the story is from his POV. Throughout the story, Harry suspects that something is amiss, but most people ignore him (and even he doubts himself, and thinks that of course his brother is not doing anything wrong behind their backs).

His brother betrays the family at the end, and Harry is kind of forced to kill him (possibly because his brother was threatening their parents, or something like that).

******* Have you ever met a real, pure racist bigot? I have had the misfortune to know more than a few. And they don't think like that sadly, they believe someone like Hermione is an exception, an aberration. That she probably cheated, that she's a special case or she has someone that is helping her. They don't reevaluate their life over it:

  “Though if his grades don't pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for ---”

  “It's not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger ---”

  “I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.
#+end_quote

It's ultimately a small hiccup. It's not earth shattering for them, earth shattering for them is discovering that their best friend is actually a muggleborn or their entire family history is a lie.

To be realstic in my opinion, Malfoy needs to have his whole entire world turned upside down. Elsewise he would not just sit back.

  he starts to question pureblood supremacy because Hermione outscored them.
#+end_quote

"Her parents are not the Grangers. She's actually a pureblood"

"She's one of the good ones/The exception that proves the rule"

"Dumbledore/The teachers are helping her to put us Purebloods behind"

I doubt Draco would go: "You know what, maybe this thing I've believed in my whole life is not quite real"

**** No, but he might go "What the fuck? What is being played here?" followed by keeping an eye on Hermione and realising over the next few years how things really are.

****** I am not expecting that to work in real life. I am trying to come up with a way you could explain Malfoy no longer being a bigot before there is too much water under the bridge.

** I don't mind the soulmate trope by definition. What I do mind is when it overrides free will and romance has to happen "because fate says so". This is how I'd create the trope myself:

Soulmates does not have additional feelings for each other because of the soulbond alone, but rather, their magic when combined together can do extraordinary things. The combination of their magic being stronger than the individual parts, or strong enough intent being capable of violating normal rules of how magic works. Perhaps romance is more common than picking 2 random people in general, but this stems more from myths about soulbonds rather than a direct result of the bond itself. Another idea I've pondered is the idea of someone in a soulmate bond /assuming/ romance is fated to happen because of it, but ends up being burned by this belief in some way (either by the other part simply not reciprocating, or just the one assuming doing something stupid to lose the chance they did have -- I've once considered writing an oneshot where something causes Snape to rant about how soulmates does NOT gurantee romance in a setup like this -- apparently he thought so as well in his youth, having Lily be his soulmate, and this very assumption and taking her for granted ultimately lead to him making the decisions he did in canon causing him to lose her friendship and any possible chance at romance he might have had).

Examples of the above kind of soulbond I had in mind are Albus & Gellert and Fred & George -- both accomplished extraordinary magic together, but (at least in the latter case) didn't even consider the idea of romance.

** Soul bonds are kind of like complimenting magic.

Like Naruto and Sasuke, even when they don't like each other, they are still amzing when teaming up.

** I'm noodling around on a soul bond fic where a soul bond and the Horcrux in Harry are tangled together, affecting both of them. The soul bond destabilizes the Horcrux, and the Horcrux is preventing the soul bond from fully forming, leading to both the possibility that actively trying to strengthen the soul bond could force the Horcrux out of Harry and the possibility that the Horcrux might have damaged the soul bond so that it can never fully form. (Also, that Voldemort might be able to tell there is a soul bond, and thus have a prime target to use to hurt Harry.)
