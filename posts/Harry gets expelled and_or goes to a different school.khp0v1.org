Basically like the title says. Can anyone rec any fics where Harry ends up going to a different school, either because he decides to leave Hogwarts or he does end up getting expelled in 5th year and decides to enroll somewhere else?

Fics where he decides to leave England to travel and learn magic on his own would be cool too.

Any ships are okay (het or slash) but I'd prefer if romance is not the big focus of the story.


** Best different school fic is definitely [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A Second Chance at life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Gen. Complete but has an unfinished sequel. FFNet.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Dumbledore doesn't make it in time for Harry's trial, and the outcome is very different. Harry is expelled, his wand snapped.But he refuses to give up. And he is done waiting around for Albus Dumbledore to give him information.Deciding to take his life into his own hands, Harry asks for training from several Order members, preparing himself to fight Voldemort while the whole wizarding world believes he's helpless and back in the muggle world. Meanwhile, his friends are at Hogwarts, tackling their own problems in the form of Dolores Umbridge. Harry hadn't expected the separation to be so difficult - or for a certain mischievous redhead to make the waiting game they'd entered into so very excruciating. He might have lost his home in Hogwarts, but with Sirius and Remus around, Harry begins to learn that rebuilding a family isn't as hard as he'd anticipated.
