Alright, so I can remember a lot of details about this fic but I can't remember the title and I'm hoping some of y'all can help me out.

Harry gives Hermione a necklace that is from the Potter family. Something happens and she gets sent back in time to before the Marauders start at Hogwarts. She's de-aged and told that her scars from the war will come back when it lines up with her timeline.

The Potters end up adopting her and she poses as James' twin sister and eventually it's Sirius/Hermione.

If memory serves, she ends up back in the present.


** I think I know the one you are talking about. I think its called the debt of time.
