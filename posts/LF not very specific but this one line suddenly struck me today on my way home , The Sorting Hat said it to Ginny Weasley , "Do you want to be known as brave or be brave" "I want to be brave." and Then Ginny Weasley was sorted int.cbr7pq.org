#+TITLE: LF: not very specific but this one line suddenly struck me today on my way home , The Sorting Hat said it to Ginny Weasley , "Do you want to be known as brave or be brave?" "I want to be brave." and Then Ginny Weasley was sorted into Slytherin.

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty sure it was A one shot and if it wasn't then it was probably a quick overview and possible character study of her 7 years of Hogwarts. I'm sorry but I literally font remember anything else besides maybe Ron being a part to her about it.

Hope y'all can help me!


** That is definitely Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. Which is about as far from a oneshot or quick overview as you can get in this world.

**** I think you were confusing two fics together, because I remember reading a Ginny fic with those two premises, but not with the conversation with the Hat
