I know there is a (unfinished) merge with avatar, in which Hogwarts is a school for all benders, but are there other good merges or hp with different magic? I would love a wheel of time merge, in which the HP verse is just a turn on the wheel. Maybe dark magic is the true power and because the dark one is imprisoned in an imperfect way people can still access it. At eleven you don't get a wand but maybe a ter'angreal.


** Several that merge with the Nasuverse (Fate-Stay Night essentially), but I can't be more specific.

I /think/ there are several Worm and Dresden Files crossovers. For the Dresden files, the obvious answer is The Denarian Renegade linkffn(The Denarian Renegade by Shezza). For Worm, you should probably check out Darth Marrs fic The Simurgh's Son linkffn(The Simurgh's Son).

Also, there are a lot of Star Wars crossovers that have something like a merging between the force and magic, but that varies from fic to fic.

*** I watched one or two seasons of the fate universe but I just couldn't get into the concept of summoned heroes. Denarian Renegade is great, it was one of the first fics I read. And I sadly just hate superheroes. I know worm is popular and I miss much. But superheroes are just dumb in my opinion. Yes I already read some like the havoc side of the force, but many swff are just bad

**** I love the worldbuilding of Fate but I hate how it all seems focused on this single tournament in the space of a few square miles >_< I couldn't get into it either, but I love reading crossovers that take advantage of the world (without focusing on the Holy Grail).

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
