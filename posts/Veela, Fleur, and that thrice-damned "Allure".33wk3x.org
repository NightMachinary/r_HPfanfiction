Let's talk about Veela. They're first introduced in GoF as the Bulgarian mascots (/Bulgarian/, not French!) and it's clear that they have a certain ability to inflame the passions of men/people attracted to women.

But how does this power work? As I see it, there are two possibilities:

1. Indirect action. The powers of the Veela alter the Veela themselves, making them supernaturally attractive. Men can act stupidly around naturally attractive women; they act proportionally more stupid around supernaturally attractive women. But this is just the natural reaction of men to supernatural beauty, there's no direct mental manipulation of the men involved.

2. Direct action. The Veela don't increase their own beauty, but rather directly manipulate the minds of men, making them react unnaturally.

Fanon generally goes with the latter, calls it allure and treats it like a kind of field that is emitted by the Veela which makes people go gaga for them. This does not seem to be supported by the books.

Let's consider the evidence:

- Mr Weasley plugs his ears before the Veela start to sing and dance.

- When the Veela start to sing and dance, Harry's mind "goes blank" and he starts wanting to do stupid things to impress the Veela.

- The referee of the match acts stupidly until a official runs to him with his fingers in his ears and kicks him.

- Even when they're not singing, Veela are described as incredibly beautiful.

- Even when they're not singing, people say stupid things to impress the Veela, but not all people.

From this evidence, I think we can say that Veela have *two separate powers*:

- Unnatural beauty. The main, passive, power of the Veela is indirect: they're supernaturally beautiful, and some men just act stupidly around that level of beauty.

- Enchantment. The Veela are capable of casting a spell via singing and dancing, which actively manipulates minds of men to be obsessed with impressing them.

- There's also stuff about fire and turning into birds, but that's not relevant right now.

So the fanon idea of an "allure" that Veela can just switch on like flicking a mental button is false. The fanon "allure" does exist, but it's maintained by singing and dancing. Otherwise, Veela are just so attractive that some people, but not everyone, acts stupidly around them. There's no "minds going blank" mental manipulation from their mere presence, it's just normal male bravado.

(Consider how Harry fell victim to the singing and dancing, but not to the mere presence of a Veela, whereas Ron fell victim to both. That further indicates that the powers are separate.)

So what about Fleur?

- She's very beautiful

- Her grandmother was a Veela

- Harry describes her as part-Veela

- People sometimes act like idiots around her

- No "minds going blank" feeling ever happens around her.

All of this supports the idea that Fleur has the passive power of the Veela, or at least some part of it. She's not just a very pretty girl, she's supernaturally beautiful, enough to make people act stupidly around her. But she's not using the Veela singing and dancing enchantment. Fleur does *not* use the "Veela allure".

Whether or not Fleur is capable of enchanting people by singing and dancing is unknown, as we've never seen her sing or dance. She doesn't seem to be able to turn into a bird and throw fire, so the mere fact that she's inherited one power does not mean she's got them all.

There remains one final issue, which is that Harry refers to Fleur "turning on the old charm" to try to seduce Cedric Diggory, Ron getting caught in the crossfire.

But "charm" has a regular, non-magical meaning as well as a magical meaning. When Ron gives Harry a book entitled "how to charm witches" in DH, one assumes that the book isn't about how to use magic to rape people. It's using the word "charm" in its more regular use i.e. to act in a charming way.

This could perfectly well be the case with Fleur and Cedric: Fleur is fluttering her eyelashes, giggling at his jokes, playing with her hair, wearing provocative clothing, etc. She's not charming Cedric with magic, she's charming him with herself.

But of course, you could marry the two. The Veela enchantment seems to be particularly linked to voice, given the way that plugging your ears was a moderately effective defence against it. So Fleur giggling and so on could carry some small amount of the Veela enchantment.

But the jury remains out on whether she has the active power of Veela enchantment, in addition to her supernatural beauty.

Now go forth and never write the word "allure" again.


** This is an excellent analysis. Thank you for taking the time to put it together.

I think it's important to make a distinction between beauty and attraction. Beauty is generally not something that is arrived at on an individual level. It is instead a cultural phenomenon arrived at by mass consensus. [E.G. We have actors and actresses on the tele and in films to show us what is considered beautiful.] In contrast, an individual /can/ be attracted to a person for personifying/embodying the cultural traits consistent with a beautiful image /or another ideal that has nothing to do with the cultural standard of beauty/. Another important distinction of attraction from beauty is that attraction is far more variable.

I think this can help explain why Harry - despite knowing that Fleur is considered beautiful - does not act on any feelings of attraction towards her. The simplest explanation is that he never had those feelings to begin with, whereas Bill Weasley - and to an extent Ron - certainly did.

The example you bring up of Harry being able to shake off the effects of merely being in the presence of a Veela is important as it illustrates another point of cognitive dissonance in the series. In the same book, Harry is able to throw off the effects of "Moody's" Imperius Curse rather quickly. How then is he so pathetic when it comes to learning Occlumency?

I think you're going to be fighting an uphill battle on this one. Fanon seems to be in agreement that the faulty example you alluded to earlier is the correct one. In any case, thanks again for the great post.

Occlumency isn't really about strength of will, it's about self-discipline, and in particular mental self-discipline. It's the ability to control your own thoughts such that you only think about the things you want to think about, and you're able to shut down thoughts and emotions that you don't want to think/feel.

That's very much against Harry's character. He does everything on instinct, often in a reflex action without much thought. He's plain speaking, and doesn't attempt to hide the way he feels from the world. If he thinks someone is wrong, he'll tell them. If he's angry, he'll shout.

Occlumency is effectively the art of being two faced, not just in action but also in thought. There's no wonder Harry struggles with it.

For me the greater dissonance is Harry's struggle with non-verbal magic, which /is/ said to be a matter of strength of will.

Re: beauty and attraction, I think we should be careful on this point, because the HP magic system blurs the objective and the subjective.

I could explain this in an abstract way, but instead I'll quote Newcomb, who has a habit of putting this stuff far more eloquently than I do:

#+begin_quote
  "Symbols have magical weight," continued Dumbledore. "Love, bravery, despair -- for Muggles, these exist only inside themselves. They are subjective. A man stops a robbery and is rewarded -- some see bravery, some see folly, some see opportunism. Each has their own perspective, to interpret as they choose. But for us, bravery is real. The Sword of Gryffindor must be taken under conditions of bravery. It cannot be tricked, it cannot be subverted, and it is not open to interpretation."

  Dumbledore waved his wand again, and the castle fell in on itself, the towers collapsed, and the sand was simply sand again. "Understanding the magically symbolic is the first step on the road to being able to make use of it. And all powerful magic is rooted in symbolism." He stood up, brushing the sand off his legs. "Of course, such understanding is useless without a thorough and comprehensive grounding in magical theory." He chuckled. "Sooner or later, we must all do our homework."
#+end_quote

Also consider: transfiguration has precedence over the physical laws of matter, and yet the human concept of "food" forms a part of the rules of transfiguration. A human concept therefore features in the fundamental rules of the universe which pre-date humanity by billions of years.

In the HP world, human subjectivity is magically objective. Ideas have power, not by virtue of people thinking them, but because they exist themselves.

So we have to be careful in explanations which start with the idea that beauty is subjective. In the magical world, it may well be that beauty is an objective concept.

Agreed, if only for the fact that the magical world - if it truly is as small and insular as JKR has intimated in the past - would likely have far different standards than what we would perceive as 'normal.'

Ah, but in GoF chapter five Mrs. Weasley made a creamy sauce emerge from her wand tip. I understand the last minute restriction JKR had to put on conjuring food in order to add some tension to DH, but it was an inconsistently written distinction throughout the series. In any case, I understand the point you're making and agree with you.

I'm unfamiliar with Newcomb. Is that an author and if so, can you provide a link?

***** Perhaps she was summoning it from somewhere else? Like she had a pot of it and she was able to "apparate" it in a sense through the wand? It does make me wonder how often she cleans her wand, though. It's not exactly sterile. :/

They provided a viable alternate explanation, but it's far from definitive. I'm all for challenging established fanon, but there just isn't enough canon evidence to make any solid conclusions. Just because Veela mentally affect people by singing and dancing in canon does not necessarily imply that that's the only way they can do so. Given just /how/ stupid men act around Veela, I'm a bit dubious of the idea that it's just because they're supernaturally attractive. Attractiveness has an upper bound, it's really not possible to be so physically attractive that everyone around you turns into a slack-jawed idiot.

** Great analysis and you raise some very good points!

However I think it is worth pointing out that just because they enchanted all the men by singing and dancing at the World Cup doest not mean the 'allure' is inherently tied to singing and dancing. The intentional enchantment occurring at the same time as they were singing and dancing does not mean they could not active it without singing and dancing.

Yes the point about plugging ones hears to prevent the enchantment does suggest a vocal element to the 'allure'. However as you mentioned this does not necessarily mean they have to be singing. If the allure is tied vocals, then why could they not active it while talking if they wanted to? Hence since in most of Fannon when a veela is using the 'allure' there is also some dialogue, one could argue that it is simply being transmitted via voice and the characters don't realize and think its an aura thing.

** This is slightly annoying. But there are other things I find annoying me more. Like nicknames straight from [[/r/im14andthisisfunny]]. Moldyshorts, Fumbledore, Gred and Forge (usually resurrected 4-6 years after it was the punchline to one joke). Then the cliches. Goblins will follow you into hell if you remember their name. Even if the author is treating Ron well compared to other stories, he's a douchebag to the bone instead of occasionally hot-headed and stubborn. You can't let Dumbledore solve all your problems for you! You're your own man. Let's see if Hermione can help with that. Occlumency? Pft, mastered it in a weekend. Also, we've had one, yes. But what about second revelation that your parents left you a fuckton of money? Is 20k words enough to show how important clothes shopping is relative to anything to do with learning mother fucking magic or defeating Voldemort? Let's mention every chapter how harry can't sleep more than 2 nightmare infested hours a night ever since that traumatic thing happened. Oh his godfather died? Obviously he would refuse food and sleep until he went full catatonic so that someone can rescue him while he's on his last legs.

** You did not consider that the "allure" could be a combination of direct and indirect action. Futher, the word "allure" is a perfectly good word for both. If you wish authors to be more specific to the type of action they are refering to, what alternate words do you suggest?

Edit: just found an example of indirect allure: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/2/Deprived]]

** SHUT THE FUCK UP!

It's a made up world that's described from one very biased point of view. Apart from smart/cunning Malfoy and gay Harry every single interpretation of the Harry Potter universe is as valid as the next. That includes veela allure and it very very very very much includes magicals being scared of muggles.
