I'm looking for a fic cant remember the name or if it got deleted. The main jist was he found ginny with malfoy and moved on with astoria and the difference between their measured magic made her submit he travels with her to france but stops in at a shop and finds one of the quidditch girls dating dean thomas and they trade his hair for hers to use in polyjuice.
