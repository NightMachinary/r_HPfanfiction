:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello people!

i read a dramione fanfiction long ago, and I can't find it again. And I was hoping someone could help.

​

So Draco opens this new company, like a consultant buisness, and gives Hermione a job, where she get to work for animal rights.. They start dation obviously, having sex in his office and all that.\\
I know blaise works there too, and I believe Pansy is in it, as some sort of desiger/stylist!

​

I really want to find it again, I hope someone can help


** I think you are looking for "The Right Thing to Do" by lovebitca8 (linkffn(12563697)). The description is totally different than what you describe but further into the story he hires Hermione and Pansy becomes her personal stylist.

  Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again. She would see him for the first time since the Great Hall, gaunt and stricken at the Slytherin table with his mother clutching his arm. She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl.
