** Didn't somebody ask for this like three days ago? I'm certain I saw an ask for this recently.

I'm like 99% sure it's linkffn(Harry's decision) but I haven't found any reference to Harry not standing a magical environment. But it has literally everything else three chapters in, alive potters, Harry at the dursleys, rejects Hogwarts, Sirius teaching at Stonewall, all of it. It does, however, also have Harry having too dangerous magic to be around anyone.
