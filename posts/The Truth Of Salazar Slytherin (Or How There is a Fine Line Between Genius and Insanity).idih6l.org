Okay I got an idea for a fic. Now this will obviously be either a comedy/parody or outright cheese/crack fic. Lets say that Salazar Slytherin was not evil but history gets twisted over time. Maybe the real reason no one complains about Binns being terrible at his job and how history is an important subject and students aren't learning it is because he was not even the 5th teacher to act like this.\\
So History is learnt not through official channels but through rumors passed on by students.

So maybe Salazar Slytherin was a absolute genius, but he was a paranoid fool as well. Not Like "Mad-Eye" paranoid. But Tin foil on head, Build a bunker because of aliens paranoid.

And everyone ignored that fact like how you would ignore your grandfathers Big Fish tales. And How Your Favorite Uncle Told people he was close to finding Bigfoot and he wanted you to come camping so you could be there when he Finds him. Its harmless so you humor them.

So Salazar would begin his class by talking about about the nature of a black hole and his theory of relativity and end it by saying how the crucifix is actually a item that muggles use to communicate with their home planet. That Heaven is in the sky because Muggles are aliens sent to learn the secrets of magic and then send it all back to their people in the sky. The student would be like, "Yes Professor Slytherin, We will Keep an eye Out for the Muggles."

"yes yes you laugh all you like, But you will see one day, one day muggle will fly in the sky across the world by the Hundreds WITHOUT MAGIC." No magic involved. only their unnatural Muggle science"

â€‹

The reason Mudblood became a saying is he thinks the bible is actually codes that they have to spread their global plan. and he thinks muggle borns are really Golems, brought to life muggles "Prayers". Whatever that is. Thats Jesus Christ is their immortal leader who can't die and that wizards failed to kill him once and he came back life and mocked them for even trying to stop the muggles.

Somewhere along the story Voldemort would bring him to life, and the purebloods would realize their whole movement was based on a Senile genius

Anyone want to do this?

Worth making? Or should the idea Be scrapped?


** I personally wouldnt read it but I think a lot of people probably will.

*** Hes a magical genus. Who said he didnt think of it thousands of years before muggles (or he's a seer that saw thousands of years into the future a few to many times and it kind of broke his already paranoid mind) either way could be neat.

*** Those were merely used as an example of his genius. I'm not saying thats what Salazar would talk about, just where his intelligence levels are. I'm not going to put in the work right now to think of some deep magical theory. Lets just replace the black hole bit and the theory of relativity with something regarding magical theory at that level.
