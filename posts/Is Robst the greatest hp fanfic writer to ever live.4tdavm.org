** Robst is interesting to me, when I first started reading he was fantastic. Long stories that would actually become completed. Then I noticed that all of his stuff was pretty much the same. In the end I realized he was garbage, but honestly I feel that way about most of the stuff recommended now a days. I have slowly left the fandom, and with my distance have noticed that almost everything I enjoyed is bad. Even the things I still enjoy are bad. So, yes, in the cesspool of 99% of HP fanfiction, Robst might be the greatest.

*** Lily Luna smut is weaksauce when it comes to weird shit on here. I still remember the guy asking for necrophilia with Hermione's corpse.

** He is a good one, but there are many others at his level and, dare I say, above, all depending on tastes.
