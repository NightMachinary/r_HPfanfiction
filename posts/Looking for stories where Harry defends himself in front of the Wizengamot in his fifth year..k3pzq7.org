Basilisk born had my favorite of these moments that I've read, but I'd love to read more. Harry is shown to be snarky, and quick with his retorts, I love fics where he takes the battle to the prophet instead of letting them talk negatively all year.

Praised one year, villainized the next.


** Welll, there is a reason there are few well done fics of that type.

  There is the old adage in criminal trials that describes a person who represents himself at trial: "He has a fool for a client."
#+end_quote

Without significant changes prior to the trial, allowing Harry to either acquire the requierd knowledge of laws, proceedings, customs and people sitting in judgement as well as debating skill to convince them, or develop a great enough charisma and force of personality o convince them to side with him regardless, Harry has no chance against older, more experienced, richer and well connected opponents.

​

What fics I could possibly recommend, usually involve using the Triwizard to assert emancipation, and thus exception from RRFUS, at the reasonable assumption that the dementor presence would be obscured and the squib and house elf witnesses dismissed (without Dumbledore there to force questioning). Anyway, if the tropes do not scare you... here's an imaginatively named fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9843281/1/The-Trial][The Trial]].

*** While you're not wrong, Dumbledore didn't really behave as a "proper" lawyer either. It's not implausible to think that Harry could have learned to behave just as well in preparation for the trial.

**** True, but Dumbledore spent decades estabilishing his foundation.

  “Is he --- a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\
  "Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”
#+end_quote

The reputation as a quirky genius who usually turns out to be right in his actions and words allows him considerably more leeway. Harry would have much less, especially after two months of dedicated propaganda campaign aimed at discrediting him. His age would act against him too, and would need to be accounted for in his approach.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Hermione comes up with a contingency plan for Harry's Ministry hearing, and they decide their education can be better pursued elsewhere---at the largest and oldest school of magic in the world: Uagadou. Voldemort won't know what hit him. Harry/Hermione.
