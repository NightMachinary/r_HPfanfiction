** Intelligence and determination, ambition and hard work in equal parts, I'd say. Throughout canon the most skilled magic users (I won't say powerful as I don't believe in magical "power") are those that have one or more of those things in great quantities. Dumbledore and Voldemort were both viciously determined to rise /far/ above their stations, escape and shatter their chains (familial obligations, poverty, orphanage, being unknown, escape mortality, social stigma) and they both had the brilliance, ambition and work ethic to do it. Magic was the vehicle for their dreams to be realized and they focused on it completely, to reach unimaginable heights.

Snape and Sirius on the other hand, didn't. Their ambitions were far more lowly: escape their shitty families and find acceptance. Snape has that in Lily (and later his Slytherin friends), Sirius gets that through the Marauders. Their intelligence, altough relatively high, did not reach into brilliance. Their work ethic was surely intense (in different pursuits), but I doubt it even approached the obsessive levels that Dumbledore and Voldemort reached. Magic, to Snape and Sirius was a tool and not the end-all goal.

There is an argument to be made that there exists an inborn "talent" for spellcasting (certainly all four of the above wizards would qualify). But I would argue that even if that is the case, it is completely useless for a magic user without the four qualities I outlined.

*** I think it's also important to note that Sirius and Severus were far younger than Dumbledore and Voldemort at the time of their demise so it stand to reason that they had *potential* to become as powerful, they lacked enough time to get there

Plenty of people have potential that is never realised. I'd say that is the norm.

#+end_quote

Even if they had the time, would they really invest it in mastering their magic? I don't see it. If Sirius had survived the 2nd War he would have focused everything he had on Harry (and maybe sleeping with as many women as possible). Snape would have probably fled Britain and invent new potions and the like, once he was free of Voldemort.

So even if the potential is there, I see a very, very remote possibility it would happen.

Ironically it seems you made a point that the thing keeping Sirius and Severus from greatness is their social life/hobbies xD that makes Dumbledore and Voldemort either scarily obsessive over magic or tragically lonely

****** Very much so. For all that Harry gets compared to Voldemort (for some incidental similarities), Dumbledore is far more alike to him. They are unmarried into old age. They both destroyed their families. They were are ruled by ruthless ambition. Both tried to conquer their surroundings at one or more points. Both are/were surrounded by a cadre of followers that follow their commands. Both were drawn into teaching and shaping the minds of others. It's not unreasonable to infer that even Dumbledore sought immortality at some point, before giving up that on that idea (Hallows & association with the Flamels).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yep, these are both true. I don't see Dumbledore as becoming more than superficially close to anyone after breaking away from Gellert and Voldemort was always an island unto himself.

***** I do not try to contest the point they were less powerful bc they lacked conviction, just wanted to point out they weren't great examples since they had under 40 yrs of learning (less taking Azkaban into consideration) compared to over 70 of Dumbledore/Voldemort

In fact I made a post in other thread with similar sentiment to yrs:

#+begin_quote
  I wouldn't say that Grindelwald would be necessarily the less powerful of the trio. I assume they were evenly matched power-wise, it's simply more fun to watch.

  What I would call the deal breaker in a fight is a mental state: what motivated them? What is their goal?

  while Grindelwald (and young Dumbledore) think more globally, Voldemort (and older Dumbledore) stick to their home turf and concentrate on Britain. I think first instance speaks of more imagination or at least bigger ambitions/self-assurance. Grindelwald exploits would be more sucessful than, say, if Voldemort suddenly decided to invade America, simply because of what they believe themselves capable of and what they are prepared to do to succeed in their path

  important would be immediate need/goal. Are they believing in the thing they fight for? While Voldemort detested Muggles it was questionable if he really cared all that much about other goals and his Followers. He very much cared about his own live and immortality tho so it stands to reason that spells cast in self-preservation would be more powerful that any protecting someone else or even harmful curses affecting others. On the other hand Dumbledore valued lives of his students over his own so magic protecting them (like Harry in the Ministry) would be more powerful and swifter than defending himself and, yet again, attacking. We don't know about Grindelwald but I assume that one of the more probable reasons for his downfall was if his situation wasn't great at the end. He was already losing, his dream slipping through his fingers. Duel with Dumbledore just finished him off.

  Both of those things should have impact on casting as we are repeatedly told that *magic is all about intent*. And obviously it mostly alludes to the concentration in the moment of casting but what if it's also /boosted by convinction/? Unwavering, deep, powerful enough to affect the others. That would neatly tie these three: geniuses, visionists, people who shaped the century.

**** I don't know about Sirius or Snape, but I think James, Lily, and the Longbottoms might have been able to get there had they lived longer and dedicated their lives to studying magic, depending on how you interpret the "defied Voldemort three times" thing. If they actually fought him and escaped three times, that puts them in or near the top tier of magical combatants. Also, Lily was doing at least a little controlled wandless magic as a kid, and James along with the other Marauders did the map and the Animagi transformations while in school.

As I've argued elsewhere, I think Snape had the potential to be on that level maybe, but we know depression can inhibit magical ability, and Snape was miserable nearly his entire life.

A big part of it though is going to be willingness and ability to dedicate the time to get that good. While Dumbledore and Voldemort seem to have had natural strong magical ability, and a certain intelligence, they also basically devoted their lives, in different ways, to becoming more powerful wizards. Dumbledore spent most of his youth traveling and experimenting with Alchemy and such. Voldemort spent it traveling the world and learning the dark arts. Neither man had a family (after Dumbledore got his sister killed) to take care of, or, as far as we know, a day job to worry about, for most of that time. They chose to spend decades just learning magic and honing their skills, and had the luxury of the time and means to do it. Grindlewald, from what little we know, seems to have been much the same.

** What makes anybody particularly great at what they do? What separates the all time legends from unremarkable professionals?

They're simply more gifted in the relevant areas and they put in the work.

** Experience? I'm not really sure that Dumbledore or Riddle at 18 were necessarily that much more gifted than Sirius. In all cases, I'd say there's a high degree of natural talent - for Dumbledore, that's honed over the years by practice and dedication, plus increasing wisdom with age (and the acquisition of the Elder Wand). In Riddle's case, I think a lot of his ability simply comes from the unscrupulous embrace of the Dark Arts from a young age, and his own style of dedication to magic. It's possible that characters like Sirius and Bellatrix might have been just as powerful if their lives hadn't been disrupted by war and imprisonment.

And I guess this is headcanon, but I sort of see Snape as having a natural affinity for Potions, but otherwise being more of a Hermione type who learns by studying hard rather than by having exceptional innate skill. I suppose that comes from the OWLs flashback, where he seems to be nervous and reviewing things frantically while James and Sirius just breeze through it all.

** My headcanon is that they value their magic more, treating it as something precious and important rather than taking it for granted like most wizard-born. Magic has a degree of intelligence to it, and nobody likes being taken for granted. This is part of the reason for the existence of Muggle-borns - coming from a world without magic, they are far more likely to treat it as wondrous and amazing.
