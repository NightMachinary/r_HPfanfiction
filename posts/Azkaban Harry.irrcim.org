I have decided to look back on old Fanfictions that I read and liked. And some of them aged well, some have not.

​

One of the fan fictions I have been searching for I don't seem to recall the title. The main premise is that Harry is in Azkaban for a crime he hasn't committed, until he was out. Yet this Harry is crazier with ridiculous power that he took out Voldermort and his Death Eaters. I think Malfoy turned into a House Elf, but I could be wrong. On this one, I seem to remember he reconciliated with Hermoine at the end, slept with Tonks only to be friends only. Ginny was the last person he saw and was comforted by Harry and erased all her memories of his and removed the posters of the Boy Who Lived. It was a bitter sweet scene.

​

The end game couple was Harry and Fleur, I think. Both Ron and Molly ended up being dead with Ron dying of some sort of spell of sort and Molly slitting her wrist with a stone, Arthur being with another woman his own secretary.

​

I am trying to find it as it was a very interesting idea of who lives and who dies.

If you guys can help me find the fan fiction that would be great.


** This... this sounds like the definition of banter.\\
