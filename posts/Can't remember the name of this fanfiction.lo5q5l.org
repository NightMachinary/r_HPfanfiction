:END:
Looking for a fanfiction that I've read but can't find anymore

I think I read it on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and its a severus/remus fanfiction

Snape and Lupin take Harry into hiding where Harry poses as Snape's son and I think his new name is Hadrian

If anyone knows which story I'm talking about that would be greatly appreciated!


** "Hunter" fits your description.

Edit: not sure about Hadrian though.
