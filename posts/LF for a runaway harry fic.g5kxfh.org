#+begin_quote
  Harry is kicked out by the Dursleys at the age of 8. A teenage boy with a large sword on his back named Jett finds him and takes him under his wing. From then on, Harry lives with a group of those who slipped through the cracks of society called the Street Knights. Their motto is: Loyalty to those who deserve it. What will Hogwarts be like for a Harry who has a very different background? Years complete: 1 and 2. Year in progress: 3
