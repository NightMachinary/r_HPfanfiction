Full moon got you feeling down? Does each transformation leave you feeling even more worn down? Tired of the pain each cycle puts you through? Come one, come all, to Harry Potter's Werewolf Petrification Center!

For a modest fee of just two galleons per moon and with the unique abilities the Man-Who-Talks-With-Snakes and his seven basilisk friends, you can spend the fool moon blissfully unaware and transformation-free! That's right: transformation-free!

Harry Potter's Patented Werewolf Petrification Process combines the power of a basilisk with carefully placed mirrors to reliably petrify you every time. Owl today for 50% off your first appointment! Some terms and conditions apply. Do not go through Harry Potter's Petrification Process if you are allergic to Mandrakes or the Mandrake Restorative Draught.


** Don't have two galleons? Tom Riddle's Werewolf Petrification Services can help you for free!

+In rare cases, temporary personality adjustments may happen after the procedure. This is a normal side effect, not a Polyjuiced Death Eater having taken your place.+

+There is no truth to the rumors of Werewolfs "accidentally" getting Restorative Draught in the middle of muggle villages.+

****** Werewolves are magically resilient and the “wolf” seems to take over the mind of the host. Since the imperious can be thrown off I'd question if the wolf could do it. Otherwise I'd have expected Voldemort to control werewolves a lot. Also, if the werewolf takes wolfbane, does it then become more susceptible to the imperious?

********* If you can find and hit then with a spell in the night, plus a single bite would have the person cursed for life, even without magic resistance there are plenty of reasons to fear them during their time of the month, even more so in cases like Remus where the surrounding people actually like him and are thus not willing to use lethal force.

Plus the thing about books having success is not just due to the stakes at risk, it is generally more about how good the author is at telling the story, especially with people so willing to compromise on the truth like Lockhart, if you know how to make a one-on-one glorified fist-fight done right it will probably be leagues above a dry-read about a battle that was decisive to end a war.

***** I'd say the pregnancy is terminated, though the pregnancy may not even /start/ because, every time you take Polyjuice, you're essentially reverting to the donor's physical condition at the time that their material was taken, and conception generally takes more than a couple hours to occur.

Alternately, ignore all that and just realize that you've got a great premise for an Mpreg story.

It's not like they are heavily discriminated against in civilized society or that the most convenient method of controlling their curse is an expensive consumable and require high expertise in a given field OR that a cage and an unbreakable charm is more accessible and reliable just with the tradeoff of pain?

Why any werewolf would choose to not avoid the full moon is a mystery to me

Edit: Sorry about this whole thing, I didn't mean to go on a rant. I was tired and people handwaving away other people's problems (werewolves in this specific circumstance) just really rubbed me the wrong way

It's fun to debate here in fictional terms about the creative solutions to fictional dilemmas but if you remove the "fiction" it just kinda hit close to home. That's probably what prompted this comment. Sorry for the attitude, it wasn't warranted

Werewolves are heavily discriminated against in Wizarding society for the most part, I could definitely see that over the years the children Greyback bites become bitter and jaded due to their continued rejection from society, and ultimately end up joining a pack because they feel they have no choice if they want to survive or have even a modicum of happiness.

******* I think it's implied a number don't survive. I remember reading on Pottermore (I think) about a boy bitten in his youth like Remus, with a loving family who tried to help him, who ended up committing suicide because of his lycanthropy. Some families will eject them and I don't imagine they fare well on their own.

Fenrir possibly circled back and collected some of those he turned to help form his little army. Excuse me, pack.

Probably die in seconds due to the complete lack of an atmosphere on the moon.

#+end_quote

Presuming that the planet in question has an atmosphere, and that it's of a kind capable of sustaining terrestrial life, that's a good question. It might depend on what it is about the full moon that triggers a werewolf's transformation, if there's some special magical aspect of our sun and/or moon that causes the reflected light seen during a full moon to induce said transformation, or if it's more biomagical in nature.

#+begin_quote
  Or a world with many moons?

See my above responce, but with the note that multiple moons could possibly either amplify or counteract the transformation, depending on a whole slew of factors I couldn't even begin to guess at.

******* It's pretty likely that the original werewolf curse was created by some dark wizard a few millenia ago trying to get a self-increasing army of mind controlled warriors. It's unlikely that an ancient dark wizard would have considered space travel when developing the curse. So there's a good chance it'd glitch out, fail or cause some weird effect. Or it might not do anything at all.

****** Depends on how it works. But we know from the source material that a werewolf will not transform if it's a full moon on the other side of the world.

Now, I could see some sort of issue where a werewolf needs the magic to 'flux' periodically or its body has issues, but not some weird magical 'you must do that or else magic will punish you' sort of thing.

That just reads similarly to a bad GM in an RPG who punishes players for not following the railroad.

***** It could be like my migraines, where there's a sort of mounting "pressure" that makes delayed migraines (or delayed transformations, in a werewolf's case) more severe when they finally do happen.

Since the full moon comes out during the day, but traditional werewolf lore and fic usually doesn't have werewolves transforming till nightfall, it may be that delayed transformation = greater sensitivity, so that somebody who transforms every month will only do so at night, when the moon is bright and unobscured, while someone who keeps the transformation at bay for months will eventually transform at the top of the lunar cycle, even at noon, and that the experience will be much more severe.

**** My headcanon is that the globetrotting trick works, but it can't be overdone. Basically, I figure that the wolf is dormant most of the time, but near the full moon, it starts to slightly leak into the main persona. It can be suppressed simply enough with a bit of willpower if you know what is happening. However, suppressing the transformation like this doesn't make the wolf turn dormant as it should. As a result, over time, it forces itself upon your personality even more, and if you continue to suppress the transformation, eventually you become a case that is sort of an inverted Wolfsbane: a wolf in human shape, until you allow the transformation to occur normally. This also causes the Wolfsbane to fail until things are back to normal.
