:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a Harry/Daphne betrothal contract fic that I read a while back. Went political and I'm trying to read more political focused fiction at the moment. I don't remember much but there's one scene that's stuck with me.

Facts: Post war At a ministry Galla/ball Harry manages to force the existing Head Auror/DMLE Head to step down. The old Head was injured/getting old. But had no intention of stepping down until Harry made gave him no option to announce it there.

I know it's not a lot. But I hope someone recalls it. Thank you!
