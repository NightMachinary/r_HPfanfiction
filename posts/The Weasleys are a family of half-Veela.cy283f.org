** The very little known red veela. Very clever, atrocious table manners. Powers include supernatural fertility.

Bonus: family fued with the malfoys is actually a biological compulsion to be aggressive with other breeds of veela.

The joining of fleur and bill will likely end in magically improbable creature children that time travel and breed standard veela species out of existence.
