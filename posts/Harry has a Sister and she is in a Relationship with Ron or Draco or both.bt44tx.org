as the title says, it doesnt have to be a long-time relationship, but can also be partly Ron and Draco. well, since it would be AU, i would like Draco to have a better behaviour than in Canon. I would also accept his sister to have an interest in the Girls, but mostly the mentioned Guys are my interest.


** Or both :/

***** No no, there's only the one. Fight club style. Draco is also Ron, Harry's sister is dating both of them but doesn't realise they're the same person, while Ron /Draco doesn't realise she thinks they're not the same person. Shenanigans ensue

Meanwhile Harry dates ginny. Who is actually a 50 ft prehistoric..

*** That would lead to some angry sex. . . while the sister is on a chair, watching.
