A long time ago I got really into fanfics, then kinda got out of it, but now I'm looking for a certain one. I remember finding one about how every great wizard and witch have a soulmate, and it appears in a book the ministry has and Harry appears on it with Hermione. They end up learning abou it, and they are given a house which they can train in that like slows down time while they are in it to cover up the plot hole of they would be gone for months and weeks on end. I think farther in Hermione gets a gun that shoots spells? And they end up being able to transfigure themselves into like elemental wolves or something. Been a couple years since I read it. If anyone could help me with the name that would be great


** Gotchu, I believe this is it.

  Who would expect that sharing a simple kiss with his best friend was all it needed to begin a journey far beyond his greatest imagination? Soul-bond fic

****** Really? Why is that? Not that there is anything wrong, just curious to your reasoning. After re-reading it myself, I found it lacking some of its beginning charm and found other stories that kept the charm of the characters better.

******** That's fair I have the same memories of the fic when I first read it. Not sure what your taste for fanfics are so I thought I just give you one that I thought could interest you.

********* good characters that actually seem like the real characters, possibly some good humor. If there aren't any harmony soul-bond ones like that, I'd probably read any ones that have characters that fit the books, some humor, and good plot
