You just don't see this happening in most fics. Defeating a Dark Lord at the ripe young age of 17 should easily have qualified him for a First Class, no?


** Well, the government was probably busy with more important things immediately after the war. But at the latest, I would probably expect a big memorial/ceremony on the anniversary of the battle where Harry (and probably plenty of other people who fought in the battle) would get an Order of Merlin.

As for why it doesn't happen in most fics (and I'm assuming you're asking specifically about eighth year and other fics that take place soon enough after the battle that it would be likely to come up), it probably just comes down to it not being relevant to the story the author wants to tell, so there's no reason for them to include it.

Or you could imagine that Harry already got an Order of Merlin, First Class for defeating Voldemort as a baby, and that you can't receive the honor more than once.

*** Lols, Imagine a fifteen month old baby being awarded the medal.. . Like, wizards are crazy but no one could be that thick. Good premise for a crack fic though.

**** I've seen a few with him having one for Voldemort's first defeat. One story where he's a blood adopted Kryptonian has the plot point that an OoM upgrades your blood status by one grade, and therefore Harry can't be robbed of his business to give it to some pureblood. Since he is one.

**** I'm playing with a fic that is little more than a collection of stories loosely based on the Fanon "Harry Potter and the..." stories that were read to Ginny (and likely a lot of other kids post voldemort the first time around).

I'm planning on a sort of 'Doc Savage' homage, where the Uber capable Harry (at 6) has a crew of troubleshooters that come along on his adventures. I'm going to have the World's Most Handsome Goblin who lives in shame at how Human women are always coming on to him, The World's tallest Dwarf (Hagrid) who can control any animal, the worlds shortest giant (Flitwick) who is sudden death with a wand, and a few others all of them experts in some aspect of Magic, but Harry is better.

I still need to come up with a few plots, but there will be Harry Potter and the Escape from the Castle of the Evil Muggle Queen, Harry Potter and the Dragon, Harry Potter and the Return of You Know Who, and a few others. In each Harry will get an Order of Merlin and my inner smart ass wants the final book in the series to be Harry Potter runs out of places to store his Orders of Merlins.

I do know the last line in the story will show how the real canon-ish Harry finds one of the books on the train to Hogwarts and after reading a few pages, asks "What the actual fuck?"

** A lot of things he does in the series should have qualified him for an OoM or some other honor. I would guess most just aren't set late enough for it to matter.

*** Yeah, but I was under the impression than Dumbledore was covering up most of it. Some of it was actually illegal (time turner abuse, polyjuice abuse, breaking into DOM, cruciatus usage and so on).

**** I lean towards Dumbledore covering it up. Else why no OoM award for Harry for his killing of the Basilisk and "saving" all of the students in Hogwarts? Why wasn't Amelia at least informed that this was the second time in two years that Voldemort attempted to return.

There were plenty of things in first and second year that should have resulted in lots of parental and law enforcement attention (horrible death on the third floor corridor anyone?) but we had crickets chirping in terms of parents concern.

In my mind the only way that happens is that there was some type of charm/curse/ward/etc that kept students from telling their parents about these things.

***** Yup most of the staff should have gone to jail for child endangerment first year.

Lucius should've been given life in second year.

It's what irks me when people say Hermione or whoever should be punished. Justice unequally applied is injustice.

****** We both know that it wasn't coincidence the Stone was at Hogwarts during Harry first year, with defences that could be passed by a first year, it was obviously a set up for Harry and Voldemort, a first meeting in a controlled environment so to speak. Or perhaps a hook for Voldemort to force him into the light. Or yet both in the same time. That Dumbledore would cover it up is normal as only the prophecy division of the Department of Mysteries would have understood.

For Lucius, Dumbledore did not insist on law enforcement because his own position would be even more precarious as it was. Dumbledore was just reinstated by the board of Governors from his suspension, his situation was precarious. But if Dumbledore revealed the circumstances of Lucius using a Horcrux to poses the daughter of Arthur Weasley, he would be forced to admit he was aware when and who opened the chamber the last time. It is obvious that the murder of Miss Warren paved the way for Headmaster Armando Dippet early retirement. The same would happen to Dumbledore or worse if the DMLE choose to prosecute charges against him.

Sometimes it is necessary to close the eyes. And Lucius probably could escape prosecution again with his influence. Dumbledore simply saved for later his own political capital.

** I think the wording of your question is important: you don't /see/ it happening. I think most authors assume it happened, but it's often not interesting/relevant to state or show "on screen."

*** I was careful with the wording, yes. What I think is happening is that being the Boy Who Lived/Man Who Won or whatever is probably a much more popular title than the Order of Merlin. Kinda like how Dumbledore is known for all of his achievements/defeater of Grindelwald rather than as an Order recipient.

** Why? He did it at 15 months and didn't get squat except being sentenced to Durskaban.

For that matter, the Ministry confiscated his home and made a monument/park out of it.

In Wizarding Britain, evidently the 'Thanks of a Grateful Nation' isn't worth much.
