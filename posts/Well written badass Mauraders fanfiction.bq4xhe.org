I am looking for fanfiction like black pride or a mauraders plan with an interesting plot, politics and action.

Is my favourite Mauraders era fic. They treat the characters right, especially James. It's not often an author gets character growth right. plus, it has all that you are looking for "interesting plot, politics and action". Enjoy.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

A bit of time travel, Regulus is the main character in the first half, late Vold War 1 era. Lots of battle action with Sirius, James, Lily making plenty of appearances. Sirius is the main character in the second half, 7 years later.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
