Luna is a well liked character in the fanfiction community, and she has been written a number of different ways. Often Mary Sue'd or Flanderized, she is written as a cryptic seer, or a manic pixie dream girl, or occasionally, the socially awkward but intelligent and occassionally insightful character she is in canon.

That being said, we meet her when she is 14, after she has spent five years living with her unhinged father after she has seen the death of her mother and three and a half years of bullying at the hands of her schoolmates and isolation from her one childhood friend.

Lina's personality is guaranteed to have been shaped by these events and years, so it doesn't make sense for a fic that introduces 11 year old Luna to have her acting the same as 14 year old Luna, and especially don't make sense for Luna before her mother's death or Lunas whose mother doesn't die.

In fics like these where Luna is introduced earlier or has different home circumstances, how do you like to see her portrayed?


** Are there any Normal!Luna stories? Where she's a normal girl, not a seer, not a genius, not a "wise beyond her years", but a regular girl who grew up without mother, with conspiracy nut of a father and barely any social interactions?

Because all I usually see is her being some sort of insightful prophet, and that just makes me dislike her.

*** I can suggest couple of these:

1. linkao3(14078862) and its sequels ... she is a bit quirky, but reasonably so, and the story is Huna, so she is not completely out of it. No seer.
2. of course, everybody loves linkffn(7352166;7725072), yes the latter is unfinished (author claims it still work in progress, but the last update was Dec 10, 2014, so yes).
3. I just finished reading [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=721][After Destiny by cambangst]](NFSW) and I like a sad Luna there, but yes, she is not completely normal, she somehow missed a filter for talking about sexual behaviour.
4. I like Luna as written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]], but she is not very dominant in his stories.

And yes, having said that, I still haven't found what you are looking for ... a girl who is just depressed and slightly damaged by her loss and by her completely out of whack father. I would love to see a story where they are sitting together somewhere in a jungle around a fire in their camp, and her trust and love for Ralf allows her to hear some facts of life. Like, no, there is really no evidence for existence of Crumple-Horned Snorkack, and her father probably had made it up.

She's very regular in Crazy Little Things. It's a Hermione/Luna fic. No Ron bashing, despite appearances.

** I, personally, don't necessarily care for Luna as a character, but I do like to see her portrayed as some sort of seer, and absolutely not Mary Sue-ish.

I think that when Luna comes to Hogwarts, she's probably not as quirky, but she becomes quirky as a coping mechanism so to speak.

** I'm good with almost any Luna (I guess), she can be smart, socially awkward, traumatized, kinky, bullied, superficial or whatever the writer want to adapt her.

My main concern is when there are some Luna Ex Machina coming from nowhere when the story was going smoothly and often not in the good way for the characters but still salvageable . At this point a wild Luna arrives and saves the day by saying something cryptic and then explaining it in a Ocean Eleven way. Story got back on track, got stuck another time and LUNA EX MACHINA !

Sorry for the rant; I had a couple of story totally immersion broke like this...

** One of my favourite Luna's is the one in Crazy Little Things. Not the best fic, very, very Americanised, but her characterisation is quite kooky but in an oddly normal way as well. She's not a seer or a manic pixie dream girl, but she enjoys puzzling people with bizarre phrases, knows a lot about a really niche area (magical cryptid-zoology), and is a bit socially awkward and insightful, and hides her insecurities about pushing her beliefs on others.

It's Luna/Hermione and breaks Hermione up with Ron in the most unbashing way I've ever seen anything do ever. It accepts that people aren't perfect and follows along from that in a realistic way instead of rape or cheating or mass murder or whatever Ron is doing with his time in fanfiction these days.

It is really not big on plot though, mostly character work and relationship building. Expect people talking and getting to know one another and disagreeing on occasion, but no big world-changing drama or action or anything.
