**** Hey [[/u/denarii]], [[/u/kemistreekat]], [[/u/tusing]]

Can you just make this person go away? Blatant troll, adds nothing to the discussion, and his Jbern/DLP obsession is creepy as all hell.

Thank you and have a nice day,

** Well, I do like the fact, that he used different challenges in the tournament, although Harry was way too powerful (he did offer an explanation with the Dementor incident though). I'd have preferred a Harry with an ounce more cunning, self-preservation and willingness to learn instead of goofing with Ron, playing chess, etc in all books.
