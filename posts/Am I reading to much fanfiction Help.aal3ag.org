At the beginning of December, I stumbled upon "The Arithmancer" by White Squirrel. Since then I've read the Arithmancer series, the "Parselmouth of Gryffindor", the "Accidental Animagus" series, the "Innocent" series, the "Where in the world is Harry Potter" series and a bunch of smaller fics, adding up to 3.6 million words, multiple times more than canon. I didn't prepare for exams, didn't sleep enough and haven't been able to try out my Christmas presents. What should I do?


** If reading fanfiction is interfering with the rest of your life - affecting your sleep pattern, interfering with your studies and other responsibilities - then I'd say you do need to step away, at least for a while. You can read whatever makes you happy, but if reading is all you do then that's not good for you.

There are apps you can download which will blacklist certain sites (or even block you off the internet entirely) for a period of time that you set. When I have something I need to get done, I use one called Stay Focusd - I can make it so that even if I want to, I can't go to the sites where I procrastinate (hi reddit) until the job is done. You could use something like this to quarantine fanfiction sites?

You could also try setting an alarm. I do this too, because otherwise I struggle to go to bed early enough to get the sleep I need. Set yourself a rule that says “I am not allowed to be up and about after /this time/”. Set an alarm a few minutes before, so you know when you hear it you HAVE to start preparing to stop for the night. Screen off, stop what you're doing, start going through your nightly routine. The alarm is your reminder.

*** If you're using an apple iPhone (and I'm not sure if this applies to Mac as well) you can go into Settings > Screen Time > Downtime, and set yourself a curfew with an optional passcode (you could get your mum or another family member to set the passcode) you can set it to allow certain apps (like calls, iMessage, calendar, settings, clock, that sort of stuff) and it will give you a 5 minute warning, then lock all non-essential, non-allowed apps until a set time in the morning. You can bypass this if you're genuinely using the app for study or something by asking for 15 minutes, an hour, or unlocking it for that night. The reason I suggested getting someone else to set the passcode and not tell you is because I know the passcode for mine and if I'm really into what I'm reading, I'll just unlock the app and keep going.

Also in Settings > Screen Time, you can set limits for individual apps ( > App Limits). These are also password protected, but I haven't used that feature before so I'm not entirely sure how it works. A quick read of the note at the top of the section, however, leads me to believe that you set a daily limit on how many hours you can spend on X app. This resets at midnight though, so I would still suggest using Downtime so you don't just start reading at midnight each night when you've used up your app time.

Finally, Settings > Screen Time also has ‘Always Allowed' which I mentioned in the first paragraph, and ‘Content and Privacy Restrictions'. There is also an option to share the Screen Time Settings across all devices that are logged into the same iTunes account, which I would presume includes iPads, MacBooks and any other devices using iCloud.

Apologies for the formatting; I'm on mobile.

**** 100% agreed on both points. On the topic of finding stories, I'm also thankful that HP fanfiction primed me to try out other serial/online fiction like Worm or Mother of Learning. If I hadn't been into fanfics, I also may not have gotten into LitRPGs like Worth the Candle, several subreddits largely dedicated to serial fiction, and even into entire franchises like Fate.

** After reading the comments, I feel bad that I nearly responded with sarcasm. I had no idea this was an actual problem people could have. I used to be the same way with videogames, so I get it, I think.

Acknowledging the problem and accepting the need to fix it are two big steps you've taken already. I think you'll be fine, just take the excellent advice you've received here and learn to moderate. All I can add is what helped me to end an addiction, without fail, and that's to quit 'cold turkey'.

Good luck with it.

** It's very common to binge fanfiction when just starting out in a new fandom. I read a couple million words in the first weeks of shipping my OTP as well. The good news is that there is a good chance your reading will slow down naturally once you've read enough to figure out your preferences in more detail and start focusing more on fics that match them. However, if you feel fanfiction is interfering with your life in the meantime, I agree with the advice to set some limits on your reading.

** In addition to all the great suggestions here: Read offline. I know it sounds counterproductive to download a whole fic and read it like that (because then you don't even have 'natural' breaks of the chapters), but the biggest issue I had was finishing a story and then /starting another one/. If it is offline I can't just load the next in the series, or look at the authors other works, or fall down the rabbit hole of a new tag. Also, when reading on FFN it is hard to tell where in the fic you are, but at least offline you have a complete page count, so you can say- "ohh, I'm only 1/5th the way through, may as well stop now, cos if I try and finish I wont get any sleep." and also "I've read 100 pages and it is still boring, why bother reading the remaining 300?"

** Having read all but one of those series, that I added to my massive to read list, I can say I have been where you are. I have read 1.2M words in the last 4 days... and Fanfiction is no longer my Only Addiction/Timesink anymore. /(that included going to work)/

A lot of the advice given is very good, but sometimes that isn't enough.

1. Alarms / "bed time" can be migrated to yourself, /I can't go to bed in the middle of a chapter. (then suddenly its 5 chapters later)/
2. Using the App to blacklist fanfiction sites does work if you adhere to the "Set it up and turn it on, then off when you're allowed to read, then on etc." I fail'd at that.
3. Someone pointed out that after a while you run out of the good fics, and this is true with /some/ fandoms; Harry Potter is not one of them if you're new as its been going on for over 10 years! There is probably 500Trillion words in HP fanfiction across all the sites...if not more and climbing. In addition, if HP isn't your only Fandom....
4. Using a reward system could be very useful for the short term, get X done and then set a timer for Y minutes reading. Rinse repeat.\\
5. Writing Fanfiction does curb the reading a bit but timesink itself.
6. Reading as a coping thing is very true. Finding the reason though might not lead to a slowdown, but would be good if that is the case.\\

My suggestions:

- Pull yourself away from Fanfiction for a little bit BY Reading a good paperback. I know Kindle/nook/etc is easier but they also can be used to read fanfiction. By using a physical book, you pull yourself away from the screen and the fandom.
- What did you get for Christmas that you've not tried out? Actively doing so might be enough.
- When *I* needed to pull away from fanfiction, I put more focus into gaming and watching youtube. /often at the same time, by listening./ There are a lot of free games out there (some which spark other fandoms :D ) I started playing MMOs primarily, to get some social because when binge reading I ignored people.

In the end, I dont write as much as I did to fandoms, and I go days without reading any but then suddenly a story I've read pop into my head and I'll go read it. /As I prefer 100k+ these days -- and actively read 700k+ if they're complete--/rereading fics take forever. sometimes I'll just go looking for fics with no intention of being drawn into one. My bookmarks have multiple folders under *Fanfiction* /favorites/*/,/* couples, fandoms, etc and I'll just drop a good sounding fic into it using faves only for the ones I know I'll read again. Then when in the mood to read, scroll down and find a new or old one to read.

​

I didn't intend to write a novel lol

tl;dr

You're not alone, this happens to many of us. there are ways to cope, not least of which is coming to reddit for help

** Basically anything that becomes compulsive to the point of negatively impacting your life can be an addiction.

You should probably take some time and reflect on if you have been using bing reading as a coping mechanism. Is it away to avoid negative feelings depression, anxiety, low self esteem. You can be functionality depressed with out recognizing it. I went into a depression after loosing my grandmother and it wasn't until years later that I could recognize how withdrawn I had been. One of my coping mechanism was bing reading.

On a practical level I have a 7inch kindle fire and it has a voice to text feature so you can download a fic and listen to it. This has allowed me to be much more productive while still enjoying fics. I listen to them while I am cleaning my home, commuting to work, folding laundry, with headphones when I am doing the grocery shopping extra.

I would try writing up a plan with when, for how long, and after completing what activities will you read. Then post it around as a visual reminder.

** I was addicted to fanfiction a couple of years ago in another fandom. What did I do about it? I tried to switch out of the fandom, shut off notification emails from Fanfiction for updated chapters that tempt me to go back in and also found something else to occupy my time with. It's been two years and I completely quit that fandom (but I still love it) and I write for HP now. I find writing fanfiction actively keeps me away from reading fanfiction, which is sort of weird. But writing too takes some time and so I wouldn't recommend that to you.

Your best bet would be to find something else to occupy your time with, even if it's simply a hobby. Also, watching television with my family discourages me from reading. It's not much but it does help.

** I had this problem starting out. I tried a number of the things in this thread, and none of them really worked long-term. I got over it partly because I'd gone through all the good stories, but I have one piece of advice that really did work for me.

If a story is taking too much of your time, copy and paste the URL into a Word document or something similar (I use Sticky Notes) so you don't lose your place. I also make a note of word count and number of chapters so you know how far along you are. It doesn't sound like it would make much difference, but it really does. It's a matter of "out of sight, out of mind", and it gives you a ready-made list to catch up on holidays or weekends.

** I've done similar things in the past, and made similar bad life choices because of it. Its not about the fanfiction or how much you've read anymore - it's about sheer strength of will and making yourself know when to stop.

** This combined with videogames made be fail a few semesters at uni. I tried some of the suggestions above with moderate to little success. The thing that really helped me was location. As in I would only read fanfiction at home or on my phone if I was in line or waiting for something. I did all my class work in the library or an abandoned classroom. Often I worked with classmates which would keep me on task. It's still something I struggle with though. One thing that has helped me a lot is listening/reading Jordan Peterson. He has a lot of good advice about how to motivate yourself.

****** Hmm, I think you have only looked at the surface of what he is saying and not any of the nuance. His points are much longer from what I can see. His point about order and chaos was that in mythology order is a masculine trait and chaos is a feminine trait. That is why we call it 'mother nature' and why the tyrant in lion King is Simba's Uncle not his Aunt. However it is not strictly men and women, only masculine and feminine. Such as the villain Mrs. Trunchbull in Matilda, who is super about order. She portays many classically 'masculine' traits. The opposite would be Little Finger from Game of thrones. His methods of winning the game of thrones generate a ton of chaos and he uses methods classically 'feminine' very similar to Cersi. The reason for this as Jordan points out is that humans are inherently social creatures so we anthropomorphise everything and our default categories are male and female. Certain traits tend toward certain genders creating Masculine and Feminine. But just because Order is Masculine and chaos is Feminine doesn't make either good or bad. Order can be terrible such as Big Brother in 1984. Chaos can be great such as Katniss in Hunger games.

As for the point about enforced monogamy, that has to be taken in the context of anthropology. 'Enforced Monogamy' is a anthropology term meaning there is cultural pressure to stay monogamous. Which I think is pretty self evident in human culture. Polygamy is super frowned upon and most people usually say cheating on your S.O. is considered bad. That is enforced monogamy. I can see how what he said there can be misconstrued and was said pretty poorly. But he has elaborated on that point after that interview. The fact of the matter is that most of Jordan's advice for 'Incels' is to grow the hell up into men so women will be attracted to you.

As for the whole transgender issue, Jordan was never anti transgender. He was just against the bill that was supposedly pro transgender because it was a poorly written law and he thought the government was reaching too far toward tyranny. That bill if it was in the US would be in direct violation of the first amendment. He had also said now that he would call a transgender student by their preferred pronoun given they were being genuine. His whole stance was that the government was overstepping their bounds.

As for the whole lobster thing, I think you missed the point. Jordan could have compared us to whales or chimps or lions or whatever. His point was that the problem of hierarchy and inequality is a way deeper problem than a sociological problem. It isn't something that humans came up with. It is something practiced by the majority of animals and our biology had adapted to hierarchy on a neurological level. You can't tackle a problem that deep from a sociological level. Or at least not without acknowledging the fact that it is deeply rooted in biology.

I couldn't find a video where he said men shouldn't debate women because they were too emotional. I'd be really interested in seeing that if you could send me the link.

As for the last tweet... That was from 1.5 years ago. From what I can tell he was asking why that occurred, and part of the conclusion he drew was that YouTube's audience is 70-80% male. After his book came out he said his audience became about 60%M 40%F

As for the patriarchy/gender roles point, that would take like 5 posts to unpack.

You know thanks for replying to my original post. I watched a lot of Peterson last night looking in to what you said and I learned a lot. I never understood all the weird hype around fake news until now.
