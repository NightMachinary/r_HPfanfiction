** Voldemort's pretty damn dead by the epilogue, y'know? And everyone's gotten over the trauma.... except maybe George. Yeah, someone could write a great fic where George goes back in time to save his twin, but then I can't really see the twins befriending or redeeming Voldemort, no matter what.

** Those may be two mutually exclusive requirements. As [[/u/cavelioness]] mentions, it would most likely involve a Peggy Sue, or some other form of time travel since Tom is long dead by the epilogue. So, at best it could only be epilogue compliant until said traveller rewrote history.

Most likely to succeed would obviously be Harry, who'd get sucked back in time by "accident," on a wednesday no less. Though /Why/ he'd try and redeem Tom would still be questionable since canon Harry never really developed an appropriate level of disillusionment with Dumbledore to induce any kind of bonding experiences with Tom. If Harry is going back far enough to prevent Tom turning into Voldemort... it's not really /redemption/ any reason he could have to try and un-evil Voldemort generally violates the epilogue compliancy criteria.
