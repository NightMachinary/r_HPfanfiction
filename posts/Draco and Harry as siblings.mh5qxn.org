So I've just read "Raven's Colours by Pharetra" and in that story the malfoys adopt Harry (in this story raven because she was very young and thought her name is freak and because she is trans). So basically I want any fanfic where Harry and Draco are siblings, I prefer fem Harry but normal is fine too (as long as it's not one of those weird lord of 7 houses, richest man on earth, heir to 200 more and goblin friend fanfics)


** In linkffn(Living with Danger by Whydoyouneedtoknow) and sequels Harry is raised by Sirius, Remus, and their OC wives and becomes Draco's brother at a young age. Harry is heir of something, but it is only one thing and not until the second or third story. His wealth is glossed over and their are no goblin friends that I remember.

  Lonely and afraid, Iris Potter lies awake at night dreaming of another world, one of magic. And then, when a chance visit from Lucius Malfoy turns it upside down, Iris Potter becomes Astra Malfoy - smart, poised, unafraid. Now, with her brother Draco by her side, the daughter of four will make her own mark upon the world. Slytherin!OC - no hiatus - no update schedule
