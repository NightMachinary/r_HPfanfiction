** The closest thing I've seen is Wind Shear, though it's not nearly as dark. Bella sees Harry kill a bunch of Death Eaters so naturally she is immediately turned on and starts pursuing him.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** You said similar, so do Tom and other characters like that (i.e. Regulus, Snape, Barty) count for the outside POV?

** I wrote this rn and have decided to make this an actual long form fic (be warned it's 99% crack):

I stirred the amortentia, careful as always. I took a small sniff. It smelled like ... gillyweed?

An approving hum caught my attention and I looked up at Professor Slughorn's thick face. Possibly the only aspect of my time at Hogwarts that my parents truly approved of was how much he'd come to appreciate me as a student.

"You /must/ come to my Christmas Party, Bellatrix. A third year with your talents... Why, it would be a waste not to." By the way he smiled, he knew I couldn't say no.

"Remember, you can certainly bring a friend, or a date." He continued, winking at the last word.

There was only one person I wanted to ask.

After what seemed like hours of Slughorn's blabbering, I spotted him in the library, his hair illuminated by light from the window.

Blacks didn't enter relationships out of affection or even attraction; that was what affairs were for. But my potion earlier had confirmed it.

I walked up to him, ready to do the most un-Black thing I'd ever done. I swallowed hard.

"... will you be my date to Slughorn's Christ-?"

I was hit by a bat-bogey hex before I even finished by sentence.

Why? Whywhywhy. I had seen him, staring at me in the corridors. When I'd stared back, he'd quickly look away. I tried talking to him and he would simply clam up. According to Narcissa, that meant he fancied me.

I'd begun to believe it was true.

Me, a daughter of Black, brought to ruin by a Longbottom. Brought to ruin by /love/

As my nose exploded and I became more bogey than person, I heard him whisper.

/That's for my parents, you bitch/

** I finally gathered my courage to do it. I really hoped that my parents wouldn't disapprove, but that was practically inevitable..
