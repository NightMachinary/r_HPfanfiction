So... I've been browsing a ton of different sites lately (and using a crap ton of filters), but am a tiny bit stumped on a reliable way to find some of that /good/ stuff. Basically, I'm a lazy person who wants good fanfics and wants them now. Thoughts?


** Between this sub and the HPSlash sub, I find a bunch of stuff. Then, if I like the story (and the writing style) that was rec'd, I check out other stories the author has written, as well as stories and/or authors that the author has favorited. This has done me well so far. If I like an author, I tend to like what's on their favorites list too; and even if I don't, it's usually at least decently written.

** You can check my app: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7w063m/promotion_ive_written_an_app_that_makes_finding/]] It's not exactly about findiing good fanfics (though it helps with that too) as it is about keeping unnecessary noise on FFN to a minimum while searching.

There is also this site: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]] where people keep track of good stuff

Alternatively, if you PM me with like 20 links to your FFN favourites I can generate a recommendation list for you.

*** Your app is really cool. Just would be more convenient as a web service which would read a FFN profile and spit out suggestions.

**** I am planning to make it service based but currently derailed a bit creating intelligent slash filter.

Also, reading FFN profile is a bad idea. More often than not profile is a collection of fics you no longer remember anymore. I've been asking ppl to link me their profile when I offer recommendation list generation, but usually response is:

#+begin_quote
  nah, it's not a solid source, use these fics instead
#+end_quote

** When I read a fanfic I Iike, I check out the author's other stuff and their favorite stories. That's usually how my reading list expands.

** If I like a story, I check out any other stories the author might have written, then I check their favorites/bookmarks, and the favorites/bookmarks of anything interesting I find that way, and on and on.

I check TVTropes' rec lists. I check tumblr blog rec lists. I google 'hp [time travel, dark, hpdm, hpss, whatever] rec list'.

Sometimes, but not often--because it's kind of a crapshoot but it /does/ work, it's just kind of tedious-- I'll find my favorite stories/stories I'd like to see more things similar to and I check the favorites/bookmarks of the people who leave reviews there. Like 70% of the time they have crap taste or haven't bookmarked/favorited anything, but sometimes you can strike paydirt in a carefully curated list with like 200 decent fics and 5 really good ones. Depends.

If I'm feeling particularly patient or masochistic, I'll search by filters. On ff, usually by favorites or reviews, and then also the same but updated recently so I can read something that will update eventually. On ao3, I usually search by tags, like I'll click on 'Time Travel' and narrow the fandom down to just HP and then sort by hits or bookmarks.

Also lastly, and really rarely, like maybe twice a year, I guess I'd say 'If there's smoke there's fire'? By which I mean if a story keeps popping up everywhere, you see it talked about in unrelated places, see controversy about it, people having opinions and taking sides and whatnot. Like, even if that fic isn't something I'd normally be into, like hell am I going to miss a fire.

Uh, that last metaphor ran away from me. Sorry, I havn't slept in about a day. Whatever, you know what I mean. Anyway, hope that was helpful! Good luck!

** Have you read everything on the sidebar recommendation threads? There's a lot of good stuff there.

Otherwise, I just prefer looking here rather than trawl through tons of bad fics.

** Favs of the authors I like, favs of the posters here I find insightful (if I can associate their reddit identity with a fanfiction site identity), and also favs of people producing insightful reviews on the stories I like.

** Spam authors who's works I've never bothered leaving a review for with PMs asking what their favorite fics are and when they're going to update next because all of their works are in progress and I don't read works in progress.

....wait...no..people just do that to me.

** There is no filter for 'good'. And in any case, 'good' is subjective. All you can do is filter for the characters and genres that you like and make up your own mind. Or if you want to follow the crowd, filter for the most popular stories which presumably have some indefinable quality that appeals to a lot of people.

Having just looked at two recs currently here on the first page of this sub, both of which had glaring examples of classic 'bad writing' in the very first paragraphs, I say decide for yourself.

*** I very much disagree. There /is/ a filter for 'good'. I am just not ready to release it for public use yet, but there /is/ such a filter.

**** Right.

So what criteria does this filter use? Can it detect poor spelling, grammar and punctuation, adverb overuse, epithet misuse, poor characterisation, gemstone metaphors, purple prose . . . ?

***** It works by matching your set of favourites with sets of user favourites on FFN and ranking on how often fics appear there. From my experience it works fairly well.

If your favourites don't contain /poor spelling, grammar and punctuation, adverb overuse, epithet misuse, poor characterisation, gemstone metaphors, purple pros/ then chances are, what my filter outputs won't either
