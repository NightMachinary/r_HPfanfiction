** linkffn(10709411) Basilisk-born, while it focuses on a Harry displaced in the time stream, does have some Merlin backstory and Merlin as a main character for a good chunk of the first part.

linkffn(9860311) A Long Journey Home has fem!Harry be Merlin's mentor, and we follow Merlin's story for a few chapters in it.

*** Definitely recommend A Long Journey Home. Merlin's arc alone is absolutely fantastic. The whole fic is, but Merlin's chapters are great on their own.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** There was a crossover with the Narnia Chronicles, where Harry studies with the teacher of Merlin himself in Narnia. And it was also a Severitus story.
