The Cursed Child was a little lukewarm to me, but i still cling to the idea of a well executed father-son relationship. I want to see how much Draco changed by having his child ,how much he loves him, basically a very emotionally gripping and/or fluffy story between parent and son.

I kinda want to see how Draco uses the love he has for his son to cope with the loss of his wife, to the point the child becomes the single most important reason to exist anymore.

I read something like this in a Scorbus fic but it wasn't nearly the main theme, and i wanted to know if something like that exists. Thank you so very much.

(I never was one to read something that doesn't have romance or an extremely polished plot , but the "Sirius raises Harry" fics and the irondad phenomena kinda opened the doors to my thirst for parental relationships)


** Is it okay if it's Drarry-focused?

**** linkao3('Dad says') has an amazing relationship between Draco and Scorpius. I love Scorpius in that fic ðŸ¥º But I have to warn that Draco is very down and out and kind of OOC.

  Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there.
