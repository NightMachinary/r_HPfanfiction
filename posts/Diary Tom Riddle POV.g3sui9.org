I'm really in the mood for a fanfiction where Tom Riddle/Voldemort is the main character, preferably one of his horcruxes, like when he's possessing Ginny. I'm up for any genre, angst or humor, and I accept any pairing, though I'm more partial to m/m. That's about it, have a nice day.


** linkffn(The Imposter Complex by notus oren) is decently written, though Diary!Tom has a potty mouth. The premise is that he had enough of Ginny's soul to sustain him for a short time until he could possess someone else, and he quickly decided that his original self had gone insane and needed to be replaced.

*** The downfall of being an Australian writer, my “swearing less than normal” is everyone else's “swears a lot.”

**** That's funny, because I'm Australian too :D. Not exactly population average, though; I'm a Mormon.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)
