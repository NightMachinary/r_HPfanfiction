Are there any stories where they have to create a school specifically for Muggleborns for whatever reason?

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** In a Salazar Won AU linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19), Muggleborns are taken from their parents and put into a "school" to train them for menial jobs. It's run by Dolores Umbridge.

In linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5), under Lucius's regime, Muggleborns are taken from their parents and go to Hogwarts but have separate barracks, where they are raised to be Lucius's private army. (The story takes place post-Hogwarts, so this is mostly told in narration and flashbacks, since .)

I could've sworn there was a Kwan Li fic like that as well, but I guess he had taken it down.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
