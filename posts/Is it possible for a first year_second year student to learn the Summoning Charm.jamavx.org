Like the title suggests, I am curious about it, no matter where I looked, I couldn't find an answer to this, or is it just 4th year students and above that can learn this?


** If they're particularly precocious, I see no reason why it would be impossible. Improbable maybe, but not impossible.

Edit: To add onto my own reasoning, I think an apt analogy would be science. I would find it improbable for a 13 year old, for example, to be able to understand orbitals, the reasoning behind PCR, and reaction kinetics. But it wouldn't be impossible for a precocious student to learn these things.

** Draco conjured a snake, a NEWT level action, as a 2nd, and Harry could summon a patronus, a spell too advanced for NEWT level, as a 3rd year.

While I wouldn't believe a 1st year could do it before December, I personally wouldn't bat an eye at a 2nd year succeeding.

** Canon doesn't really explain much about how magic works, including why some spells might be harder to learn than others. Fortunately, this means that you could easily justify either position depending on the needs of your story. If you want a young student to learn it, just say that Flitwick arranges his curriculum based some criteria other than ability (maybe the younger years only get to learn spells that they won't be able to cause much trouble with when they decide to be difficult). If you need a younger student to struggle or be unable to learn it, just say that it needs more concentration/power/experience/anything else than they have at their age.

As one data point, I'm pretty sure that "summoning a toy they can't reach" is a common example of accidental magic that even Rowling has used, even if it's not in the books. But that could also just be levitation used to "summon" an object and not a true summoning charm.

** Yes, most magic could be performed if the willpower and focus were used adequately. Harry manages to apparate before he goes to Hogwarts just because he really wants to escape Dudley and Tom Riddle could already use mind-controlling magic on animals even before he knew he was a wizard. Of course, when wizards become more aware of their magic they can also cast it in other circumstances than the direst ones, but also most wizards are not that competent.
