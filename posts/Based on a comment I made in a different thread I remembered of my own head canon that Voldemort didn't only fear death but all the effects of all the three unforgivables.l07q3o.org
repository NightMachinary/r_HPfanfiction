:END:
His insanity or god complex or megalomania or whatever it is did not come from Horcruxes but maybe from an overdose of confidence potion or something so that he would never take orders from anyone, thus being able to fight off the Imperius Curse. In fact, I like to believe that Harry on his own would have not so easily resisted the Imperius Curse himself was it not for that voice in his head encouraging him to do so (and that came from Voldemort's horcrux)

Also his snake-like looks were not a bodily manifestation of creating Horcruxes either. Due to a traditional (mis?)conception (scientists are still not entirely sure to date afaik) that reptiles cannot feel pain, Voldemort combined his DNA with those of snakes in order to fight off the effects of the Cruciatus.

And he also created Horcruxes to be immortal.

Any thoughts?
