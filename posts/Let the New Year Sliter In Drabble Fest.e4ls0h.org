Be sure to let me know if this is not allowed and I'll remove it.

Welcome to the First annual Draco's Den New Year Drabble Fest! This is will be done similar to the Monthly Roll A Drabbles that are done in the group, but instead of rolling the dice we will be selecting prompts and Slytherins out a bowl during a live feed!

The theme for this year's challenge is: 8th year and everyone has chosen to spend the holiday at Hogwarts instead of going home. We are asking that participants submit one Slytherin and a word prompt that will be added to the bowl for selection. This will be your writing prompt for the drabble!

Event Timeline:

Sign-ups & Prompt Collection: December 1 to December 6

Stories Due to Collection: December 28 by 9 pm EST
