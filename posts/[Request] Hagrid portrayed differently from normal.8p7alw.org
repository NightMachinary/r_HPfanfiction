  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** Hmm...well, I've asked for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qfoqd/lf_rubeus_hagrid_as_a_major_characterand_as_a/][werewolf Hagrid]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5k5bod/rubeus_hagrid_as_voldemorts_archnemesis/][Voldemort's-nemesis Hagrid]], and I once came up with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8ccu1p/lf_a_fan_fic_where_harry_died_as_a_baby_and_dobby/dxe1qj4/][ditzy entrepreneur Hagrid]].

I never got anything with them, sadly.

In any case, though, while he's not significantly different, Hagrid is a significant recurring character in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8541055/1/No-Knowledge-No-Money-No-Aim][No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim]], showing up in most chapters (though Harry is, as usual, the protagonist).
