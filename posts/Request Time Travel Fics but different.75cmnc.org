Looking for time travel fics that don't deal with the Graveyard scene.

So many of the rehash type of stories that have time travel in it have the graveyard scene and it just doesn't make sense to me. Wouldn't you want it to not happen?

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would like it to be completed or regularly updated.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jaime Evans and Fates Fool]]

An interesting fic that I just finished. A bit odd, but I enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]

Probably one of my favourite time travel fics so far, sadly appears to be abandoned.

** These fics involve time travels to Harry's Hogwarts era, but don't bother with that nauseating Graveyard Resurrection Scheme:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): She took a little less than a year, but the entire process was relatively painless and efficient.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): He dealt with Voldemort before getting to Hogwarts, but waited 5 years before killing most of his sympathizers in one fell strike.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): He, Hermione, Luna, and Susan were all time travelers and proficient killers. They killed off Voldemort's gang well before going back to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day old Rose got thrown back to Aug 31, 1991. They completed their mission on Oct 31, 1991.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

****** Almost every scene from canon that appears in OH God Not Again! is mocked terribly. I think the Chamber is my favorite, but the graveyard is also great.

******* Thanks for letting me know. I had been already reading Oh God What Again so when they told me that the graveyard scene was in it I was uncertain to continue to read it. But really, if the rest of the fic is good with the humor I honestly don't care. XD.

******** It's really very good. I've read it about three times and I think I've left reviews on every chapter. Both on FFN and Ao3. Their other works are highly entertaining as well. Especially the one where Lockhart raises Harry...lol

** I think linkao3(into the arena with your head held high by LullabyKnell) could potentially fill your request since it sounds like it frustrates you when characters travel to before then but still don't stop it from happening? It doesn't completely omit the Graveyard scene simply because when the time travel happens it's right at the beginning of that scene where the time travellers end up so it does still technically happen but it does so differently and not because they just neglected to stop it.

*** It doesn't frustrate me per say, but I still don't understand why X character doesn't do something to stop it ahead of time, I mean a innocent person (Cedric) was killed and Voldemort was brought back, wouldn't you want to make it so it took Voldemort longer to come back? Destroying the Horcruxes that they know? As well as his father's grave so it couldn't happen? That just makes more sense to me personally. But thanks, will check it out.

I love Roundabout Destiny, personally. All the Wrong Choices is also a favorite. The others are classics that have been around for a while. All either Tomione or Sirmione.

  It seemed ironic that the one thing that could ruin the magical world, the defeat of Voldemort, and Hermione Granger's perfectly ordered life was a book. Time-travel fic. Tom/Hermione. DH-compliant.
