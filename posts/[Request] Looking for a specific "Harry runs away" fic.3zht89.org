I remember reading a fic several years ago in which Harry ran away from Private Drive (I think after 5th year) and ended up in Italy, where he saved a vampire princess. He was then either turned or made an honorary vampire, I can't remember which. Later on he ends up in the US and finds high elves who had been hiding there for a long time.

If anyone can tell me the name of the fic I'd appreciate it.


** The sounds insane. I also want to read it. Someone link pls.

** I remember reading this, it turns into a bit of a harem thing at the end I think. He saves Fleur and Gabrielle at a concert from french terrorist wizards. Cant remember the name though sorry. He has a super powered time turner, and starts his quest around the world by going to Australia.
