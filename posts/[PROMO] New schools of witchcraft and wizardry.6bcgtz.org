So, I'm writing a fanfic about every magic school in the world, including many I've made up (because, come on, there has to be more than 11 schools). So far, I've got the canon ones (Hogwarts, Ilvermorny, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Castelobruxo, Uagadou, and Mahoutokoro), non-confirmed ones (Koldovstoretz), and my own ones (in China, Peru, Spain, Alaska, Italy, Greece, Croatia, India, Indonesia, Samoa, Australia, Madagascar, South Africa, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Israel and Jamaica). I've got everything more or less planned, and I'm planning on introducing creatures and tales from each country's folklore, but I was wondering if you guys could give me any tips on planning or organizing the information.

I haven't posted anything yet, just a short author's note. You can find the story in the link down below, but it's in Spanish. It's called "Albus Potter and the Thief of Ghosts", but I'll probably change the title.

** First rec: try not to make all of your invented schools sound cooler and more sane than the canon ones.

I can imagine building a table for common information, but one that wouldn't be included in the story. It would just be your reference. Things for this index would be: actual location & how its hidden; language of instruction; language of invocation - that is to say, what dead-ish language do they use to cast spells, so as not confuse it with normal speech; how are students selected/invited; size of staff & size of student populations; do the students live there or do they commute; best magic taught; unusual topics covered or not covered due to cultural biases; are adults allowed to come back for further instruction/use the resources; legends and reputations, accurate or not.

*** I had almost all of that covered, but I hadn't thought about language of invocation - thanks for the tip! The names won't be more sane than them, mainly becuase I don't want to screw up each name that isn't in a language I can speak. I speak Spanish, English, French, Italian and Greek, and can read Latin and Ancient Greek, and probably won't struggle with Portuguese due to its resemblance to Spanish. But most of the names will be a bit generic, not wart-hog-but-reversed kind of original, mainly because it covers so many different areas with so many languages I can't understand on my own that I could potentially ruin a school's name.

***** The only ones I can speak fluently are Spanish and English. I can get by with French, Italian and Greek, but nowhere near as well as with the other two. I haven't really tried speaking Latin and Ancient Greek, as I've only ever seen them written down and can understand them almost right away.

** When making up schools for large countries consider the fact that these countries may be much younger than the magical Society they serve.

India is a nation made up of many smaller groups rather than just one for the nation.

*** In addition to cultural boundaries vs political boundaries, OP should keep in mind that countries like India and China are huuuge compared to Britain and other European countries and thus ought to have multiple schools just to handle the size of the population.

The Americas also present an interesting case due to colonization patterns. I've done some thinking on the subject before and have come to believe North America would more than likely have several smaller schools serving various regions rather than one or two big ones serving each country. I also think the American schools ought to draw heavily on the native cultures and not just be European copycats.

**** On the last, it entirely depends if the native had a culture of magic, and if so, if the magicals from europe followed the same patterns as the muggles from europe.

Personally I think it would be interesting to see colonial era seperation of the United States/America within the magical community. Sure muggle mexico broke off from spain and then broke apart into california, texas and mexico. Wizard mexico, however, controls basically everything that spain held in their grasp at the height of their power, and may still be part of wizard spain, considering the fact that wizarding transportation is much faster than muggle transportation, it's very likely they wouldn't feel as far away.

***** It's an interesting concept and I've thought about it, but I'm planning on sticking to one school per country, and I don't think I'll create one in Mexico. South America will basically divided into Castelobruxo (Brazil), Peru and the Caribbean. It's easier to keep track of the characters if we stick to a handful of schools per continent. The lack of schools in some countries can be explained by wizards sending the students to the colonizing country to study there, with a few schools finally being created in the colonies.

I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES. I really do. I'm investigating each country's cultural background and I'm pretty sure it will play an important factor in some characters' arcs. As in an it's-our-differences-that-makes-us-who-we-are kind of thing.

I'm still researching though, so nothing's sure yet. Thanks for the info!

*** Wow, thanks, I didn't know that. I'm looking up each country's history but I hadn't really considered the fact that one big nation may be a group of smaller ones that have united relatively recently.

*** I've thought about it, but I doubt it. I was translating the introduction and it was taking me ages to make sure every word was right, and it sounded a bit robotic, not like natural speech, you know? Besides, if I decide to introduce an original object or creature or something like that, its translated name won't make much sense. I can speak English, but I would've never thought of a good name to translate, say, "pensive" into Spanish. The same applies reversed: had the word been "pensadero" in Spanish, I would've never been able to find a good enough translation in English. I don't know if I'm making myself clear, but I'm on a hurry and don't have much time to write this. The point being, I don't think I'll translate it because translating original words into another language and making the speech sound natural while translating is very complicated. If anyone offers to translate it, though, I'm all ears.

By the way, sorry if there are any typos. My keyboard is kind of shitty.
