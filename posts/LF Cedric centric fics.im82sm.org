I LOVE Cedric. Looking for any good fics with him, preferably without him dying. Any pairing works, especially love him with Hermione.

Either complete or updated recently and regularly.


** Finding Himself is great. It involves Cedric surviving the cemetery and developing a relationship with Hermione. Umbrage is super villainous in this one, it's great. Linkffn(4594634). There is an unfinished sequel.

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU

  Hermione is surprised when Cedric Diggory, a handsome 6th year, starts chatting her up before the Quidditch World Cup. Ginny's convinced he's chatting her up because he fancies her. But in reality, it's so much more. (Written for the Hermione's Nook RarePair Soulmate Fest 2020; Cedric/Hermione, HEA)
