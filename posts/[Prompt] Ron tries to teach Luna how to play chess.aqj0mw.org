** Luna would keep making fatal, but utterly unique moves. Eventually she'd get better and better, but every time it looked like she was actually getting somewhere, she'd commit suicide again. After hours of this, Ron would be like, "What are you doing!!"

"Trying to loose in a new way every time. It's actually getting a bit difficult now."

"But that's not thE POINT!"

"But it's more fun."

"You don't play chess to h ave fun! You play to win. And-and to be cleverer than the other person."

"Well, if I keep trying to loose, eventually I'm going to find that it's so hard that I can't do it. Then we'll both win!"

​

...if you can't tell, I'm inspired by Tak from NotW. The point is to play a beautiful game.

*** That's the Fanon version of his character, while we know he is skilled his victories over Harry (a novice) and McGonagall's set (skill level unknown) doesn't make him a chess master.

And remember that the only real trap that couldn't be easily beaten by a prepared adult was the mirror so there really isn't any need to suppose that the set was meant to be more of a challenge than say the flying keys (requiring significant but not exceptional skill).

**** Chess pieces in the wizarding world are semi-sentient, enough to know when someone is good at chess and seem to know how to play the game well, which is why they get on Harry so much. There isn't a reason to believe that McGonagall's set isn't the same way (in terms of being good at chess.)

Ron had to beat that chess set without losing three major pieces. Rook(Hermione), Knight(himself), Bishop(Harry). Losing himself early means they lose the chess game, because neither Harry or Hermione are good enough to win. If he loses either of the other two, they can't proceed forward. Even against a decent opponent, this is a difficult task, and takes a lot of skill. Dumbledore wasn't joking about it being 'the best game hogwarts has seen in many years.'

Plus, Ron has been mentioned beating other people easily. He crushed Ernie, he beat Percy regularly, I imagine he probably played against his father and beat him too.

I remember reading somewhere that the chess game in the first book was based on/made by master level chess players, so Ron basically beat a master level chess player with huge restrictions. So no, Luna will NOT beat Ron.

I don't remember Ron beating Ernie at Chess, but I do recall that Percy is apparently dreadful, given that Harry once reflects that Ron might not have beaten him so badly if Percy didn't keep trying to help.

As for other Weasley relatives, I always thought Ron was taught how to play by his grandfather.

***** Unless you read (and can produce) that statement from JRK then it is irrelevant. If you can then it goes in the category of things she spent no time considering the consequences of. The chess having some level of awareness doesn't mean they can play chess at the master level, that's like saying that every chess AI is Deep Blue.

Ignoring the fact that you are positing a chess master Voldie, how much experience does Ron have against other styles because likely him Percy and Arther would use similar styles there are many different approaches to the game. As I mentioned in another comment Luna could use a style that focuses on getting in his head as opposed to just countering his movements directly. And we know that Ron has issues that can be exploited on that front.

******* Why do you think that was his “one thing”, he did do more after Book 1. There are a lot more interesting ways to explore the character than: plays chess, eats a lot, and has no grasp of human emotions. All you have to do is take book 1 Ron (a young boy with issues but trying to be a good man) and allow him to grow from there.

****** Voldemort is brilliant, so it stands to reason that he would be pretty good at chess.

And I found the reference I was talking about, although it is for the movie instead of the book.

Jeremy Silman, international chess master, created the chess scene in the movie. Some of the moves were cut out.

The game in the books is described vaguely but if we take the movie into the account, Ron actually is a chess master.

******* Do you understand what the title of chess master signifies, it goes beyond “pretty good at chess” and no the fact that a chess master helped with the movie has no bearing on canon.

Edit: Now that I am home and not trying to use the crappy mobile app I can add more: The official title is Grandmaster (I had to look it up so not bragging or anything) and there are about 1621 Grandmasters currently in a population of around 7.7 billion people so the idea of 3 coming from the same school is ridiculous. On top of that there are 36 people in history who won the title at 15 or younger and Ron would be the youngest ever at 11 (or even if he was 12 by the end of book one he would still be the youngest by several months)
