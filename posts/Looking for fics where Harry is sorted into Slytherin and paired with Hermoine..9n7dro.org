  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

***** Alice Longbottom is Harry's Godmother.. so ideally Harry should've gone to the Longbottoms after Halloween.. which would probably cause Neville and Harry to have a more brotherly relationship than in the book.. OP is requesting stories where they realize this fact, and start acting accordingly..

  After his mother died, his father abandoned him with his relatives. Harry grew up emulating his uncle, a shrewd businessman.

However, his plans get derailed when it's revealed that not only is he a wizard, but his father is one too and that his twin brother is the famous Boy Who Lived!
