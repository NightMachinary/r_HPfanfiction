The idea behind this story is that somehow a still impressionable, 11 year old Bellatrix Black ends up in the future with attends Hogwarts alongside Harry Potter. Through out the years the two of them eventually develop and friendship and fall in love during the original story. This post is to see if anyone can help me with the details of the story: who're friends, who aren't, what changes, what's still the same, ect. I mainly want to focus on what is absolutely mandatory in each book, so if it doesn't advance the plot or establish character relationships try not to include it. This is because I'm trying to summarize this entire story into 165,000 words.(this way it actually gets finished) and is broken down as follows:

Year 1: 15,000 Year 2: 15,000 Year 3: 20,000 Year 4: 30,000 Year 5: 35,000 Year 6: 25,000 Year 7: 25,000

Anyone who comes to discuss and plan out this story with me and anybody else who shows up is doing a big favor and is greatly appreciated.


** First off, here are a handful of questions to consider:

- The most important: Does canon Bellatrix also exist alongside this new Bellatrix?

  - Like, will Bella read the news one day and see a person with the same name as her in Azkaban?
  - If that is the case, will there be a whole existential crisis about fate and the like?

- Did Bellatrix know she was going to travel in time beforehand?
- Does Bellatrix hide her identity, or does she proudly proclaim herself as Bellatrix Black?

  - The Sorting Hat and the Hogwarts enrollment system will know her real name, so what happens then?
  - If canon Bella exists what's the reaction of the staff?

- If canon Bellatix exists as well, does Neville suspect anything?

  - What would he do if he figured it out?
  - If he does figure it out, when does he?
  - Are they friends before he figures it out?

- Does Bellatrix try to contact her family members?

  - How will she react to finding all the adults in her life all dead?
  - How will she find Narcissa or Andromeda when they've both married?
  - How does she react to finding out Sirius in jail and that Regulus is dead?

- Does Bella find out about the Boy-Who-Lived before or after she meets Harry?

*** 1.) Canon Bellatrix does NOT exist in this new timeline. The way I see this working is that back in the 60's Bellatrix Black disappeared and is now back not aging a day. 2.) Bellatrix's journey through time was not planned for at all and she is stuck. 3.) Seeing as the Blacks were a proud pureblood family seeing themselves as royalty I'm sure Bellatrix would make her identity known. 4.) So canon Bellatrix is gone but that does make me think that we now have a more confident Neville since it's likely his parents wouldn't have been tortured nearly as badly. 5.) The way I see it is Bellatrix would really only care about her sisters' fates. I feel like she didn't have a strong attachment to her parents and she wouldn't know Sirius or Regulus that well at this time. Back to her sisters, I think she would be disgusted at Andromeda marrying a muggleborn and would be satisfied at Narcissa's marriage to Lucius. 6.) Do to how much of a big deal Harry's defeat of Voldemort is I'm certain Bellatrix would've heard about the boy who lived, and this gives me a (reasonable) explanation as for why Bellatrix would seek out to even associate with Harry.

I'm sure there are more details so I'd like it if we could keep doing things this way.

**** Why do you think she wouldn't have been close to Sirius or Regulus? This may be my bias for the backstory of /A Keen Observer/ talking, but I feel like in a family that is pureblood cousins, and such would matter like siblings. The only thing I can think of would be age (I don't remember what the difference is between them, but she certainly cared about Sirius's betrail enough to seek him out and taunt him.

***** It is their age difference that makes me think the two wouldn't be that close. Bellatrix is about eight years older than Sirius so when she Time Travels he would have only been around two or three years old. In terms of Regulus Lestrange, it has been established that she never really loved him with the marriage really being of convience more than anything else.

** So you want a canon rehash with Bellatrix included?

I'm open to being a sounding board or something like that, but not the kind of heavy planning I think you're implying.

This sounds pretty interesting, however, and I might give it a read.

** I'm working on an AU and for planning, When thinking about events and the stations of canon I set out a chart with three columns looking at the main events of the book (CoS for me). The columns are: What is the antecedent (cause of the event) >*what is the event*> What ate the consequences of the event (Positive and negative). I used the book timeline in HP lexicon to help set this up.I asked my self some questions about the event

1. Would the change I made to make this AU prevent this event from happening?
2. If the answer is yes, might I still need a consequence from this event to happen? For example, In my story, I might have Harry and Ron not miss the Express. If the Angila never makes it to Hogwarts what happens with the spiders? For now, I've just made note that I will need to work around this.
3. If the answer is no, and the event is still likely to happen, I ask my self how will the character changed by the AU change their actions during the event?

This sounds like a lot, but I suspect the further along I go, the more events won't happen the way they occur in cannon. I hope this is helpful; I haven't gotten very far myself because of time constraints. Good luck!

** This is going far better than I expected (seeing as last time I opened a thread nobody joined in), I really appreciate your help so far. To help steer this thread towards what I'm looking for a bit more, I'm proposing two questions about Bellatrix's new life.

*Where is she living now that she's reappeared long after the death of her parents?

*What's the housing situation between Harry and Bellatrix like? Harry in Gryffindor and Bellatrix in Slytherin, both in Slytherin, (playing devil's advocate) both in Gryffindor, some other combinations?

*** Where she lives: As of when she arrives in 1991, I imagine finding a place to live would be difficult. Why would she know where any of her family are? I also imagine she would be too proud to ask for shelter. So for the summer leading up to her first year, perhaps she could spend it at Diagon Alley like Harry did in PoA. I imagine she would be resourceful enough to make it work after the initial shock. She'd try to withdraw some cash from the Black vault at Gringotts after proving her identity through some sort of blood magic, or she brought her key with her when she time-travelled. Then she could pay for school supplies and rent. First semester at Hogwarts, I'd imagine through Draco, Bellatrix would eventually correspond with Narcissa, which would then end with Bella moving to Malfoy Manner.

Houses: Let's review: First Harry. Harry could have gone easily into either Gryffindor or Slytherin, but three things made him not want to go to Slytherin: The fact that Voldemort was in Slytherin, the fact Malfoy got into Slytherin and both Hagrid and Ron's comments about the house in general. Bellatrix, comes from the house of Black, a notoriously Slytherin House. She was raised with the mindset that she would be in that house and nothing would change that. To change Harry's house to Slytherin, you'd have to have Bella, the only difference from canon, convince him that the house isn't so bad, with Ron Weasley in the same compartment. You'd have to bring up some serious Ron bashing to pull that off. To change Bella's house to anything else, you'd have to change her entire ideology, something that would be far harder thanks to her Black pride. Unless you want to be really, really unfair to Ron's character, Harry's going to Gryffindor, and Bella's going to Slytherin.

On that note, here's a scenario that could play out that could put Bella and Harry on at least somewhat friendly terms while on the train. Bella meets Draco on the train, after Bella introduces herself, Draco doesn't believe her and she storms off... right into Harry and Ron's compartment. Ensue talking point of Malfoy being a prat, and then introductions, so on and so forth.

**** Your idea is the most likely of what's to happen on the train. However, I'd like it if you could indulge in my idea of a both in Gryffindor scenario. What I thought might be interesting looking really far in the future is Bella taking Neville's sword of Gryffindor momment. The way I see it if she was in lion house she'd start off hating breaking her family's tradition but would eventually enjoy her new house while doubting her placement since she has a Slytherin background and some traits. But in the battle for Hogwarts ends up pulling the sword proving it to everyone and most importantly herself. The way she'd probably end up there would be during the train ride after the Draco's a prat conversation Bellatrix thinks to herself that if people like Draco populate Slytherin than she'd rather follow Potter and his foolish desire for Gryffindor. What do you think of that?

***** Sorry for the late reply.

I can definitely see Bella following Harry to Gryffindor, as she definitely has a lust for power, Boy-Who-Lived and everything.

As for taking Neville's moment, personally I don't think it's that fair on him. Maybe if you could somehow share it between them?

****** Oh no, don't think that I hate Neville or something, I just thought that giving the moment to Bella would be nice since I don't think Neville would have his old arc anymore. One of the main reasons for his lack of confidence was Bellatrix having driven his parents insane and being forced to live with his grandmother. Since she wouldn't have done it in this timeline I feel that he would be more confident here and wouldn't feel he had to prove why he's in Gryffindor.

******* The Lestrange brothers still tortured Anne and Frank, it wasn't just Bellatrix. Though without the power that Bella has, it's likely that one of them could have survived with their mind intact. In canon, Anne was mobile while Frank was essentially catatonic. The way that I imagine it, Frank would still be bound to St. Mungoes though I'm better condition than he was in canon, while Anne can safely stay at home, with some lingering side effects. Similar to the victim of a stroke.

******** Yeah, that's along the lines of what I was thinking! Frank and Anbe still would've been tortured, just not to the same degree Bellatrix did. Maybe since Anne was still able to return even after the torture she'd be a living example of how to be brave and get through a tough situation for Neville. While the fate of his father would cause him to aspire to help fight against death-eaters in a more cautious and supportful way.

** This is probably the biggest thing that I need help with trying to figure out in the story. What are the MANDATORY scenes in the books that MUST appear in the fanfiction and How does having Bellatrix change them. For the sake of making things simpler let's start with Philosopher's Stone. If the story had to be condensed into 15,000 words what should be written in detail and what gets a passing mention?
