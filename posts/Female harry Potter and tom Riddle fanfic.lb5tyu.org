:END:
Can someone please help me find a female harry Potter and Tom Marvalo Riddle fanfic. I read it a long time ago but now I can't find it, I don't remember much about it but: I know it has something to do with fem!harry trying to fix her occlumency barrier in the R.O.R and somehow she ends up in Voldemort mindscape, I don't know how but they ended up getting along, after that it's hazy... I don't know if it's useful but, I think tom created a spell to absorb books (?) and he showed it to her, his animagus(?) is a magpie, and he helps her get her lady/heir rings as the first courtship gift. This fanfic has Dumbledore/ weasley/granger Bashing. Ps : I apologise for any mistake you find, English is not my first language (nor my second...) and Thank you for your help, have a nice day or a good night.


** I am not sure that's the story you are talking about, but I read one a while ago. It's called The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles, and it sounds pretty similar. I don't remember about animagus transformation tho.

Edit: I just checked. He is a magpie, and Dumbledore is bashed. The fanfic is on Archive of Our Own.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]

*** I'm sorry, it's pretty similar but it's not the story I was looking for. Thank you so much for the recommendation though.
