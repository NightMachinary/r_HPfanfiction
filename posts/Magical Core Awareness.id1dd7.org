I've been a part of this fandom since 1999, and I peek my head back in every few years to make sure everything is progressing as it should.

Imagine my surprise when I see that Magical Cores are no longer being taken seriously?! How could this be? I was stupefied! Stunned!

It was my peers and I, the Four Fandom Founders of yore, that put in the blood, sweat and tears that eventually led us to the most factually correct and verifiable conclusion in the history of wizard-kind: Magical Cores are real and determine the power of a wizard. Sadly, the ordeal drained us greatly and we were unable to continue our research. We had hoped that you, our children, would take the stand in our absence and dig further!

Instead, I come back to find that some sort of cream-colored, bendy, architectural phenomenon has used the Dark Arts to hide away the truth and convince everyone that Magical Core Theory is useless nonsense!

Unforgivable!

I challenge this curved communal stone figure to a duel to put this tomfoolery to rest.


** One of the reasons why I love HP magic so much is skill, intelligence, and knowledge matters.

Put a navy seal with a pistol in a room with 10 other people with pistols and the navy seal isn't winning, no matter how good he is. He might take a few with him, but he still dies.

Put Dumbledore in a room full of death eaters and the death eaters run away.

Do I not doubt that there's an innate phenotypical range when it comes to the factor of innate magical strength? Yes. But for strength to solely depend on magical cores is lazy writing and is thematically worse for it.

*Am I so going to regret writing this when this post turns out to be a parody? Yes.*

Edit: Found out, it is, in fact satire from discord. */Yes, that's right, I have the power of a seer./*

** While there might be haters on this sub, they're still pretty popular. I've seen stories published within the last couple years that still use cores as part of their world building. A lot of stories recommended on this sub use cores as well.

People don't like them as much because it's a quick and cheesy way of making Harry powerful. It's an easy way of restricting what magic Harry can't do (his core can't handle that magic) while ensuring that Harry will usually win against others as long as his core is bigger. He pushes more magic or he outlasts them in a duel. Why can he win against Malfoy or Bellatrix? His humongous core of course

A good story with magical cores should have extra consideration for what makes a wizard powerful. Just focusing on the core is too boring. Things like control, experience, magical knowledge, etc.

It's not the worst trope, and you can still have a decent story with this type of system. Of course overall I prefer non-cores stories, but those are pretty rare.

** I remain bitter at the mention of magical cores ever since my first fic was called out for improperly describing magic because 'it's supposed to be a magical core' when I had never heard of such a concept being applied to HP.

** I dislike magical cores because of how they impoverish magic. They replace something that is a complex combination of personality, mood, experience, knowledge, intelligence, moral character, and plain old hard work---things integral to the character---with a single arbitrary Power Meter.

Notice how canon doesn't have characters who are unintelligent and weak-willed yet powerful, nor those who are wilful and intelligent yet are almost squibs. Instead, canon has Lockhart---the character most obsessed with how others perceive him---whose magic gives him effective and precise Memory Charms, but fails him in most other ways.

Canon has Harry, for whom "wearing his emotions on his sleeve" gives him a powerful Patronus, while crippling his Occlumency. It has, in contrast, Hermione, who knows exactly how she wants the world to be and always works to impose her will on it magically or not---and whose magic is just as precise and efficaceous---but whose mind is ever preoccupied with all the problems of the world, making it hard for her to cast a Patronus in the face of a Dementor. It gives us Neville, whose magic is crippled by his fear and the pressure of the expectations put on him by his overbearing relatives---and which he masters as he masters himself (which happens largely /before/ he gets a new wand, recall).

*** You are romanticizing canon. You have imagined much more than JKR actually put in.

I'd recommend you go read the actual canon lore about Lockhart. It's disappointing how she retconned him into being a super-genius whose magical abilities were stunted (as an adult) because.... he used one charm so much. ðŸ¤®

**** I am not going to spend time looking for some vaguely described saying. If you want me to read it, give me a link.

As it is, I don't see a contradiction based on what you've described. As Lockhart becomes more and more preoccupied with a particular spell for a particular purpose, his magic becomes similarly preoccupied.

***** I feel ya. Google is hard.

Anyway, the story goes that Lockhart was a gifted wizard, but his laziness and reliance on the memory charm meant he sucked at all other magic. Kind of like how Harry using the Disarming Charm over and over meant he couldn't do any other.... oh, wait. No one else in the series ever dealt with that issue.

** I had a similar shock too. Can you imagine my man Snape getting so much hate simply because he pointed out that Potter was strutting as if he owned the place? Or those lovely Dursleys being painted as child abusers when they put a roof over Harry's head? Or that sweet lady, Umbridge being considered second worst only to Voldemort, when all she tried to do was bring in some order to that madhouse that's called Hogwarts?

What's this community coming to?

Contrast the complexity, subtlety, and originality of that system vs "magical core goes brrrr".

*** Ah Taure, still writing dissertations on magical theory. Never change.

I broadly agree with you, although I still feel that having a small "inherent" factor to magical ability isn't a bad concept. Such variation should be overshadowed by the factors you mentioned.

*** There you are! Finally, he shows his face!

Magical cores have plenty of subtlety! Each sensation associated with a core tells you about that person's base personality; so when I write about Harry having a huge, caramel-flavored, rosemary scented, ribbed, green magical core, I'm not only talking about the dominativeness and competitiveness he should be showing, but also the effects of the Dursley household, where his experiences must have made him consciously act against his natural inclinations.

Magical Core Theory is not only the most verifiable and factually correct magi-scientific model of the past century, it is also a brilliant writing tool in the hands of anyone skilled enough to use it.

** I'm not a fan of the "Magical Core" theory because I don't think it mix well with the world Rowling built.

From the few fics I have read, a "Magical Core" looks a lot like the "Dantian" you can see in a Xiantia fics, a physical and/or spiritual place where the Qi/ Magic is produced and stored. When talking about Magical cores, problem like "Magical Endurance" and "Innate power of spells" are often mentioned, but they can somehow be explained by the narrative.\\
But if the Wizarding World has some Magical Dantians, the adult could just observe the "Magical Core" of their children to determine if they were Squibb or not, rather than trying to "Force the Magic" by startling them. If the "Magical Core" could be sealed or destroyed (as seen in some Manipulative Dumbledore fics), then the DoM research papers in DH would not be "Magical Nazi Propaganda against Mudbloods" but "Something the make some sense and need to be studied".

Of course, this is a parody post talking about fanfictions, so people are free to write whatever they want. I just feel like to justify Magical Cores, author would need to change the world so much it would barely be Harry Potter anymore (then again, other tropes like Lordship or Muggle AU are also changing the world so much it's almost a new universe with Canon so it's just one trope among many).

Also, from a reader point of view, Magical Core are often a cheap way to make Harry better than others without having to do anything, which is kinda boring.
