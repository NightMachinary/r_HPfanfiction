Rather than the usual dimensional travel stories, where Harry ends up in a not-quite-the-same mirror of canon or in another series altogether, I'm looking for a more... /interplanar/ style. Harry ends up in some sort of eldritch realm of fractured reality, utterly alien and nearly incomprehensible. Maybe he accidentally teleports himself there, or falls through a random portal (or conveniently placed Veil) or crack-in-the-walls-of-reality(tm).

Wherever he ends up bears absolutely no resemblance to our universe, what with its utterly inhospitable alien landscapes, horrifying eldritch locales, and probable plethora of perilous pests. He then has to fight for his survival every step of the way as he attempts to return home, his trials and tribulations inevitably changing him so that when he does find his way out, he is barely recognizable as human anymore.

Alternatively, maybe he ends up traveling through places like that /intentionally/ in the pursuit of knowledge and powerful magic. Stepping in and out of our reality and /others/ at will, walking forgotten and forbidden paths. Essentially a Planewalker!Harry.

Bonus points if it's a semi-comedic post-DH story where he regularly brings back "presents" for Teddy from the places he travels.

"What's this Harry?"

"It's a shard of crystallized time from the fractured planes of eternal twilight."

"Why is it screaming and writhing with tendrils of darkness?"

"It's allergic to our reality."

"Oh. Okay then. Why are /you/ writhing with tendrils of darkness then?"

"Our reality is allergic to me."

** AFAIK Fractured Apocalypse is the only fanfic like that. No dimension travel though.

** 1)The Eyes » Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash (finished)

** 1) October » It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

Reality bending fracturing

2) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus » As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
