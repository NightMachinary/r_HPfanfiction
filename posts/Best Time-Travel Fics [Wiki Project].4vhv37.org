[[/u/Pashow][u/Pashow]]:

I'll get the obvious ones out of the way:

*Backwards with Purpose:* linkffn(4101650)

I /personally/ don't care for this fic, but there's little to criticize about it as far as writing is concerned. Every time it's mentioned, it's referred to as the "gold standard" of time travel fics, so while I disagree, there's a good chance you'll like it.

*Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time:* linkffn(4068153)

This is certainly a case of not going easy on you if that's what you're after. Highly unique fic with a lot of merit, but the writing can be a little hard to get through at times. If you like something a bit more "out there", this is certainly worth looking at.

--------------

Linkffn(altered destinies by dobbyelflord)

--------------

Linkffn(A Long Journey Home) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon)

[[/u/Reichbane][u/Reichbane]]: A Long Journey Home is definitely an A tier work.

--------------

[[/u/TheOneNate][u/TheOneNate]]:

Stages of Hope is not strictly time travel (it's dimensional travel) but is written incredibly well. The character development and take on Harry and Hermione after having been through a war is absolutely stunning.

linkffn(6892925)

--------------

[[/u/sunshineallday][u/sunshineallday]]:

If you don't mind complexity, this is definitely one for you. It's dark, confusing, and downright frustrating at times, but it's one of my favorite time travel fics.

linkffn(Destiny Redefined by thejealousone)

--------------

[[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]]:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]*, linkffn(5511855): Harry went back 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. I like this one even better than *Backward with Purpose*.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]*, linkffn(4740107): Ginny went back alone, and finished off Voldemort in a very efficient way.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]*, linkffn(10687059): is mostly from Hermione's POV on a time-traveling Harry, and how she came to terms with what Harry did.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]*, linkffn(10972919): someone died in the 2010s, turned up in young Tom Riddle's head as Jerry (Harry?), and started guiding him towards world domination.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9757451/1/Three-Turns][Three Turns]]*, linkffn(9757451): Harry & Hermione time travel to the Marauder era.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]*, linkffn(8581093): One of the best Hermione in Marauder era story.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]*, linkffn(10871795): A great story showing how 'Hermione traveling back to Marauder Era should have worked'.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]]*, linkffn(3735743): Snape's second chance with Lily.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6548167/1/His-Greatest-Wish][His Greatest Wish]]*, linkffn(6548167): Another Snape/Lily story, with heavy James Potter bashing though.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]*, linkffn(4536005): is quite hilarious.

--------------

linkffn(Time Warp by Kitten1011)

--------------

"Reunion": Hermione finds a way to send the minds of her, Harry, Susan and Luna back to the past. linkffn(4655545)

--------------

Linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die)

--------------

linkffn(7410369)

--------------

[[/u/megabanette][u/megabanette]]:

My absolute fave fic of all time. Harry goes back to teenage Tom Riddle era but Riddle follows him back.

linkffn(Fate's Favorite)

--------------

Harry travels back to the graveyard, and has 12 hours to defeat Voldemort. linkffn(6256154)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.

** One series I don't think I've ever seen recommended on here is the Dissonant Melody Trilogy, linkao3(3368597) and linkao3(3368927). Due to the way the diverging timelines work, I think they can really be read in either order, though reading the 2000 word prequel, Desperate Overture, first is probably a good idea. linkao3(3313406)

It's been a fair while since they were updated, it looks like the author has fallen off the face of the earth, which is a shame. Everything here is well written and though not paticularly innovative indiviudally, they way that both stories seemed to building towards meeting up was very cool and just makes it more of a shame that they'll probably never be finished. I'd reccomend.

[[/u/OwlPostAgain][u/OwlPostAgain]]:

I love a good time travel/Peggy Sue fic, and I've read most of the big ones like Nightmares of Futures Past and Backwards without Purpose. A lot of people don't like to read unfinished fics, but frankly it's never bothered me as long as the fic is long enough to enjoy. All of these fics are 30k+ words, most of them 50k+.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts][Stunning Shifts]]* - During a publicity stunt, Harry and 5 others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (80k words)

Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Draco, and Zabini are thrown into a world where the war hasn't ended. Features friendly Slytherin snark, Order interference, and an AU!Harry with his own personality.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486108/1/From-the-Flame-to-the-Spark][From the Flame to Spark]]* - Ginny Weasley pulls a PeggySue after Harry dies in the final battle. Featuring a determinator!Ginny who doesn't care how the previous timeline went, she's going to save Harry no matter what. (70k words)

Ginny finds herself in 1991. Her first act is to break Sirius out of Azkaban and recruit him as her partner in crime. Features: Strong and independent Ginny, lots of Ginny/Sirius friendship, and a totally oblivious 11-year-old Harry.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8857265/1/An-Accident-in-Time][An Accident in Time]]* - After an unfortunate accident involving an experimental time travelling device and a naked girl, impulsive James Potter II has been sent back in time almost fifty years to a world where Death Eaters terrorizes the neighborhoods and his Auror grandfather can only be confronted after his first four cups of morning coffee. This is bound to cause some headaches. (110k words)

Starts out as a fairly light and uncomplicated time travel story, but things start getting more complicated quickly. Features: light-hearted next gen interactions, Harry the Angry Auror, and humour in unexpected places.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10714425/1/Messing-With-Time][Messing with Time]]* - Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange. (40k words)

It's hard to do powerful!Harry well. What makes this fic work is that Harry's abilities are grounded in his experience as an Auror rather than some otherworldly power. He's able to evade Auror capture not because he has five Animagus forms, but because he's spent 10 years working with Aurors. He knows the handbook, the weaknesses, and most of the players.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357627/1/Scorpius-Malfoy-and-the-Improbable-Plot][Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot]]* - Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. (50k words) Harry finds himself in 40 years in the past with James, Albus, Lily, Scorpius, Victoire, and Teddy, and has zero control over any of them. One of my favorite humor fics of all time. Older than the other fics above and unlikely to be ever finished, but you don't read it for the plot anyway.

These are just my favorites, so if anyone else has any that they think are underrated, please share. :)

[[/u/PyschoGeek][u/PyschoGeek]]:

Ooooh, I /love/ time-travel fics. I have a few recs of my own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined][Destiny Redefined]] : /Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story./\\
Takes place one year after the epilogue. Rather unique time-travel mechanics with Harry going back in time using a potion for only a few hours, causing changes, and then having to live in a new AU world based on the changes he made in the past. Harry fucks up monumentally the first time, and now he has to fix it by further trips to the past. Lots of plot twists and major character deaths. Harry/Ginny. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] : /Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours./\\
Fast paced, frantic action with a highly driven and ruthless protagonist. Harry/Ginny. Highly recommended as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] : /In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)/\\
This one is set in the ancient times. The arc with Merlin and Jasmine (as Morgana) is simply amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7644616/1/Hallowed-Time-Twists][Hallowed Time Twists]] : /Mixing the Potter kids with the Master of Death, not-so-secret horcruxes, haywire magic, and the dawning Second War could only end in catastrophe. All was well? Harry Potter really shouldn't have tempted fate like that. For the Potters are now stuck in a year where Voldemort is far more than a half-forgotten nightmare. --- Canon compliant, Next Generation Time Travel./\\
Rather slow paced, but has some really good ideas. The Potter family arrives in Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. Harry/Ginny as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2894304/1/Young-Again-The-Rewrite][Young again : The Rewrite]] : PostHBP. /When all hope seems lost and everybody is dead, Harry transports his soul into the body of his one year old self. This time, he's going to try and set things right./\\
Harry and McGonagall travel back to the time of the first war. Its slightly dated, but it has a few very good scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6083930/1/A_Clock_on_the_Face_of_Hell][A Clock on the Face of Hell]] : /Fate was sealed that night. I was to live and fight, to breathe and conquer. The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend./\\
Harry and Flitwick travel in time to the time of the Grindelwald war. This one is really good, with a great mentor!Flitwick. Highly recommended.

linkffn(The Hogwarts Strike Team) is a pretty good new story. I haven't been keeping up with it, but I liked what I read up to chapter 17 or so. It's Harry and Hermione time-traveling together.

This one is short, and written from James Potter's point of view. It's Harry/Hermione. linkffn(Many Thanks) linkffn(Pride of Time) is a great Severus/Hermione, with Hermione being the one to travel back in time.

--------------

[[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]]:

*A Second Chance*, linkffn(5251301), sends Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna back to their first year. The heroes are a little overpowered, but there is a twist later.

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107), only sends Ginny back after everything was lost. She got rid of Voldemort in a very efficient and non overpowered way.

*Here and There*, linkffn(7525570), Hermione/Ginny femme slash, time turner travel; the story is actually quite good apart from an illogically overpowered Fenrir Greyback at the end

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine.
