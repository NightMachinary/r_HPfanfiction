Rather the psychological moments, or just affects him in some way, like PTSD or something. Maybe Dumbledore, Snape or someone else has to get someone to help Harry or something

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing, or if there are, please let them get forgiven by the end.

Am fine with het/Slash/femslash

Would rather not have Dark/Evil Harry, please

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine
