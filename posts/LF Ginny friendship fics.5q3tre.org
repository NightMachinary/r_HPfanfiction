** I asked this same question a year ago. I'd recommend "Faith and Understanding," which was by far the best fic surrounding the platonic friendship of Ginny and Luna I've ever read. Sadly, it was taken down--I think the author just canceled her account.

Having said that, "A Night Without Stars" is very good.
