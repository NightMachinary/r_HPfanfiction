I recently rewatched Order of the Pheonix and was suprised how much more I appreciated the film as an adult compared to when I was younger. While I was originally less fond of the film's darker tone (the book didn't come off as dark), now the film's portrayal of fighting the darkness resonated with me on a whole new meaning. I wrote about it for a blog I am starting back up and decided to share it!

I know this isn't fanfiction but figured this would be a good place to discuss if anyone else had similar experiences with Order of the Pheonix or any of the other Wizarding World movies? Looking forward to discussing this more.
