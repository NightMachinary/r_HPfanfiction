:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
-Harry was raised by a dark witch. A disowned OC I think.

-He goes by Harrison and he's in a magical disguise (using a rune).

-He gets forcefully summoned to a death eater meeting where Voldemort recognizes how powerful he is and that the young snakes were played by Harry.

-Harry is in Slytherin, but he's pretends to be weak and stupid.

-Voldemort makes him live with the Malfoys to keep an eye on him.

-I believe he found out Rabastan or Rudolpus is his father.

-Lily is alive, but gave Harry up for adoption.

-Last I know it was a WIP.
