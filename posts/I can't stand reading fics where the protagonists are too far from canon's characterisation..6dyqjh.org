It just feels like I'm reading about new characters under a familiar name. For example, I've never been able to stomach Dark!Harry fics because it feels like it's just too... alien? Yet writers seem to do this shit way too often. I started reading linkffn(12240216) and enjoy it for the most part because of the witty dialogue that's actually /witty/ and not a neckbeard's reimagining of a convo they had (y'all know what I mean even if I worded it really badly), but it reads like a Jily fic due to the way Harry acts, instead of a slightly smarmier Harry fic. Even if Daphne has no established personality in canon, she's written as Lily 2.0. I don't know who else feels like this, but it seems to not be too common to hear the same opinions as mine outside of canon-compliant writers.


** AUs are kinda my jam, so I'm more lax about divergent characterization ... /buuuuuut/ ... I prefer there to 1) be a good in-story reason for it, and 2) the canon personality should be the foundation for the altered one. They can be different, but recognizably so.

Otherwise people might as well put OCs into the story -- it's more honest and I'll probably nitpick it a hell of a lot less.

That's easier than having to characterize from scratch, I imagine.

*** AUs are one of my favourite things too, and a well-characterized AU is a thing of beauty. :D

** Now this might come across as a bit dickish but if you want canon characterisation then avoid AU, people like Northumbrian, FloreatCastellum do wonderful post Hogwarts stories where they attempt to keep the canon feel. The story you linked has AU as the first thing in the summary. Personally I think AUs where they try and keep canon personalities are worse. A person is shaped by their experiences, in AU or rewrites the author wants to change this so Harry will experience different things and therefore be a different person.

In my opinion it is a miracle that Harry coming from the background he did is such a nice person and so trusting. Maybe there is the potential for mumbo-jumbo involving the horcux in his head containing so much hate that to repel it he became super nice but really he'd have every reason to be a dick. I can therefore understand why people might want to write darker, or more solitary Harry's. They will write with what they can understand and engage with. A lot of fanfiction starts with the idea of what if? Now like it or loathe it, it can raise interesting ideas. If Harry was more lonely and less trusting would he have still gone into Gryffindor? What consequences does that have? Poor characterisation is when the eleven year old speaks like an adult or their actions and personality are opposed or it is shaped by experiences they never had.

If we look at canon Harry what sort of personality do we see? We actually miss most of his day to day interactions with people and tend to follow him in high pressure scenarios.We know that he always tries to do the right thing but how much of this stems from his innate nature and how much from Dumbledore at the end of first year? He isn't overly friendly, he only has two close friends and seems on speaking terms with a few more but for the most part is rather isolated. He's young enough to not be aware of his own mortality, racing drivers get slower after they start a family when they realise they have something they need to come home to, they don't take the same risks. Harry will always take the guilt and tends not to blame others, is this from the Dursley's where he would have become accustomed to being blamed for things he didn't do or at least didn't intend? If Harry isn't raised by the Dursleys as in some AUs then I could understand this not being a thing for Harry any more.

Harry Potter is the half-blood son of James and Lily Potter, his Godfather is Sirius Black. He has muggle relatives through his mother. That is what he was born with, heck I've seen his date of birth moved, everything else is shaped by his life. If his life is different so too would be Harry.

** I just don't like stories where they are too far from canon characterization for no reason, but if Harry has a different upbringing or experiences different things then it wouldn't make sense if he were the same person we know from canon. Eg the 'Slytherin Harry' stories... If not Hagrid, but someone less direct about such matters introduces him to the magical world and Harry never gets told that Slytherin is the House that produced many dark wizards/Voldemort supporters he wouldn't argue with the hat and could end up there. What follows would be Harry spending his formative years in a different environment, with different people, making different friends etc. Basically I want realistic characterization, and if that differs from canon in a way that makes sense, I'm all for it.

** For me, it depends on how they change. A Snape who ended up in Ravenclaw (for example) could be quite different, still have the same lonely anger and longing for acceptance, but go about everything in different ways. A Snape who lives the same life as canon but ends up a nice person...no.

I also don't mind a different interpretation of more minor characters. Harry sees the Weasley twins as fun and clever, but Percy may well see them as borderline malicious bullies. Unreliable and biased narrators can be a great storytelling tool.

Dark Hermione is one I have never managed to find believable though. I can believe her as bossy and ruthless and a bit of a bitch, but never dark and evil. Feel free to change my mind!

*** Dark Hermione conversion challenge. (Note, I don't read Hermione stories so I have never attempted to read a Dark Hermione, so this is my stab at how I think it could happen, ones where she's just evil at 11 and/or been raised by Death Eaters are just silly.)

Why is Hitler often considered the benchmark of evil over Stalin or Mao who were responsible for far more deaths? Why do most Historians not paint Lenin and the other communist dictators as the worst people to have ever lived?

For better or for worse we have a tendency to judge intentions over consequences. Rent control for example, historically has led to worse living conditions for the poor since Landlords have less incentive to look after their properties and builders would rather build expensive places exempt from rent control to sell for far more money. However it is still a popular policy amongst many since its intentions are to make living affordable even though in operation it has been found to have the opposite effect. Hitler's campaign was based around the superiority of the german people and securing them a better future, something others deem a poor intention when looking at what that meant for non-aryans. The communist dictators tried to make life better for everyone and create a little utopia, instead their people died by the millions.

Hermione has shown tendencies to believe she knows best and that she thinks little of others opinions when they don't come from those she deems clever, I.E Hogwarts teaching staff. She has also shown a stubborn streak, an unwillingness to back down over what she believes herself to be right. See house elves and the firebolt in the third book, Scabbers too. Remember what the road to hell is paved with?

Is it hard to believe after seeing the failings of the wizarding world she would want to help? From her point of view she knows the solutions, everyone has always told her how brilliant she is. If she was given a chance wouldn't she try to implement them since it would make life better for everyone? Now, what happens if people disagree? Well she knows best. If people are holding back progress then railroad them, they are traitors to the future. What do you do if people aren't agreeing with you or helping, you MAKE them or you get rid of them. Historically most authoritarian states within the last century have started out with someone trying to help others. When faced with opposition they clamp down on dissent.

Hermione being evil might not make sense, especially in stories where she's evil for the sake of being evil but if you look at what she might do in the name of the greater good, in trying to help others then she can begin her descent. What is right is not always easy the books tell us, to fix the wizarding world would be hard and come with a high cost but in the end would it be worth it, would it have been the right thing to do? She might be seen as evil but for her, she was always trying to do the right thing. Outsiders see her as evil, she is a girl trying to make a difference.

*** A Dark Lady Hermione just makes no sense. But if you show Hermione during the war I can see her doing things people like "all Slytherins are evil" Ron would consider dark. Because she knows history and draws the parallels between the Muggleborn discrimination and the Holocaust. The ministry was building concentration camps for muggleborns and that could be a good point for Hermione to "go dark" in order to help the people. Because stunners won't win the war. Imagine fighting an armored division with tasers.

But that asks the question, what is dark? Using lethal force in a war? Using magic that purposely hurts instead of a quick death? Killing any Death Eater on sight? Causing civilian casualties?

Because that's how you win a war. And you need a total victory in order to discredit an ideology.
