It's a story where Harry is really REALLY /REALLY/ badly abused at the Dursleys, and in his dreams he is Christopher Robin with all of the others; Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet....

It's not complete, but through context clues you learn that the animals are other people like Hermione, Percy, and Ron, so that's pretty neat. It's definitely a slow-burn, and because I'm very hyper empathetic, I want to tear my hair out when Harry doesn't accept help! It's 72 chapters, and each are pretty lengthy.


** Just a warning: the fic contains graphic depictions of child sexual abuse.

*** Sorry, I forgot to mention it. I hate graphic descriptions so I skipped over it, and I picked up from where I left off over a year ago today. Sorry!

** Just read it in one go when I came across your rec. It has 74 chapters now. I'm nearly tearing my hair out because I want Harry to get well soon and fast.

** I remember reading this!! I was so obsessed with it for a time, been a while since I've checked it out. I've always liked watching those theories where the Winnie the Pooh characters were representations of mental illness and this just fascinated me and pulled me in
