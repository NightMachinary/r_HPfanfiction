Harry is a brick when it comes to emotion. His entire childhood groomed the perfect weapon against Voldemort.

When harry is attacked in first year his immediate idea is ask quillin for spells that can really hurt, injure or cripple someone.

When he's ambused in the hall by higher years he peals their skin off, vanishes their skeleton or just straight up removes their eyes.

Harry is brought to Dumbledore's office where Minerva is with him. Harry points out Minerva hasn't stopped them from pushing him down the stairs or shooting him in the back so he assumed that he was within the rules in his choice of dealing with it.

This isn't an evil harry but he is completely void of emotions. He doesn't feel anything.


** Disassociated/psychopathic Harry will make Voldemort look like a child in a scary Halloween costume. Voldemort makes emotional mistakes. A person like the Harry in this scenario will not. Voldemort may leave a victim alive to spread terror. Harry will not care whether they live or die long enough to do that. Voldemort Tabooed his name to capture dissenters; Harry will Taboo his name so he can kill anyone who even thinks aloud, let alone tries to plot against him.

*** Someone write this. My Harry Potter writing is kind trash since I got hooked on MHA.
