Given the circumstances, I finally have some time to put some of my ideas into a story - I'm writing a canon compliant fic from Fleur's POV.

The original idea was to start the story with her move to Britain after GoF, but that would involve a lot of flashbacks which I personally dislike. I wanted to try something different, so the first chapter takes place on the night of the Quidditch World Cup final.

It's much harder than I thought it would be. Trying to give her character some depth, while keeping her behavior in Goblet of Fire the same, proved to be quite a challenge. I'm having a lot of fun writing this, but I still need help.

What is overused? What makes you cringe? What do most authors overlook?


** There's the "Oh, he's immune to my aura so I must be in love with him!" trope - avoid that. Love bonds/life debts are also a no-no.

Bringing Gabriel into a love triangle with her sister makes me cringe. Playing her crush on Harry up for laughs is cute though. Remember GOF is when Dennis Creevy comes to Hogwarts and it could be funny for him and Colin to rope her into their HP fanclub.

I've always thought it would be hilarious for Fleur to accept Ron's invitation to the ball because, up until his asking, everyone else had been too intimidated to ask, then just treating him as an inanimate prop to keep other suiters away during the ball because he can't do anything except stare at her.

Also, I've never seen a Fleur-centric fic that wasn't primarily a romance. So making the romance secondary or cutting it entirely could make your fic stand out from the crowd.

  Though he's a confident and competent newspaper man, Ron Weasley's heart is full of disappointments. His boss is horrible, and his two best friends have abandoned him in favor of their own company. They haven't even invited him to their wedding. He doesn't think things are likely to change, but then he unexpectedly bumps into Fleur Delacour in a Muggle coffee shop in downtown London. His teen crush might be the one person who can become a real friend and perhaps even someone he can love.

*** Quite. The biggest error fanfic writers make about Fleur is to have her identify as a Veela at all. In canon she views herself as a witch who happens to have a grandmother who was a Veela, and that's how all the characters treat her.

However, if Veela /must/ be mentioned, the other big error is getting Veela powers wrong. In canon, they:

1. Can enchant men to do stupid things with their voice (singing, laughing) and movements (dancing, tossing hair), the effect of which can be blocked by blocking your ears.

2. Are supernaturally beautiful.

3. Can turn into fire-wielding birds.

Fleur definitely has a generous helping of power #2, and likely some amount of power #1. No sign of power #3.

What neither Fleur nor regular Veela have, however, is any kind of "attraction field" (aka "allure"). The medium of their befuddling enchantment is through physical movements and through voice, not through merely being in their presence.

The sole effect of being in their presence derives from the fact that they are supernaturally beautiful, so any stupidity a given man has a tendency to display in the presence of beautiful women will be on display and magnified by that beauty. But that effect isn't really magical in nature, and can be witnessed every Friday night in the Muggle world. It also depends on the man's character: see how both Harry and Ron are vulnerable to a Veela's enchantment through voice and dance, but only Ron is vulnerable to doing stupid things merely because they are beautiful.

The part in which she openly shares her wand's core was always kind of sweet in my eyes. It was very direct, and I imagine her with a very enthusiastic expression every time I read that chapter.

This...makes a lot of sense, actually. I've disagreed with people who dispute the "allure" theory before, but this is a better fit: Veelas' enchantment simply makes men act how they would normally act around beautiful women, except turned up to eleven. (Maybe women too, given Hermione, Ginny, and Molly's attitude toward Fleur.) This also explains why Ron's reaction to Fleur was so over the top; that's just Ron's personality.

I do think the enchantment can be used subtly enough to act as a jury-rigged "attraction field," but they don't need to directly influence emotions and/or arousal to do it, and there are far fewer unfortunate implications that way.

  A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.

***** I always interpreted that as a wedding + Harry thing. Fleur is known to be beautiful, and it's safe to say Gabrielle is too. Harry loves Ginny, and he seems like the type to only appreciate her beauty more when in such a situation, rather than compare her to others. Bill, like Fleur, is getting married and wedding glow is totally a thing.

I totally see the interpretation of it being an actual magic power though.

  Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . except that they weren't --- they couldn't be --- human.

  A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair *and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow.* To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray. "'Arry," she said in a throaty voice. "Eet 'as been too long!"

The problem with this, and I blame J.K.'s bad logic skills, is that since it is also canon that there are no male Veela, Fleur's not “1/4 Veela” as this is impossible. If there are no male Veela, then all Veela are full Veela. So she can't be a “witch who happens to have a grandmother who was a Veela”. She can, though, be a witch who herself happens to be a Veela.

***** There are plenty of other approaches that make the canon system work just fine. The "all Veela are full Veela" is just one possible solution.

E.g.

- New Veela are created via asexual reproduction.

- New Veela spontaneously appear under certain circumstances, as Dementors and Boggarts do.

- New Veela are not created at all, but rather women of other species can become Veela under circumstances.

- Veela steal human babies and turn them into Veela.

Etc.

In any of the above situations, Veela can biologically reproduce with other species to create half-breed offspring, but this is a different manner from how full Veela come about.

******* I've toyed with the idea of "full" veela being basically half-species themselves, and that all of them came from some sort of uber-ancestor.

I tend to do that a lot, for example a lot of my fics have metamorphmagi be magical people from a line which has boggart in it - usually done by the Blacks in the distant past. It seems to fit their fucked up nature that they'd attempt to integrate a creature that knows someone's biggest fear and can shapeshift into it into their bloodline. So the first metamorphmagi were strange demonic creatures with a preference for human-like forms, but the blood eventually mellowed out until they retained only a shadow of their ancestral abilities.

If you do the same with Veela, you need to make their ancestor something like a siren - some sort of being that could make itself absolutely irrestistible to humans (and then probably ate them), and whose progeny slowly lost their more savage attributes, but retained some shadow of their ancestor's powers. The issue with genetics can be easily explained by having the attribute not based on genes, but magic. So the Black family's shapeshifting powers slowly went dormant as the magic was just turned in on itself over and over, and only a fresh infusion of it in the form of Ted woke it up again.

**** I mean, there are two issues here. One, can it be plausibly argued that she is, for example, a "full" veela (based on a hypothesis saying that's the only kind there is)? If so, you can write a reasonably Canon-ish FF about it. This, as far as I know, is also quite rare, so you're somewhat original on top of it. In terms of OP's request, it strikes me as a legitimate answer.

Two, I'd agree that perception/treatment of Fleur vs. the World Cup veelas differs. She goes to a magic school and is clearly competent at (human) magic, whereas the veelas at the WC were literally treated as mascots and are only shown to use their unique powers. But what is there to conclude from that, beyond elements of Fleur's character? Remus considers himself a wizard with an illness, and lives in the wizarding world. Greyback considers himself a werewolf, and lives with his own. The perception/treatment of both couldn't be different, yet we /know/ that both are essentially the same thing in a magical sense: A werewolf.

By the same token, veela!Fleur might consider herself a veela and live with her folks, or consider herself a witch and live in the wizarding world. The latter wouldn't mean much, then.

** Okay, things to avoid when writing Fleur:

- Speak thee not the word 'allure', unless you intend to continue on and instead speak the word 'alluring'. 'Veela allure' is right out. Don't do it.

- If this story is going to be from Fleur's point of view, do not spend time reflecting on how beautiful she is, or on her bust size. No 'she boobily boobed her boobs across the courtyard, boobs brushing gently beneath the silk of her boob holders'.

- We don't gave much to go on from canon really, except the fact that she appears to be brave, smart and fiercely loyal (to Bill) at her core. She also seems to hold both herself and others to very high standards.

- Give her something to do and think about outside of the Triwizard Tournament or her love life.

- Please don't use the 'Veela puberty' trope.

I've been thinking about this a lot - this is one of the reasons why I wanted to write this in the first place. The fact that she got a part-time job at Gringotts always intrigued me.

She only just graduated from Beauxbatons, right after competing in a dangerous tournament in which, hm, one of the contestants got murdered. Why did she move to Britain? Why Gringotts? Why only part-time? What does she even do?

It's been fun trying to answer these questions, and I used this to start a plot which involves working with Bill.

You know, "Veela allure" is a lot shorter than "alluring effect the magical creatures called Veela have on potential mates". I don't think that the term itself is to be avoided. The tropes usually associated with it (eg being a targeted ability or being able to manifest somehow) are bad, but I don't think that the allure as an Area of Effect field that surrounds Fleur is necessarily bad writing.

In all the characterizations of Fleur that ive ever read, the best ones have always had her as being somewhat distant from new people and especially boys. 2. Fleur is in no way a damsel in distress. Despite the fact she canme in last in the triwizard tournament she was still a champion and a fully qualified witch of sufficient skill to be hired by gringotts right out of school. She can take care of herself and rarely needs assistance with non-extraordinary problems. 3. Use her canon personality as a guide. In canon she is; proud, intelligent (though not bookish), affectionate towards her friends and family, has something of a quick temper, and is very non-discriminatory and accepting of people regardless of their circumstances (although this isnt 100% confirmed due to how little presence she has in the books, especially when around people who have less than ideal circumstances like snapenor lupin).

And that is not even mentioning the implications from the real life lore of these creatures, like centaurs reproducing by kidnapping and raping woman or werewolves being exterminators of entire villages.

"Happy magical coexistence" is one of the most boring tropes because it takes away everything what makes those creatures interesting (the threat they pose) and replaces it with a struggle for civil rights. That is especially out of place for werewolves since they, with the exception of Lupin, collectively join Voldemort and then attack civilians for fun. That's the kind of behaviour which ends with you sentenced in the Hague or outright hanged, not getting civil rights. Those creatures are the manifestations of basic human fears throughout the ages and regions, and writing those aspects away is like Harry Potter without magic.

** Fleur is a little more fleshed out than Daphne, but not much. I've found a lot of flexibility in her character because of her limited appearance in the books.

You are limited a bit by canon-compliance (cc), for sure. I'm having the most fun with Veela stuff, which won't be something you can do too much of unless you choose to delve into some extended family.

As for overused?

TBH I think your cc with help you avoid most of that. Veela/life/marriage bonds. Harems. Etc. I think one area it's feasible you could still stray into is over-sexualizing Veela. Sure she's only 1/4, but it's still a possibility, especially considering her romp in the bushes with Roger Davies (iirc) at the yule ball. The key is 'over'. She can be a sexual person without that being her identity.

For cringe?

See above. And just caricature levels of better-than-you-ness to explain some of her attitude. Confidence in herself =/= haughtiness.

Overlook?

Honestly? The things that would make her three dimensional. Likes, dislikes, habits, childhood experiences, things like that. They help shape her into who she is, and that's where I think you'll find a lot of your freedom.

*** I've been thinking about GOF Fleur vs. DH Fleur for a while actually! Here are my ideas:

1. Everyone is a bit of a brat at 17 (weak, I know)
2. GOF: Fleur is in a new place -- a complete disruption from the normal -- entered in a dangerous, time-consuming, high-stakes (I imagine that she takes the honor of her school very seriously) competition, she still has her regular school to do, but her little sister isn't there, and it's also probably her 7th year so she has French NEWTs. On top of all that, the girl can't even have the comfort of the food she's usually accustomed to. In stressful situations, food is really important to people and being able to eat what one is used to during a big upheaval or transition in one's life can be a massively underrated source of stability.
3. In DH, Fleur acts extra French and does things like bitch about Celestina Warbeck because Molly, Ginny, and Hermione are hostile to her and she is striking back.

TLDR; Fleur acts arrogant because she is stressed out and uprooted.

** I'm not sure how much it fits in with your ambitions, but I was playing around with the whole "half breed" thing that GOF revealed. So, basically, Fleur's parents didn't tell Fleur she was part Veela until not that long before we meet her in GOF. Being part Veela is just as complicated as being part anything else so Fleur sort of compensates in two ways. Firstly, she leans in to it (the wand test, for example). Secondly, she is sort of a reverse Umbridge in that she's sceptical of most people... the haughtiness. In hindsight, this might be a reason for being blunt too

I also think this can help explain why Madam Maxine was so close to Fleur... much like with Harry and Dumbledore, there are certain parallels in their biographies.

***** I would actually take canon compliance more strictly than what [[/u/ValirysReinhald][u/ValirysReinhald]] is saying. It's really important to keep fates, events and characterisation consistent with what we know, but I think keeping the world consistent with what canon appears to set up is important too. So that's including theme as well as setting.

So, Cursed Child, for example, is fine when it comes to how time turners work (matches up with Hermione's warnings) and general take on personalities (Cedric and Hermione make different choices so become basically different people... cf "it's our choices that matter") but turning the Trolley Witch into some kind of automaton or whatever the hell that was? Doesn't make much sense with her being at Dumbledore's funeral. Therefore, not canon compliant. Harry's leaving the Aurors to become the head of the DMLE is also a bit odd in the sense that shouldn't be an investigative role based on what we see in the books (not that Cursed Child Harry runs it that way).

This does leave some room for debate. I read the books and I think, "Ah, Harry's set for life because he's very wealthy" but not everyone shares that interpretation.

  but turning the Trolley Witch into some kind of automaton or whatever the hell that was?
#+end_quote

Oh, come on. I had forgotten about that. How horrible was that? It's my headcanon that the Trolley Witch dropped out of school and couldn't take her NEWTs so the Ministry wouldn't hire her. So every time a student tries to escape she sits them down and explains how important school is.

******* I think, and I should probably re-read the thing to make sure, that it's the only thing I can't get over.

My headcanon is that Cursed Child is the Rita Skeeter edition of whatever really happened. Hence why everything is so... extreme. Presumably the Trolley Witch offended Skeeter at some point. Hey, maybe she was one of the would be escapees who got a lecture!

Your idea would also explain why she was at Dumbledore's funeral. Maybe she was an early Hagrid...

*** The royalty thing is probably because Fleur's name is Delacour which means "of the court" which may refer to the royal court of the old days. And if there are some families in France like the Malfoy in England (according to Pottermore, at least) who were close to the kings and whatnot at that time, "Delacour" would fit that to a T and Rowling is kinda known to give name and surname to her characters in that same fashion.

*** To tell you the truth, I haven't really read a lot of fics with Fleur, and that's part of the reason I'm posting. What I have seen was almost exclusively this - the Delacours are practically royalty, and I don't dig it.

  BTW Why do you want it to be "canon compliant"? I've always thought this phrase is a bit contradicting. Isn't all fiction not compliant? Just write her in any way you want.
#+end_quote

Thought it was faster to write that rather than "this is not a Lord Harry X Fleur / soul bond / harem / time travel / whatever fic, I am going to follow the canon as much as possible, but from her POV". And I also wanted this to turn more into a discussion than simply asking for something specific hehe

  Canonically, Harry can resist it somewhat. He does not want to jump into certain death like Ron.
#+end_quote

He doesn't resist it and he does want to jump, he even worries that it wouldn't be impressive enough.

#+begin_quote
  But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren't --- they couldn't be --- human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their whitegold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human --- in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. *The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . . And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough?*

  “Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione's voice from a long way off.

  The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.

** The most annoying Fleur related thing in the books, and this isn't Fleur's fault actually, is the way other women, specifically Weasley women, think of her as a bitch. Please don't lean into that! Also, forget about making her stereotypically veela, don't make her stereotypically French!

** Please, don't make Harry immune to her "allure". That's so cliché and I think the only times we have seen people genuinely able to resist it, except people not attracted to women, is Mr. Weasley which warn him about Veelas and Cedric who was asked by Fleur about the Yule Ball and he resisted her advances (my point being that the best way to be immune to her, is to be attracted to someone else).

Also, if Harry is supposed to interact with her, with emotional intimacy in some capacity, remember Harry is not the most observant of the boys (which is in itself not really that much at that age) about the girls (remember Cho). Also, it could be a good idea to help process with everything that happened to him (instead of "Yeah, my first DADA teacher tried to kill me, the second one wanted to obliviate me, the third one was a werewolf, and I know the Dark Lord has made me participate in that tournament to kill me. And I'm totally fine. What about you?")

What's in your favour is that we don't know much about Fleur and anything about France (I have not seen the Fantastic Beasts, so I don't know if France is shown in any capacity but I don't really care about what JKR may have to say about it)

Also, also, if you want to put some french words, make sure they are wisely chosen. In french, every word is gendered, the verbs are spelled differently between I/You/He/We/You/They . The best way is probably to ask reddit about french beta ; it may help you to find how the world of France would look like, because France is more complex than just /baguettes/ and l'/amour./

Also, maybe show how little of her actual time at school, we see in the original story. Maybe she has hobbies: art, music, duelling (maybe at Beauxbâtons they are trained to sports duel, not the "I have to stupefy them or else they are going to kill me" kind of duel), maybe something else but at least it would stay consistent with her name.

Also, the fact that not all Beauxbâtons students came to Hogwarts (I personnally expect Beauxbâtons to have like 200 students for each year), so maybe all of her friends stayed in France and she doesn't really know the others Beauxbâtons students), something Harry would understand since in OOTP, he is ALMOST sure about the names of the Ravenclaw guys who were in his year and that says something about how he barely knows anyone at a school which is supposed to only get the wizard kids from the british islands. Or maybe Fleur wasn't the most pleasing because she is french and France has a millenary rivalry with England.

*** Also, resisting it doesn't seem like an overly rare talent. Considering the world cup organizers knew there would be an entire group of them dancing and didn't install any sort of guardrail or safety nets.

Likely the only people overly affected are hormonal teenagers and the occasional weak-willed man, but all the adults at the world cup seem to be more amused by the boys' antics rather than influenced themselves.

** Lore surrounding the Allure is very nebulous.

- On one hand, we have evidence that it can be used offensively, as seen with Roger Davies, who was essentially braindead.

- On the other hand, we have evidence that it needs dancing to activate, as seen in the World Cup.

- On the third hand, we have very nebulous evidence that it can influence people passively, as seen with Ron.

However, I don't know if the third is very accurate. It might just be a thing straight guys do, you know, the sort of spur of the moment type decision.

So I don't know. I've always maintanted that in canon, it exists as a unique ability that can be used, with or without dance, but the dance amplifies it.

In addition, I've always written Veela characters with a very defined morality towards using the Allure on people, which was that it was basically an offensive attack, and a breaking of trust if done to someone who isn't an enemy. So they use it mainly in combat, not when going on a date or walking down the street or something like that.

If anything, use it very sparingly, keep it nebulous, and don't make it the thing any sort of potential relationship is built on, even if the actual reason for it is that it /didn't/ work. Because her "testing" everyone for their reaction to it is kinda messed up.

And for gods sake avoid the dehumanizing terms like "seeking a mate". It's incredibly fucked to equalize a sapient species and animal behavior. They're just random people who are more human than anything else. They do human things and use human words.

Oh, and please avoid things like "ancient veela laws". Those make me shudder.

** I would avoid the written french accent, if it's Fleur centric it's gonna be annoying real fast. And as a French native speaker, don't put "Oui/Non" or random French words everywhere, no one does that when speaking a foreign language, except if taken by surprise or lack of words. What could happen is mixed up expression.

In the end anyway, it's your story. What do you want to see in it? It is your vision and tropes are here for a reason : be used with proper judgement.

Best of luck for your fic, if you post a link at some point I'll check it out and post a review ;)

** Avoid harping incessantly on the drama of being a Veela. It can be relevant to Fleur's adolescence, but that's not interesting as a constant issue. (Just like harping on Harry's childhood abuse isn't a good story.)

Bonding is overdone.

Threesomes with another woman is overdone. Like Fleur would accept sharing the man of her dreams - yeah, right. More likely she'd have her own harem of men.

** I mean, just look at the comments here, telling you everything and the opposite. Just do whatever you want?

I'll toss in yet another possibility: AFAIK, all the evidence of "Fleur being a quarter-veela" rests on her statement that her grandmother was one. But we don't know how veelas work. It's possible enough that there are no such things as fractional veelas, and you either are one, or not ... which would also explain how veelas haven't died out already, since there are seemingly no male ones.

Hence, feel free to make an argument of how Fleur is a veela like her grandmother; I think that plot line isn't explored enough in FF.
