Also Dumbledore gave all the staff members some warhead candies, and Dobby and Winky got together (a match made in heaven)

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

***** I don't know what you find strange about it; the Harry Potter fandom was /very/ active back in 1969.

** I can't come up with the name at the moment, but is it the one where Harry's been in St. Mungo's since winning, and to escape Dumbledore and the Order, who plan to grab him the moment he's released, he turns everyone in the vicinity into a Harry Potter lookalike for a few hours?

**** Different story, then. In the one I'm thinking of, Hedwig is sent back by the PTB in phoenix form as a reward, IIRC, and he hides out in a magical tent to avoid Dumbledore and the Order.
