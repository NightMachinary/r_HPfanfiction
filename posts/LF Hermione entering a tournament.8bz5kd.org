Any tournament, it could be an AU (like the fanfic, "Fractures") or Hermione entering triwizard tournament instead of harry. I would like it, if the pairings is f/f but it's also okay it it's not. Thank you.


** There was a fanfic, /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Coulsdon Eagle, where some protective spell that Hermione had cast on Harry interacted with Crouch Jr.'s machinations, and it was her name that came out. The fic went down with Portkey, but I still have a copy.

In linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), TWT-analogue has champions (of whom Harry is one) doing the tasks, but there are also parallel competitions open to all students, and Hermione participates in those.

Could you please link to "Fractures"?

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** Thanks for the reference. The Bot didn't generate the link, but it gave me enough information to find it.

/Please/ tell me that Hermione gets to hex the crap out of Bellatrix at some point in the story?
