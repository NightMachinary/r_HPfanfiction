Personally I'm looking forward to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][/The Imposter Complex/]] coming to completion, it seems to have a good update rate and I've found the story very enjoyable. I have both a reasonable expectation that it will be finished and a fairly good feeling that the author is going to do a good job with it.


** Linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error) is close to wrapping up canon and I've been very pleased with it so far. Excellent example of a well-done Peggy Sue fic that doesn't get bogged down in the first few years.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
