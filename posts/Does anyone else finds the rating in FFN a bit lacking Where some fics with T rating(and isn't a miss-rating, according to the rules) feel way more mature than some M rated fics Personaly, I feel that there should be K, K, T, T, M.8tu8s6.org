#+TITLE: Does anyone else finds the rating in FFN a bit lacking? Where some fics with T rating(and isn't a miss-rating, according to the rules) feel way more mature than some M rated fics? Personaly, I feel that there should be K, K+, T, T+, M, M+, MA (or R). It gives more options at the very least.

Just a thought.


** No.

It's not like someone is going through every work and giving it a rating a la the MPAA. It's more of an 'honors system' than anything else. As evident by the fact that FFN explicitly does not allow any 'MA' (which would be closer to X than R in your description) content yet it's there aplenty.

It boils down to 'is it for all audiences?' 'is it for teenagers?' and 'is it for adults' and that's all you really need. There's next to no enforcement on viewing or actually posting and there's no reason to overly complicate it.

To be entirely honest the thing that most often determines 'rating' is language or sexual content. Since, theoreticaly (lol) ffn should have no explicit sexual content, that would boil down to language. You can write a mature story and not say 'fuck' or throw a lot of gore in it. There's no reason that shouldn't be T.

Except that there are some heavy themes (rape, child abuse, genocide, PTSD) which get unsuitable for age 12 no matter which language you use.

**** of course you can write stories about those topics for children, but you have to be very very careful with it.

You can write a story about PTSD with the intention to teach a child what it is and how to deal with in a family member for example. But yes it is difficult and you normally don't find such stories on ff.net

***** I'm pretty sure that there is no child-friendly way to deal with watching your parents being brutally murdered (like in Harry's case) or your mother raped in front of you unless you want to make it unrealistic (like the Dursley abuse, but that is an entirely different can of worms).

There's a reason why people usually get therapy after such events, and unless you have a solid background in that area (degree in child psychology for example) or personal experiences, any attempt at writing about such topics in a child-friendly way will fail spectacularly. Hell, any attempt at writing about those topics without some sort of experience will fail spectacularly, no matter the target audience.

****** I think empathy and research can get you a long way.

Of course there are topics that are very difficult to write about, rape for example has the added sexual component that is always difficult to work with and I have no idea how to handel it.

But the violent death of a parent is something you can do. Let me give you an example: The Lion King

** Literature should not have age ratings. Recommendations maybe, but if some twelve year old fangirl wants to read about +Harry+ Daniel Redcliff taking it up the ass from +Draco+ Tom Felton, a single letter won't stop her either way.

*** I actually meant for searching to be easier. Internet makes it basically impossible to censor anything if the user really wants to see something. It was simply to make life easier while searching. Considering that there isn't a tag system in FFN, we only have genre, rating, size and characters to mess around while searching, so imo it would make it a bit easier.

**** Filtering by rating is pointless since every author has their own standards and adding even most ratings would make things even more complicated and inconsistent.

** I think they just need a system more like AO3. Not that FFN allows explicit stuff, but like has anyone ever really filtered for K+ solely? I mean an adult and a non-adult rating is all they truly need in my opinion. I wish if there was a change that they would remember I like M rated stories in my searches by default. Annoying to have to add it. Or maybe I should just log in more if they do this already.

** authors are going to select the maximum rating so they don't have to worry about censoring their work. that's not the fault of the system.
