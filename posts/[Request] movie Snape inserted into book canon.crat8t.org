Please, no slash, no change to the other characters.


** The only times in the entire book series where Alan Rickman's portrayal is not perfect in every way is when it says 'Snape shouted'. And that doesn't happen particularly often. I've always read Snape's voice in the books as the movie portrayal, and I don't do that with the main characters, I have my own voices for them.

*** Movie Snape isn't nearly as cruel as book Snape. A lot of inexcusable things aren't present in the movies ("I see no difference", him threatening to poison Neville's toad, him openly bashing Neville in PoA Defense) and we also see him take a more active role defending the trio from Lupln.

I much prefer the movie portrayal of him (And I mean his movie behaviour, not because of the actor).

** I don't think this is much of a prompt, I've always considered Alan Rickman's portrayal of Snape to be one of the closest to book canon that where was.

*** I disagree. Movie Snape was heroic. He threw himself in front of 3 school children.

Book Snape is a dick on the side of good for revenge.
