or stuff you've read before? I sure know, and then when i jokeingly go several dousin pages down i find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][this gem]]. Not too long ('bout 200k words) very original, compleated and WAY better than most 1000-3000 reviews/favs!


** It's the second time I have seen this fic recommended in the past two days. I try, but I can't get into the premise of WBWL stories if James and Lilly abuse Harry.

*** In addition to what you already mentioned, I couldn't get past the writing style or the fact that Harry is supposedly eleven. Harry doesn't act or think anywhere close to his age in what I read of that fic. This is about where I had to stop:

#+begin_quote
  I woke up early, today I was going to Hogwarts. The plan was simple but full of hazardous factors.

  First step was getting sorted in Hufflepuff. That was also one of the most hazardous factors.

**** True, can't argue with that. The first few and last few chaptors are rather dodgy and filled with a couple of holes.

*** First off, it isn't a WBWL story and yes the first two chaptors Harry gets neglected it isn't the overall plot of the series. Heck one of the great things about this fic is that Voldemort is barely signifigent in any way. But yes i can see and repect why some wouldn't like this fic.

** That fic's actually pretty bad. Enjoyable, I guess, but definitely not quality work.

**** You're completely right, but there are also significantly better. A solid turd might be better than diarrhea, but it's still a piece of shit.

** I just couldn't get over the fact that James and Lily neglected Harry and his sister as well the [[/spoiler][handwaved explanation of 'because magic']]. The underwhelming ending notwithstanding, the story itself was pretty great but the author seems to have jumped through hoops with the premise.

** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] and come here to post it as a suggestion and then I saw your post.

It was absolutely amazing. I've read so many fanfics that I thought there wasn't anything of quality left but this one proved me wrong. The character development is superb as well as the story progression. I can honestly say this in now in my top 5 favorite. Maybe my all time favorite.

The author says in his ANs that some people complained about the first chapter (which I didn't find bad) being weak compared to the rest of the story, so if you do give it a try, read the first two chapters before giving up on it.

*** True, true. Acctually i really liked the first chaptor since it begins to paint itself as a cliche "Harry is the brother to TBWL and is abused by his parents" but then it goes an entirely different direction.
