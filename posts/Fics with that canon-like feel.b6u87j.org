As the title reads; are there any fics out there that give you that canon feel?

I largely prefer canon compliant pairings, so if anyone knows of any fics with those requirements, do let me know!

I'm not against reading other pairings, so if you know of a fic with that â€˜canon feel' but different pairings, rec them too.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  This story follows the Battle of Hogwarts and considers how the main characters might have moved forward from those harrowing times. They embark on a journey of friendship, healing, relationship, and growth toward the Deathly Hallows epilog scene nineteen years later. The story aims to be canonically aligned and includes a bit of humor and a few serendipitous thoughts.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
