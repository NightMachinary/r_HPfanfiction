Were a SI takes advantage of their particular brand of foresight and uses it instead of trying to stay close to cannon or helping the main characters. Thanks

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Gilderoy Lockhart. The one person in the books who was there at a pivotal moment and could have made a difference but was utterly unable to. Until a dimension traveler took over his position.

*** I managed to get to chapter seven before I got tired of the authors "spreading Mormonism via lies" schtick. I don't have a problem with using religion as a storytelling elment, but the author dropped it in there for no reason but to proselytize. And then they started including lies as part of it.

I'd rather read poorly-written teen angst with bad grammar. At least that's /honest/ storytelling, however badly constructed.

** Here is mine, linkffn(11677223). A more updated one can be found [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20075499/][here]].

My SI is not Evil, per say. But I try to write him well, and I think you may like him as the story progresses.

  The story brought to you by the depressing realization that any realistic SI involving myself can be summed up as: "He died. Horribly." But... death in the Buffyverse is hardly the end. Sometimes it's just a beginning. A pseudo-SI turned vampire story. Rated M for comedic sociopathy.
