I love reading things that the author has obviously put a lot of thought and effort into and love stories that take a while to read. No pairings really bother me as long as they seem reasonable and justified.


** Okay, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] (links to the first book) is absolutely /stellar/. A lot of people hate the protagonist for some reason, but I think she fits the story very well. It's set in Wizarding America, 11 or so years after Voldemort's downfall - entirely new cast of characters, but the same magic and house-elves and pureblood supremacy and everything, just with an American twist.

** You could always go way back and read the Draco Trilogy. That's like 3 separate novels. From what I remember they were pretty good.

**** The Draco Trilogy is a fan fiction from a long time ago. I'm talking like 2004ish. But they were all about Draco. I can't really remember exactly what they were about. I just found the PDFs that I had someone email me from back then in my email. The stories are titled Draco Dormiens, Draco Sinister and Draco Veritas. If you google "the Draco trilogy PDF" it'll bring up the PDFs of them.

** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave - starts with Saving Connor.

This shit is 3.1 million words long. Like. Mate. What the hell. I finally took the plunge and started reading it, and in about 3 days I read the first 4 books. The writing is stellar, the plot is exceptional and the character development is wonderful. The world-building is breathtaking, and the best i've read in any fan fiction bar none. The author has created an incredibly deep world of light and dark magic complete with their own rituals, interactions and family alliances. It suffers from some flaws in the first few books. A couple of characters are bitchy little shits that make you want to pull your hair out and smash things. The main character acts like a complete fuckboy for a while, and he's only now starting to get better.

Above all, the fact that it's frustrated me so damn much in some places, but i've just carried on reading without stopping for hours at a time shows how quality the plot is - I just had to find out what happens next.

Don't start this during term time if you're a student - you will fail your next set of exams. Wait for your next holiday and binge as much as you can so that it doesn't take over your life. I've had to stop myself from starting book 5 because I know once I start i'll have to finish it without really stopping, and i'm not ready for another 700k words of this. God damn.

To the people who gave me info about in another read...I don't know whether to curse at you or thank you. Both to be honest.

*** I don't recommend it, honestly. The main relationship gets creepy fast, and it's otherwise an average fic not worth the time investment because of the unreasonably high words/plot ratio.

*** This is still one of my favourite fics ever, and I would highly recommend it. While it is ridiculously long, and does have some obnoxious characters, it gets so much right and has so many original magical ideas (like the rite of Cincinnatus within the Ministry).

If you read it, it helps to know that many of the story points were purposefully written using the cliches of many fic: twin-fic, Harry isn't the BWL, Harry/Draco, manipulative!Dumbledore, etc. but also expands on the world JKR wrote in a way that few others have. Just about every character mentioned in canon gets a backstory/motivations/goals/full-characterization instead of just "Pansy has a pug-nose, and is evil" or "Dean likes sports, is black, and a half-blood".

The Sacrifices Arc is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it kind of story; the length, divergence from canon, or the relationships drive most people away from it.

** You could try if you like the Dangerverse. It's very long, very AU and as of Halloween last year finally finished ( but it looks like the author can not quite keep her hands of it anyway) . It has AUs branching of of itself, too...

It has it's problems and needs some time to get going, but it is still an interesting read.

** I just started reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4998084/1/][George and Annie: an Unofficial Biography]], but it's promising so far. Almost 400k words, technically well written and engaging, plus a premise that isn't just a rehash of the usual fandom cliches.

**** I'm almost finished and... I liked the first half but it seemed to go off the rails around the halfway point. The rest has mostly been spent reinforcing gender stereotypes and reciting an endless litany of babies and marriages.

** Most of Bobmin's stuff is novel length and pretty original, a lot of there stuff is [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][here]] while the rest is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356][here]]

Sunrise over britain and sunset over britain are the absolute longest fics I've ever read (currently rereading them), but I've also enjoyed their crossover with Dragonriders of Pern. They've been writing for a while so there is plenty of stuff to read. Just keep in mind they wrote things before many concepts became insanely cliche.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3421129/1/Muggle-Summer-Wizard-s-Fall][Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall]] By Canoncansodoff is another great long fic.
