Hi, so in the past few days I have begun writing my very first fanfiction (nothing ready for posting yet). It's an HP/ASoIaF crossover and one of the main premise is that Harry doesn't have his wand. Also, he doesn't have any wandless capabilities or the "magical core" of a mythical god or any of that nonsense.

What he does have however, are a very particular set of skills... hum, no wait, I got lost here for a moment. So he has ONE runic tattoo that correct his eyesight. He got it by an originaly super dangerous process that he rediscovered/recreated with the help of Hermione, and at one point, he will do an Iron Man 1 kind of move to gain a new ability in an unsafe environment because he is in deep, deep poopoo. It is going to be kind of nerfed, he can't get too crazy with the runes he uses or he would die a most gruesome and unpleasant death.

I thaught for exemple [FAST][REGENERATION] has caused a wizard who attempted it in the past to be found dead the next morning in the shape of a giant tumor with feet. This kind of things.

Also, he can only barly do this second one because of the inbalance in magical flow it would cause to have too many of them on your body (the magic you process in your body has to feed the tattoo all the time).

Anyway, the point of this post is to ask for recomendations on fics that have pulled of the runic tattoo/scars well. I remember one where he uses like tolkien elvish or some stuff and ends up having Darkness/Void and Light/Sun balancing inside of him but it was a CrazyPowerfull!Harry and it really got too over the top for me... also I think it was a harem fic...so yeah.

Also, if you have comments on the inner workings of runes, or fun ideas of runic tattoos gone wrong, they would be most welcomed.

Have a nice day!

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

** linkffn(For Love of Magic) He uses Elder Futhrak and a whole bunch of other languages as runes for carving into his skin, even Kanji and a language from WoW (I think, since I didn't play, I assumed it was from this). Its definitely a "dark" ritual but he simply doesn't give a shit. Lots and Lots of Smut though, if you don't like, its hard to skip because there isn't a warming and sometimes not even a build-up. Harem with Luna/Fleur/Tonks.

Really good story though, but a bit long.

Another one that's classic and old is linkffn(Runic Animagus) but this is just a cracky bad and funny fic.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Immediate upvote for going to the effort of writing your own fic. Good on you :)

I think the fic you're referring to is For Love of Magic, which was also recommended above/below. Here are some quick thoughts on examples of how they could go horribly wrong:

- Strength: muscles so strong that they break bones.
- Eternity (attempted immortality): becomes unchanging, may as well be made of stone.
- Intelligence: This way lies madness.
- Flight: Mutates arms to non-functional wings.

More minor symptoms could include pain, or a "tainting" of magic with the concept embodied in the rune. An example could be fire-related runes could make all of your spells burn, or burn the user when they cast.

Have fun writing!

*** Thanks a lot for your thougts and encouragements. I like to think of runic tattoos in my story as pairs so there are great ideas in what you have suggested.

[Strong][Muscles]: End up breaking your body or pumping the heart so hard you pop like a bottle of champain. [Long][Lived]: Makes the cells in your body not die or reproduce, therefore trapping you in a single unchanching state.

Great stuff, thanks again !

** Well if you're looking for discussion I'll tell you that this sounds like crap. Harry doesn't sound like Harry, not!Harry doesn't sound like a wizard, so I'm questioning what HP has to do with your fic at all.\\
Even ignoring that, runic magic doesn't seem to be a thing in HP magic. Ancient runes seems to be nothing but a language course, the analogue of Latin in muggle boarding schools. But that can be ignored to some degree, but you can't make it better, or even comparable, to wanded magic and have it make any sense to the HP canon.

When I was writing my own xover, that went nowhere, Harry's bureaucratic experience was as important as his magic.

***** I agree with you completely.

For now I am set on Harry being captured by Dothrakis “on arrival” and sold as a slave. He then has to fight for his life when he is purchased by a slaver who specializes in gladiators for the pits. With other slaves, he escapes and one of them claims he has a contact in Pentos that would help them cross to Westeros to work as sellswords and would even pay them to perform “small services for him”. They kill their master and steal his ship but end up having to sail through the Smoking Sea for a little bit in order to escape fast sloops sent after them to kill them. Stuff happens. The contact ends up being Illyrio Mopatis, friend of the Spider and host of the remaining Targaryens. In Pentos, at the end of the first Arc (approx. 9 chapters relating 5-6 months of story), Harry meets Dany very briefly and forms a sort of brotherly attachment to her (she is 13 and he is 20) that will come to play a role later and the group embarks on a ship to King's Landing that happens to be transporting Syrio Forel (canon compliant because the point where Sirio stops being First Sword of Braavos is not explicitly stated in ASoIaF).

I'm not going to regurgitate all my plot line here, especially considering that it is still a work in progress, but I thinks it's not impossible to write a mildly interesting story set in the world of ASoIaF with a Harry that is limited in his usage of magic (he will find an artefact in the Smoking Sea that will allow him at some point during the third Act to perform some magic).

**** I'm not sure I understand this comment as the term “request” was used in my post as a way to ask for fanfictions that used runes well (specifically runic tattoos) which seems to me appropriate, and the term “discussion” was used as a way to initiate an exchange of words that would relate to the writing of a fanfiction using said runes as a plot device to adjust the power of the main character who is devoid of wand (because he would be too strong with it in this universe), and therefore ends up a bit too weak to face the challenges he is faced with during the course of the story.

It appears to me at this moment that there seems to have been an abstract meaning to the tag “Discussion”, that would replace “Discussion about HP canon”, which I do not seem to have grasped in my initial posting, and that it might have disturbed some other participants of this forum for a few seconds there... I therefore apologise deeply for having inconvenienced you so.

Being “so dumb” is, after all, an ailment that can afflict us all on occasion.\\

*** Okay so, there are multiple points here that I am going to try to adress the way I understood them at least:

*Harry doesn't sound like Harry: First I would like to say that this is pretty much subject to interpretation. For example, if during a fic, Harry lost his wand and had to be without it for a while, would you skip the chapters entirely because it's not Harry any more? What about fictions that don't explore the use of magic at all, like some romances or mysteries or many other fictions where magic is not important but that feature Harry as a character. Would you say that they are "crap" because he doesn't do wand magic ? My Harry is a Harry in so far as he has the same past, character traits and knowledge in magic as canon Harry. Which is as pretty damn close to a Harry Potter any character can get if you ask me but fair enough.

*Runic magic doesn't seem to be a thing in canon: Well, it may not be to your liking, but as you suggested, runes can be a way to place enchantments in some fanons at least.

*You can't make it better or comparable to wand magic: Yes... yes that's the point. Harry would be completely overpowered in the world of ASoIaF if he had wand magic, as demonstrated in many other crossovers in the corpus. I've never said anything different. I even said I would nerf it and that the process of making a runic tattoo would only appear once in the story.

So would it make any sense in the HP canon if some obscure and dangerous way of using runic tattoos to place permanent enchantment on oneself existed, I don't know. Maybe?
