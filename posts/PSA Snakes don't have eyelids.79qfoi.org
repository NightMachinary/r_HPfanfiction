Thanks to Parseltongue, a lot of fics deal with snakes. Also, a lot of fics talk about snakes blinking, sleeping with their eyes closed, etc.

Snakes don't have eyelids. They cannot blink. If a snake appears to have a closed eye, it probably has had trouble shedding several times over and has an opaque bit of shed stuck on top of its eye. It can also happen from insufficient hydration, especially while shedding. [[http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/SnakeEyecapRetained.jpg?ver=1423695225][Example]] of this happening to what looks like a ball python.

This is unpleasant for the snake. It's a sign of poor health. In this situation, the snake cannot open its eyes; the best it can hope is that it gets plenty of water and a humid environment so the shed scale comes off.

Blinking and winking is simply impossible for snakes.


** Well, this is awkward:

"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked."

** This bugged me endlessly. Basilisk or other magical snakes I can understand but there were unreasonably large population of snakes with eyelids in fanfiction. And they had to blink because I am not allowed to read in peaceful ignorance. Blinking snakes were like indicator of bad fic to me.

Then I found out cannon muggle boa winked, and now I feel lost, betrayed, and harry potter world is a little bit dimmer..

Now I am trying to think that wink was not physical. That was communication between a parseltongue and a snake aided by magic. The snake did some friendly recognizing behavior of snakes and magic translated it to human body language version for Harry. Or something.

Why do this to yourself? Just accept that JKR fucked up and move on.

Sorry to subject you to this rant, but I really don't get why some people treat the books like the bible and try to make sense out of obvious mistakes and errors. There's plenty of stuff in those books that just doesn't work and it's obvious that it wasn't written in some kind of secret way where you'll have to figure out its secret meaning.

Lots of conflict between some subsets of this community seems to come solely from this... the obsession that somehow there has to be some sense behind everything JKR wrote. Romances don't make sense? Well, there must be some super-duper special connection between these snowflakes that you uneducated fool just don't *get*! Quidditch is a really poorly designed game and it doesn't make sense that anyone would want to play it? Well you see, it's just a recent development because broomsticks got super awesome and it used to be a great sport! A society in which Polyjuice, Metamorphagi and Imperius exist, yet security measures are non-existent? Well, it all has to make sense somehow, you just don't get it!!! Clearly their security can't be as ridiculous as it appears, because no-one is murdering the Minister every day.

Sorry, I'll stop. It's just... I don't really get the point of the mental exercise to make up more or less (usually less) plausible explanations for that kind of stuff. Especially for Fanfiction it seems much more interesting to me to come up with better and new stuff that makes sense instead. There's a certain subset of canon-compliant fics that focus on canon-apologetics which I just loathe as a whole. Particularly when it comes to Dumbledore. I *like* a good Dumbledore. Just write a good Dumbledore please. Don't try to convince me that everything canon-Dumbledore did was secretly the best and he's a perfect grandpa for Harry.

**** I do it to move on from this error and enjoy the book more. I don't mind about plot-holes and agree on your opinion about the flaw of the books to some degree. Really, They don't need to be perfect, and actually I like it when story has some holes. Those urge me to imagine, and thinking about possibilities is one of my favorite ways to enjoy literature. The reason this bugged me so much even though I don't mind flaws is, It's not same with plot or world-building. Those can be confused during writing easily. This is simple fact which can be checked if writer bothered to look at a picture of snake. Also one of my major interests being animal makes it more hard to ignore. I think even you would be bothered if book mentioned UK is in the southern hemisphere. To me eyelided snakes are something like that. So I fill the hole to erase this bugging sensation and to get some interesting side story by doing that. Like where snake doesn't actually wink but harry gets impression that snake does. Harry talks about snakes making faces while all other people can see is snake flicking it's tongue.

**** As far as I can tell, there are two popular ways to deal with inconsistencies in the original story. One way is, as you say, to admit "hey, the author fucked up, I'm just going to fix it in my fanfic." The other way is to say, "Yeah, the story isn't perfect, but this is the story we have. Assuming it's all correct, what would we have to do to make it true?" They each have their advantages. The first way lets a fanfic author be more creative with worldbuilding and really make the universe their own. On the other hand, the second way provides additional constraints on your writing, which can often be a good thing for a writer.

Personally, which way I prefer varies a lot. For the most part, I like to stick close to canon with characterizations and relationships. When it comes to things like Harry/Ginny not having enough development and Dumbledore acting evil, I like to say "hey, the author wanted Harry and Ginny to get together and wanted Dumbledore to be a benevolent mentor in the first few books, but she didn't write a good romance and she had Dumbledore acting negligent. Screw that. Dumbledore is good and Harry and Ginny work," and read stories that take those as a starting point and then make good stories. On the other hand, sometimes it's really fun to get a more detailed fanfiction explanation of canon events that changes the meaning a bit without actually changing anything in canon.

That means all those awesome cobras, boomslangs, and whatever other species not included in the python, boa, or viper family that super edgy parslemouth!Harry gets his hands on can't see heat signatures.

** I just had an idea. Parsletongue lets a wizard understand snakes such that they hear English (or presumably their native language) instead of the hissing everyone else hears. Now since a large part of communication is body language perhaps the wizard experiences a similar visual interpretation wherein their minds overlay imagined body language like winking (as in the zoo scene) while in reality the snake is just sitting still and hissing.

** Harry Potter is an alternate universe.

In the world we live in, snakes don't have eyelids. There are no Goblins either, or any other of the many weird and wonderful creatures in the books.

In a world with Goblins, the snakes might well have eyelids...

But you're right, it was a bit jarring. I suspect that the first book suffered from first-book syndrome, with Terry Pratchett as a fairly good example, where the first book or two had a very different feel from the later books. JKR probably hadn't thought through the consequences of all the charming little things she introduced us to. A winking snake is /awesome/, and the whole encounter fits well into the plot. It could also be explained away with light or whatever being reflected by the eye.

Btw, why would the snake say "Thanksss, /amigo/" when it had lived in England all its life? There's a lot of broken logic in the books.

** As I understand it, it was eye contact with the basilisk that killed not being in the Basilisks vision. The difficulty came in killing basilisk with your eyes closed.

******* Not to be a spoilsports, but we know that the Potterverse's version of Paracelsius was an example of a benevolent Parselmouth and that he studied his gift extensively and put his findings in writing. Perhaps the answer could be found there.

Barring this, I /could/ just get the Resurrection Stone and ask Herpo the Foul. And that's assuming Herpo is dead at all --- after all, we know he made a Horcrux and are never told it was ever destroyed; for all we know maybe he's still around in wraith form.

And the only thing that can ward against Basilisk venom is Phoenix tears; so Dumbledore rightly assumed that, since Voldemort didn't have ready access to a Phoenix, this was likely his Horcruxes' Achilles heel.
