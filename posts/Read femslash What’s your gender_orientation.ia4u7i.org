Who are the primary readers of femslash? I know that a lot of readers who read m/m slash are described as women, and a fair bit has been written over the years about how sometimes women writing m/m slash for other women can lack key details/be written in a certain way that doesn't necessarily reflect men's experiences.

Do you read or write femslash? What's your gender? What's your experience of it?

I know a number of guy friends of mine read lesbian fic because it often deals with themes associated with women that traditional romance isn't always guaranteed to engage with. Also because apparently sexual themes are dealt with in a more emotionally charged way with less of a focus on power (in traditionally published works anyway). I was wondering if fanfic can be the same too. Thoughts?


** I'm not sure about Harry Potter in particular but I would say most femslash writers are gay / bisexual / pansexual women. A lot of my female friends are into shows with female main characters like The 100, Supergirl and She-Ra and that's like 90% of the writers, especially for fandoms where a lesbian pairing is canonical.

** In my opinion, most of the sexual energy is generated by the plain curiosity and the lure of unknown. Thus the idea is that male-slash gets really exciting for ladies, because it is the area of completely unknown, and femslash should hold allure to us, blokes, because two ladies in a bed is something completely outside of our experience.

*** I can see that, yeah. Also we see this in porn consumption as well, the same kind of curiosity. I was wondering if femslash is written more by women or by men, given that we have a pattern of women writing male slash for women (and gay men saying it doesn't hit the mark all the time).

Of all the femslash I've read, I've never thought to myself that it was written by, or for, a man. So at least if it was, it's always been convincing (to me as a woman at least).

**** I think the first rule is that slash (both kinds) has absolutely nothing to do with real homosexuals. There are exceptions, the author's notes claim that linkffn(12507814) is written by somebody who is truly transgender, and it really feels more authentic than, let's say, linkffn(11396276), however, I am afraid, that is more an exception from the rule than anything else.

***** I don't think it's fair to say that it's got nothing to do with real lgbtqia people, because we do actually read and write slash. There is just also a lot of fetishisation and utilising internalised homophobia and bigotry for angst porn, which is a real issue.

However it cannot be stressed enough that for a lot of young queer people (and older, late blooming or closeted folks as well) fanfic has been a way for them to explore and discover things in a safe (hopefully) fashion

******* Nah, it's just that LGBT people like titillation as much as straight readers. Of course, it's possible you're looking in very different places to me - but this was particularly verifiable when LJ was still about.

Also, lots of LGBT deliberately write out the struggle because it's a fantasy world. Also, not all of us live in places where it's a particular struggle.

I do quite enjoy a 'coming to terms with sexuality' fic, however - but for me, a fic about being kicked out or lots of homophobia just isn't relevant. Of course, I'm not saying there's none at all - but nothing like the tragedy some people imagine. I the first person out in my school year, but I wasn't the only one by far.

********* I'm a lesbian. I read any type of pairing, provided the story is good. Before I had sex, it didn't really matter to me what type I read, although I liked that femslash often had more diverse characterisations and body shapes* and had fewer gender cliches. It was often written by relatively older writters, so stories had more depth. On the flip side, it could be difficult to find longer fics.

If I was after a queer story, slash was easier to find - there's so much of it. Interestingly, bisexual/pans/etc women churn out a fair bit too - so it's not just straight women.

In general, I prefer not to read sex scenes. For me, I don't thinkit adds to a story and when thrown in every few chapters takes away from the plot. Having spent most of my life watching and reading about straight male characters, I don't have a problem putting myself in another character's shoes. So, really, romance is romance for me.

******* I don't keep up with it so much these days - I try to aim for gen fics, but the LGBT community for fanfic tends to form in clusters and groups. Frequently, people will list their sexuality on a profile or blog.

To be honest, I didn't even really have to look for it. I just fell into the right areas of the internet - there's a LOT of LGBT people online in fandom, more than out irl. These people invited people they know to join groups and in the end, you don't even need a specific LGBT group to find similarly minded people. Some of them write good fic and if they do, they probably know who else writes decent fic, etc. So, rec lists written by LGBT women tend to be a safer bet.

If you don't have much of a profile, no-one can be certain but people who engage in the fanfic community tend to have more recs. Plus, the femslash community is, quite simply, smaller.

I don't use tumblr but without a doubt people there tend to tell you.

I would say that reddit is a male dominated website, so you don't see this tendency so much. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if men were more likely to enjoy femslash written by men.

Often my friends and I can make a decent guess at whether a fic is written by a man (when verifiiable), so I would presume the reverse is true.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, I've read very few femslash (written by women) that involved gender-bending. If you're LGBT, you're probably used to being thrown hints (or making up headcanons) about minor characters. So it's less of a jump to read about them. Added on that femslash is so far and few between that if you want to read it, you need to be flexible on pairings.

Also, why change a man to be a woman (unless a trans story?) when there's perfectly good women waiting for the stories to be told.

I'm a bisexual woman, for the record. Two of my favorite writers are lesbians (one deleted her work, but several of the fics are still available in the original fest posts), a couple are straight women, the rest - who knows? Many of my lesbian friends also write and read male slash, het fic, and gen. We tend not to focus on Harry much at all, although my femslash-writing friends often write Snape fic.

** Most fanfic is written/read by women, so I believe most readers would be LGBT women. There's some fantastic femslash out there, written by and for women.

There's still fundamentally the issue that much of it is written by people who haven't had sex/exploring sexuality before experiences. Plus there's the usual 'most fanfic is poor quality' thing going on.

I would agree that sex written by women tends to focus less on power when compared to its written by men - but I haven't noticed a difference across the type of genders written.

** Complicated? I guess...

I'm a male with pretty much no gender identity so I look like an average man except for my hair is longer. I'd say that I'm straight, but I like almost everyone with a really feminine appearance. Woman, guy, trans... just be feminine and I'll probably like you.

The thing is, I don't know if this has a fancy label, but I'm not really interested in real people. I'm a super introvert with no friends, who've never been and is never going to be in a relationship. Some might put me on an asexual or aromantic spectrum, but I don't really think that I'd be any of those. From the outside, I guess I simply look like one of those creepy guys who you tell your kids to stay away from. I pretty much read and write for emotional satisfaction and that's all.

I've read and written mostly femslash and straight stories, but I've only been into fanfictions for a year and a half. I like reading slash, but I haven't written any and I don't even really have ideas for that. I've never read 'traditional' romance so I don't know the difference, but the emotional part of the stories in femslash stories are the ones I like the most.

**** I wouldn't say that I can identify more with a lesbian female character than with any other. I simply find those stories the most interesting. When I don't identify with the characters I simply give up the story regardless of their genders.

I always say that it's more about the characters for me rather than the genders. If they fit together, I'm satisfied with it, even if same-sex pairings often feel more wholesome in an emotional way.

Also, impersonating different characters is really great. Writing from females' perspectives always feels natural for me, but I often wonder if I'm making them way more masculine than they should be. And fanfictions played a great role in making me accept the fact than I might be into some male people and I shouldn't be ashamed of it nor in having slightly feminine traits.
