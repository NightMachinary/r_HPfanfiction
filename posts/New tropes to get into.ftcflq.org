I'm the person to stick to a few select tropes I'm comfortable with, and as you know there's only so much you can read until you get bored of the repetitive tropes and plot lines.

Here are the kind of tropes I like and if there's a certain trope you think I'll like based on them, go ahead and I'll try it out üòÅ

#+begin_quote
  drarry, tomarry!timetravel, severitus
#+end_quote

<op!harry, abused!harry, smart!harry, slytherin!harry

#+begin_quote
  wbwl!harry,

  timetravel, dimension travel
#+end_quote

Things I don't like:

#+begin_quote
  dark!harry, fem!harry, post!hogwarts
#+end_quote

Also anyone feel free to hijack my post lol if they're looking for tropes

Hope your all staying safe üëå

Edit:welp I found out how to do that blue bar format thing (:


** How about these tropes:

- Harry Goes to Another School
- Harry Leaves the Wizarding World (before or after the war is over)
- Parselmouth Harry / Parselmagic
- Harry Is Raised by Another

*** u/StarOfTheSouth:
#+begin_quote
  Parseltongue Harry
#+end_quote

As tropy as it is, I kinda love Parsel Magic. If only because it gives the ability to talk to snakes a use beyond "can open the Chamber of Secrets".

I can't think of a fic that did a lot with Parsel Magic, but I like the idea.

**** Oh! I'm a huge fan at seeing parseltongue incoperated more! Especially when Harry has a pet snake!

Thanks, I'll look into this trope more specifically!

*** Hmmm the being at another school isnt something I'd enjoy. I like seeing house disputes/ allying and Hogwarts itself is beautiful. Plus assuming that the whole of the students/faculty don't move to the whole school, that's a very different outcome of everything

Harry leaves the wizarding wold sounds cool, but doesn't this trope often end up with crossovers? I'd be cool with those except I don't really know much about any other fandoms
