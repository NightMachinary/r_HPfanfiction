I'm looking for good fics where Harry solves a mystery of some kind. Like a murder, or a kidnapping, or a robbery, etc. I've already read Barefoot and The Aurors, so you don't need to suggest either.

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.
