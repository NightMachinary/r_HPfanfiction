I don't understand why people feel the need to write Sirius as a stereotypical Gryffindor unable to differentiate Harry from James. I agree that the character has flaws and I could see him having problems adjusting to a darker version of Harry but I feel as though the character has way more to offer and deserves more than to be written as an obstacle. They always do this by exaggerating aspects of his personality or by blaming his erratic behavior on Azkaban (the Azkaban part could be interesting but they usually don't explore it, and just use it as a flaw).

What bothers me even more about this trope in fanfics is that they tend to cast Severus as a more 'responsible' and sympathetic character to highlight Sirius's failings (especially to show Snape as a better candidate to be Harry's guardian). In what world that wannabe Nazi is the more interesting character idk.

I'm sorry if this is very specific and a little bit ranty, but I would really like to know if anyone else has noticed this, or a similar trend and would like to complain as well.


** â€œThe world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters."

"You don't understand --- there are things worth dying for!"

"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us?"

"But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before. . . . Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him. . . . If Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back."

"When all this is over, we'll be a proper family. You'll see."

"We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on... that's who we really are."

"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."

*** I am not sure about Ron: I would call a one-note character with terrible eating habits and inept badmouthing of "slimy snakes" and such 0-dimensional. As far as I know, Hermione is 1-dimensional: the axis runs from an authority-worshipping nag to Harry's arm candy. What do the additional .3 dimensions represent? An infinite fractal recursion of something?

** I can't say I'm horribly fond of 2-d Sirius or parental Snape, but I think a lot of those authors are trying to use him almost as a foil. The expectations he fought against (he's a Black who should go to Slytherin and love dark magic etc) are the opposites of the ones Harry often lives under in these fics (should be a perfect Gryffindor like his parents and fight for the light). It's not typically done well, but I can often see where they meant to go with it. The other issue is typically Dark Harry's don't get unconditional love from authority figures since often that would make it less necessary for him to be dark/ruthless. Snape's respect is often hard won and contingent on him being basically the opposite of James Potter. If Sirius was not 2-d then his and Harry's bond would probably have a net positive effect on Harry. Therefore it's often easier for writers to skip that and have his assumptions and actions push Harry further away from being a well adjusted human being. So they exacerbate his canon recklessness or short temper and make it his defining characteristic.

*** I haven't thought of it this way, it makes sense. I still dislike this trope and would run away if I see it, but I can see why they would use it. Although I would argue that it would make for a more interesting story to see Sirius loving Harry even if he doesn't agree with what he is doing.

**** Oh I agree! And I feel like I've seen a few that do that or at least have Harry hiding it because he's worried about Sirius's opinion. Typically theses are the ones were Harry ends up Heir Black or something. Definetely lots to explore with that relationship.

** Truth be told, this is why I stopped reading A Black Comedy a little ways through even though a lot of people recommended it to me and liked it (and that's ok). I just never saw Sirius as someone who would sleep with everyone in sight because 'Look at me, I'm not in Azkaban, I'm in an alternate universe and I can do what I want now!'. I get that 12 years in jail probably messes with your social maturity and such but he was still 30-something and for him to revert completely and instantly back to what he was probably like as a teenager just seemed off to me

*** The idea that Sirius would intermingle with everybody upon his exoneration didn't sit well with me for a long time. He is a man out of time, even if he did want to meet as many people as possible, I think eventually, he'll feel out of place and withdraw (whether voluntarily or not). He's two decades back in the timeline. His supposed highly extroverted, 'extremely outgoing with everybody' personality doesn't mesh will with the fact that he wanted company solely because he was lonely in OotP after fourteen years of social isolation except for the random letter, we'd all want that. We do not know if that is his default state or not (in the SWM flashbacks, he's really sullen, James is the more attention seeking of the two. I'd put Sirius at the quieter end of the spectrum).

I really like Sirius in linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error), where Remus is like us, expecting Sirius to go travel everywhere, reconnect with everybody and the author completely subverts that expectation.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.
