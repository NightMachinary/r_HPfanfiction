Can someone know the fanfics, where Harry gets into the parallel universe in which he is dead? I found one such fanfic: "Dimension Father". Can someone know the fanfics similar to this one?

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/dimensional-shift-hp-private-sneak-peek/][Dimensional Shift]] has him visiting multiple dimensions in which their Harry Potter is dead, looking for a new home after his world is destroyed. Some really radical departures from canon (e.g., Grindlewald is the dark lord and Tom Riddle leads the opposition; Dumbldore raised Harry himself until he was killed at the age of 10; James Potter divorced Lily when she wouldn't agree to bind her magic in servitude as a mere muggleborn). It's incomplete, but he has chosen one and mostly settled in by the end.
