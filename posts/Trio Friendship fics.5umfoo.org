I just want to find some fics that shows the deep friendship between Harry and Ron and Harry Ron and Hermione. I love seeing the three together and I like seeing the Trio play of each other. Please no fic that involves character bashing especially of Ron. I don't care if it's set during their Hogwarts years or after it I just want to see a fic with them supporting each other and being friends. Also Auror fics as well as longer fics are welcome as well.

One of his Horcrux was just an ordinary piece of rock lying at the bottom of the Atlantic, and that piece of rock got too close to the sunken wreck of Bismarck...

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
