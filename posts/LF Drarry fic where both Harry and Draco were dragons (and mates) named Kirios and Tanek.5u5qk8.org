I've been in search of a story for a couple of years, and I don't know if the author pulled it or I just can't remember the title. But basically Harry and Draco could turn into dragons and were mates? Draco was a Spirit dragon named Kirios and Harry was a Wrath dragon named Tanek, and they were trying to defeat Voldemort. Last time I read it was 2009/2010 so I really can't remember the title of it, and I feel that the author might of deleted it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to see if someone had any clue about it.


** Seems like you're out of luck. If you [[https://www.google.de/search?q=%22Kirios%22+%22Tanek%22+site%3Afanfiction.net&oq=%22Kirios%22+%22Tanek%22+site%3Afanfiction.net&aqs=chrome..69i57.10617j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Kirios%22+%22Tanek%22+fanfiction][Google for "Kirios" and "Tanek"]] you find two reddit threads ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5o159r/lf_old_drarry_creature_fic/][1]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5lyrou/lf_old_drarry_story_from_around_20102009_where/][2]]) that both went unanswered.

Even if you remove the "fanfic" from the search, you find nothing. In short: The fic isn't on the visible internet anymore, or you (and two others) remember the name wrong.
