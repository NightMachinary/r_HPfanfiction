Don't particularly care if it's slash, hetero or anything. Just read The Beguile and Devotion of a Black Heir linkffn(10710981) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Any suggestions for fics with the same pairing? I don't mind the rating of the fic, preferably a long one and have no problem with anything (except for rape, no.) Don't particularly mind if it's incomplete as long as it's ongoing and not abandoned.

  A chance meeting for Harry sets him on a path he wasn't meant to travel. With his eyes opened, he struggles to control the furious anger after finding all of the lies and hidden agendas. A sudden adoption and unlikely allies work to split him from Dumbledore. With two Lordships and a betrothal, how will the world react to Lord Potter-Black when he refuses to fight in their war?

  Harry Potter disappears from the Hogwarts Express at the end of his fifth year. The Light thinks he is dead. They're right, in a way, but also so very, very wrong. What has the boy who was once Harry Potter become?
