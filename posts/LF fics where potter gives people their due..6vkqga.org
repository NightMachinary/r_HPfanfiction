Im looking for fics after 4'th year where Harry is pissed at people (Dumdum, Order, Ron and Hermione) for keeping him in the dark, and he rants at them/keep them in the dark/ignores them/or otherwise just treat them with indifference.

Bonus if they pick up Harry and take him to headquarters and he just doesnt give a shit about anyone -as it seems to him they dont care about him at all


** Ron and Hermione tend to spend far more time worrying about Harry's issues than Harry worries about theirs.

*** Yeah, but the Forth-Year!Ron was a dick. Harry should not have forgiven him. Then there was the fifth year. And the sixth one. I am not saying you are wrong, but try to look from his perspective.

***** True enough. Although his reason was jealousy. That's where all those shitty Dark!DeathEater!Ron fics were born.

I suppose. But you're looking from your perspective, try looking through Harry's. When he needed him the most he betrayed him. A similar thing happened in the sixth book with all the Hermione bashing J.K. Rowling did.

******** But we look from Harry's perspective in the books. Don't forget third year, when Hermione forces him to give up the firebolt, for example.

Harry needed him the most, and from Harry's perspective and the logical one Ron should have stayed, but not from Ron's perspective. It's also hinted upon that Ron knows that Harry needs him (see Dragon message), but he is stuck between a rock (Harry needs him) and what I figure to be a hard place (himself and his emotions). Harry and logic see only the rock. Ron also chooses the rock in the end.

If Harry had what he wanted and had gotten Ron to stay with him, for example, I figure that he would have betrayed Ron by not giving Ron any room for character growth and maturing (, as Ron's decision to stick by Harry is not effective if Ron had made it under influence of Harry). Aditionally, I think that the locket would not have been needed to get Ron to such an emotional state as he was in Book 7, an outburst which would also happen sooner.

And that's correct, we see things from his *view* but not his thinking.

I totally agree with you. I never said didn't eventually make the right choice, but it took him so long. Still, at least he made the right one.

Interesting line of thought. I have not thought that way. I don't know if I agree yet, but it's worth pondering.

**** Third year Ron is even worse. Look how he is treating Hermione and the entire Scrabbers issue. That was Ron at his worst and honestly speaking Harry is a dick there as well for not standing up in Hermione's defence (she was right after all).

Literally every Dark!Harry fic in hpfanficarchive.com/. Except for that one with Game of thrones. And that one with the Mutants. You know what? Let me correct my previous statement. Literally almost every Dark!Harry fic in hpfanficarchive.com/.

Grey!Harry usually works too. Your idea is good, but there are millions of shit HP fanfics that feature what you want.

*** Ofcause, but as i dont want shit fanfics as you say, im asking for help here in finding the good ones ;)

And most of those i have found goes apeshit dark/evil very fast... Instead of turning Harry ooc, then just make him hit his breaking point after the triwiz and kept isolated. A "harry has enough and talks back" seems more reasonably to me for these kind of fics

**** Believe me, I understand you. I want similar fics, but it's either Harry is sucking Dumbledor's dick, he questions things around him but does nothing about them, or he turns super dark evil man.

** Soooo, the first one that comes to mind is this - [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/ind/a/1/Indifference+And+Neglect/Seel%C2%B4vor/1]] Basically, Harry gets tired of everyone's crap and just stops caring. He over hears a few conversations, stands up for himself, makes a few friends in unlikely places, it's all good. Though there are a few wrong names, and the phrase 'Indifference and Neglect' shows up about ten times. If I remember right, it's technically an h/hr, but that's only in the last bit and is easily ignorable if that isn't your thing. Also, I distinctly remember something along the lines of Good!Voldy and Bad!Dumbles, but nothing too horrible. That's the only one that comes to mind. It's called "Indifference and Neglect" by Seel'vor, if the link goes bonkers for whatever reason.
