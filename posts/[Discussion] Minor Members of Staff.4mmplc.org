Hey, I'm using Aurora Sinistra and Charity Burbage, as well as Sprout, Filch and Flitwick, as relatively important characters in my fic at the moment, and I was just wondering if anyone had any favourite headcanons or characterizations for them?

I know there are fics that look at Dumbledore and McGonagall a bit, as well as too many that give interestingly terrible characterizations of Snape, but I can't think of many off the top of my head where any of these members of staff - or Trelawney, Vector, Kettleburn, etc - are important at all.

So, yeah, what are your favourite trains of thoughts with more minor members of staff at Hogwarts, guys?


** I've always had a chuckle thinking about Sprout's "secret" greenhouse where she grows certain plants for "medicinal use only", which explains why she's always so happy and giggly.

Basically I see her as Hogwart's Medicinal Marijuana dispensary. She get's a lot of business towards the end of the year from fifth and seventh years because of "stress".

It's probably not a hugely popular idea but it always makes me smile.

** I really liked Flitwick's characterization in "The Birthday Present" (a very long Snape Centric fic). Flitwick is a champion duelist and (iirc) a former secrect agent during the war against Grindelwald. He likes to tell Snape stories where he (Flitwick) seems like a ladies' man.

Which is to say, generally any fic in which Flitwick is very competent, and has any personality that seems somewhat plausibly dealing with him compensating for his height is good by me if its pulled off well.

(I mean, I like to think that Hogwarts actually has a lot of really competent people teaching, with Hagrid, Trelawney, and the DADA professors being the exception to this rule).

**** It's the only explanation I can think of for how he can be caretaker for a large magical castle by himself. The times we see him cleaning things in the books? Stuff that the house elves are too busy handling, yet still needs to be taken care of right away, or is him supervising a detention.

** My unfiltered headcanon (and be aware, theres some stupid shit in there):

Aurora Sinistra: Smoking and aware of it. Is a good teacher, patient and understanding, especially towards the younger years that really take a beating with the late nights. She has the habit of taking midday naps for a few hours to get to the full 8 hours per day. Has on and off flicks with former students. Is half-blooded (muggleborn mother from Kenia) and pureblood father from Britain.

Charity Burbage: Mousy and shy woman, pureblood, with a love for stories and fairytales. Completely uninterested in what muggles actually do, but very interested in what stories they tell. Constantly mixes up muggle movies, books and reality in her lessons, making the whole course a farce of very basic factual knowledge with basically made-up advanced knowledge. Shes a moon-landing truther. No kids, no husbands, but a loyal owl.

Vector: As far as her job goes, she is the "good", female version of Snape. Extremely talented in her field of study, but somewhat unskilled when it comes to teaching it. Blatantly takes favorites among her students and tries to get those out of her class that she has not much hope for. She is know for her strict gaze of unblinking eyes. Has offered several times to take over Divination as well, since she also holds a NEWT in that field. (My headcanon: Arithmancy = Divination with Numbers). Is somewhat personally insulted that her offer wasn't accepted, given the state of the Divination lessons. Owns a kneezle. Her grandfathers name was Vektor, as she is of german decent. Name was changed to something "more english" during the war against Grindelwald during wich the Vektors were refugees.

Trelawney: Next to the stuff we know, she suffers slight madness due to her visions and her inability to remember them. Shes not a seer, but an Oracle, as she needs to be in trance to see the glimpses of the future. She knows that she made prophecies, even though she can't remember them and that drives her crazy. She tries to force them by over and over repeating what she thinks are trigger words in front of important people. Suffers from severe depression and the occasional panic attack after normal slips of the mind, because she fears that she, once again, made a prophecy without remembering. Due to her complete inability to actually force visions through techniques of Divination, she has developed a great, private hate against her heritage from the talented great-great-grandmother Cassandra. Alcoholic and avid drug user during longer holidays.

So... for the rest I don't really have a headcanon. Those four were just those I once used as characters in an idea.

**** Well, I probably ought to start with a bit of context. A few months back I started writing a "Dumbledore killed Voldemort in first year thing aka. The trap worked." It had a Harry that grew up with Sirius and his views on girls and sex. Sirius starts a thing with Aurora, resulting in some subplot to Harry's rise as a great wizard artificer.

Anyway, prepare for me rambling.

Aurora likes Russian Pumpkin, which is a longdrink made from pumkin juice and vodka. She enjoys english breakfast, but prefers mediteranean food overall. She also doesn't say no to the occasional hookah/shisha smoke.

Her hobbies include some study into african magics, especially pre-colonial magic. She also delights in the occasional broomride. She doesn't own a pet, per se, but she has opened her house to a family of fairies who occupy the upper part of a cupboard. She is a Holyhead Harpies fan and goes to their games whenever possible.

Before she started teaching at Hogwarts, she was studying the impact of different stars around the globe on a set of potions, charms and rituals. The following essay made her a well known name among the magic theorists and astronomers, as she pointed out the interesting small differences that stars of the Northern and Southern hemisphere have on certain magic practice. She also theorizes that some unique uses of magic around the globe are partly because of the different stars. She is also highly interested in what magic is released during an eclipse, but finds it hard to research. She has a sceptic view on centaur star-seers, but refrains from a definite opinion due to the little knowledge of the practice. She merely states that if its a constellation based seeing, she could easily predict what centaurs see throughout the year.

She owns a house on the Faroe Islands which she uses during holidays and long weekends. She grew up in London, but has a profound dislike of big cities, or rather, light pollution. Her parents live in Norway. They fled during the first Voldemort War because of the stigma on her mothers heritage.

The single most life altering moment she ever experienced was to see the footage of the moon landing by the muggles and especially to see Earth from the moon. Since then she is a constant reader of NASA publications. However, her knowledge of muggle astronomy is her well kept secret due to the bigoted views in the wizard astronomical society. In secret she also researches what it could mean that some stars were dead for millions of years before their light even reached the earth, or what the magical difference between the light of a galaxy, a star and a supernova is. She is also the one who gives Harry the idea to use magic to colonize Mars, as a way to ensure the magicals survival in an increasingly connected muggle world.

During the story, Harry sees her coming and going to and from Lonesome Rock Cottage (the house he and Sirius live in) until eventually before Harry's fourth year, Aurora Sinistra becomes Aurora Black. She has found her equal in Sirius after almost a decade of one-nighters and short relationships. She is a very independent woman and found that Sirius likes it just like that. Aurora never planned to have children, but gives birth to Apollonia and Leonidas Black just after the Triwizard.

I'm not sure if I left something out. If you're still interested, ask.

***** A little late to the party, but I just felt the need to tell you that this whole idea for characterization is amazing. You did a really good job with it. I'm hooked, and I haven't even read the story.

****** Thank you.

It unfortunately never will be a story... it just goes nowhere. But I appreciate the compliment.

*** Sinistra has a subject that seems extremely well planned out. I mean, it's the study of something that changes night to night and can be predicted. Wouldn't she have planned everything out for the entire school year? I imagine she's only teaching like a few days a week to very specific classes and certain astronomical transits. Perhaps she doesn't live at the castle full time and hangs out in a cool weird part of muggle Glasgow when she doesn't want to worry about seeing the stars and maybe has a strange hairless cat and eats easily digestible vegetarian food.

** I read a fic once where Sinistra was described as a night owl who hated her daytime classes and always had a cup of coffee in her hands lol. Ever since, I've always pictured her as being kind of exasperated and caffeine driven. I mean, honestly, her teaching schedule would suck lol.
