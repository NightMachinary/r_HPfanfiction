Searching with angst tag wasn't specific enough. I wish you could helf me, please?

I'm looking for fics where main character goes through dire situation and fights tooth and nail. Where they suffers and not excepted from being damaged or death. Where they might literally die trying, but will not give up. Though some reasonable breakdowns and screams are more than welcome. Situation is not needed to be world apocalypse. Canon is enough. Point is how well charater's emotional/physical struggle is described. Canon is not enough here. Actually if character feels suffocating desperation by doing schoolwork, potions class can be fine catastrophe.

Thank you! Sorry if grammer is wrong, english isn't my first language so it was some struggle. I tried.


** "Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): dimensional travel, Harry and Hermione were in awful shape, but they also faced far worse situations than in canon.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** linkffn(5757945) This is hands down the angstiest fic I've read in this fandom. The last update seems to be where Harry hits rock bottom, because I honestly cannot fathom how he could get any lower. Hopefully it gets better, because the whump is real.

*** Thank you so much for this rec. I'm a few chapters away from the latest update, having read most of the day, and wooow. I want to cry a little every time James says "have you gone from me" and just... ugh. Those words are really poignant. It makes for a great motif. Good things.
