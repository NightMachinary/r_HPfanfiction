I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7198522/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Curse-of-Hamunaptra][Harry Potter and the Curse of Hamunaptra]] and I want more like it.


** linkffn(Gothic by Brennus) has treasure hunting and tomb raiding in it, and is probably Brennus' best work.

Also by Zenzao is my absolute favorite crossover linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra), which is a Bill-centric fic, and is quite frankly amazing. Zenzao does a shitton of writing (500 words a day, I think?) so his (her?) writing has /drastically/ improved in the two years between Curse of Hamunaptra and Cursebreaking Hamunaptra. Give it a read.

If you haven't, linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle by jbern) is, well, a jbern fic. Not quite as famous as The Lie I've Lived (nor do trolls fixate on this one as much), and definitely better than To Fight the Coming Darkness, but this is notorious as that 2nd Person Fic. If you can get your head around that PoV, go for it. The only time that rune-based enchantments and wards has been any level of entertaining.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.
