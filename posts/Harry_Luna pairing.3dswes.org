** I love, LOVE this ship but there's hardly anything besides short fluff pieces.

linkffn(Protection From Nargles) and its sequel linkffn(Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor) have probably the best characterized Luna in a novel length fic even if the start is a bit rough.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because enembee is one of the finest authors in the fandom.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, and the characterization of Harry is a little wonky in places, but it contains some very compelling moments and ideas. One of the best pacifist!Luna characterizations.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but very intelligent fluff, and well worth reading despite being abandoned after 8,000 words.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11201910/1/Different-Together][Different Together]] by Hippothestrowl is an intelligently humorous GoF story that relies on a Rowling-like grasp of character voice and comedic beats. Unfortunately, it kind of goes off the rails in the last chapter, and some have found Harry's characterization to be off-putting.

** Linkffn(firebird's son)

It's not a romance, heavy AU, extremely dark, and not much Harry/Luna in the first book at all. Then on top of that it has other girls (but it's not your typical harem story, far from it), the character development and world don't allow much of the happy luna we all love to remain, etc.

If you are only looking for a fluffy canon-near lovetstory, stay away. But if you want something unique, then please invest few days to read this (thank god already completed) trilogy.
