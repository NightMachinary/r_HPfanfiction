Voldemort's killing curse backfired, so he must have died (or rather his soul ripped). So, why was there an explosion and how did Harry not get injured by that at all?

** Probably because rebounded spells are more volatile. And this spell is normally unblockable so the rebound is fittingly excessive. I mean, the Killing Curse blew up those statues Dumbledore blocked them with so it's not a unique effect in that instance.

*** Because the statues weren't living. But, Voldemort was and so, the direct consequence of a Killing Curse should be simply on him. He didn't blast to smithereens. What did the poor house do?

**** The statues were charmed to life. But that aside, it makes even more sense if they weren't alive. The Killing Curse blows up nonliving things on contact. So the house, being non living,would get blown up by the Curse (especially a rebounded one). Also, as far as we know Voldemort's body was destroyed also. No one ever mentions a body, and Crouch Sr specifically says in the Penseive memory that the Ministry at the time knew Voldemort survived the rebounded curse (meaning his body was definitely destroyed).

Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but there's no reason for the Killing Curse to come in contact with the house if it touches Voldemort first.

Now that you mention it, imagine Voldemort being blasted to smithereens and baby Harry had to watch it?

** There are many possible theories. The main ones are either that the soul-protecting magic of the Horcruxes interfered with the Killing Curse's normal function (which shouldn't account for the soul staying behind), thus causing the explosion; or that when the Killing Curse was reflected back off of Harry, it had become "infused" with the Love Protection, giving Voldemort his first and more powerful taste of the same magic that burned Quirrell in /Philosopher's Stone/.

As to why Harry wasn't harmed, one presumes that the love protection saw to that; being a direct consequence of Voldemort's casting the Curse, the explosion can easily be accounted for as "an attempt by Voldemort to harm Harry", and all of those are blocked by the protection.

Why? The piece that split off and became a Horcrux was part of Voldemort's soul. He didn't intend to make it, so the rebounded curse just split off another piece, that's why it stayed behind. Maybe I misunderstood you.

**** You do indeed misunderstand; the point is that "normally", a Killing Curse results in the target's soul moving on to the afterlife. Thanks to his Horcruxes, Voldemort's main soul /didn't/ (regardless of the accidental Horcrux), and that may have messed up the spell's effects.
