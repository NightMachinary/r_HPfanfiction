:END:
One of the Winchester brothers (I think Dean but I'm not entirely sure) gets stuck in Harry's body or somehow Harry acquired a copy of his memories and think is/was him.

I don't remember a lot about this fic but I know I enjoyed every minute of it and I would like to read it again.


** Okay so it sounded familiar and proceeded to spend the past 20min hunting through my followed stories and found this....not sure if it's what your wanting but sounds very close.
