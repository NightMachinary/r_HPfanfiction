I am looking for fics wherein people who are good in canon become, via a series of unfortunate circumstances, evil or are forced to do evil acts. After reading Black Ink, Red Rose linkao3(19381933) which showed Ginny's downward spiral in a believable manner, I am curious if there exists fics for other characters. I have never seen a Dark Neville fic for example.


** But the Darkness Alters is a slow devolution of Neville to dark. It's also dramione, though, and Neville is gay, and I know people on this sub tend to hate both slash and dramione so be forewarned.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.
