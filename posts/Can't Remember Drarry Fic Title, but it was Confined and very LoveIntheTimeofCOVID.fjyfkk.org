:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sooo this was a Drarry fic I really want to reread. It was Harry and Draco trapped in an old house together. I think that it was a safe house or summer house owned by the Malfoys, and somehow Narcissa tried to save Draco by sending him, but they both ended up there through some twist of fate. They have limited food and fight over it and it's on some level a very dark and gritty fic. They end up in love also and having lots of sex.

If things rings any bells, can you send me a title/link? I remember this being on Livejournal back in the day and I think it was made by a BNF, I just can't recall, however.


** Is it maybe [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/PlayingHouse.html][Playing House]]? I don't remember it much, just that Harry and Draco are trapped in a dollhouse together. If this isn't it, I'd love to read the story if you find it!
