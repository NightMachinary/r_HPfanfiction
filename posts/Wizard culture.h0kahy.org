Can we talk about how little harry knows about wizard culture? Like in his fourth year, someone had to explain what an Auror is even the unforgivables! ( I think these are things everyone should know a muggle kid is never too young to learn about a gun and how harmful it is ) Tales of Beatle the Bard , he and Ron never spoke about their childhoods and what books they enjoyed when they were young? In seven years, not once ??!?!?!?! There are a few more things that other characters explain to him, it just doesn't make sense considering how prominent the news in the daily profit is and how everyone including him reads it daily.


** Most question about a book can have 2 answers, a Watsonian (or In-Universe) one, and a Doylist (or Real-Life) one, as explained [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist][this]] page of TV tropes.

So about "Why does Harry know so little about the magical world culture?" :

- *Watsonian*: he is a pretty self centered kid who rarely notice anything unless it tries to kill him. Also he spends his time between a boarding school which is pretty isolated from the world and his relative house where he is completely cut off from it. Even when in a magical house (the Burrow or Grimmauld), he is stuck inside the house.
- *Doylist*: Harry doesn't know anything about the magical world because we (the readers) also don't know anything. When Ron (or Hermione in the movies since she stole all of Ron good scenes) is explaining something to Harry, it's in fact Rowling explaining to its reader the same thing.\\
  Some on these explanations can happen relatively late in Harry's life (like the Aurors, and even the world "Mudblood" and the general Blood Purism ideology) because the readers had no reasons to know about these things before they became revelant in the scenario.\\
  It's not like an author can put a 60 pages essay to explain a completely different culture at the start of his book (unless said author is a madlad named Tolkien).

*** Still like some things are pretty basic the easiest example being the Aurors( it really pisses me off), look at how starkid introduced them : " were the wizard cops !!!" because that's what they are and it's that simple Harry could've easily provided that information.

**** Well, the Aurors are a special case, not only because they are a bit more complicated than "Wizard Cops" (the "Magical Patrol" seem to be the most close of our cops, while the Aurors are supposed to be "super cops" that only take the most difficult case like identifying and arresting the Dark Wizards), but also because I'm pretty sure Rowling didn't invent them before GoF. 2 evidences support this theory :

- In PoA, Fudge explains how Black was arrested by the "Hit Wizards", yet the arrestation of Dark Wizards is supposed to be done by the Aurors as they are later explained. Hit Wizards are also never mentioned after this scene, which make me believe that they were some kind of 1st draft for what later became the Aurors.
- In OotP, we learn that Shacklebolt is the Auror entrusted with the capture of Sirius Black. And yet in PoA, even when the presence of Sirius Black is confirmed in the school (with several appearances), he never set a foot inside the school. Sirius Black managed to enter Harry's dormitory, his supposed target, but no Auror came if only to ask the Gryffindors some questions? So either Shacklebolt was terrible at his job even before joining the Order, or Rowling had not invented him yet.

***** But that goes with all of the books. PS - Don't go into the third floor corridor unless you want a most painful death. So where were all the outraged parents or the aurors to investigate what was in the third floor corridor? Are you telling me that not a single student (out of 1000 (JKR)) wrote their parents telling them how the headmaster stated they would die if they entered one of the corridors of the school?

What about an investigation about the troll that was in the castle at Halloween? Again not a single concerned parent or auror showed?

Finally Harry killed Professor Quirrell now granted it was self defense but the fact is he still killed a professor. So where was the DMLE auror led investigation into what happened?

Then CoS when the Chamber of Secrets was opened not a single concerned parent showed up even after students started being petrified? Not a single student was removed from the school by a parent? Not a single auror showed up to investigate what was happening nor to provide additional security for the school.

The only aurors to show up only came with fudge to arrest Hagrid "to be seen as doing something" but again no true investigation.

Theses plot holes or just unexplained issues are why folks developed the manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore tropes. Obviously the reason that the aurors never showed up to investigate any of the issues in PS was because Dumbledore never informed them. And no parents showed because Dumbledore put a notice me not charm on all outgoing owl mail if it contained "negative" information on what's happening at the school. He also placed some form of charm on the students when the left on holiday not to talk about the "bad" things that happened.

How else do you explain that out of a thousand students no parents complained or removed their child or got the aurors involved to find out what happened.

​

To answer your question, I'll just say "It's a children mystery book, and the plot need it to happen".

One of the aspect I dislike the most in the HP fandom is this need of some authors to find an "In-Universe" explanation to everything that happened, because in order to do so they have to change so much some characters that they end up as only parody of themselves.

​

The structures of both PS and CoS are pretty simple : there is a mystery in the school, and only the hero (Harry) can solve it. And since it's a children book, everything ends well and there is almost no consequences.\\
Because of this structure, some concession must be made for the sack of the story :

- Unreliable adults : it can be annoying how the adults of the story are mostly useless (McGonnagall as an example, who dismiss the Trio even though they proved to her that they knew almost everything about the Stone and its protection).\\
  But to be fair, they need to be useless so Harry can arrive at the last moment and save the day. I have read some "feel good" fanfics where the adults are as competent as they are presented to be, the plot is resolved in 2 or 3 chapters and everything after is just some slice of life for Harry which is just . . . boring.
- Easy protections : Why are the protections so simple that 3 First Years managed to pass them? Some people say that it's because Manipulative! Dumbledore prepared it as a "test" for Harry, why other say it's because these protections were only there to slow down Voldemort and give him a false sence of security, with the mirror being the true protection. But the true explanation is that if the teacher really did they best to protect the stone, Harry would have ended up as smear of blood against the 1st protection, so she had to tone down everything to his level.
- Isolated school : Why is nobody reacting to the strange things happening at Hogwarts? Once again, you can either go with the "Manipulative Dumbledore is blocking the mail" or just "if adult truly cared about their children safety, the school would close around November and there would be no story.\\
  Also, months (or maybe years) ago, I remember reading a post of this sub explaining how to truly make Hogwarts the best and safest school in the world. All I remember about this post is that at the end, Hogwarts, a magic school, would have managed to become boring, plot need danger and drama.

Most of the "plot holes" can either be easily explained with a Doylist explanation, or need a lot of guess work and extrapolation to somehow find a Watsonian one. One of the problem of the serie is also that around the 3rd or 4th book, the structure changed from a "Children book" to a "Teen book". Because of this, the serie became more serious (with the inclusion of concepts like the enslavement of House Elves, or the prison of Azkaban) and the events began to have consequences (with the death of the innocent Cedric being the best example), ,so people began to look back at the first books with the different eyes, even though the structure is different.

******* Without a doubt I agree with you about a children's story. One that was interesting enough that it pulled in adults and one that ran long enough that the kids who it was designed for have grown up and had their own kids.

And once you look at it with adult eyes you can see plot holes that you could sail a nuclear aircraft carrier through them.

But of course this allows fanfiction authors to fill in those plot holes and create their own story lines.

******* On the easy protections I saw one fanfic that described the initial protections that would have easily killed all three kids (if they could've gotten past the first door) and what the manipulative/evil Dumbledore switched them to force a harry/Voldemort confrontation.

***** Totally agree... it's been a while since I read the books and I do have to review... but that's my whole point throughout the entire story Harry is constantly put into danger and I think what's lacking in the early books is the lack of thought given to what we consider trivial ... like if in any story there is a break in into a bank or a school or some dangerous criminal is in the loose the first thing you'd think about is law enforcement.

Another thing that could've been done better is the whole fact that law enforcement , legislation and the justice court are all run by the same person. (I' not sure what is the word for it in English is ) I know it's supposed to show how messed up the ministry is at the first war , but you'd think they'd do things a little different after because if the ministry is that weak Voldemort never needed to hide, mass panic is exactly what would work for him .

It's just small things that the more I think about the more I realize how truly flawed the world building is , even if it is made for young adults doesn't mean you can half ass it .

I'm not saying you are wrong (this is definitely why JKR did it) but I just want to point out that this isn't the only way to do it.

The alternative (which we see in Dresden Files, for example) is for Harry to know more than the reader and when it comes up (so that the reader needs to know it), you have the narrative explain Harry's knowledge of the matter to the reader rather than a character explaining it to Harry.

This is the approach I have taken in Victoria Potter - something of an necessity, given her prodigious nature and wider social circle.

**** From what I remember from canon, Rowling also uses the "narrative explanation", but only to remind the reader of something (how awfull the Dursleys are, who is Draco or the situation of Sirius).

It's a wonder why she didn't use it to also introduce "obvious" cultural aspect of the magical world, but considering the success of a books, any choice she made worked for her.

** JKR didn't seem to be fond of too much worldbuilding(no more than was strictly necessary) and only really did it after people pestered her about it to the point she had a whole site made it(Pottermore) I don't think it's even about the money, but just a way for her to answer questions so people can be happy.

This may have happened because she didn't want to write herself into a corner, it also made fans more tolerant to plot holes because of it.

Not everyone can be Tolkien and George RR Martin who made history, geography, genealogy, and culture by the droves for their work, most of which isn't exactly relevant to their main novels.

Martin's worldbuilding is absurd, and Tolkien's only simpler because his world is not as complex, but it still goes way back.

** Does Harry really read the prophet everyday or does he just read the stories when they are about him (eg I don't recall him being a cover to cover daily reader)?

Two the purebloods have ensured that the muggle studies course is at least 100 years or more out of date yes an assumption but why else wouldn't the course be more up to date if the content wasn'tbeing interfered with). So the assumption is because they detest muggles and look down on muggleborns. That would explain why there isn't a course or a list of wizarding culture books because the purebloods don't want the muggleborn to stay.

As far as other kids not saying anything. How about the simple belief of "you didn't know that I thought everybody knew that". Eg to magicals it's general knowledge so they automatically believe that everyone either already knows it (since it's so basic/common knowledge) or everyone was already taught it like they were.

I don't expect him to, but I expect a lot of juicy stories have Auror interventions or commentary eg. They say the attempted robbery of the sorcerer's stone is being investigated.... no one ever said aurors ?

Idk I'm nitpicking but it just annoys me that he knows nothing, in a lot of stories the main characters explain things and how they work by mentioning a memory or a connection, like having Harry explain what an Auror is when we first meet Moody by saying he was interested in that line of work instead of saying he wanted to be an auroroutn of the blue one year after he met one who wasn't even an auror lol . I have too much time on my hands I'm starting to hate the books. 😂

**** "It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he would like to be." In HBP.

Harry wants to be magical special forces given the prophecy with Voldemort. Its too bad that he doesn't continue with the DA to prepare for the war and that said magical SOF resembled mall cops rather than highly trained operatives for the rest of the series, given that all the Aurors do is capture Stan Shunpike.

***** But that also leads into/points out a major plothole. And the one that truly bugged me was that a discussion about possible careers happens in 5th year (two years after you starting taking electives). I could see the conversation going like this.

McG- so Harry have you thought about what you would like to do when you graduate?

Harry- Well I met Bill Weasley and I think being a cursebreaker would be interesting.

McG- Well you should have started taking Ancient Runes in 3rd year as you can't be a cursebreaker without them. So that career isn't possible.

Harry- I didn't know that. Why didn't anyone say something back when we were first picking electives?

McG- It's not our job to tell people what electives to take.

Harry- how are students supposed to intelligently select electives in 3rd year if no one tells us what career requires which electives?

McG- oh......
