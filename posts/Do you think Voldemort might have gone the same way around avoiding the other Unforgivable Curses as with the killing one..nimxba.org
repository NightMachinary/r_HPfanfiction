I was just thinking, it seems like each of the unforgivables attacks one aspect of human:

- Imperius attacks the mind;

- Cruciatus attacks the body;

- Avada Kedavra attacks the soul.

By the time Voldemort is introduced he appears to have mangled all three. We're explicitly told that he mangled his soul to beat death. But he also has snake-like features and reptiles are thought to not feel pain... or not the same way humans do anyways. And he is quite insane with thoughts of grandeur, talking about himself in third person, obsessive behavior and complete disregard for other people. Could that be the result of twisting his own mind either through magic or subjecting himself to repeated sessions of Imperius in order to develop resistance to it? I always assumed that Harry so easily resists the Imperius is because part of the Voldemort's soul becomes more active when his mind is unfocused. Sure he is also strong willed but the Horcrux remains unaffected by the curse and in fact that's the little voice that tells Harry not to obey the commands given through the Imperius.

Similarly, I wonder whether he did other stuff to become immune to love potions, poisons that may inhibit magic or other curses. Maybe even go as far as to remove all human needs such as hunger, tiredness or the need to go the bathroom since he believed himself to be a god. It would be quite in character to even view those as weaknesses.

Any thoughts?


** I can see Voldemort doing that. It makes a lot of sense actually.

** I have an intertwined theory that could fit with yours! It is that he made a deal with a demon or a similar being. However, there's always a give and take. So maybe for his 3 wishes he asked to be made immune from the Imperius, Cruiciatus and Avada. They made him immune to Imperius by mangling his mind so no-one would ever understand his thoughts. They made him immune to Cruiciatus by imbuing him with those snake like qualities so he couldn't feel pain but also couldn't feel any other emotion. And Avada... well, you can't kill something that isn't alive. And can Voldemort really be considered alive?

** I've made this comment before but I think it bears repeating

The killing curse just seems to be an instant death status effect curse, it doesn't eject the soul from the body

Because dementors do that, they take away your soul. And yet you don't die instantly when that happens, your body keeps on living you just need assistance with basically everything

So the killing curse is not really affecting the soul

Now, you could change that in a story or AU or whatever you want to write, make it so that the killing curse actually harms the soul and this is why the death is instant and why it has such a harsh punishment on the caster and such.

You can re-write it how you like I suppose

*** Fair. Yet it's still the soul that is attacked since the body remains without any sign of damage. That is my interpretation. A soul eaten by a dementor still remains on the human plain and thus your body continues to live, just like with a horcrux. But in the case of Avada Kedavra your soul is elected into the afterlife.

Not even remotely freacking true, you can say that to some extent about certain taxa of fish, but reptile feel pain just like mammals. It is stupid myth made up people because reptiles don't react as violently to pain as mammals do, because playing dead even when bitten is their survival strategy in many cases.

*** I'm here to discus a fictional world not actual science. However the fact that reptiles don't feel pain was a pretty common myth until not so long ago. And, yes, I know they do feel pain but it's still assumed to be less intense than that of mammals.

**** Reptiles are just better at tolerating pain and resisting reflexes associated with it. I just don't think poor creatures deserve to be demonized this way. Voldemort made himself look reptilian to dial up his claim of being Slytherin's heir.

***** Why are they demonized? They have a nervous system that is less sensitive than that of humans. That's it.

If there's someone demonizing reptiles it's the bible which associates the snake with the devil and by extension JK, whom we don't know why she chose to associate Slytherin with snakes or why she chose to make Voldemort have snake-like features.

I just put out a theory. You can offer suggestions if you want but I'm not here to discuss the nervous system of reptiles.
