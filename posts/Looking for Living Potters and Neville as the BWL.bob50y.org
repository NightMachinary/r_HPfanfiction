Looking for stories following Harry as he navigates the world and eventually becomes someone but to start off just another kid in his year. Would like to see Living Supportive Potters as well


** Umm I don't think I've ever read any fanfictions like that (I'm more into Dark!Harry...) but there's a tag on AO3 called something like "Wrong Boy-Who-Lived" that might be able to help you? Though from what I remember, there's also a lot of Harry having some kind of a twin who ends up being the BWL and Harry is abused (hence how I know about the tag). Good luck!

It involves Harry accidentally traveling to a universe in which Neville is the BWL, so it doesn't fit your request perfectly. But he is just another kid, and his family is supportive.

#+begin_quote
  -COMPLETE- One morning Harry wakes up in a different world. His parents are alive and Neville bears the scar. Things are different and Harry starts to like that the weight of the world isn't on his shoulders. Neville may not be able to bear that weight.
