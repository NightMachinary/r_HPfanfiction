After a wizard/witch is found murdered under mysterious and ritualistic means, auror Harry James Potter is quickly pulled off the case when an uncovered piece of evidence ties his past to the victim.

His (separated) wife's family.

Suspicion falls upon him by association, so he realizes to find the truth, and whether they're involved, he'll have to break the promise he made himself all those years ago: to never go back.

On arriving the cartel's mansion, he is met by confusion and hostility by the younger members, while the older members, whom he knew personally, greeted him sadly, respectfully, and with reverence, baffling the newer members.

He's directed to her office, but he needs no direction: he knew the place inside and out, after all.

After steeling himself, he walks in after a knock.

Behind a desk, hands on papers, Daphne Greengrass smiles at him and warmly welcomes him home.

When Harry first met, fell in love with, and married Daphne, he had no idea that her family was basically a magical mafia, and she was set to inherit.

Finding out this lie after they were married, as her attempts of keeping it quiet from him inevitably failed, resulted in him leaving and becoming separated from her (that, and he was on the other side of the law, too).

To Daphne, however, they were just having a marital spat, albeit a multi-year one and that he'll "come to his senses eventually", and they're still firmly married in her eyes.

After finding out why he's there, however, she's furious: not at him, but at the obvious set-up attempt on her family.

Unfortunately, Harry unintentionally played into their hands by going to see his wife, as it makes them look guilty.

Harry now has to solve the mystery, chart a course through a tumultuous marriage, and remain on the right side of the law.
