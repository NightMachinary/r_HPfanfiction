** AO3 actually has a feature to abandon an individual fic by declaring it an orphan, or you can delete your account and orphan all your fics. I've seen one particular case where an author apparently ragequit, orphanning their fics, then created another account and was able to reclaim them.

Also of note is that this was the fifth story in the Sarcasm and Slytherin series. Although orphanned, the series link still works: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]]

** It used to be by 'sunmoonandstars', so I think she deleted her account. It's almost certainly abandoned, unfortunately.

*** Yup. It's been orphaned, which is basically abandoned.

** The 15/26 means that the author planned to have 26 chapters and only got to part 15. If there's a question mark on one side it means the author doesn't know how long it will be. If the numbers are equal it's complete.

*** If it says 15/26 and was last updated about 3 months ago, does it mean the story is abandoned or is there a chance it got continued somewhere else?

**** Perhaps it isn't abandoned and the next update is being worked on, on the same site

** I'm so sad. This is my favorite fic and I was hoping the author would eventually come back to it. But if it's under an orphan account now I don't have much hope.

*** Copy/pasting my comment to OP here so you'll get a notification:

Found out that sunmoonandstars did in fact continue Secrets of Vipers on a new account, posting the next few chapters a few days ago, and remembered this thread. Enjoy: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513/chapters/59756794]]
