also any story were Harry as a child learns to use his magic to full dive(like the Nervegear from sword art online) into the MMORPG World of Warcraft.

Or if he were to bring a copy of world of Warcraft to hogwarts and use it in the room of requirement to have the room simulat the world of Azeroth.(or mabye the weasly twins could create a product that lets you do it like a pensive but instead of going into memories it lets you go into video games)

But I am not really interested in storys were Harry uses dimension traveling magic to actually go there.


** This is... very specific, and I can't QUITE recommend something that fits exactly what you're looking for. However, because you mention SAO, and "full diving" with Harry's magic:

Not WOW related whatsoever--entirely an HP/SAO crossover fic. I know it's not what you're looking for, but I've been enjoying it nonetheless.

  After two years, they are finally out of SAO, but the real world is not how they remembered it. They are now strangers in a familiar land. Now they have to try to adjust to a new world... again. But what about those they left in the real world? Will they like the changes that everyone has experienced?

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew.
