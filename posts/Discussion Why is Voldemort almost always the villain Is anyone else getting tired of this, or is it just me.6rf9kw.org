This is particularly grating when the fic is AU. I mean, come on! Everything else in your fanfic is different, so why not shake things up?

Make another HP character the main villain, or even better, create your own villain - one that would put Voldemort and his Death Eaters to shame! I know it's not as easy as it sounds, but doing so - as long as it is well-written - can go a long way to making your fanfic something else. If, for example, Harry goes back in time - with so much more knowledge and wisdom - why retread the books, when a new, much more powerful foe can emerge from the shadows ready to face our protagonist.

What do you guys think?


** I think a lot of people are tired with reading Harry vs Voldemort but we're a community of avid fanfiction readers. For a lot of people Harry Potter the series IS Harry vs Voldemort. Then 30-40% of fanfiction and rarely the good part is Harry vs Voldemort done 'right', better known as OP or Indy Harry. Its easy, its what we know and what we first loved in the books. The driving conflict through out the series was Harry vs Voldemort and its only natural that people want more. So many people who first touch the writing side, especially in their teenage years want a 'better' Harry, a Harry who is Voldemort's equal in always.

Post-Hogwarts or stories outside of Hogwarts are very popular but very difficult to write. Essentially they're completely new. Fanfiction is like lego in someways, you're given the pieces and you can make it your own but essentially the pieces are given to you, post-Hogwarts/outside of Hogwarts features new characters or characters who have developed in ways not shown in the books. I personally don't like the epilogue there is almost limitless potential if one ignores the epilogue and/or Pottermore. The problem with limitless is its vague. We like specifications, it makes things easy. I ask you to draw me a masterpiece and you'll stare at the paper blankly not knowing where to start. I ask you to write a 5th year Indy Harry story where he gets stronger, well you could knock one out in a few hours. Editing and improving is infinitely easier than creating something from scratch.

We don't pay for fanfiction (ignoring people who bought Cursed Child) and beggars can't be choosers. If 70% of what is written is Harry vs Voldemort then we either read it or we have very little to read.

** I'm with you, let's let Voldemort just be completely dead the night he attacked the Potter's. It would segue beautifully into the 'manipulative Dumbledore' trope so well it's ridiculous.

It would be a story in which an ever aging, highly respective person, who wields just a smidgen too much political power, corrals and controls the life of the protagonist due to the ramblings of a 'seer' combined with his increasing senility.

Actually, I am not sure how I lasted until chapter 15 as so many parts are cringeworthy. The writer has a certain charm to their writing that has kept me going.

** In order to make Voldemort not /an/ antagonist, you generally have to either have someone else kill his parents, have Voldemort being mind-controlled (often found in evil!Dumbledores), have some other thing make Voldie not in control of his actions, or have some way to make Voldemort not Voldemort (say, by Obliviating him back to childhood.

Alternately, you could have a 'bigger fish' scenario, where you have something so very evil that Voldie goes 'enemy of my enemy', and ends up not being an enemy (by death or redemption) by the end.

Or have Voldie's defeat not be the end (bigger bad), or just have him be to be dealt with, but just not the biggest problem.

Fics that do that can feel... awkward or ill-paced if done poorly, especially if the author heavily relies on canon for structure and pacing and stuff.

At worst, you end up with awkward summary chapters after Voldie falls.

** I was writing this story where Voldemort died from dragon pox in his first year at Hogwarts Canon!Harry soul gets switched with this Harry's dimension.

The main villain was a Vietnamese witch whose parents died during the Vietnam war by way of napalm bombing, they were researching soul magic (Horcruxes and other stuff) thanks to that they were able to save her (sacrificing themselves) and the woman became really powerful thanks to her parent's research and their sacrifice.

her objective is to reveal the wizarding world and destroy all forms of government (also thin the population) to create her own version of peace so no one has to live what she lived

She is less crazy than Voldemort just as powerful and ruthless and even more dangerous

the kicker was that she was killed by Voldemort in the canon universe

** I feel like in many fics it's difficult to make a different character take on a Voldy-type role, especially if Voldemort still exists in the story. However, just because there's no other "foes" doesn't mean that Voldemort has to drive the plot. Maybe instead of a Hero-vs-Villain story, turn your story into a Man-vs-Self or a Man-vs-circumstance?

E.g. maybe time-travelling Harry holds almost all the cards and can easily trounce Voldemort (although perhaps at a cost), but he has to examine the moral implications of his actions every step of the way? Is he turning into a terrorist like Voldemort? Is he turning into a manipulative chessmaster like Dumbledore? Is he using his knowledge to accomplish as much as he's obligated to, or wasting time on arguing with himself?
