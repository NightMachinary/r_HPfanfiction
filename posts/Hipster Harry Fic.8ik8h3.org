Basically looking for a milennial as fuck flannel wearing kombucha drinking time unbelieving woodstock attending kind of Harry

Basically what [[/u/noexit007][u/noexit007]] shows in his post

" I feel like that Harry would be wearing socks with sandals, often seen in flannel pants, usually also wearing his robe as both pajamas and daywear. Perhaps carrying around a sippycup full of vodka, or a chai latte and a reusable snack bag full of organic kale chips, while pondering the dangers of frizzy hair and desperately trying to convince Hermione to use a new organic hair product he invented in his bathtub. Sometimes to be discovered praising the benefits of putting bicycle pedals on his broom so one can pedal while flying to anyone who will listen. Occasionally found playing his acoustic guitar in a breakfast nook, or discussing the merits of their favorite obscure author, while quoting love sonnets to no one in particular. "

I want this so fucking badly

** Bonus points if he ditches class to go do shrooms in the Forbidden Forest with Luna Lovegood.

Hagrid: "Harry! Luna! Aint'cha two s'posed ter be in class?"

Harry: "Class is like... a drag, man. /This/ is what learning looks like."

*** If they want a full length story, then I have no idea why.

Crack fics, however, can be highly entertaining and generally limit to several chapters or less, and really are just extended jokes.

*** I love that character archetype. Far better than wangslord edgerazors or supposed smooth talkers or pretentious bastards or whatever is popular these days. I like people that I would actually like, thus, this being an arcytype of person that I generally like, I would like a story about someone fitting it.

Basically, I know a lot of people like that and thus wish to read about people like that. Mister Freud probably has something to say on the matter... or jung...

*** If you don't like it that's fine, but no need to post this comment. I guarantee there's something in the fandom that you like that a lot of people would hate, so no need to post such a comment on someone else's taste.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
