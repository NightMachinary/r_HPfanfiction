Binge-watched this recently. Anybody up for it?


** Time travel would have to be involved. Could also be a good opportunity for Harry to finally attend Ilvermony, which I've never seen, despite it having existed in the Potterverse for several years now. I'll have to see if I can borrow the books from the children's section of my library, just to see if it's feasible.
