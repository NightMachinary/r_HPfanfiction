** I would argue, that having a relationship which began based on physical attraction and then slowly grew into something more is a more realistic story than your average "I love you, now let's kiss for the first time" romance.

And I am also quite sure that ten years down the road, Ron would be a lot happier with Lavender than he would be with Hermione, given that she stopped calling him Won-Won.
