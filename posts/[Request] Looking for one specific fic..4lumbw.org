from what I remember the fic had a type of special title for some people i think the name of the title was warden but i am not sure. I also remember Hermione being gay and took the title of warden to be allowed to marry another girl (i think she might be marrying more than one, but not sure about that)

I also think Harry had more than one girl.

can anyone help me?
