I thought it was a spectacular story. It's a very interesting Dark Harry story. I liked that the author made him suitably paranoid and dark to fit the situation without taking it over the top into something cartoonishly evil. I also really liked that the author didn't do that thing where a supposedly dark and asocial character meets that one other character that's just so special they can't help themselves. It was great to see him keep even Hermione at arm's length for the most part.


** Surprisingly good. Starts off like crack and then turns into a real fic.

** Okay, I guess. Just started reading it and I would have liked it more if the story started with an older Harry, just personal preference.

** It was pretty okay. Not usually the biggest fan of the "munchkining," but at least it kept that relatively sidelined. My favorite part of it was its update rate.

*** What exactly does "munchkining" refer too? I've never seen that term before.

**** It's kind of like powergaming. I haven't read the fic in a while, but from what I read, Harry seemed to know things it made no sense for him to know, and he used that knowledge to his benefit. In other words, it was as if he was a character controlled by a gamer that knows how the game is played and forgoes roleplaying entirely in order to 'beat' the game.

** It got a little weird halfway though. It has a lot of promise in the beginning and some interesting ideas (like how all the deaths impact him psychologically) but it's a independent Harry type fic that pairs him with Hermione, so it's not my cup of tea

** I got really far into it and ended up dropping it. Something about the writing style/editing just turned me off

** I enjoyed it reasonably well. His eventual power level was a bit of a stretch of my SoD as I recall, but otherwise well done.

** I thought it was fun read, the triwizard tournament was one of the more enjoyable ones and it closed the story rather nicely. There's a lot of munchkinry in the later half of the story that was interesting, if you enjoy action sequences then I really recommend this fic.
