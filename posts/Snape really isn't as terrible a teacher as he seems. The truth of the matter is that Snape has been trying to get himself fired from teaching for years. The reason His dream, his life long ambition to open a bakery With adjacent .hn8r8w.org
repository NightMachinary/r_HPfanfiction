** “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of baking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the soft bread texture with its freshly-baked scent, the delicate power of flour, vanilla and cinnamon that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . I can teach you how to bottle sweetness, brew tenderness, even stop wheat from withering --- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”

*** I personally love the grangerbread, even though the purebloods view them as a lesser biscuit. Some go far as to say they taste like mud.

Perhaps it's because grangerbread biscuits stem from the far more common gingerbread, another controversial recipe among purebloods. The plethora of gingerbread variations and the simplicity of the recipes are frequently cited by frequent pureblood spokesperson, Malfortunecookie, to make the gingerbread 'a disgrace to the name of a biscuit.'

That said, the famous eccentric baker Allspice and his assistant Macaroonagall have long championed grangerbread.

** /Here a little something that was inspired by this prompt. English isn't my native language so there's gonna be mistakes./

--

Severus Snape was looking into the list of the future first years. They'll begin their career at Hogwarts next week.

He was searching for his next victim. A wizard from a powerful family. A family that would have no qualms going against Dumbledore to get Snape fired.

That's all the potion teacher wanted. To be fired and finally to do whatever he wanted. In this case, starting a bakery.

He already could see it, taste it, smell it. He could already feel the comforting heat from the oven when his apple pie is baking. He could already smell the cinnanemon mixed with the chocolate of his perfect muffin. He could see his little bakery, decorated on a chocolate theme, the darkest of them. The bitter was always the best. He would have a chocolate fountains at the entrance, of course. That would bring kids in, and he isn't really fond of kids. But he wanted the fountains, so he didn't care much about that.

What he cared about is using his skills to make delicious cakes. He wanted to finally trying to work on those giant wedding cakes that would demands all of his skills and focus.

But so far, this is a pipe dream.

His freedom was linked to his employement at Hogwarts and Dumbledore supervision. He couldn't quit himself, or his pardon would be void. However, he could get fired, and not face Azkaban, as long as he didn't do anything illegal. That was a loophole that everybody had ignored and that Snape intended to use.

His plan had been to become the worst teacher that Hogwart had even known. The thing is that is a challenge. He tried to be boring to the point kids would feel asleep in his classes. It didn't work. Then again, he should have seen it coming, Binns was still teaching here, after all.

Clear incompetence wouldn't give him his freedom back, either. Look at half of his colleagues.

He decided to become the biggest bully. To make the kids so afraid of him that their parents would complains and force Dumbledore to fire him.

Immoral, yes. But not illegal.

He also avoid didn't explain his lessons nor showed how to follow his intentionally convoluted instructions. Let's not have people think that his horrid behavior was worth his valuable teaching.

That plan haven't work, yet, but he wasn't ready to abandon it. He already gathered more complains than any other teachers in this school. Sooner or later it will work out. He did have hope with the Weasleys, especially the new perfect one. He kid was sensitive, unlike his twin brothers. And the Weasley did have some standing. At least enough to have the ear of Dumbledore if they wanted it.

But nothing came of it. The new perfect had shown himself stronger than Snape had thought.

And maybe, this year will be the one. There was another Weasley coming. Hopefully a bit more like The Perfect than the Twins or the Seeker. Those ones were immune to any form of bullying.

He ignored many muggle-borns. Oh he still will bully them, to maintain his reputation, but none would make a good primary target. Would their parents even know how to get him fired ?

He focused on old wizarding names. Bones ? No. Too dangerous. Amelia Bones was head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She would make life very hard for him well after she had him fired.

Malfoy ? He wanted to be fired, and then open a store. Not to get killed or suffer a terrible accident. Mafloy likely already hated him for his defections. He would destroy him if he thought Snape was hurting his son.

Potter ? Of course he will bully that one, just out of spite. And he will get great pleasure doing it. But not very useful for his end goal. No one would complains. Lily would have. Hell, he would have been fired the minute he looked wrong at her kid, if she was still alive.

Snape refocused on the list of future first-years before the pain became unberable.

And here, on the 5th page, well after kids he won't see for a few years, he found his gem.

Longbottom. That was a very powerful family.He had to deal with Augusta a few times. This was a woman that no one would say no to. She had the power to get him fired if she wanted to.

Neville Longbottom. A late bloomer. Late-bloomers were good for his plan. They usually lacked confidence and self-esteem. They were sensitive, they didn't stand up for themselves, and they never tried to learn on their own, as they believed that they couldn't do it without a teacher.

If Snape played it right, Longbottom would be afraid of him before the end of the first quarter, and wouldn't learn anything in his class.

If he played it right, he'd have his bakery before the end of the school year.

*** That's the thing though: Teaching terribly and being a terrible teacher are not the same thing. It is like saying, "I took a test and got literally every answer wrong." Statistically, I should have gotten at least some of the answers right if I was just terrible at taking tests. But I had to be good enough to know the right answer to answer incorrectly and thus take the test terribly. Same idea here.

If he were a terrible teacher, statistically, at least a few students would have thought him a good teacher or there would have been lessons that went well and resonated with students. However, if he were teaching terribly, he could be an amazing teacher just doing everything he knows is a terrible way to teach.

If he is trying to get fired, that sounds like he is teaching terribly, not necessarily a terrible teacher. For all we know, if he were trying to get fired, he could actually be the greatest teacher known to man for all time. But all we see is him teaching terribly.

**** The thing about this is that you don't need to know what the right answer is in order to get every wrong answer, you just need to know what isn't the right answer, which can be very easy or hard depending on the formatting of the exam. If it was fill in the blank, that is very easy to get a question wrong if you put in something nonsensical like “dinosaur dildo”. If it is multiple choice, it can be easy or tricky based on how close the all of the choices are to the right answer, like for Astronomy, if the question is “Which is the smallest planet in our solar system?” and one of the choices is Jupiter, having a limited knowledge of Astronomy can make it easy to pick the wrong answer.
