** *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): it's one of my favorite HP fanfics. Harry and his girls make up a power team.

*Harry Potter's Promise*, linkffn(3974563)

*The Harem War*, linkffn(11035814): I actually don't like this one, but it's worth mentioning

I'm surprised that there is no Hermione/Harry/Ron story. Given the amount of Harry/Multis out there, it would be nice to see a Hermione/Multi for a change. So, why not turning the golden trio into the lover trio?

*** Hermione/Harry/Ron fics are called menage et trio and there's a few I heartily recommend starting with this guy if you want something canon compliant.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951061]])

This one has pretty much the same story line but with a happy ending and slightly worse structure.

[[http://www.triofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=266&warning=FF-Adult]]

And it really shouldn't be a surprise that there's very little trio stuff, this sub is *dominated* by straight guys who are -in general- quite averse to any male/male stuff.
