** I've found that Harry/Tonks has had some great adaptations, although I do also approve of the canon ships. Otherwise, I like inventive (but not ridiculous) or original ships, like the Harry/Katie Bell from (oh God) /Cadmean Victory/ or other ships involving side characters who haven't been heavily explored.

/With the general exception of Daphne Greengrass. God, I'm so fucking sick of that ship, because it seems like 9/10 stories with it in deploy the same-old "Ice-Queen" trope that's boring, underdeveloped, and usually requires some stupid politics BS that's equally uninspired for it to have any narrative weight other than stupid independence angst-fests./

Harry/Tonks - I like how their personalities fit together in a well written story.

Harry/Fleur - I'm a sucker for attractive French women

Harry/Fem Voldemort. - This one I never really knew I needed in my life until TheEndless7 started writing a story with the two of them interacting.. If only there was more stories about them.

Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Narcissa - These are my guilty pleasure pairings

** Probably Harry/Tonks. She feels like exactly what Harry needs. Harry might as well be in his 20s with the shit he's gone though. Tonks has the fun personality that could do him good. And I've always liked relationships that have drama to them. Tonks is older, so naturally that would bother someone.

Others I like:

Harry/Fleur if done right

Ginny/Luna

Harry/Hermione if done right (no bashing). Pretty rare though, in my opinion.

** Ron and Hermione are one of, if not /the/, favorite couples in fiction. They just compliment each other in the most perfect of ways. They're perfectly imperfect. I never really got behind Remus and Tonks, instead thinking she'd have been better with Charlie. George and Angelina always seemed weird to me due to her previously dating Fred. Harry and Ginny are great. But the greatest ship in all of HP is Draco x Apple.

** harry & tom/voldemort, because you really gotta rangle canon to make that work lol

ironically it's the idea of this pairing and others like it that made me avoid fanfiction altogether when i was younger and thought it was all plotless porn(i wasn't entirely wrong...)

i'm not picky at all about pairings, though. i will read any ship as long as one member of the party is a character i like, though i do tend to stay away from hetro fics unless they're lemon free

** I prefer Harry focused stories so....

Top 5 "classmate" pairings In order:

- 1* Harry/Hermione
- 2* Harry/Luna
- 3* Harry/Daphne
- 4* Harry/Katie
- 5* Harry/Astoria

Top 5 "beyond Hogwarts" pairings in order

- 1* Harry/Tonks
- 2* Harry/Fleur
- 3* Harry/Bellatrix (or Narcissa)
- 4* Harry/Fem-Voldemort
- 5* Harry/Lily

Unusual pairing bonus!

- 1* Harry/Pernelle Flamel

However outside of Harry focused, my favorite ships would be anything Luna based, Tonks/Fleur, and the occasional Bellatrix/Hermione.

And most of it with a bit of genderbending.
