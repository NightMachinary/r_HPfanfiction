*** Oh, wow! I'm actually currently reading questions and answers and I really like it, it's actually the reason I asked this question because I liked the Harry and Ginny post DH relationship.

**** Oh, I see! Questions and Answers was written after a whole bunch of the other fics, but like I said they are all inter-related / happen at the same time. I believe Burning Down the House happens at the same time as More Than Words. Her profile has a list of fics with suggested reading order chronologically if you like!

** linkffn(In Love and War) just started up.

linkffn(Australia by msbinns) is a really well known one, but I haven't read it personally.

linkffn(Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live) is canon compliant post-war Ron/Hermione that starts some time after the end of DH.

  [COMPLETE] After the war, once Hermione and Ron retrieve her parents' memories and bring them back from Australia, her relationship with them is decidedly damaged. And why are they insisting that there's something wrong with her? Could they be right? After all, parents know best.

  Her birth certificate reads Lelouch vi Britannia, an ill-fitting name for an ill-fitting girl. Her mother says that the name was born out of a pain-killer and endorphin high, but they both know that the real reason is that the Emperor was expecting a son. That's probably a large part of why she is how she is. She always did feel like she had something to prove. (Fem!Lelouch) (AU)

  Hermione has resolved her war is not over until she brings her parents home to England. Ron thinks a summer on the other side of the world is a perfect escape. But transitioning from friends to lovers is not always easy, and some hurts seem impossible to forgive, as Percy Weasley knows all too well. Can the bonds of love and family mend the pieces of their lives torn apart by war?
