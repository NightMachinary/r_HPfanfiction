Preferably no Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, or Weasley bashing, but I'll take what I can get. No slash.


** Linkffn(a fine spot of trouble) I don't really know if it is what you want but Harry is pretty messed up after the war and Draco kinda tries to fix him.

*** That one is bashing galore. Especially Hermione, who previously gave everything for her best friend, basically says that Harry can go fuck himself. The premise wasn't bad, but everyone is written as arseholes.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** Sorry I don't have a link, but I read a story called “Australia”, that is one of my favorites. It's more Ron/Hermione centric, but half the book is about how the Weasleys cope with the loss of Fred.
