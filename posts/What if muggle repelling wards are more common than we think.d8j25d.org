What if places like the Sahara Desert don't actually exist, they're just illusions covering areas occupied by magical communities? The people who visit these places have just had their memories tampered with. Sophisticated special illusion magic has been used to portray these false landscapes on television. Oasis' in the desert are just places where wizards no longer live so the wards have failed and now muggles can see them. Think about it... What other places besides the Sahara desert are really magical communities?


** The /entire/ Sahara desert is a bit big for the concept. I mean, it's basically the size of the entire United States?? And with only oases being uninhabited by wizards? That's a metric fuckton of wizards!

I feel like the Bermuda Triangle is the obvious answer here. And somewhere on floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantis exists, and it's filled with muggle-repelling wizards.

*** There's a lot of confusion as to the actual population of the wizarding world. JK has stated there's about 3,000 wizards in Britain which suggests a very low population in comparison to muggles. JK also estimated there were 1,000 students at Hogwarts. ⅓ of the population being ages 11-17/18 just doesn't make sense. Then again the low population could be explained by Britain and even Europe in general experiencing a massive population drop in the last century because of deaths and people moving away during the 1st Wizarding War, 2nd Wizarding War, and the Grindelwald Rebellion. Most of those killed, at least during the school year, would have been adults so maybe that explains only ⅔ of the population being over age 17/18.

Barry Winkle invited everyone he'd ever known to his 755 birthday part. 30 million wizards attended. Even if he was very popular and traveled a lot there would still be a lot of wizards he'd never met. So the wizarding population must be at least 30 million. The world population in 1990 was 5.3 billion. So that's at least 1 wizard for every 176 muggles. Britain's population in 1990 was 57.24 million. If the wizarding population at the same time was only 3,000 that's 1 wizard for every 19,080 muggles. Let's assume that's the normal population in Britain and not just a result of 3 wars in the last century. Then also assuming the same muggle to wizard ratio is true of other muggle populated areas. That's less than 280,000 wizards in muggle populated areas. Where is the rest of that 30 million? Also there's a lot more than just wizards in the magical community. Britain is wizard-centric but does that really reflect the rest of the magical world? Or is there equal/greater percentages of other sentient species that make up the entire magical population?

**** JK is terrible at maths.

there only being one pure wizarding town in britian is part of that as well

there is also the fact the ministry seems to have hundreds of employees so if there was only three thousand wizards in britain the vast majority would be working for the goverment

***** Recently I started thinking what if it's because enough wizards don't want to get into a war that could end in genocide. Not to mention no matter how good you are there's a chance you could die. What's the point if you have no reason to? Not to mention the risk towards the kids who don't control their magic yet. And they think that's what would happen when the statute was put up in a time when witch burning was common.

*** Maybe there's just a lot more oases, like, "So this is where all the /Agumenti/ water comes from!" levels of unplottable oases. I'm imagining a sort of left over Roman Empire, just chilling in in what's left of their holdings and occaisionally taking potshots at what's left of the magical Ottoman Empire because /of course/ they're still holding a grudge over that.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
