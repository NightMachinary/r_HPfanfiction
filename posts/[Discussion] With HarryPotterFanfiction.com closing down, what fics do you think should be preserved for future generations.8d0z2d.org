** Will any of them care? I only ask because I'm fairly new to the whole fanfiction deal (almost 3 or 4 years, depending on what you consider my start to have been) and I know I've never read anything that was on there.

*** This post was mainly to find new reading material on a site I've never heard of. I've been in fanfiction for...uhhh....11 or so years I think. I feel like I've read a lot of the "good" fics that are out there already.

** I think the best one was Run, it's written really well with beautiful prose and some interesting ideas on the afterlife

** Almost everything in "The Dobbys" section is worth reading. Maybe not the best ever, but definitely above average.

I particularly liked "Running with Wolves" by Aurora Dawn and "Arabesque" by CelticKisses.

Also, in the Top 10 section, the severitus series by greengecko, starting with "Resonance."

*** The first story I ever read was some Tonks/Lupin story from the Dobbys section in 2008. I never finished it, because I guess even 20 year old me who had never read a fanfic before realized it wasn't very good.

Also, the Resonance trilogy didn't originate on HPFF. I first read it on that site as well, but some research has showed that it was actually posted to FFN first (by about 10 months). The first sequel was posted nearly simultaneously, but still to FFN first by a couple of days.

*** Oh, as a warning, one of the reasons I remembered the Running with Wolves and Resonance series is because the authors both went AWOL. Periodically I would check for an update but it never came. So I got very invested in like 4 years of the story then they just stopped ðŸ˜”

** I can't remember any specifics, but as an older site, there's probably some decent WolfStar on it.

That pairing seems to've fallen by the wayside since the films influenced a new generation of fans more than the books, and also since the fanfic community has become more mixed genderwise.

**** That's possible, I guess. It's hard to remember the timeframes sometimes looking back.

Ugh part of me will still never forgive JKR (or her editor) for prominently introducting two /clearly/ queercoded, positive, helpful characters and then backtracking on it and pairing them up and insisting that there was no chance they were ever even bisexual. So much for being Ms. 'I support fanfiction'!

***** Never mind that her depiction of Lyncanthropy was obviously an analogue for AIDS. But people are uncomfortable with queer characters in supposedly children's books (even though at this point the series was YA)

** Do you mean that site specific, or on the whole? I personally haven't read anything I'd put on the level of Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Faust, Crime and Punishment, Max Havelaar, etc etc. I don't even know if Fanfiction can fulfill that role literature does, or whether it should.

Anyway, I think the piece of Fanfiction that stuck with me the most were the first chapters of Nightmares of Future's Past. It hit me, especially after I just reread and rewatched the original series, to open a fanfic and see everything ruined, broken, destroyed, so vividly. That was powerful stuff.

*** I wouldn't say that the point of fanfiction is to fulfill that level of literature. It's a lot of fantasy fulfillment and have the story continue beyond canon. Or, for people like me, who don't like it when things come to an end.
