The magic world is small and there is no many wonders or unknown that have yet to be explored or discovered . yet there are hundreds of thousands of fanfics. I mean what the hell all this people talk about?

*** I understand it just that when you write a new novel you write many characters and new creatures and even create as many faction as you want but in fanfic your are sort of limited and can't even kill a main character let say for example naruto. In most feamos naruto fanfic you see that they are limited what the original writer wrote like villages and clans or the same power structure and most enemies are only those you knew, nothing new

**** You can kill the main character, though. That's the nice thing about fanfiction. You could write a “what if Harry had really died in the Forbidden Forest” and explore that. All the horcruxes were gone, would the others have won without Harry or would they have lost? Another nice thing is that you can explore relationships and events without having to come up with a whole book of background story.

**** Well i think that if you ignore the 60% of the fan-fics that are just the author trying to put his actions in the one of the main characters for X reason.

The thing about FF is that it takes a bases of the story that you know, and mould it into something different but still relatable.

An example can be the Alexandra Quick series; that even though it has almost nothing to do with the HP series as a whole only mentioning its events a couple times, it still includes that magical feeling that some people might be attracted to.

However in most cases the fanfics are basically the same story but just in a different light.

** Harry Potter has hundreds of characters. That makes thousands of ship combinations. There are so many books that there are plenty of missing moments and what ifs. Possibilities are endless, I think you lack a bit of creativity. Look through FanFiction.Net or AO3. There's so much opportunity. Crossovers. AUs. Time travel stories. Back stories...

** HP world is adoptable. We can add any type of creature real or mythical or imaginary. Can create spell/potions to do any work. If you are interested in politics just make wizengamot, a chamber of lords. You've quidditch for sports fanatics We are not limited by canon characterisation as except main trio, none of the characters are focused much.

And we have a single villain and followers, so it is easy to write plotline around how to defeat them so it is hard to make your story mess.

Harry Potter character is very likeable. Almost everyone can see themselves in his place. He has the potential to become very powerful wizard magically/politically/finacially. You can pair him with any character of your choice. Lots of girls with different background. Want bad girl pair Harry with pansy or a slytherin with no background you have Daphne/Tracey/Astoria, or a blood traitor Ginny, government girl like Susan or muggleborn/best friend like Hermione, or sports girl you have chaser trio, Indians? Patil twins, Asian? Cho, Su Li, MILF? Narcissa, Hot older girl? Tonks,Fleur...

It is easier to introduce Harry in other fandom crossovers. He can fit into other superhero crossovers seamlessly.

** I've never run out of fanfic to write about and I stick to the very narrow path of canon compliancy. There are just so many characters and untold stories to explore.

Then, of course, you can get onto AU and canon divergence. It's not my personal cup of tea but the imagination and creativity and breadth of writing possible is extraordinary, and there are just endless possibilities.

*** What I like for story to have au and canon diverngency, I mean naruto for example if he defeated itachi or orichamru on fic then that means he is basically one of the strongest people in the world , if there was au you can produce a new enemy and entirely a new more powerful cast

**** I'm not into Naruto so I don't know what any of that means, but sure, sounds great.

I have a lot of respect and understanding for AU fans, it's just not what I'm into personally. I like to get more out of the canon world and explore the emotions and motivations of characters more.

Rowling's world-building stops working somewhere around Ireland and Alsace. That leaves 98% of the world open for interpretation. You can hardly have a less constrained universe.

** The limited world is exactly what makes writing fanfiction easier than for many other universes!

If Rowling had clarified it more than she did then writing something would be harder (unless you chose to simply ignore many things she might have clarified!)
