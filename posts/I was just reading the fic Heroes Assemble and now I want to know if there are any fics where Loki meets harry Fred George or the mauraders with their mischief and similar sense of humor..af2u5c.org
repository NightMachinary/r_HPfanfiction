** linkffn(Child of the Storm) is a massive crossover with multiple series, but it includes Fred and George becoming Loki's apprentices.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** I believe it does happen in a couple of the "Loki/Odin is Harry's father" fics. There are quite a few of them, so you should find them easily with the "Avengers/Thor crossover Harry Potter" search option.
