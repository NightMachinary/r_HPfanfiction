So I just got done reading a fic where Harry was Salazar Slytherin in disguise and had the backing of Nicholas Flamel, Godric Gryffindor and Merlin himself, but still basically did things in the same way canon Harry did (Voldemort still gets resurected at the end of year 4, etc etc).

Same with redo fics, don't give me that 'preserving the timeline' crap, you know all the shit, fuck it up.

P.s. I'm not looking for multiple points of departure, rather a single point of departure with a strong ripple.


** The most significant changes can probably be found in linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). Canon timeline is blown utterly out of the water, and then bombarded with all the weapons the Northern Sun has at its disposal.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** I really liked With Strength of Steel Wings. It threw me off a little bit with the whole, "Suddenly, Harry got /another/ superpower that makes him the /ultimate/ badass!", but it's still a good story.

It's like that show, Bleach, or DragonBall Z. I haven't watched them in years, but almost every other episode there'd be a situation where the main character nearly dies, but manages to reach /deep inside/ and find the power of love/hate/life/death/heaven/hell/angels/demons etc.

** Something that only partially fits your criteria is the Sacrifices Arc series by Lightning on the Wave, found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][here]]. It's basically a rework of the HP series, with Harry being the brother to the Boy-Who-Lived, Connor Potter. It's a complete 7-book series (about 6 times the length of the original books) which starts out very similar to canon, but by the 3rd book is nothing like it.

It's very well written, and it depicts the magical society in-depth, with more info to the pureblood society than I've seen in any other fic. Harry is powerful, albeit not almighty, he makes mistakes and often has to learn from them. The only put-off might be that it's a Drarry slash. If that doesn't bother you, might wanna give it a try.

The link to the first one in the series is here linkffn(2580283)
