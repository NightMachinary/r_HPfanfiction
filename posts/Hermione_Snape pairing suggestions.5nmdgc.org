** [[http://sshglist.blogspot.fr/2013/04/the-list.html]]

A good place to start, especially the pics by Loten (on ffnet).

I'm trying to search for one I loved, I'll edit.

EDIT : Found it ! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5928118/1/A-Chance-in-Time]] I really liked the way the time travel is done (regarding paradoxes, for example). Probably one of my favorites time travel SSHG stories.

(also, you're not alone, I love this ship and I ship many more "weird" HG pairings, you need just ask)

*** Ugh so excited thank you so much! I've read all of Loten's stuff, but since I'm getting back into the ship I might re-read it thanks for reminding me

Edit: Just getting back into FF. Any other odd pairings you would suggest I check out. Back in the day I read a lot of different stuff and would love recommendations.

  Eleven years after the end of the war, Hermione finds herself in a delicate situation when her only son leaves for Hogwarts and threatens her most guarded secret: that he's not only a Granger, but also a Snape!

** Ok, here you go. Actual links to the ones mentioned in my earlier post, and a few I'd forgotten about, lol. All of them should be complete, and i think over 20K words. I don't really read short fics lol.

linkffn(5089614) - Camerado - Haven't read this one in a while, but I remember enjoying it.

linkffn(9234875) - Come Back To Me - Time travel, but not how you would expect... It starts out slow, and has a few weird chapter in the middle, but all in all I love this fic.

linkffn(7453087) - Pride of Time, and the alternate ending Divide of Time. I liked the alternate ending better, but really both endings are good.

linkffn(10822825) - Of Myth and Magic - Completely AU, sorta, not sure how to describe it without spoilers... Really good, but not exactly a "feel good" fic. Still worth the read.

linkffn(2290003) - Pet Project - This one gets recommended a lot, so you may have already read it. But figured I'd toss it up just in case.

linkffn(11053807) - Sin & Vice - Excessive use of a Time Turner. I don't think I've read another fic quite like it. I really love this fic, and...

linkffn(11702523) - The Master, the Warden, the Headmaster and the Deputy - by the same author. Two of my favorites, I think, lol. It's really hard to pick. (The author has some other fics that are really good too)

linkffn(4661762) - The Gilded Cage - Another great fic.

linkffn(6408692) - The Occluded Soul - I loved this one so much that I actually started re-reading it when I woke up this morning lol.

linkffn(2162474) - When a Lioness Fights - A very dark story, but I enjoyed it. The author is not a native English speaker, so there are occasionally things that don't come across well, but it wasn't a big issue if I remember correctly.

linkffn(11477797) - World Enough and Time - Think "The Lakehouse", and you've got the premise of the story. Another one I haven't read in a bit, but I remember enjoying it.

Ok, that's a list, lol. I actually have more than that in my Favorites/Followed list, but I absolutely don't remember reading them, so I don't know if they're actually any good, lol.

  Complete. Starting with a letter found in his bedside table when he assumes the role of Headmaster in 1997, Severus Snape and Hermione Granger begin a strange correspondence. The new Headmaster is glad for the comfort of a confidant, but Hermione has just one problem: it's the end of 1998, and Professor Severus Snape has been dead for months. A story of time and second chances.

** Ping me about this tomorrow? This is one of my favourite pairings, and I've got a handful that I really love, but I'm literally in bed on my phone and trying to link them would be more effort than my half asleep brain can handle.

Sin & Vice, Come Back to Me, Pride of Time (though I liked the ending in Divide of Time better I think), The Contact, The Gilded Cage, Occluded Soul... I'm sure there's more but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
