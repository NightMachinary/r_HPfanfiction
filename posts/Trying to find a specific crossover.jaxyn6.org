So here's my problem. Long ago I ran across a crossover im finding impossible to find again. It was a RWBY and HP cross or at least I believe so. From what I remember the author described in a authors note that he decided to change harry to be more of a warrior. Someone who preemptively prepares for conflict rather than his old survivor style where he simply reacts to situations and uses a hefty amount of luck. Im fairly certain a section of this story i remember vividly has to do with a certain scene where he stops cardin from taking "action" against Ruby. Im sure you can figure that out. I believe the scene in question was a reference to a shadbase comic. Although it was more about stopping it. The only reason I mention this as it really stuck out in the story and its a hefty detail to hopefully narrow down the story. If I could get some help that would be great ive ran into a bit of a brick wall here.
