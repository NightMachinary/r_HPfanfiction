So I've been really into the time travel fanfiction lately, and they are always either Hermione or Harry, and it starts to get old when the ones I've been reading are all the same.

So here's my question:

Does anyone know of any fanfiction where someone from the past travels to the book years? It could be a marauder, maybe Lily, or maybe even young Dumbledore. This just seems like a really interesting concept to me and I would love to read a fic about this topic!!!


** It's extremely rare, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), also has a forward time travel involving Harry and Bellatrix that brought them from 1976 to 1997.

*** Basilisk Born sounds pretty interesting. Do you know if it's well written? Like few grammar errors, believable dialogue, and no gaping plot holes? Those sorts of things annoy me a bit, but especially in long fics where it kind of adds up over time increasing my frustration a lot because I've already invested time in the story and don't want to drop it 100,000 words in. Also high concept HP fics IMO are pretty hit or miss when it comes to working out those plot holes.

***** I'm not going to read what you wrote because it looks like it's kinda a spoiler. That's what I gathered after the first 8 or so words at least. When I say plot hole thought I mostly just mean when an event happens or when characters perform an action that doesn't make sense withing the framework of the story or their characters. Then there are plot holes like, "Why didn't the ministry use time turners?" or "How come nobody cares about Legilimency and Occlumency?" which are a bit more more acceptable to me. Which kind of thing is this plot hole?

******* Gotchya thanks, that seems alright by me. I was mostly worried because I always think back to this one story I read a while ago where the main plot point, that everything leads up to is facilitated by a certain event that makes literally zero sense. Well it does make sense, but only if the characters that made those decisions were 5 year old children.

**** I love it, for concept and execution. I believe the writer isn't a native English speaker, so I can give him a pass on some of the odd grammer which pops up.

***** I like it too, I've gotten a decent way through but the grammar is getting to me. I know he's not a native speaker, but it just grates on me that he will use words that don't exist or just wrong. Actually those aren't so bad, but they do add up, the more annoying things are when sentences are completely unintelligeble. I try to be forgiving about it, but it's a battle because I really do like the story. But what I can't forgive is some characters behaving completely contrary to how they would behave in canon for no reason. One of the first scenes with McGonnagal did that for me, it was uncomfortable to read.

** linkffn(12101842). I just read this a little while ago, really fantastic. Unfortunately it was last updated in January and there's been nothing since, I don't know if it's stopped or anything now. Basically it's Harry and Tonks accidentally travel back in time to the late 1970's during the beginning/middle of the first war.
