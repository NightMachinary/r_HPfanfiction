I am curious if there are any fics where Dumbledore is de-aged. Any recommendations?


** I've only ever read one, and it was a Bloodborne crossover. Which was short and not very far along. Dunno if you'd be interested

  What would happen when a trio of Order members are accidentally turned back into their youth? Eventual Harry/Snape bonding...with Remus, Sirius and Albus! No slash. Canon-compliant, but a bit AU obviously. Begins summer before fifth year. [undergoing rewrite as of jan 2018!]

***** Hello, again, Alma! :D

They're called emojis (this one, in particular, is the "thinking" emoji). They're just normal characters like the English alphabet, kanji or cyrillic. Except these characters are tiny little pictures. :D

If you want, try this website: [[https://getemoji.com/]]

You can copy/paste them like you could any other word/sentence.

** Not permanently de-aged but he does make himself younger when /with/ his young wife. Actually one of my favourite fics despite Dumbledore/Hermione being a squick inducing pairing.
