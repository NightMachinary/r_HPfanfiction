Just binge read what's posted of Loose Cannon in less than a week and I love it. I was wondering if anyone knew any similar fics


** I read some of it. The idea was interesting, but at the point where that guy warned Hermione that Harry for some reason would become arrogant and they have to prepare for it I gave up on the fic because it sounded dumb.

What do you like about it. The background about the wider wizarding world? Harry not getting married and popping out babies immediately after Hogwarts and actually living a little? Harry becoming a Quidditch player? Tell us that and we can help you.

*** I just like that it actually feels alive and like a real world thats more than just what we see on an everyday basis. The quidditch is also fun and I like Harry actually having a good time and doing what we wants. I feel like you gave up on it too early. It makes sense why he would turn kind of obnoxious and arrogant. His job is mostly him talking shit on people while trying to catch the snitch. If he does that for hours on end 6 days a week it's bound to slip out into his everyday like accidentally. It doesn't even happen for long and he eventually stops the taunting

**** Maybe you're right. I'm a bit too impatient with fics and books I'm reading and the slightest things put me off reading them. I'll probably give it another go. And for what you are looking for, it's actually quite hard to name fics like that. I love linkffn(A Black Comedy). It's fun. Also linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes; Kicking Gotham; Toppling Heroes) are good.

** Tell us what you liked about it - not everyone has read that fic.

(I, personally, won't touch an in-progress fic that's nearly a million words long until it's marked complete, so I have no idea what it's about.)

*** I don't even know how to describe it honestly because there's so much. When it starts Ginny has recently broken up with Harry, maybe a few months before it starts. The Daily Prophet prints an overheard conversion between George and Harry about how he's going to quit his Auror training and become a league seeker for the Cannons, only they were joking and Harry had no intention of doing that. But after thinking about it he decides to give it a go and he's actually really good at it. From then on the story is basically a genius mix of side stories involving endorsement deals, Harry struggling to come to terms with all the left over trauma he's had from the war, members of the Black family that get rediscovered after Harry fixes the Black family tapestry after becoming head of house, and many other amazing things. Oh and he has a bunch of relationships with different witches and a muggle.

Theres just so much to the story and I couldn't get enough of it. I've seen people complain about it needing to wrap up soon, but honestly it doesn't feel like it needs to for me. It's great. I just love the atmosphere of the story

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
