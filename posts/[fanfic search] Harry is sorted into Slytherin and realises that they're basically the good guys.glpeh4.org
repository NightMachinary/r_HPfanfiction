Hey all, I was wondering if any of you knew of this certain slytherin harry fanfic. I read it a while ago and dont remember all the details and was hoping one of you could help me track it down, not sure if its famous or not. Heres a few important stuff i remember that'll help narrow it down.

- Harry is in Slytherin and friends with Draco

- The Malfoys are actually really nice, if a little traditional which causes the hostility towards them from Gryffindors

- Lily and James were friendly with the Malfoys before death and as such polite to Harry

- Through the influence of the Malfoys they begin to make changes to the school including...

- Professor Binns being replaced by a more effective if stern Slytherin History of Magic teacher (just a hunch but i think her last name is Greengrass)

- Lucius becomes deputy headmaster and I think snape headmaster

- Sirius Black is eventually freed due to influence and sympathy from Narcissa and becomes Harry's godfather

- Dumbledore is shunned for leaving Harry with the Dursleys and using Harry's wealth ( I think)

- Lupin becomes Gryffindor head of house and swears an oath of loyalty or servitude to Lucius (willingly)

I hope this is enough information to narrow it down, sorry if some of it is correct but if you know what fanfic im talking about your help would be greatly appreciated, thanks. :)
