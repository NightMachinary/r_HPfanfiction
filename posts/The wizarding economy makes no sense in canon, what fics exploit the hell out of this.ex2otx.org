** Arbitrage is mentioned in Methods of Rationality, but not pursued; Harry decides that going to Hogwarts and learning about magic is a higher priority than going from rich to richer. (My headcanon is that goblin coins are nigh-impossible to melt down, making arbitrage impractical.)

Hermione develops a permanent alternative to regular transfiguration in linkffn(The Arithmancer) and sequels, which she uses to go into business selling jewelry, but market exploits aren't really the focus of the series.

** I've been thinking about this.

Setting aside the possibility that over hundreds of years no one thinks of abusing a broken system, there are a few ways of keeping it consistent:

1. Money can't be conjured. Perhaps the goblins have some magical block against it. Perhaps certain metals simply don't work and thus those are the ones used for coinage.
2. Coins aren't solid metal, but an alloy, thus making raw metal value less than face value
3. Coins are magically durable, and thus cannot be readily melted down to be sold as scrap. Transfer to muggles could then be barred based on the statute of secrecy.
4. Coins are smaller than we imagine, or hollow. A galleon of ~.25 oz would be worth ~$10. A Sickle would be .05 oz, for a VERY small coin. Knuts could be any size as bronze is cheap.
5. Conversion costs are horrendously expensive

Now, each denomination could follow any of the above. So galleons could be the currency of exchange and be solid gold (small per #4), while sickles are not pure silver (#2) to maintain the 17/1 ratio.

My own headcanon is that wizard money is intrinsically nonsensical. Wizard money does not reliably translate into muggle money in any way shape or form. The very logic of the math breaks down. This would also explain why wizards have such trouble with muggle money.

** I've read a fic where the galleons are actually a really cheap metal like copper. The goblins took most of the actual gold and replaced them with gold plated copper instead, making them worthless in the muggle world.

Copper is actually really expensive. I mean, it isn't gold, but a pound coin made out of copper would be worth more than a pound I think.

  Committing arbitrage with the fixed gold to galleons to pound rate.
#+end_quote

I doubt you can melt down goblin made coins, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if that's why they're in charge of the money. Remember that goblin silver is pretty much indestructible, absorbing anything harmful and repelling anything else.

#+begin_quote
  Abuses transfiguration to game the Muggle markets given that canonically, transfiguration is permanent.

  That's breaking the statute of secrecy and will eventually get noticed.
#+end_quote

Or even just Harry starting a business chain and taking advantage of the lack of laws against monopolies and the ability to loss lead into every market with his potter fortune.

What fortune?

** Alright.

#+begin_quote
  Committing arbitrage with the fixed gold to galleons to pound rate
#+end_quote

This assumes that Gringotts would allow the transaction of enough money to matter. They have no need for muggle money beyond what people change for purchases in their world, and such things wouldn't happen often. By the second or third attempt at changing money, you would be questioned. Enjoy time in goblin prison.

And if you mean what I think you mean (which is not what arbitrage is), then you're a fool to assume that goblins don't protect their money through magic, either by the coins exploding, refusing to be melt or teleporting back to Gringotts.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is against the Statute of Secrecy, not only because it counts as distributing magical artifacts to muggles, but also because various government offices, like finances, would do inspections with specialists and realize that your faux plant is either empty or set up but not used at all. At that point, embedded magicals would find out and the ICW would come in to obliviate. Enjoy time in Nurmengrad/Azkaban.

This assumes that there are no laws against monopolies, which is quite stupid a thing to assume. Enjoy your time as a normal businessman? Also, how would you even approach this without

#+begin_quote
  and the ability to loss lead into every market with his potter fortune.
#+end_quote

There is no such thing as a Potter Fortune. The potters were a minor family without any titles or manors or billions of gold coins, the vault which is shown in the books is the only one they have, and all the money in there came from bounties on Voldemort (paid to Harry's account) and James' father's sleakeazy invention.

Why the fuck would James and Lily live in a normal house and have jobs if there were manors and castles and billions of galleons lying around somewhere?

All in all, this prompt assumes an incredibly idiotic wizarding world, and I can see clear influence of MoR in this, which shouldn't be seen as an authority on anything. Even without the incredible smugness and grating arrogance, that fic is completely AU with all aspects of the wizarding world.
