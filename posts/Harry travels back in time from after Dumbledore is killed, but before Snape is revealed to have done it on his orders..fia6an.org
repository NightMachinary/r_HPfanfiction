We always see time travel stories where the traveller has all of their facts straight. I think it would be interesting to see a time traveller who /thinks/ he knows how it all played out, but is wrong.


** Would you take recommendations of non-Harry-centric stories? I can think of one with Remus, who thinks Snape kills Dumbledore, and one with Fred and George, who think Pettigrew's a war hero killed by Sirius Black, Voldemort's right-hand man.

***** Well, I was also going to recommend *The Bureaucratic Error*, but since your link didn't make the fanfictionbot stick it in... I'll put it in and second it as a great fic that explores Remus' perspective back in time but missing a critical piece of information.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance]] In this fic both Harry and Hermione go back thinking Snape is a DE and plan to get rid of him. It is pretty good.
