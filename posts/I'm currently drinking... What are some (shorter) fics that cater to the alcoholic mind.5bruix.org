Whether it's an insane plot that only a drunk could understand or humor that only gets funnier with every drink sipped... anything works really. Doesn't really need to be what this sub usually considers to be topnotch, because I am currently anything but.

Please keep it short though. Like I've said multiple times, there is whiskey whispering lovingly to my liver.

If there's romance... go crazy. Seriously. I like every person paired with anyone as long as it isn't femslash. I like clam hammers too much to read of a bump and grind without one.


** Linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel by Private Jenkins)

I thought this one had an easy back and forth between characters that made me laugh. Pretty short, only 6 chapters, and unfinished.

Will add more suggestions as I remember.

*** Wonderful, thank you! The author's notes at the start is hilarious and encouraging! :) I look forward to the rest of it!

If you have more recommendations, I so far completely trust you. You're batting one for one right now!

**** Hmm, I can't think of anything other than a few of the more commonly recommended comedy fics, like Lessons With Harris, Triwizard Tales, or Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. How do you feel about cross-overs?

***** I love cross-overs! Worm, Buffy, Avengers, and Naruto are my usual, but please recommend others outside of those!

****** Okay well linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous) is kind of silly but it kept me laughing. Definitely short and crack-y.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.
