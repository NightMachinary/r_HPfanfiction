Hello, I'm searching for a fic that i've read that involves Harry Being transported to the star wars universe, I remember Him being young, Learning how to Use Magic/Force very well and starts working as a Bouncer(?). I remember him trying to buy food But he doesnt have any money, The owner takes pity on him and gives him free Lunch, he later returns and pays for it. After a while All the criminals starts to challenge him, or get scared in some cases. He's Kind of known for fixing peoples problems.

Would really appreciate any help finding this fic.

EDIT: Found the fic. Not as good as i remembered though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11215909/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Jedi-Chronicles]]


** That edit hits me on a deep level. Went through my favorites list and man, there is some garbage shit on there.

** I can recommend you linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577249/1/Magic-of-the-Force][Magic of the Force]]) It has some similarities. It is a young Harry transported to the world of Star Wars from a young age with the ghost of Lily with him. If you have not read it yet, you will have a few hours of good reading ahead.

*** Thank you for the tip, But i have a really hard time reading anything by that author. It's not that he/she is a bad writer but it just gets so tedious with the length etc.

I also really didn't like the meeting between Harry and Lily, I mean cmon? A leotard?

**** You can use TextAloud with a high reading speed while doing something else on the pc. That's how I finish a story that I do not particularly enjoy, or they're too long to the point of tedious.
