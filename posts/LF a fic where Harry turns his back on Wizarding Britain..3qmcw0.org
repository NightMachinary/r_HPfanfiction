#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** There is a story call Betrayal: Where Harris falsely accused of several murders and sent to Azkaban. When he is finally proved innocent he leaves the wizarding world, which then covers up how they treated him. It is only when his daughter goes to Hogwarts that the truth of the wizarding worlds betrayal comes to light. Oh, and his wife dies at Hogwarts. Sorry, but but I'm not sure who the author is, but I give it massive points. It was very well written.

*** There's one that's similar to this where Harry is banished from the wizarding world because they're afraid of him, but he returns to conquer them when his daughter is abducted and taken to Hogwarts as part of the Ministry's new program of kidnapping any muggleborn who declines their Hogwarts invitation. For the life of me I can't think of its name, but I would love to read it again.

** Ok, so here's the thing. A lot of these feature a ton of character bashing, usually Dumbledore and Weasleys, and a few where it rags on everyone who isn't Harry. That being said, I'm linking them anyway because this is one of my favorite type of fics, even though they're not always written that well. It's a guilty pleasure, so sue me.^{please^{don't^{sue^{me}}}}

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5531587/1/Black-Phoenix][Black Phoenix]]: To quote James Baldwin, "The most dangerous creation of any society is a man with nothing to lose." The Wizarding World is about to find out just how dangerous.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5429928/1/Running-Away][Running Away]]: AU. DEATH EATER KIDNAPS BOY WHO LIVED! read the newspaper headlines across magical Britain. SS, HP/HG. Oneshot. (This one is more Snape saying "bugger this" and taking Harry with him and raising him, but I'm including it anyway.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6729358/1/Screw-the-Magical-World][Screw the Magical World]]: Harry is found guilty for underage magic and has his wand snapped. With help, he tells them to go sod off. I got the idea from another fanfic, but cannot remember the name of it. So, sorry i cannot leave praise for that story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]]: OneShot: Harry is expelled after the hearing in Courtroom 10. His wand snapped, an angry Harry choses his own path forward. First person story focusing on Harry's effort to find his own place. (This is the story the author of the previous story refers to. Contains lots of military stuff but it's still pretty fun to read.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8281649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-RAF][Harry Potter and the RAF]]: What happens when Harry gets fed up with the wizarding world. Yes it's been done before but this is my take on it. Starts after 5th year (Another soldier!Harry story, only this one features a pregnancy and a lot more slice-of-life rather than action, but it's not bad.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136250/1/Rage][Rage]]: Harry makes unexpected friends in his fourth year, when his friends and his housemates abandon him. Hestia and Flora, daughters of some of Voldemort's most sadistic enforcers, know what its like to live in fear. In this unlikely relationship, the three plot to bring down Voldemort and escape the society that tried to destroy them. Dark, violent, potential H/H/F pairing (This one features two Slytherin girls who are almost unknown in fanfiction despite being canon characters, which is a breath of fresh air from all that Ice Queen stuff.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards' Fall]]: A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081448/1/Guy-Fawkes-Day][Guy Fawkes Day]]: Harry Potter destroys Magical England.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard][Weary Wizard]]: When a few inappropriate questions derail the meeting at the Hog's Head, Harry lets the situation play out. Eventually, he refuses to commit his free time to teach a bunch of easily distracted fools. - Set during fifth year; Harry/Hermione

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation][The British Reformation]]: After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter: Mercenary]]: Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard][Harry Potter: Hit Wizard]]: One-shot sequel to Harry Potter - Mercenary Two years have passed and now Harry is back for a bit of revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866364/1/To-become-a-Muggle][To Become a Muggle]]: After the events of GoF Harry decides to give up on magic. (A bit slice-of-lifey, but still decent.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4771879/1/A-Squib-Worth][A Squib Worth]]: The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7971769/1/Petrified][Petrified]]: My name is Hermione Potter and this is the story of how I with my husband Harry Potter fled our native country Britain and settled in United States of America, to find acceptance, equality and some peace. One Shot, set after second year Basilisk incident (Not the best writing ever, but a unique idea.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5695320/1/The-Road-to-Freedom][The Road to Freedom]]: After two startling revelations, Harry has decided that he has had enough. With his only true friend, Harry decides to leave the war and magic behind forever. HHr. Manipulative!Dumbledore. One Shot. (Cliche'd as hell but still fits what you're asking for.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5424316/1/The-Hell-I-Will][The Hell I Will!]]: What if? What if Harry had more contact with Sirius after his escape? What if Harry and Hermione made a new friend at the World Cup? What if the Goblet of Fire scene played out differently? (Again with the cliches, but I did warn you at the top of this post.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6755363/1/No-Hurry-At-All][No Hurry At All]]: Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr (*WARNING: THIS IS A ROBST FIC!* If that offends you then don't even bother clicking. That said, I actually think this is one of his better stories as it doesn't come near the level of fedora-tipping that some of his other stories do.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4973167/1/The-Curse-That-Killed-Thousands][The Curse that Killed Thousands]]: What would have happened if Sirius's appearance in the hospital wing was not received as relatively calmly as in canon? Unashamedly Harry/Hermione H/Hr , but in a family friendly way; Bashing of Dumbledore & cohorts included.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7888224/1/All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Wizardkind][All You Need to Know About Wizardkind]]: Nicholas Flamel and Albus Dumbledore were wrong -- there is an arithmantically satisfying and most important thirteenth use for Dragon's Blood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7573003/1/Harry-s-had-Enough][Harry's Had Enough]]: Title pretty much says it all. OotP AU, some swear words. No pairing, though HP/HG is hinted at a little. Harry does what he should have done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782623/1/Damn-Wizards][Damn Wizards]]: This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

EDIT: Forgot to add [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Enslavement/index/][Enslavement]] by Jeconais over on fanficauthors.net. Requires registration to read, but it's pretty satisfying.

  What if Harry met someone different in the Alley when he was eleven? What if it was someone who was looking for a friend as well and whose heart went out for a boy who appeared to be lost? Harry/Pansy.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is tired of the Wizarding society idolizing him one moment and turning on him the next. It all comes to a head during the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione offers him a chance to escape from it all. Harry takes it and his life takes a turn for the better. Slightly A/U right from the start and of course, Harmony.

#+begin_quote
  AU post 5th year. A bunny that wouldn't let go. Harry is set up in a marriage contract, but things don't go as planned. Rated for language and blatant - if non-desciptive - sexuality.

  Nothing but a blend of overused plots and an ending that I haven't seen before.
