i read this fic awhile ago and i can't seem to remember the name of it. The first chapter starts out with Harry having a sex dream about hermione but then he wakes up and realizes he's married to Ginny. i remember There was a flashback to sixth year during bill/fleur's wedding where Ginny is trying to help ron/hermione get alone time or something. One of the common themes is that harry doesn't realise he has feelings for hermione so he keeps telling himself that he sees her like a sister. I think there was also this huge falling out with harry and hermione.
