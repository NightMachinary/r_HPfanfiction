  "Listen here and listen well, Granger, because this is the /only/ time I'm going to say it," Harry said lowly, tightening his grip on Hermione's wrist when she tried to pull away from him. His blazing green eyes stared into her wide brown ones. "Do not /ever/ presume you know me, because you don't. I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does /not/ mean that I buy into that blood purity nonsense. I will never, /never/ consider calling someone a Mudblood, even in jest. My /mum/ was a Muggleborn and /she sacrificed herself for me./ I would never defile her memory by calling someone else of her blood status such a crude word."

I'm particularly proud of the "I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does /not/ mean that I buy into that blood purity nonsense" line. You?

Here's the link for those curious about the fic. This scene won't happen for another thirty or so chapters, though: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909][Hbi Hr At]]

*** I didn't mention it, but the only reason he's got her wrist is because she tried to slap him. He's only holding onto her so he could get the point across. He's also not in the best mindset because he's pretty frustrated that everyone keeps making generalizations about him just because he's a Slytherin, which wasn't really something he thought would get to him when he chose to be Sorted into Slytherin. He thought that the comments would roll off his back due to the events in the past (everything that happens in the books).

So, while not letting go of her when she tried to pull away could have been seen as a bit much, it was just a way for Harry to properly get Hermione's attention so she doesn't continue her frustrated/angry rant that led her to trying to slap him in the first place.

Also, like in most time travel fics, Harry's future conscious or whatever was put into his younger body. He was almost twenty-one when he got sent into the past and he "woke up" in his almost eleven-year-old body, so to speak. So even though he's mentally an adult, he's physically the same age as Hermione in this and Hermione's fourteen here. Due to this, no one who saw the whole scene (i.e. Hermione going to slap Harry and Harry grabbing her wrist to prevent her from slapping him) is going to think him grabbing her is wrong. They'll think that him grabbing her wrist to stop her from slapping him is justified. The only people who will see it as wrong are the teachers, and that's only because he's a boy grabbing a girl/they didn't see the whole scene/he should have let go of her right away or when she tried to pull away.

There /is/ about a nine year difference here mentally (which could be considered a lot since she's a teen/he's a young adult) but Harry's emotional state kinda regressed a bit due to the ritual that sent him to the past (and because he's going through puberty again and the fluctuating hormones/emotions that causes), so while he's got twenty-three years of memories inside his mind, he's more-so around the mindset of a sixteen/seventeen/eighteen-year-old.

Objectively, Harry knows that he shouldn't have continued to hold her wrist and should have let go when she tried to pull away from him, but he was doing it for a reason. Also, this version of Harry isn't particularly as "chivalrous" as he was in the past (the book version of him), so he doesn't mind using a more forceful method to get his point across it need be. He'll have done something similar to this in the past during confrontations with older Slytherins who thought he shouldn't have been in Slytherin.

And the way I'm looking at Harry holding her wrist is sort of the way a parent would grab a child's hand to stop them from doing something or to get their attention if they're doing something wrong/potentially dangerous. It's not to physically hurt them or anything, it's just to forcefully grab their attention and to stop them from doing something.

Hope that clears up any misconceptions here.

**** I loved the "I may be a Slytherin, little girl", but what I really would love is a sceptical Harry being sold to the travel back in time plan with his auror partner by the unspeakable telling him that "Harry's future conscious or whatever would be put into his younger body."

And maybe another reason than dealing with Voldemort for once, but rather preventing the makings of the dark lord they have to deal with when Harry is in his 30s or 40s, or maybe that Harry is selected for the time travel because the Dursleys abuse made him into a high functioning obscurial, and they hope that if he is young and solid enough they can prevent that clusterfuck from really happening.

I used to love time travel fics, but somewhere along the line it became a paint by the numbers dealing-swiftly-with-horcruxes, or how-to-do-canon-hogwarts differently, and they started to bore me to tears.

Bonus points if time traveling Harry doesn't need to go to Hogwarts at all but does something completely different while avoiding everyone looking for an errant child.

***** I can't remember the name, but there's a legit time-travel one where Harry goes back in his adult body and basically adopts his younger self after saving him from the Durselys. He does not become a professor like most. But actually works behind the scenes trying his utmost to give himself a "normal" childhood. Pairing is also something you don't see everyday. Harry/Amelia Bones. Idk the pairing for his younger self though. Incomplete as far as I remember though sadly...

Of course, I'm reading this out of context, and it would make perfect sense if Hermione said something to spark this response. Like:

"Oh, what do you know? You're a Slytherin. You must hate that a /mudblood/ like me is allowed to go to Hogwarts."

*** I don't plan to imply that all other Slytherins just believe that all Muggleborns are Mudblood trash because their parents weren't magical or anything. The quote you made up for Hermione is pretty much what I plan for Hermione to say, except it's going to be more aggressive, if that makes sense, because Hermione's so upset at the prejudice she's facing and she'll think that Harry's mocking her or teasing her or whatever.

(I haven't really decided where this dialogue will take place, but it'll probably be in a scene where Harry says something about Hermione's intelligence when they're doing a project together or something. It won't be rude, he'll probably mention about how she's trying too hard or she's thinking too much like a Muggle or something and she'll take it the wrong way. She'll try to slap Harry because she thinks he's mocking her or something and that's why Harry's got Hermione's wrist in his hand. Again, I haven't a clue about this. This little quote is al that came to mind.)

I can also see how his reply makes it seem as if he believes that all Slytherins believe in blood purity, but he was mainly referring to the Slytherins who treat Muggleborns badly, and not just because of their blood. It'll become clearer in scenes after this one that while some people believe that Muggleborns are the dirt beneath their shoes just because their parents are Muggles, most dislike Muggleborns because they either refuse to learn about wizarding culture, they want to change it, or they refuse to let go of some Muggle ideals and stuff. Hermione will become something between an acquaintance and a friend to Harry and she'll learn this. He only said, "I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does /not/ mean that I buy into that blood purity nonsense" because he's referring to her ignorance about the matter.

I understood where you were coming from on the Slytherin quote as soon as I wrote the Hermione line, but I felt that it was more honest to include my initial thoughts, as you were asking for my opinion. I like the option of you're thinking like a muggle, I think that's a good way to point out the issue without implying either group being inherently superior. It makes a lot of sense. You might want to make him a bit rude though or possibly give her a reason to have a heightened reaction. Otherwise she could come off as unreasonably aggressive or illogical and you have what seems like a tamer Hermione. I recommend going with Harry being a bit mocking. Still looking forward to it.

😂😂😂

No problem with telling me your thoughts/opinions, either. I practically thrive on discussing my ideas/fics with people. I actually made a whole ass essay a week or so back discussing my fic and the ideas behind it, along with two other essays of me replying to comments in that thread. These sorts of comments/replies are usually how I plan out my fic, believe it or not.

And I'm definitely planning on making Harry seem rude. This little bit of dialogue didn't really show my thoughts behind the full scene (because I didn't actually write the scene, lol) or even the reason behind Hermione slapping Harry or whatever. Harry will definitely be acting sort of like a snob (but not snobbish, if that makes sense? sorta just like a pureblood, I suppose) because he can't show his "real" self or anything. Like, he's the /Boy-Who-Lived/ in /Slytherin/, he can't be seen as a total Muggle-lover or anything (and he's not a Muggle-lover, actually, but he could be seen as too friendly with Muggles from the purebloods' point-of-view).

Harry will also totally be antagonizing Hermione on and off during third year and after. I've actually written a few different scenes explaining how he has a "perverse sort of pleasure" out of antagonizing Hermione. They're not really connected or anything as it's just me feeling-out Harry's relationship with Hermione in the later chapters of the fic. I'll just copy and paste them below, lol.

The first scene:

#+begin_quote
  For some reason, Harry took a perverse sort of pleasure out of antagonizing Hermione. He'd thought dearly of the girl (thought of her almost like a sister) the first time around before they went their separate ways, but there was just something about the way her hair would puff up like a cat's tail or how her face would turn red in anger that would greatly amuse him. It wasn't cruel, the way he teased her---he certainly hadn't started to become a blood-purist during his time as a Slytherin---though some would probably say it was rather unkind.

  He just loved to rile her up, especially in front of the other Slytherins. They possibly thought that he was picking on her because she was Muggleborn, though Theo knew the truth. He knew it was because Harry knew Hermione more than anyone thought he did and because he had changed from that kind, shy boy he'd been in his actual youth.
#+end_quote

The second scene:

#+begin_quote
  Harry leaned lazily against the Slytherin table, watching through half-lidded eyes as Hermione marched up to him. Her hair was frizzed up like an angry cat's tail and her face was splotched red in a mixture of what he assumed to be anger or frustration. Hermione completely ignored the semi-hostile eyes sent her way from the other Slytherins (his progress in reducing prejudice was a bit slow-going) and Harry had to admit it---his old friend had guts. She may have refused Ravenclaw's House like he'd refused Slytherin the first time, though there was no mistaking that she was a Gryffindor. She practically /bled/ fearlessness and bravery.

  "'Lo, 'Mione," Harry drawled as the witch stopped in front of him, posturing her hands on her hips as she tapped her foot in annoyance. Hermione narrowed her eyes at Harry and he merely smiled back. Harry knew that Hermione hadn't really had friends before Hogwarts---and she certainly didn't have many /in/ Hogwarts, either---and so she hadn't really had anyone who gave her a nickname before.

  She probably thought that the shortened version of her name that he'd taken to calling her was him mocking her (and he definitely was mocking her, though it was more of him teasing her rather than him meaning anything malicious about it), no doubt from the insecurity she'd carried over to the wizarding world when her Muggle classmates used to tease her for her unique name.

  "Don't call me that!" Hermione hissed sharply before saying, "What is this, Potter?" She followed up her question by shoving a piece of parchment in Harry's face.

  "A piece of parchment," said Harry dryly with a raised brow. Hermione bristled in annoyance and her hand twitched, as if going for her wand, something Harry knew she only did when she was really annoyed. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he watched the girl with dark, amused eyes. She wouldn't dare to pull her wand on him here in front of the school; he knew it, and he knew that she knew that he knew it.

  That was probably why she was so annoyed, if he thought about it.
#+end_quote

The third scene (which is pretty much a rewrite of the first one):

#+begin_quote
  Harry took a sort of perverse pleasure in antagonizing Hermione, he'd come to realize. He didn't know why, but he loved the way her hair puffed up like an angry cat's tail or the red splotches of colour that painted her face in frustration and annoyance. Now that he thought about it, he'd loved to rile up Hermione during his first round at Hogwarts, so this certainly wasn't a new thing. He just rarely backed off now and already knew what buttons to push to really annoy Hermione, unlike the first time around where he'd merely teased her before backing off in fear of her retaliating via well-meaning nagging or refusing to help him with his school work.

  He certainly hadn't needed her help with his schoolwork back then, either, but he had become co-dependent on the girl due to his worry about Ron's feelings if he would suddenly rise to one of the best students in their year. He didn't need to worry about that anymore, though, and so he took Hermione's glares and spitting comments with a grain of salt.
#+end_quote

And the fourth scene (it doesn't really match the personality of the characters, but I like this one the most):

#+begin_quote
  Hermione reared her hand back and slapped Harry straight across the face. Harry's brows rose slightly in surprise. He knew that Hermione could be a little violent at times---he certainly hadn't forgotten the slap she'd dealt to Draco or the time she'd locked Rita Skeeter in a jar for a few months or even when she'd led Umbridge to the centaurs---but he hadn't anticipated Hermione slapping /him/.

  The girl had guts.

  Hermione froze, wide-eyed, her no-doubt stinging hand hovering in the air (that had been a /hard/ slap, no matter the fact that he hadn't reacted). It was as if she hadn't expected to /actually/ hit him, especially for something as simple as annoying her. (Though he had to admit, he might have taken it too far with that last comment.)

  Harry stuck two fingers in his mouth and felt for the stinging in his lip. When he held up his hand to show Hermione the blood on his fingers, he commented, "Not bad."

  "I---I didn't---" Hermione stammered, lowering her hand. The flush of anger and frustration in her face had faded to a pale colour in her shock.

  "You didn't mean to slap me?" said Harry dryly. He waggled his fingers at her and Hermione's brown eyes locked onto the red smear on them. Harry wiped them on a handkerchief he Conjured before he Vanished it. He wasn't about to leave his blood lying around; he'd learnt that lesson during Voldemort's resurrection the first time around.

Him calling her "little girl" is mainly him mocking her out of his own frustration. He's a Slytherin in this and a lot of people think he's a blood purist because he hangs out with all of these prejudiced pureblood Slytherins, most notably Draco Malfoy.

And yes, I'm definitely doing timeline shenanigans. In the fic, Harry and Theo are sent ten years to the past to right before their first year at Hogwarts during one of their investigations as Aurors. This scene will most likely take place around third year, so while Hermione is technically older than Harry, Harry is mentally ten years older than her. Also, he's not going to be a little shrimp, either, because he'd have taken supplements or whatever to get rid of most of the malnutrition damage.

Basically, before Harry's dialogue here, Hermione basically called Harry a blood purist or some such. I haven't actually written that part. This little scene was just an idea that came to mind when I was writing the fourth chapter of this fic.

Hermione's also not really friends with Harry, she's more of an acquaintance, and from what I've got planned, she's not going to find out he's from the future. She'll just take it as him mocking her because he's upset that everyone keeps thinking that he'd ignore the fact that his mother was Muggleborn, which is what this scene basically is.

If you're surrounding yourself with openly racist people (calling for death of muggleborn level), I'm going to assume you're racist. Saying your mother is muggleborn would be just an excuse if you can tolerate the people that would want to see her death enough to be friends with them.

*** Everything is pretty much canon for the first time around, save for a few changes like the Dursleys' abuse being a little more extreme and a few other minor details. Almost everything in the books is canon, and i'm intermingling a few details from the Epilogue (such as Harry being an Auror) and a small detail about Theo that I read from the Cursed Child. I also took Harry being a Parseltongue still in the Cursed Child, as well.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione broke apart after the war and became really distant with each other. They went different ways, and while they tried to patch up their friendship, it just didn't happen. They still see each other every few weeks, but that's if they cross paths. Harry hadn't really interacted with them by the time he was sent back in time (three years after the war) and this little scene takes place three years after that in third year. Harry and Hermione are acquainatnces here but Harry and Ron just aren't in the same circles (I'm going to keep Weasley bashing to a minimum). One of the reasons they split apart was because Harry got into darker magics after the war because he became obsessed with going back in time to save everyone; Sirius, Fred, Tonks, Remus... He accepted the darker part of him and his friends didn't really understand and they broke apart because of that. So that's why he seems so AU in this and a little bit is because he's so frustrated and stuff.

**** I see from your other comments that this is a time travel fic, which is one of my favorite tropes so I'll definitely check it out. In my opinion, the interaction between Harry and Hermione would be more impactful if Harry's response was less angry and more controlled. Considering the fact that he's mentally so much older than her, if she'd been rude to him previously, it would be like a little kid insulting an adult, which is not very threatening and less likely to induce anger. I'd expect this response from a teenage Slytherin Harry, but from an adult, I don't buy it quite as much.

Others may disagree, but I feel that the scene would come across better if he simply stated his viewpoint as though it were obvious and she was dense for believing otherwise, rather than getting angry (or showing his anger outwardly, at least).

Just my opinion, based on my personal preferences.

I said in another response that Harry's emotional state is with him in his mid-to-late teens so that kinda corresponds with his response. Harry's pretty much frustrated at this point and Hermione pushed him just a little bit too far. (Basically, the time travel stuff messed with his mind, kind of regressing his emotional state a bit, and he's also going through puberty at this time, which is not only affecting his emotions but also his magic, which is something he's so in-tuned with.)

I'll definitely make a note of him doing it differently. I still want to have him holding her wrist since she was going to slap him and that would gather her full attention, though. It's also a little scare factor, which I want him to use to get her to listen. Him mocking her slightly while sounding so serious and as if it's obvious is a really good idea, though.

How about this? (Also, please be aware that I just cranked this out without reading it over.):

#+begin_quote
  Harry grasped Hermione's wrist in his hand as she went to slap him, his green eyes staring coldly into her wide, surprised brown ones.

  "Listen here and listen well, Granger," said Harry seriously, tightening his hold on Hermione's wrist when she tried to pull her hand out of his grasp. He paid no mind to her other hand, which was beating against his arms and sides in frustration as she failed to get him to let go of her. He continued in a flat, almost mocking tone, "Do not presume you know me or my ambitions, because I will only say this once, you /do not/. I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does not mean my ideals align with what your ignorant little mind /thinks/ what the other Slytherins think about you and your parentage.

  "You say I dislike Muggleborns and that I belive that you're not smart enough to be in this school, but you would be /wrong/. You don't /listen/ when people tell you things, do you, Granger? You only hear or read one opinion or book and make up your mind. You hear 'Slytherin' and automatically think 'prejudiced purebloods', do you not?"

  Harry stopped talking and watched as Hermione's lips thinned. She had stopped hitting him when it became clear that she wasn't going to get out of his hold until he was ready to let her go. Her cheeks blotched red at his mocking comments and tone but she didn't dare to speak.

  "You need to /understand/ why many witches and wizards, not just purebloods, think that Muggleborns shouldn't be included in the wizarding world. It's not because they think your blood is dirty---though I won't deny that there are those who certainly think that, as idiotic as they are---it is because Muggleborns either don't care to learn wizarding customs or because they /refuse/ to learn, even when they're given the chance.

  "And Muggleborns, they /think/ that /we're/ the backwards ones. They and who the old families refer to as 'blood traitors' think that it is /all right/ to remove our customs. Have you ever thought about why Hogwarts, a /magical school/, celebrates /Christian holidays/? No? Well, I'll tell you.

  "It's because Albus Dumbledore, champion of the Light, believed that /our/ customs, the pagan holidays, are not /welcoming/ to Muggleborns like you with small, little minds. That our praying to our chosen gods or goddesses, that our celebrating the solsitces, that us doing /harmless/ /rituals/, are /wrong/ and /dark/ and /backwards/. And if we want to celebrate them, we have to celebrate them in /private/. And yet the everyone else can openly celebrate those holidays?

  "Do you think that is fair, Granger?"

  Hermione had started to shake half-way through his cold, intense rant and her eyes were glossy with unshed tears. Harry's dark, unkind eyes stared unsympathetically into Hermione's. He might feel bad about scaring Hermione later, but she /needed/ to hear the truth. She was a very intelligent girl, somewhat open-minded, too, but all she wanted to do was /change/ the wizarding world; because she believed it was /backwards/ and /wrong/. She never thought that perhaps things were the way they were for a /reason/.

  "Do you think that is fair?" Harry asked once more, tugging Hermione's wrist to make her react. She shook her head mutely.

  Harry continued softly, "Good, because it's not. It's not /fair/ that people think these things based on a few comments they heard. It's not /fair/ that people make up opinions based on the rumours of others. It's not /fair/ that you think that I, /whose 'Mudblood' mother sacrificed her life for mine/, think that Muggleborns aren't even worth the dirt beneath my shoes."

  It was Harry parroting her words back to her that made Hermione's tears finally fall. Her shoulders hitched up in a silent sob and Harry let go of her wrist and stepped away from her. He watched blankly as Hermione grabbed her fallen bag and ran off without looking back at him.

  He stood there for a moment longer before picking up his satchel and walking the opposite way to the Great Hall past Theo---who'd stood beside him silently during his whole rant---without a single glance.

  He wasn't feeling hungry anymore.

I'm struggling a little to decide how to write it because it jumps to when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter and I'm not sure about how to go about it. After this chapter, though, the ball should start rolling and we'll get into first year. I'm only about six hundred words in and I need a minimum of three thousand, lol. Luckily, I've got a cool little scene that I wrote up a week ago that'll fit in. I'm so excited to write that part!

Harry is planned to go into Slytherin, right? Because I freaked out when I found this Fic, it was like so perfect and well-written.

If he goes to Slytherin is he planned to be friends with Draco or just have a small bubble of friends like Theo and Daphne?

***** My minimum used to be a thousand words but then I looked over it and that was barely three minutes of reading and it looked so short. All of my chapters were a thousand words long and there was no diversity in chapter length. So now my minimum is three thousand (I moved that up from two thousand a few months ago) and the longest chapter I've written so far has been nine thousand words. I've written over ten thousand words a day before sometimes, and I think I hit thirty thousand once.

Harry is definitely going to be in Slytherin, because if not, then I'm going to have to do a full rework of all the planning I've already done. However, I will be rewritiing my fic where Harry's in Gryffindor, if that makes sense.

I discussed this in one of my other posts (it was a long discussion of me discussing my fic and the thoughts in it and I responded a few long-ass essay comments that helped me figure out my fic), but Harry will sorta be forming a "Marauders" kind of friend group. He's not going to pic up his father's bullying habits, but he's going to have a somewhat close friend group in Slytherin that will remind everyone of the Marauders (especially Lupin), and the group will be of him and Theo, as well as Draco and Blaise. Draco and Blaise will find out about them travelling back in time. Harry will also be somewhat friends with other people in Slytherin, as well as from other Houses. Hermione will be an acquaintance and so will Neville.

And no worries about asking me questions! I love it when people do that because that's how I work out what I'm going to do in my fic.

******* Ron's pretty much going to be a minor character until fourth/fifth year. He's going to be an asshole during the Goblet of Fire and his family is still going to hiding out in Grimmauld Place. Other than that, no, he's not really going to be in the fic. Just a few mentions.

I'm actually kind of planning for Blaise and Hermione to potentially get together when Harry and her go past the acquaintance phase and more to the friend phase. I'm pretty much planning for the relationships to be Harry/Theo, Hermione/Blaise, Remus/Sirius (I'm still iffy on this, it might become Remus/Dora and when Sirius gets exonerated, Sirius/Amelia), and Draco/Astoria. I figured the last one would be funny if Daphne hated Draco (kinda) and Draco really wanted to date Astoria, or maybe Blaise trying to be a wingman for Draco or whatever, lol.

I'm excited that you like how I'm portraying Harry and Theo! I was always a little annoyed that Harry didn't show any interest in magic other than Defense. Like, he was so excited for magic in first year, so why isn't he interested in learning more of it? I've always seen Theo as more of a quiet, blunt person who wants to stay out of the way. Theo's going to be Harry's shadow, pretty much, and he'll be doing things in the background for Harry (and himself).

You're not bothering me at all! I love discussing things!

Also have you been foreshadowing Harry delving into the Dark Arts? Or has he delved into the Dark Arts? I feel like there have been some mentions but I'm not that good at picking some stuff up.

Is Harry gonna be like super intelligent in this Fic? By that I mean like beating Hermione in the subjects because he already knows what there talking about. Well, I guess he does have to watch out for Theo though as well.

Completely unrelated but do you have any fics you can reccomend? I really need to take my mind off of 2021.

********* He's already delved into them. He got into them when he was searching Grimmauld Place for time travel spells and rituals, and he also got into them when he studied in Alexandria, Egypt (because Egyptians studied time travel). He read some about Necromancy because it interested him in a weird way but he didn't try any of the spells.

Harry will be pretty intelligent in this fic. He was intelligent in canon, he just didn't try as hard as he should have. In this, he's going to rival Hermione and Theo in the matters of schoolwork because he already knows it, but he'll be taking completely different classes in third year so he will be challenged a bit. I made him become interested in warding, spellcrafting, and curse-breaking after his studies for time travel and he's had conversations with Bill about them. He also learned a bit about spellcrafting from Hermione during the seventh book. So, yeah, he's going to be really intelligent, but he's still going to be challenged a bit and he won't know everything.

Fred and George are also totally going be friends. They're not going to be best friends, necessarily, but Harry won't be on bad terms with them. He'll be funding their experiments and he'll also give them money for their shop, but it's also for a trade. They'll help him out when he needs the help and they'll also be giving him the Marauder's Map.

He's still a Gryffindor, but he plays around with Slytherin politics so Draco doesn't have to deal with befriending a Gryffindor/the Boy-Who-Lived. He's also a prodigy in Transfiguration.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22327684/chapters/53334382][draw me after you (let us run)]] (Harry gets one over on Voldemort during the Department of Mysteries fiasco and he goes on the run early to get the Horcruxes. It's really good.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] (Harry is reSorted into Slytherin after he is accidentally expelled from Hogwarts after the Dementor thing.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24410095/chapters/58886953][The Boy Who Lived, The Brightest Witch and The Boy Who Wasn't]] (Harry and Hermione become good friends with Neville after Ron thinks Harry put his name in the Goblet.)

There will be a lot of platonic relationship stuff going on, though, since that's pretty much what I know how to write. I'm not good at writing romantic relationships so the fic will mainly be based on the plot, though I do have a few scenes planned that will contain them being couple-y (such as everyone's surprise when Harry and Hermione, who acted a lot like James and Lily did, don't get together but Harry and Theo get together and potentially Hermione and Blaise getting together). I'm not that big into writing smut, either, so there will most likely be none of that, so it'll mostly be something that's not mentioned much. Hope that answers any of your questions!
