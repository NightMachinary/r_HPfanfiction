:END:
After the disaster at the Department of Mysteries, the Weasleys and the Grangers refuse to let Harry see Ron & Hermione in the infirmary and Harry is kicked out of Gryffindor House and learns that the Inquisitorial Squad killed Hedwig in revenge while he was off to the Ministry.

He goes to the Astronomy Tower and encounters Susan there, who has been pestering him about Cedric for most of 5th year. She asks him and he snaps and tells her that Cedric didn't have heroic death, he died for nothing and was squashed like a bug "poof he's not there anymore" and that he couldn't save him. She gets angry and tells him "What good are you, then?" and he decides that he's had enough and kill himself by jumping off the Astronomy Tower.

He dies, but Dumbledore has made a deal with the Unspeakables who somehow manage to bring him back. His body is too damaged, though, so they put his consciousness in the body of someone who was kissed by a dementor. They're aware of the prophecy and they train him to fight Voldemort for several years while letting everyone believe that he really died. His unspeakable codename is Wraith.

I was halfway through and then lost it and can't find it anymore since I cleared my pc

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.
