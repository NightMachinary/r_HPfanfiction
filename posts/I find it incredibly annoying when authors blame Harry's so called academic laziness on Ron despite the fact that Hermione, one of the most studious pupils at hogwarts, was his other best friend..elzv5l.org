Hagrid actually fits better than all of them.

Ron is blamed because he's what separates the Harry who read all his books in August and the Harry who didn't give a damn by October. The real reason is plot, but you can't write that in a story.

Harry's actions are entirely his own. That I agree with, but Hermione, while an excellent academic, is not someone that could inspire anyone to become more of an academic or a better student, especially not one looking to have /fun/. Having a meltdown and being ostracized due to being snappish because you're overworked, stressed, and exhausted is not inspirational.

Harry didn't have any good influences. The adults were simultaneously enabling and unhelpful and the fun friend wasn't an academic.

*** Why Hagrid? Cause he kept dropping adventure hooks?

Anyway, in canon, Harry isn't a bad student, he's an average one save for DADA from third year on. He's written that way to be more relatable - an ordinary guy put in extraordinary situations. Plus, if he were a highly academic genius, Hermione's importance to the trip would be diminished.

** I've always felt like the fanon of Harry getting in trouble if he outperformed Dudley in school made a lot of sense. There are no indications of it in canon other than that's totally something the Dursleys would have done.

Even without that fanon implying that he was used to under performing by the time he reached Hogwarts, I wouldn't put the blame on anyone but the Dursleys. Ron is very laid back regarding his education in a lot of ways before fifth year. Taking things seriously after that was part of his character development. So given that for the first month of school Harry's only friend in his entire life is laid back about school and irritated with the engaged muggle raised know it all Hermione, why would he risk his friendship by moving out of his comfort zone?

On top of that he is seeing Snape, who automatically hated him and in Harry's eyes might be trying to kill him, tear apart Hermione for being an insufferable know it all and trying to answer questions. Why put in more work if it is going to be punished?

Then he's friends with Hermione, and he gets how important studying and knowing the answers is to her. Is it that far out of character to think that previously friendless Harry would be worried that he would upset his brilliant friend by upstaging her in class? There are indications that he felt that way when he was asked to teach the DA.

I think that at first, it was the Durselys fault for the way they raised Harry, and that later it just became habit.

IIRC wasn't he emulating her in book 4 when Ron dumped them after the goblet? He was beside her researching. When Ron came back, it was back to Hermione doing the researching.

That was not cheating, no matter how much Hermione says it was. The only legit concern she had about the book was the spells in it. Fanon says it best: Hermione was jealous Harry beat her in something that wasn't DADA.

I'm not 100% blaming Ron on this. I'm not saying he's blameless, but he is a factor of it. The rest is Snape, everybody's high expectations because of his parents, and Dumbledore not letting him have a proper childhood, and keeping his school in line.

As far as we can tell, that's about all there is to learning to brew potions. Additionally, the essays they write are usually about the properties of the ingredients and what not, not the techniques employed in brewing.

It's just one of her pesonal flaw that are completely ignored by most fanfic (as they were by the films) because Hermione is such a perfect character and the only woman worthy of Harry (funny how these same flaws are, in the case of Ron, proudly showed as a proof that he is a bad friend who don't deserve the friendship of the other 2, not to mention the love).

***** I'm not sure if it /is/ hypocrisy from Hermione - doesn't make her opinion /right/, of course, but it seems to me that she considers anything outside the official instructions/instruction materials to be wrong to use there, so she doesn't use it.

****** I think that, if I had to voice the main shortcoming of Hermione, it would be her tendency to often think she knows best, and because of it, most of her actions depend of her personal opinion, and she is also really stuborn, having difficulty to admit she was wrong.

There are several instances in Canon where Hermione act on these, sometimes making her appear hypocrite :

- For example, she kept asking of Harry and Ron to be respectful when talking about a teacher, especially with Snape (because you respect the authority, and mastery I guess). And she kept this stance even with Lockart even though several evidences proved he was just bad. Yet, she also completely dismissed Trewalney and called Divination a fraud, because she didn't like the teacher. She also kept this opinion after Trewalney did a true prophcy (proving she had "the Sight").
- She also went to Mc Gonnagal, behind Harry back because "the broom could come from Black and be dangerous". While the broom truly came from Black, and she had good intentions, I think it's a bit hypocrite to do this considering all the "dangerous" thing she took part of in the past.
- There is also the case of Scabbers. She completely dismissed the possibility that her cat may have killed Scabbers, even though all evidence went in this direction. Even if, once again, she may have been right and Scabbers was alive, this is exactly the kind of behaviour you see from Karen when "Their little angel did nothing wrong"
- And just the year before, she dismissed the "official instruction" because she decided it was bad.
- And I don't talk about the whole SPEW where her heart might be in the right place. But when the Elfes themselves don't want to be free, you try to understand why they are happy like this, and try to find alternative, you don't sew clothes and hid them in the hope you will free them against their will.

I think the Hermione refuse to use the book because, the 1st time she was still a bit bitter about losing, and was later too stuborn to admit she was wrong (when Harry kept using the book and no potion exploded) and tried to prove a point about how she could be better while following "proper instructions" (failed on this though). If Harry had showed the book in difference circunstances (mainly not just after using it to win a little competition), she would probably have been more willing to use it.

PS : I also want to add that, while I think this is the main character flaw of Hermione, the narrative is really kind to her in most case. She was wrong about Lockart, but was petrified, and when she was back, he was already in the hospital and the subject never came back again. After Harry ignored her after the broom incident, she had a crying fit about the pression of all her classes and Buckhead, Harry apologized and the subject never came back again. Scabber was not only alive, but also a bad guy so even though she should have apologized because all evidences of that time pointed to it, it's Ron who has to apologize about daring to doubt her. Even in HBP, Harry does use a dangerous spell of the book, and she later show him a newspaper in the library showing that Snape is a Half Blood son of a "Prince" showing she was right again and the book was from a bad guy.Harry and Ron do mistake and have to apologize and grow up. Hermione does mistake and others have to apologize and grow up.

***** Well, I could see a case to be made that Harry /was/ kind of cheating by using it - or at least, making himself out to be a potions genius while just following some instructions. Same with it being an advantage the other students don't have access to - and particularly if they're meant to be using the official instruction materials (ie - class notes, the assigned books, etc), or at least vetted ones (if we extend it to include the library books). I would imagine she'd have no problems if Harry had dug it up out of the Library, for instance.

But Potions is a weird one, because from the books it really just seems to be the equivalent of a chemistry lab with basically no real theory/lectures behind it, so following instructions is all they do. And Harry just happens to have better instructions.

Think of it like Draco getting private tutoring from Snape on the side (as in a lot of fanfics). Is it cheating? Not /really/, but it's certainly /unfair/ since Snape isn't offering the same assistance to anyone else.

Given that Hermione's achievements are mostly down to /working bloody hard at it/, it's understandable that she'd be miffed about suddenly being at a disadvantage.

** Why do people see Harry as this impressionable kid who is influenced by those around him? The reason he was excited about books only to drop them is because at first, books were his only source of information. Then he had a whole castle to explore, ghosts to meet, and a friend with a lot of very interesting stories and information. Of course he didn't need books anymore. Plus, it was his first chance to actually be a normal kid. He'd never had that opportunity, because he lived in a fucking cupboard and was bullied. If he was influenced by Ron into playing games instead of studying, it's because he'd never had a friend to play games with. Studying is a pretty ordinary thing you can do on your own. A friend to play with is a novelty, of course he fucking wanted to do that.

Everyone. Sounds a lot like Tom Riddle "poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave". And as I prefer to see it- Harry's smarts are put on the same level as his /fame/, /scar/, and /broom/ skills. ie. Quite considerable to say the least.

** I always got the feeling that Molly was easily impressed due to years of dealing with the twins. However I must point out that in terms of studying Hermione would probably be a worse influence than Ron. I'm not talking about her giving homework help but the fact that she is very one way fits all, and Harry seems to be more a practical learner than solely a book learner like Hermione. If she had been interested in having practice duels, etc she may have influenced him to study more. Not to mention that studying visibly brought her a lot of stress sometimes- something the people around her likely did not find inspiring. Harry basically had no good role models for studying unless he were to think it would be fun to be as obsessive as Hermione. I actually think the most likely to inspire Harry would be Lupin ir Sirius, if not an older Weasley.

** Eh. Yes and no. I agree with you wholly that it's primarily Harry's crappy actions/decisions that make for his lack of interest in learning anything about anything (it took him four bloody years to learn what a Death Eater was!) and that it was ultimately his responsibility for not bothering to actually prepare in any way for being an immigrant into a new society or being enemy number one of an apparent prodigy mass-murderer that everyone talks about as being ridiculously powerful and scary.

Ron being a bad academic influence is never really explicit, but it's sensible enough to be somewhat canonical. Regarding why he'd follow Ron and not Hermione, psychologically we follow the people we're most like or most want to be like. Harry is a dumb jock who likes Sports and being a Normal Kid^{TM,} which is basically what Ron is - a perfectly normal average Magical Quidditch Nut. So, yeah. Of course he'd follow Ron over Hermione when the latter is kinda pushy and slightly condescending on occasion. I'm not sure if the 'I was forced to do worse than Dudley because they beat me if I did better on tests' thing is canon or not - I'm rather tipsy atm and my memory isn't the best - but if it is that'd also push him more towards the athletic than the academic.

I mean, Voldemort should technically have a better effect on Harry's learning, given that he's supposedly coming after him and the people he cares about, which a self-sacrificing and passively-suicidal-ideation-having Harry would care about and do his best to stop. Sensibly, he'd learn everything he could so he'd have the best chance possible when Voldemort and Co came after him. Same with Umbridge, technically she boosted his learning by creating a situation in which he needed to teach others (which is one of the best ways to learn something).

Quirrel was shit, though.

*** 1) Ron had absolutely 0 influence on Harry concerning Quidditch. In fact, outside of some basic conversation (about their favourite team for example), Ron was not linked to Quidditch before year 5 when he himself joined the team. Before that, he would just say "good luck Harry" before a match and cheer for him. Harry joined the team by some turn of events (mainly caused by Malfoy), and then saw that he liked it.

2) Absolutely nothing in canon show that the Dursley forced Harry to have worse grade than Dursley. In fact, from what we saw, as long as Harry followed their rules (do the chores was asked you to do, and don't do anything strange like the M word), they were perfectly happy to ignore him. Even the rare case of violence we see (like Petunia "murder" pan swing") were always in the contexte of magic like Harry getting his letters or making Dudley think he cast a spell.

3) Harry and Ron are both good students. In fact, from their OWL results, we can see that they both have pretty much the same grades, with the exception of Harry being a bit better at Defense (an O rather than an E). Not wanting to spend 90% of his free time in the library is a normal comportment for any teenager, and it's rather Hermione the abnormality. And while we are at it, I don't know how it works in Britain (or in the magical world in this particular case), but in my country, a student systematicaly submiting a dissertation 2 times longer than asked would quickly get very bad grade until he learn how to synthetise.

4), Finally, and that just be a personnal opinion, but I don't understand all these people that think that Harry "should have prepared". He is a freaking kid opposed to a genius who has 50 more years of experience. No ammount of time passed in the library would level the field with a edge like that, and you would just end up with a completely dysfunctional Harry. Dumbledore never intented for Harry to duel Voldemort, he was more interested in his human qualities (love, compation . . .) because these were the things Voldemort didn't know about.

**** Re the Dursley thing.

I can't see them doing it deliberately but I can definitely see it being a byproduct of the environment.

They put him in a cupboard rather than a bedroom to keep him out of sight and out of mind, so I doubt leisure time would be something that Harry was allowed. I also doubt that they would have let him do his homework at the kitchen table or in the living room like a normal kid, let alone helping him if he didn't understand something. Harry's cupboard in the book doesn't appear to have a lightbulb or anything of the kind. Dudley is also enabled and even encouraged to bully Harry.

Ergo, Harry has to do his homework at odd times, in odd places, probably without the benefit of light and definitely without the benefit of adult help. His homework then has to run the gamut of Dudley, who would probably find it very funny to ruin it just to get Harry in trouble.

Obviously homework isn't everything, especially in primary school, but it might well prejudice teachers against him if he appears to be someone who perennially doesn't do his homework.

**** Is the 'Ron is an obsessive Quidditch nut' thing fanon? Really? Damn, I totally have to make time to reread the books. I'm finding out I've overwritten so much canon with fanon over the years. I could've sworn I remembered something about Ron being all interested in the moves and tactics from the books. The Dursley thing I really wasn't sure about, but it's good to get confirmation it wasn't.

That is very much the same here. At my university, we'd get graded from the beginning up until the end of the word count and absolutely no more than that. You wrote a ten thousand word essay with a two thousand word introduction? Well, that introduction is all that's getting graded.

...because it's common sense and a pretty common reaction in reality? If you get mugged and know you're going to get mugged again and again, you go get self-defence lessons or prep a speed-dial option for emergency services or do something to try stop it happening again. I don't mean Dumbledore's reaction would be to train him, you're quite right on your point on his focus on Harry's human qualities, but Harry should probably have gone "Hey, this guy is trying to kill me, none of the adults are really being all that helpful, so I should probably gear up a bit and learn some stuff so I can handle that stuff better next time shit goes down with Voldemort without getting a basilisk fang in me or Hermione/Ron getting cursed." Especially if you add in the saving-people-thing undertone to everything where he'd be doubly motivated to learn so as to be able to prevent his friends and loved ones being hurt as much. It's just sensible to prep for bad situations you know are coming when no adults seem to be able to help.

***** Concerning your last point, I think it's important to point that Harry was always someone with an extreme amount of extra curricular activities :

- 1st year : Solving the whole mistery, with hours spent in the library looking for Nicolas Flamel, plus how to smuggle a baby dragon out of Hogwarts, and playing Quidditch.
- 2nd year : Chamber of Secrets mystery, plus quidditch.
- 3rd year : Defense against Dementors, plus leaving the ground of the school (ok this not is less important, but he did learn some importants things about the plot while going to Hogsmeade). And Quidditch
- 4th year : How not to die in a Tournament made to be challenging for talented student 3 years older
- 5th year : The running of an illegal Defense group plus lessons with Snape (and OWL, they kinda are important). And a little bit of Quidditch
- 6th year : The year where it seemed he had the most free time, though HBP says that NEWT level lessons are very challenging and he has to work a lot on it. Still Quidditch (even more so as the Captain), lessons with Dumbledore, the stalking of Malfoy, and the study of the HBP's book.

With all these activities eating up his free time, I don't think he would have all that much time to "train himself". And even if he could, where would he do it? He discovered the Room of Requirement in year 5 and used it for training in defense, and in HBP Malfoy was spending all his free time there, blocking other from entering.\\
Also, a lot of the things he did in his free time can already be considered as "training" (for book 3, 4, and 5 at least).

And where? In a castle where the vast majority of it is unused? Pick a classroom, do it outside, pick up books from the library, find a corner of the common room, etc. It's not like he needs a lot of space to pick up a book and wave a stick while yelling pseudo-latin at things and so long as he fires anything lethal at a wall there's nobody being harmed.

Against Voldemort, that would be pointless because he's completely outmatched. However, given what we see from the other death Eaters, there are not many who are decent fighters. Bellatrix and Snape were the only ones who won fights against the good guys, with Dolohov and Rookwood getting good shots in.

Think of it this way. A helmet won't stop an artillery shell. But it will protect your head from shrapnel, glancing shots and small calibres. So of course soldiers wear one. And for Harry, that helmet would have been training.

If the trio would have spent year six drilling lethal spells (eg Sectumsempra) rather than passing the idiot ball like a blunt, they could have fought their way through the snatchers. If the DA had gone through similar training, the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a one-sided slaughter because Voldemort's tactics were just "charge".

** I've never understood why people thought that Harry and Ron were academically lazy. They're both shown to be at the very least average in all of their subjects. They always complete their homework, which no matter the subject, wizarding or not, is always a drag.

They're frequently seen with Hermione in the library. Sometimes they're not studying but researching whatever hair-brained scheme they've managed to get involved in this years expedition. But they still study. But Hermione's a bookworm and an overachiever - she's literally described as the brightest witch of HER AGE - the amount of time she spends in the library is not the average for others.

As with most things in life, the bad always shines through more than the good. Potions is a drag for 5 years because Snape is an asshole. That doesn't really reflect on Harry or Ron's academic prowess. And in spite of how awful a professor he is, Harry and Ron manage E's. The equivalent of an A. Divination is seen as a hoax and so they routinely make up their homework, when even Hermione comments about not wasting time on the subject.

DADA has such a flurry of good and bad teachers, the fact that Harry taught (!) the DA everything they needed to know and Ron received an E - like cmon - is hella impressive. Harry even compliments Ron a few times in classes for getting things pretty quickly. But despite the awful education they received, Harry probably alone manages to teach the entire DA 5th years well enough to pass the OWLs.

Receiving an O is really like getting 110/100. Harry only receives that in his best subject. Hermione doesn't even get one in DADA. An E is like 90-100/100. That's still top marks. Harry and Ron manage that for every core subject. Hagrid gets attacked in the middle of Astrology (which would be grounds for a resit in my book.) Harry has a Voldy-flash during HOM. And Divination, well... Rons scores are never confirmed - but its believed he received a P for HOM. They study hard for their OWLs. Rowling just doesn't spend two chapters talking about it. She takes probably a paragraph to describe revision that Easter.

Harry also always completes his summer work over the holidays (except when the Dursley's lock everything away). So it's not like he's unmotivated without Hermione nagging at him.

Countless teachers - other than Snape and Umbridge - talk about how bright Harry is. McGonnagall clearly believes Harry has the brains and the ability to become an auror. And he does make the cut. Snape has an unusually high standard for his NEWT class. He's the only teacher we see who requires an O. And that's probably because he's a jerk and wants to deal with as few students as possible. But I don't think McG goes around telling anyone that they have aptitude to achieve the right grades for Auror training. She sets Neville in line about the comments his grandmother made about transfiguration vs charms. And she knows his aptitude is for herbology.
