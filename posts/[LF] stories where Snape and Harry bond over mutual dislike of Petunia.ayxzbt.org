Not a bashing fic and please no slash.


** I don't think I've ever seen a fic like this, in like a decade of reading HP fanfiction.

Not that there aren't any to be found, but good luck finding one.

*** Woah! You've been reading fanfics for a decade?

I'm just a year in and good fics are already scarce.

*** Shame since I'd actually be willing to read that. I've seen a couple where Harry is adopted by Snape/Snape tried to be a mentor to Harry after finding out he lives with Petunia.
