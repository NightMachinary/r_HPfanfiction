I've seen conflicting information about what werewolves in HP actually look like. Text descriptions seem to indicate that werewolves are almost identical to regular wolves, save for small features (human-like eyes, shorter snout, tufted tail; Lupin taking his Potion makes him indistinguishable from 'a sleepy wolf'). But the movies plus the 'official' Pottermore illustrations show werewolves (or Fenrir, at least) as taking a more stereotypical bipedal / half-digitigrade horror movie form.

Could I go with either, or is there an explanation for the contradiction I'm not aware of?


** Identical to regular wolves is easy to describe in a book, but not visually appealing in artwork or movies. It's just a matter of picking your preferred canon. There is neither explanation nor contradiction, Movie Canon is separate from Book Canon, and Pottermore is a supplement for Book Canon (its images are only as accurate/canonical as the book covers and/or chapter pictures in the book).

Looks like a fairly large, shaggy wolf

** There's a theory out there that the partly-humanoid appearance is a side-effect of taking Wolfsbane for several years in a row. But no, otherwise, there's no canonical explanation of the discrepancy.

*** I'm pretty sure Lupin only ever took Wolfsbane while he was teaching at Hogwarts, so he only took it for less than a year. I'm also pretty sure Greyback wouldn't bother with that potion (unless it allows you to remember what you're doing as a wolf, as he'd want to remember his attacks, but he would probably also see it as not embracing the wolf so he'd most likely be against it).

Canonically werewolves just look like big wolves, the movie director just thought that was too boring.

** Remember Fenrir bit and clawed at people in his human form and did not seem to care much about acting like a human being. I always thought that he was a crazy person who wished and tried to act as if he was a monster all the time instead of once a month. Still doesn't make him a bipedal wolf though.

And movie canon is not book canon. I personally do not know why they had to go and make transformed Remus disgusting and grotesque. Wolves can be very terrifying when aggressive, they don't have to look like bald skeletal humans with snouts to be scary. There is this very cute painting on Pottermore where the marauders are standing in a grassy field, it took me a second to tell Sirius and Remus apart XD I like the idea of four cute animals going on nocturnal adventures as long as there are no humans nearby, with movie canon though? Urgh...

** I personally prefer the appearance to be the form Lupin transforms into during the third movie.

I found the Pottermore image to be silly - that's a regular old grey wolf that's depicted there. Werewolves are typically depicted as half-man half-wolf anyway. A fully lupine appearance would be sort of antithetical to the name itself, barring the transformation, feral nature and overall rabidness of the form itself.

Greyback takes a more lupine appearance even in human form, because he's fully embraced the werewolf as a core part of his being, instead of treating it as a curse, like Lupin does - which is implied as part of the reason why other werewolves respect/fear Greyback, and disdain Lupin.
