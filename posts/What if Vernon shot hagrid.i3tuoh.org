I just read a fanfic and it mentions that while in the shack Vernon had a gun, so what if he shot hagrid ? How would that change the story of Harry Potter?


** A shotgun makes lots of small injuries, so I don't imagine it would have much effect on a half-giant. I was about to say it would make him angry, but considering his pets, it might just make him think Vernon was adorable.

*** Shotguns shoot either a large number of small pellets or one very large metal slug. I think a shotgun slug would probably do some serious damage even to a a half-giant.

This is of course irrelevant, because Vernon had a rifle, not a shotgun.

** Was a rifle, not a shotgun, but yeah a well-placed or lucky shot could be enough to take down even Hagrid.

I swear I've read at least one story in the past based on this premise. Was just a one-shot where Vernon shot Hagrid dead in the hut and they went back to Privet Drive, Harry managed to get his hands on the letter Hagrid had brought at the end and learned he was a wizard.

*** I disagree. Wizards are resilient already. Car crashes are no threat, venomous mundane creatures don't have a chance, and Harry gets his skull cracked by a bludger and falls out of the sky, and survives easily. Even if Dursley could hit Hagrid (unlikely with magic), I highly doubt it poses a serious threat to Hagrid. I don't think Dursley bought a big game rifle. Add in the half-giant nature of Hagrid and rifles pose little to no threat, and that's not even getting into the spells Hagrid might be capable of using.

People often overestimate guns. People survive gun shots to the head and chest a lot more than people think. Add in magic, and half-giant status, and I think Hagrid's just going to be angry.

Good catch on the shotgun though.

Edit: it seems there is some doubt as to the accuracy of my evidence. Unfortunately. I lost power and don't have access to the books to directly quote. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2n8vm/healing_in_harry_potter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]] is a link with evidence as to the resiliency of wizards. PS shows Hagrid's ability to perform some human transfiguration, a subject taught in 6th year. HPB will has quotes from the hospital wing detailing Harry's injuries. In the post I linked, only the injuries being inflicted scene is quoted. I detail a further response down below in response to another comment.

Nothing in canon supports these.

#+end_quote

No he didn't. The only time Harry was ever hit by a bludger was in the arm (which broke his arm, exactly what you'd expect a heavy iron ball hitting somebody in the arm to do), and he stayed on his broom. The time he fell off was when the match was attacked by Dementors, where he fell fifty feet (not "out of the sky") onto soft ground, and we have no idea what level of injuries he may have had because he didn't wake up until he was already in the Hospital Wing.

People also frequently die when shot in the head or chest. My point isn't "Oh if Vernon had shot first and talked later Hagrid would absolutely be super dead dudes!", it's that that could have happened. Half-giants are strong and durable, yes, but nothing in canon even suggests that they can get shot in the head or chest and stay standing. As for magic, I doubt that Hagrid's third year education and infrequent use of magic since then has made him a master of spells that will protect him from bullets.

Quotes in the post I linked for the car crash and venomous creatures.

Reread half blood prince for cormac hitting Harry with bludger and the hospital scene after. I'd quote it but I lost power and am on my phone. If you can't find it, I'd be more than happy to help when I get power back.

I'd suggest reading OoTP for info on giants. Again, I'll quote when I'm on my computer if you'd like me to.

Hagrid also performed an incomplete human transfiguration, a notoriously difficult subject taught to 6th years, so I think it entirely feasible he learned shield charms or imperturbable charms, which Hermione cast in either CoS or POA.

I apologize for any grammatical errors. Edit: my point is that gun shots are survivable enough for actual humans, before adding in magical resiliency, possible spells, and giant blood. I don't think a rifle Vernon has possesses a threat to Hagrid, even with an ideal shot. Of course I recognize people die from gun shots, I've literally seen them do so.

****** You're absolutely right, I completely forgot about that time in HBP. Although that one absolute supports my point, Harry got hit in the head and got his skull cracked, exactly as you'd expect, he survived because Pomfrey healed it. No magically increased durability seen or needed.

I understand your overall point, gunshot wounds are not always fatal. But you seem to be missing my point that they very often are fatal, and nothing suggests Hagrid is immune to bullets.

If a Muggle was hit in the head by a bowling ball made of iron and travelling at over 100mph, there would be no head left to heal.

1. The Nimbus 2000 travels at easily over 100mph (probably closer to 150mph), and

******* Anyway, I went to sleep before I could reply in time but it seems [[/u/Taure]] beat me to it. To add on, a cracked skull compounded by a fall is fatal. Surviving gunshots occurs far more often. Wizarding resiliency already reduced the severity of the injury; it also meant he didn't die of them.

  What if the Dursley were good people that cared about Harry, their son, and weren't exactly the most lawful people? Harry has his families aid in all that he does at Hogwarts.

** Hagrid probably lives, blasts Vernon across the room, but likely needs medical attention. Harry's introduction to the Wizarding World is likely either St. Mungo's or the Hogwarts infirmary.

If Hagrid actually dies, then the next person they send will probably be Dumbledore himself, and Vernon is so very fucked.
