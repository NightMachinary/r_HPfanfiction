I'm looking for a story where Harry gets Away from the Dursleys and ends up helping out on a farm where Seamus' cousin lives. Eventual Harry and Draco become friends out of necessity. Oh, and dragon animagi.


** This sounds pretty bad.

*** It's actually pretty good. I'd tell more of it, but I don't want to give it away, its also completed, and not some one shot like "0mg Seams I luv ur cuz so much cuz she is purdy, and drakes, you iz da homie despite being a pureblood git to everyone, and we haz dragon animagoose furms so we r awesum." I don't remember the extent of the bashing in it, but I didn't have a a ffn account when I read it, so I couldn't favorite it.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.
