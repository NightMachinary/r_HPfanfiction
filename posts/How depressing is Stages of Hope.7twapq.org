** The low point was reached when Luna told Remus her stories. After that, it gets better. The ending is very nice and ends, as the title says, on a hopeful note.

** I think it never really drifts into grimdark - there's always hope that things get better. And they do get better.

*** I can't get passed the hospital wing part at the beginning. I just cringe way to hard and then close it instantly.

** I didn't consider it depressing at all, mostly because I could never get into this story. Wasn't a fan of the writing, the dialogue constantly broke my immersion and some of the descriptions and exposition was painful.

** I found it depressing as it's basically a bunch of co-dependent prodigies curbstomping a cracked-mirror world. There's only so many ways an author can hope to work the "other-universe reveal/current-universe 'OMFG that sucks' response" construction before it gets stale. Perhaps I'm jaded from a few too many AU dimension-travel stories, but this one relies a bit too much for my tastes on the trope.

It's also slightly depressing at a meta-level as it seems to be one of a small handful of stories recommended here in basically every thread, even those where it's not a very good match. (Look, I get passion--there's a bazillion StarFox5 fans here who rec. her stories three or four times per thread--but with a million stories in the fandom, perhaps we might try for some variety?)
