  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

I've reread the first 5 chapters several times now, and am thinking of breaking my 'don't favorite incomplete stories'-rule, so your efforts are most appreciated.

I do have to say, I really want Hermione to have her revenge on Dumbledore & co, I hope she can get Harry('s new coven) to follow her as she goes on to lead the world into darkness....

  Hermione Granger snaps and unleashes fire and death upon the wizarding world as only a muggleborn can. “I am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds”- J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the Atomic BombI've wanted to write a story where the light uses muggle technology for a while now, and also one with a dark Hermione. This is what came out. I won't be expanding it any, as I feel like the ending fits. The HMS Vanguard is a real ship, one of four Nuclear Missile submarines in the service of the British Navy. It calls from the Clyde Naval Base in Scotland and carries forty nuclear warheads atop eight Trident-II Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles. I don't think I'll write something quite this dark again, but if I'm in the mood I might put out another oneshot like this one. - Sincerely, ~partiallykritikal
