:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it a long time ago on fanfiction.net. It was essentially her diary entries where she talked about her job and her antagonistic relationship with Snape.

They have a thing for each other and don't want to admit it. I'm pretty sure at one point Sinistra is interested in a popular robes designer. There was a companion fic that was Snape's diary too.

It's pretty old so I'm not sure if it's even still around but if anyone has any idea what I'm talking about I would be grateful for your help!


** Snapistra FTW!
