#+TITLE: Any fully completed HP stories(that includes complete series) that don't have the Horcrux crap in it? Also, I enjoy a powerful Harry. Doesn't have to be godlike, but not a wimp, maybe like Tom, and Dumbledore in their younger years.

*** And as usual, I will give my thanks for a suggestion. It's a fully complete story. That was my only request, I don't mind when it takes place as long as it's complete. Be honest, where would you rate Harry power-wise by about the half way mark?

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. Award winner!
