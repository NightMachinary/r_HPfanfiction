Time travel or rebirth or whatever, maybe Harry is Merlin. A Merlin crossover would even be chill. But not the other way around. I am adverse to fics where the whole "crew" is livin' it up medieval style and I'm not really in the mood for Merlin and Arthur hop forward to Hogwarts, but in either case quality trumps shitty cliche. Hit me up. Please.


** linkffn(9860311) has fem-Harry traveling back in time. The four-chapter sequence 'Forging a Legend' is all about Merlin and the Arthurian legends. Maybe not /quite/ what you are looking for - Jasmine (Harry) is Muirgen/Morgana, not Merlin - but it's a fantastic story with excellent characterization.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Only a Boy by RiddellLee is pretty good, as is Harry Potter and the Return of Merlin by luminare91. Only a Boy is an incomplete series with the first work complete and the second slowly updating. Harry Potter and the Return of Merlin is sadly incomplete and appears to be abandoned. I'll edit this with synopses and links in the morning when I'm not on mobile. They're both on AO3 and should be easy to find though.

  Plot: Merlin has fulfilled his destiny. Albion is alive and beautiful, and magic is no longer feared in the land. He doesn't have to hide his powers and he doesn't have to polish anyone's armor. But then, at the signing of a document to commission the building of the first magical school: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Merlin is suddenly and violently jerked forward over a thousand years in the future. He has a new destiny to fulfill. Now he has to attend this school, hide the fact that he's the Merlin and defeat a Dark Lord that's messing with magic he knows nothing about. Pairing(s): Canon Parings, Merlin/ ? Rating: Teen - Subject to Change Disclaimer: I own nothing except my original characters and ideas.
