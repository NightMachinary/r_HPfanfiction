Basically, I'd like a fanfic where it depicts the Second Wizarding War but Death Eaters aren't utter douche bags and Voldemort is an actual mastermind besides being a power house. It would be nice if there is insight, even through short anecdotes, of what happens in both the Light and the Dark camp. Pairings would be nice as long as they're M/F. 100k+ or with sequels. Thanks!
