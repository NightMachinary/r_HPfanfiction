:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only thing I remember about this fic is the wand matching scene in Ollivander's.

Ollivander matches Harry with the Holly/Phoenix wand, rattles off the "Curious..." speech, but Harry doesn't like that and snaps it, saying something like "I don't want it." Ollivander proceeds to get all huffy and offended, and I think they had to go to a different wand crafter.

This has been bugging me for a few days, so thanks for any help.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

** The least a mediocre story like this could have done was be complete! Though I did find Harry's quips to be amusing as were he ridiculous names.

** Would that mean that Harry betrayed his wand? I don't think any wand soon will want to choose 'the betrayer'.
