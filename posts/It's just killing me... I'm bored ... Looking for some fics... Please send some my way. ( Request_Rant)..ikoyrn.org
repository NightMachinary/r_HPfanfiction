  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** Man I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Couldn't phrase that better. If you are just pulling my leg straight up tell me. And if I offended sincere apology. I'm awkward in real life. So I don't really get textual sarcasm

** Escape from reality? Well, let me try to point you to some interesting stories that I go to for my own escape. These are just the ones that are really entertaining. All of these are Harry centric, with a pretty competent Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] - linkffn(2328355) - My favorite story. It is quite fun with good humor. No romance but that works for this story. The author also has quite a few stories that are also excellent so I strongly recommend checking out their additional work if you enjoyed this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis][Amicus Protectio Fortis]] - linkffn(11547735) - A fun story about a 'what if the DA started early.' Again it's a fun story and pretty entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13132670/1/The-Stag-and-the-Flower][The Stage and the Flower]] - linkffn(13132670) - A great Harry/Fleur fanfic that you might like.

This is all I got time to really sit down and recommend. If you want anymore just PM. Also next time you want to requests fanfics. Try to narrow it down to a few tropes/genres you like. Also, please don't feel like you have to put in a paragraph of why you don't like slash. People understand its not for everyone, no one is going to hate you for it if you don't want that to be the center of the story. I hope you end up enjoying these stories. Sorry they are not mainly the tropes you like, I couldn't think of many off the top of my head.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
