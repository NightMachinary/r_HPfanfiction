We /all/ have them. Or we would have left fanfiction a long time ago. The Instant Drop Signals, which allow you to tell if a fanfic is worth reading or not based only on its summary.

Time to share the tips! What are yours? What do you use to find the good stuff in the pile of crap?

Mine are:

- WBWL/Harry has a twin. They are typically just excuses for ridiculous amount of teenage "No one understand me" angst. Avoid at all costs.

- Bashing. I can respect not liking a character, and dark interpretations of a character can be fun, but don't try to convince me that Mrs Weasley is a hateful cow that keep pushing Harry to marry Ginny. That's just distasteful.

- Tomarry. It's simply too much.

- Grey!Harry in general. It's just so rarely well done. Often, as for WBWL, it's excuse for angst. I /have/ read a few good Grey!Harry fics, but those are all too rare and now I simply ignore them.

- ???

Been too long since I last wandered FFN for a good HP fic, to be honest. I'm missing tons, I'm sure...


** In no particular order:

- Atrocious orthography\\
- Names misspelled (Imperious Curse, Prewitt, etc.)\\
- I'm-Smarter-Than-Rowling-And-This-Is-Why-Canon-Is-Stupid -- fics (most commonly time travel)\\
- Needless bashing\\
- Teenagers outsmarting everything and everyone\\
- Compound names (Especially if they're extensive, a mouthful, and annoying. Sadly, they all are.)\\
- Nargles

Bashing/apologists. If your story is straight AU and the Weasleys are actually evil and Snape is secretly good, fine. But don't try to take cannon events and twist them.

** - Coherent summaries. I take them as a sample of the writing style of the fic inside. If you can classify your own story with a trope label (dark!Harry, pureblood!Hermione) then it's a hint the story will be tropey.

- Point of view. I prefer third person limited, past tense. The same tense format as the books. If a fic diverges from this format, it had better be good.

- Interesting premise or divergence point. If the first chapter is a rewrite of Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were proud to say they were perfectly normal, it's a red flag of a story veering hard into the stations of canon. How about starting where the actual plot begins? Eg, Lockhart's wand doesn't backfire, Snape doesn't get knocked out in the Shrieking Shack.

- Americanisms and anachronistic pop culture references, or Muggle pop culture included because the author likes it. I read one fix where Snape talked about listening to Aretha Franklin and Freddie Mercury and it was too weird. I could tell it was the author speaking, not the character.

- Elaborate translation guides for every single chapter. *$$Parseltongue speech$$*, /regular speech/, you know you've seen it. Fuck, it's eye cancer.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** ​

mine depends on the Genre?

In general -

Any story where a the authors prejudices, thoughts etc. bleed through and don't fit the story<looking at you for the love of magic. which i found OK outside that near end>. Any story that basically takes a characters negative faults to 11< spinal tap!> disliking a character, painting them in a negative view or even high lighting their bad sides can be well done. but yeah.. bashing for bashing sake. no. Though i am not the best writer? and am not a master of grammar? not even using spell check or something. and finally making a char so oc, why name it the char. While i love some twists on chars. If Luna becomes a dark evil slytherin with quirks hiding in raven claw? do your own OC

​

​

If smut-(yes i admit i read it) anything with the kids to young right out the door and hidden kinks/etc. as someone said before. Hidden mpreg, beast out the blue etc. I am a perverted bastard, but jesus. also writing that's horrible porn you can tell written by someone whose well. not experiencing it lol

** - Friendly Goblins

Some exceptions can apply, but not to the point where the character is pretty much sworn in to the Goblin nation and can get away with just about anything because Goblins run everything. They run a bank, not an all-in-one government building... and it's likely they don't care about Wizards no matter how long one can remember the name of one of them.

- Thrown in Azkaban

Unless the story has a /very/ good reason, I just can't accept Harry being tossed into it... especially when it's likely he's only going to get stronger when he gets out (likely for no reason beyond because the author said so...) also using the word Durzkaban can see me drop a story pretty quickly.

- Slash for Slashes sake

Not a huge fan of Slash/Yaoi/whatever you want to call them stories. If they're in the background and it's not shoved in my face every couple of sentences, fine... but sometimes it's like they're thrown in there just because the author thinks the characters are cute together.

- Snape/Student

I get that Alan Rickman made the guy likeable and everyone loves a "was really good all along" character, but I just can't see this guy actively dating anyone he's ever had to teach... or just about anyone else either. Sure throw a bone for him every once in a awhile with someone who can appreciate his Mastery of Potions, or is just weird enough to get past his personality flaws, but not a student he's old enough to be the father of.

- Entire chapter of buying cool stuff you'll likely never see again

Yes. Interesting. Fantastic. You've managed to write several thousand words of picking out clothes and other inane objects with insanely useful features nobody has ever had before. You've also managed to lose a reader if they haven't skipped that entire chapter (or skimmed it.)

Can't think of many others... but there's likely some more.

Linkffn(2829366) has several hilarious interpretations of some of the above stuff. Best part is that it was written in 06 and is still possible to find most of them still being applied in stories today.

** I have very low standards on the quality of fics (if a fic is really low quality, I'll probably drop it after a few chapters, though). However, while quality isn't a standard of mine when it comes to instant dismissal, there are other things that are.

- Bad grammar/spelling errors/etc.
- Mpreg. Stealth-mpreg (when it shows up in a story I've picked up without being marked from the start) will on top of this also make me really annoyed at the author.
- Creature fics (As in, the concept of "creature inheritance", not merely the presence of creatures in a fic).
- Fics with bad endings or with unresolved angst, if I am able to sense it. I have spoiled last chapters in fics in the past to make sure there isn't a bad ending before, and will continue to do so.
- Good guy/Death Eater (or Voldemort), main focus or not. Exceptions: Draco/anyone, main focus only if Draco has a clear redemption arc. Snape/any /female/ who isn't a student (past students are OK), except Minerva.
- Major ships which I avoid as main focus on top of what I already mentioned: any slash, any femslash, Hermione/Ron, Nymphadora/Remus, Lily/James.
- Romantic ships that involve more than 2 persons at the same time.
- Fics which portray SS as devil incarnate, or a saint. I'd rather him not have any presence at all if he's going to be put into an extreme.
- Soulbonds interfering with romantic ships. I don't mind the concept of "compatible magic affinities" or similar shenanigans, as long as it isn't interfering with their free will to choose who to love romantically.
- Manipulative!Dumbledore that deliberately sacrificed the Potters. While I dislike it in general, only this particular choice generally results in an instant drop.
- Unhappy oneshots.

Beyond this, I mostly choose what to read or not on pure whim. One story that I might have utterly avoided and scrolled past one day might get a proper look another day.

My proper preferences are larger than this, but these are the main ones that results in instant drops when not followed. For example, I don't like bashing, but given how unfortunately common it is, it isn't an instant drop.

Romance. The vast majority of fan fiction that is romance centric is utter garbage. Those few that aren't are still romance, which isn't a genre I enjoy.
