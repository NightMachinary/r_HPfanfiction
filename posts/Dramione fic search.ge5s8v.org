  Draco Malfoy has a mission to complete, and no one can help him. Spending nights stuck on Prefect duty with Hermione Granger only adds to his problems. Doesn't it? Or is it possible that their unlikely relationship could alter the course of the Second Wizarding War -- if the Boy Who Made All the Wrong Choices can get this one thing right?Come for the medium-burn Dramione, stay for Magical lore and new twists on the canon we love (and love to change)COMPLETE!
