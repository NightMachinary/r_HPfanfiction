I'm super duper interested in hearing what you folk are up to.

Myself I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]] and I'm writing two fics right now.

My first fic ever will be novel-length and have it's first 40k-ish words released in a couple months.

General Info:

- Hufflepuff Harry
- Mentor Quirrell
- Darker/gorier from the start
- Neville is BWL
- OP Harry at the end which leads on to the sequels :D

Est. 100k words.

Second fic I'm planning will be a chapter by chapter release (episodic) of the Department of Mysteries kinda like CSI or something. I'm planning the characters and "missions" right now. It could turn out into something interesting if I do it right.


** Reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] - an awesome story in both action and characterization that I'd deferred reading until recently because it was over-hyped. I have a defiance-of-expectations thing. It's a real problem for me in many ways.

Writing [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10932567/1/Holly-Polter][Holly Polter]] - yet another opportunity for me to write about sex, opinions on canon, insights into life and the occasional attempt at an emotionally-charged scene. Almost has a working plot now, which is good since I'm over a third of the way through the alphabet.

** Currently reading:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince Of The Dark Kingdom]], a complete AU retelling of the series if Voldemort has won. Definitely the best of its kind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][Merging]], I don't know how I feel about this. It's like a 3/5 for me. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, but there are so many cliches. It just /feels/ bland to me. It's fun to read, but if you asked me to differentiate it from the twenty thousand other 5th year divergent HP indie stories, I probably couldn't do it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That was Promise]] is one I really like. Definitely the best GoT/HP crossover out there. I've only found one other that was decent, and it was pretty Hermione centric (which I'm not a fan of). If only the writer could grace us with another chapter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]]. So, I've got a secret. I'm a sap for stupidly forced romance sometimes. Soul bond stories? Marriage contracts? Sign me up. 99.99% of them are terrible, but once in a while you come across something that isn't total shit. That is this fic (and every other written by the author, because he/she writes the same story over and over again). The writing is technically sound, the plot is overdone, and I just keep reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10170838/1/The-Counterfeit-Cousin][The Counterfeit Cousin]] is an interesting take on what would happen if Tom Riddle raised Harry. It's in its early stages yet, but my attention has been caught.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] is a fic that I see that has the best potential out of all the fics I've seen in the last year or so. It has my favorite ship (Harry/Fleur), an interesting take on a powerful Harry, and fantastic writing. Now if only Anasazi could quit her job and just update this fic every couple days. You know. Because I want more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10925258/1/The-Next-Great-Adventure][The Next Great Adventure]] is like most of Taures other fics. Full of potential with a solid grounding, that will probably sputter out around five chapters in. I'm hoping for more, but my hope isn't that high.

** I am currently reading [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][Crazy Little Things]]. It's my first Luna/Hermione fic and I must say I'm enjoying it. I feel like it shows off Luna's Ravenclaw side while still keeping her the Luna we all love.

And I'm writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll Be the Death of Me]]. It's Neville/OC, the OC being the twin sister of Draco, and it takes place 6th year after the whole ministry ordeal. It's been my WIP for over a year now and it's currently over 300,000 words.

The fic you mentioned in the post sounds really interesting. I've never read anything with Harry as a Hufflepuff.

Thank you! I've spent the last four weeks organizing my notes alone (I had 100+ double-sided pages jotted on...).

I first wanted a single book with no sequel, but that would end up being a dense 300,000 words or more for the amount of notes I had to expand on and fit in. Instead I decided on a four books covering seven years and a big war :/

It's pretty fun with Hufflepuff, I get to play around with new characters and develop them however I want. Not to mention how fun it can be to write Prof Sprout :D

I've also got a really, really interesting idea for magic and how it came to exist and why some people are muggles and other's are magical. I don't know what I was smoking when I thought it up, but I should get some more :P

The writing style is quite verbose, or at least employs a very large vocabulary. Probably one of the only fics I've read where I don't know some words being used. Maybe because of this the writing style is a bit awkward, but it is okay. Good story so far.

** I'm working my way through everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]; an author who is firmly canon-compliant. Took me a while to get into that as normally I love a bit of AU; but starting on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], a muggle woman's view of befriending adult!Ginny and Harry, I got really into this author's writing.

It's rare that I read an author that makes me like the canon pairings and further, has no slash pairings (since to me, canon was crying out for certain ones). I really love, though, this author's portrayal of HarryxGinny, a very convincing volatile RonxHermione, competent! adult Lavender Brown, and muggle OC Bobbie Beadle who the gang encounter as adults. I'd reccommend Strangers as a way in, it gets the British setting down really well too.

Other ongoings for me; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] (which I hope updates soon), avidbeader's AU [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]] featuring an institutionalised Harry and Hermione, and White Squirrel's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] (which is worth bearing with the super!Harry-sounding premise, it's really well-written).

** Reading "Vox Corporis" right now. Nearly finished with all 68 chapters of it and I kinda dread coming to an end. It is a fantastic read.

Currently writing a fanfic with an OC.

General Info:

- Protagonists name is Aurelius Lander. Grandson of a wizard grandfather and a communist grandmother who fled from Germany to Argentina to evade getting killed by Grindelwald /the Gestapo. Mother and Father are magical. Former student of the Macchu Picchu Academy of Magery with a major in Demonology and Godkin Lore / Mythology.
- He wants to go to the moon and maybe even further - studies magical engineering in Valhalla to do so
- Gets introduced to Hermione Granger who studies there as well. She helps him with the theoretical part of his work.
- Mostly about his ambitions and project, his failures and breakthroughs, with a bit of romance here and there.

Est. 70 - 150k words, I currently translate the first 10 chapters from german to english in order to cater to a broader audience. Should've written the damn thing in english in the first place.

Basically it'll be novel length, following the marauders from 7th year, up until halloween 1981. The focus will be how relationships change during a war time. I take a lot of inspiration from my recent experiences during war time. It's also Remus/Sirius based. So far it's a very cathartic experience for me, but also really fun to write.

*** I love Identity as well! Me too though; it's probably one of the very, very few, if not the only straight!Remus and straight!Sirius stories I like. I'm still mad at JK for going out of her way to say Sirius/Remus wasn't and couldn't possibly be canon. I think it helps that Sirius and Remus are both paired with likeable and unique characters. I had to stop reading a fic recently because it had Remus as a chronic womaniser and kept dropping in references to his womanising ways almost every few sentences.

*** I follow Jules on Tumblr. She's still writing, so it hasn't been abandoned yet. She said she was going to update back in November or something, but then never got around to it. Currently, she's going through a friend break-up or something (her life is very dramatic), but I have faith that it will be soon. Honestly, it's almost worth it for the heartache. It's pretty much the story that started the James/Lily tropes that are so common, but it's never been done quite as well. That being said, though, I first read the story over two years ago, and there has only been two chapters since I started.

** Just got through with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/][Catechism]] which is like the most disturbing abused!Harry fict I have read...and liked. It's so dark and deep and the psychology is very well done. My only beef is the muggle brought in on the last posted chapter. I don't mind him being there but it's done in a bit of a hamfisted way.

Writing: most if not all what I write is slash BUT I am brainstorming a fict where Tom Riddle and Lucius Malfoy are muggle and went to a performing arts school and start a band together. Bromance with canon romance [Lucius and Narcissa have Draco, Bellatrix is the crazy groupie, etc...] Also I am working on a fict where Lily Potter is death eater and kills James. so...yeah.

**** Well it's tied into a current story that I am doing where merope didn't die and not only manage to get Tom out of the orphanage but marry Eileen, Severus mother as well. Naturally this is set so Tom is only a few months older than Lucius so it really alters the timeline. Once I finish the second story I can work on Death Eater!Lily. :)

** Quite late to this post since I didn't know this place existed. Although I figured it would be fun to post here.

The general idea of the story is Harry grows up in the Dursley household, but Vernon is a much firmer motivator for Harry in his early life. Most fanfiction makes the Dursleys abusive or apathetic towards Harry, and in turn usually just bash them(For good reason, they weren't that great in the actual series).

I decided to change things up. Vernon ends up pushing Harry in his youth beyond what is expected of him. Sometimes this can come off as abusive, and spiteful much like his original character. But ultimately it serves to make Harry stronger. These are things that Vernon could never do to his own blood, or Petunia's own son. However these are things that he has no qualms about doing towards Harry.

So he pushes Harry. In turn by the time Harry comes around to being in the wizarding world he has a very different outlook on life and a very different work ethic than other kids his age. He is incredibly focused and driven, but also willing to go through great pain in order to achieve his goals.

Now I don't know where the end game of this story will lead. I don't know what the ultimate plot is going to look like. I simply felt that a lot of fanfiction out there create this magically driven and ambitious kid out of Harry Potter(or whomever) without any inclination as to how their work ethic was established in the first place. The character is just motivated because the author says so.

I also felt that in fanfiction authors love living in this fantasy realm that doesn't equate with real life where our hero is able to coast by with victory after victory without any loss or pain along the way. Yet the truth is that for anyone to be successful, you have to work at your craft every day, and some days you will be beaten down, but you have to get up again if you want to succeed.

I feel these themes aren't shown very well. And in other cases they can be outright ignored because Harry is "The Chosen One." So hopefully I can make an adequate story out of this :)
