It sounds like fun and I've never actually come across one before. Any recommendations you could make?


** Not exactly a fem!Snape, but [[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/][The Fire and the Rose]] is a Snape/Hermione body swap that has lots of the story from body-swapped Snapes perspective. It is a very very good story, and I highly recommend.

*** Oooooh, awesome! It's hard to find Snanger (or is it Grape) stories with original plots anymore...

That's what happens when I've been reading fanfiction constantly since like 2006 hahaha.

**** There's quite a few good ones on WitchFics (the site where Fire and the Rose is hosted) if you haven't been there already. Though, the site seems to be abandoned so don't hold your breath for updates.

*** I was about to suggest the same story. It's hilarious. I can't say much for the sequel though.

** I think there's one called Harry Potter and the Distaff Side... Its an in progress/hiatus story where Harry is transported to a Genderswap/roleswap AU. Really good read, i thought, but not finished. Check FFN.net and Fanficauthors. net
