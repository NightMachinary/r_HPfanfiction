Hermione in Slytherin. Quite interesting, the author updates somewhat regularly as well.

And yes, I am also following the other two recommended ones!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]]

It is sort of a crossover with Ender's Game. Hogwarts is like Battle School. But I think it will be enjoyable even if you haven't read Ender's Game. Harry is awesome, but not too awesome. Like he can do cool stuff, but still faces a lot of challenges, and his dynamic with Hermione is really cool since they are the smartest people in their year. Harry's in Slytherin while Hermione's in Gryffindor. It just keeps getting more cool as it goes on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]]

It is a Harry Potter and Avatar: The Last Airbender/Legend of Korra crossover. Hogwarts is in the United Republic about 100 years after The Legend of Korra.

**** They both have a few spelling or word errors here and there, but nothing so frequent or pervasive as to detract from the reading experience. I would give them a try. None of the dialogue seemed awkward or anything to me.

*** I love the Last Avatar in that vein there is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8647382/1/Missing-Magic][Missing Magic]] Everybody thinks Harry is magicless but is in reality a bender. Not quite as well written but still a fun read. I'm also reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9772943/1/The-Spell-of-Sealing][The Spell of Sealing]]

  AU, based on info from Pottermore. If Remus were the only one of the Marauders left, charged by Lily to keep Harry safe and happy and free, would he be willing to do the otherwise unthinkable to fulfill her wishes?

**** The way Alex is shown to think really captures the sort of naivety you might get from a precious 11-year old (though perhaps undershoots the age a little) and the descriptions of the magic theory are great. But there are a few odd things and you're too right - it gets really dark, really quickly.

** In addition to ones already mentioned:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][The Song of the Trees]] by Tinn Tam; 215k words, slooow to update (but updated last Dec.) It's elegantly written (particularly so for a non-native speaker) and original, with scenes that could be in an art house film.

#+begin_quote
  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9646669/1/The-Firebird-s-Song-Book-II-of-the-Firebird-Saga][The Firebird Saga]] by Darth Marrs. Nearing the end of novel two of three, one of the most extreme HP AUs extant. DM updates every Saturday, so even if his storytelling isn't top shelf, he's dependable for providing a steady diet of prose.

#+begin_quote
  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper]] by Watermage. One of the best HP/Dresden Files crossovers still updating; 190k words.

#+begin_quote
  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.
