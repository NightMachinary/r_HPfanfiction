:END:
Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me remember the name of this fic. What I remember (if I'm correct) is that Snape is teaching a muggle class during the summer. For whatever reason Harry, Hermione, and Ron help him prepare. It's discovered that Harry is abused. During the summer Snape rescues Harry from the Dursley's. Harry goes with Snape but is mute now. I believe he goes to Snape's muggle class with him. Does anyone know this fic? Thanks in advance!


** There's a typo in your title.

He isn't The Shape AKA Michael Myers from the /Halloween/ franchise --- or is he?

*Cue the /Halloween/ theme*
