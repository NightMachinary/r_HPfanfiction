I'm a casual reader, and I've never before been moved to post a recommendation here, but I just had to for this fic. I'm blind, and today I ran into this

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes]]

which I must say is very very very well done from a realistic perspective. It's a Blind Harry fic and take it from the perspective from someone who's themselves blind, the author knows what they're doing. Harry doesn't suddenly become Daredevil just because he's blind like in that other Blind Harry fic, Blindness I think it was called, but instead he struggles with issues that are common for someone that'd find themselves in his shoes.

I can't fully empathise with his blight of suddenly becoming blind mainly because I've been born blind, but his other challenges such as navigating around are realistic ones that thousands of blind kids have to go through with, and even myself when I was taking Orientation and Mobility years ago when I was younger than Harry at the moment. The author knows all the right terminology related to materials and technology regarding blind folks, and even the British regulations surrounding how to get a train ticket as someone who's blind, that I wonder where they get their info from.

I'm about 30 chapters along and I can't wait to see where the author takes this story.

Scrolling back with my screen reader I realise I repeat the word "blind" too much. Sorry for that. And also his staff is epic. I wish mine was as cool as it üòÇ Give the story a try! üëç


** Thanks so much for the rec! I'm always really interested, when I see fics that explore different perspectives like this recommended by people who can confirm it's well done and true to life. Have there been any other fics like this that you've found treat the subject of blindness well? Even with a character that's not the main character?

I get excited when I see fics that treat specific subjects that I have personal experience in well because I feel like there's a little bridge between me and the fic author, like we might have something in common, and I can engage more with the work.

*** Totally agreed on the point about the connection to an author, and no to the question about well-done fics. This is the only fic that I've found that is actually going about telling a realistic story about blindness. That fic where Harry grows to be a Super Saiyan Magical Daredevil in that fic called Blindness is a joke, it's got nothing to do with blindness.

I do take recommendations though to any such fics you think are written well, I'd be happy to check them out :)

**** As soon as you mentioned that other fic, Blindness, it reminded me of a blind youtuber expressing frustration that everyone thought her gradual blindness would cause her other senses to become more powerful. It's great how fanfic builds bridges between experiences.

One fanfic I was recommended by an Asian lesbian friend of mine was linkao3(1243798) and I really enjoyed it. It's well written and cute but made me think about being lesbian and Asian while dating.

**** The blind main character does basically become Daredevil in this, so not sure if you'll like it or not.

But I've been enjoying this Naruto HP crossover called Out For Blood where the main character, who is an Uchiha OC, becomes blind after someone steals their eyes. Like 1-2 chapters later they learn to sense nature chakra and use that in a way similar to Daredevil, so probably not a great representation of the struggle real blind people go through. But the fic is still pretty enjoyable imo. After the eye thing happens they flee Kohona and end up in magical Britain and attend Hogwarts the same year as Harry.

** To be fair, the name ‚ÄúBlindness‚Äù in the other fic you mentioned is a bit of a misnomer, since at no point in it is Harry actually ‚ÄúBlind‚Äù. So if you go into it looking for an actual blind Harry fic you'll be disappointed, but i think it's still a great story. That said, glad you found a fic that was more along the lines of what you were looking for.

*** You're welcome! As I pointed out in the post I can't fully empathise with Harry since I'm born this way and have gotten used to it, but the stuff like having trouble eating liquid foods are real concerns for newly-blinded people, and even myself as a child while getting used to my reality. Everything he experiences are valid concerns, and even his fears are spot on as what I'd imagine to have a newly-blinded person, a kid at that, and I know plenty of people who've went blind later on in life who feel the same way. Same as Harry, I don't like being pulled-along or rough-handled either! I don't know where you get your info from, but kudos to you for doing it right. Do you know someone who's blind?

**** Thank you so much for your kind comments! It is a huge relief to hear that what I've written resonates with your experiences. I have met a few people with visual impairments and made friends with more since I started writing this fic. I just did a ton of research and also took advice from readers as they commented. I'm currently working with someone who is going to help me with the portrayal of the deaf and deaf/blind experience.

I am open to feedback and suggestions, too. So if you see anything that you think I should change, I definitely want to hear it.

Anywho - I was just browsing through reddit today and never expected to find a recommendation of my story... it truly made my day and it was all I could do to contain my excitement. Thank you!

BrailleErin gave me invaluable advice as I wrote Basilisk Eyes and we started collaborating on a third story in her series. The collaboration is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22106113][Harry Potter and the Forgotten Lady]] and it takes place in Harry's fifth year. He's back at Hogwarts; he weathered the Dementor attack as well as the inquisition at the Ministry of Magic, and he's noticed that something is happening to muggleborns... he and his friends are determined to figure out what is going on.
