It seems that everybody is under the impression that a persons Hogwarts letter comes on their eleventh birthday. On PS Harry gets his first letter about a week before his birthday and more and more in the following days. He finally learns he is a wizard on his birthday in the shack on the rock.

It comes up in so many fics that Harry gets the fisrt letter on his birthday or that the reason Hermione knows so much is that she had most of the year to study because her birthday is earlier in the year.

If letters were sent on a students birthday then Harry would be given a day to reply and anyone born in August would have no time at all because Hogwarts awaits your owl by no latter than July 31st.

It often comes up as a plot point fir how stupid wizards are and I think it needed clarifying.


** It's weird would a person who turns 11 in the first week of September after hogwarts start have to wait

*** Hermione's birthday is, IIRC, in mid September, and she turns 12 shortly after starting Hogwarts.

**** September 19th, specifically. Hermione Granger was born on International Talk Like a Pirate Day.

It seems like there should be a crackfic about that somewhere, but I've never seen one.

***** Hmmmmmm.... Arithmancy, numbers have power. So according to bullshit logic, so that extends to dates having power too.

In a ritual where they use the squid to keel-haul Snape on a pirate ship they magically declare themselves pirates. Then, they politically solve all of their problems with pirate laws. Which are still accepted by pureblood society. Because archaic laws have to work out for the protagonists once in a while.

â€‹

Book 5 when the death eaters show up after the prophecy was picked up. Hermione shouts "PARLAY!" and the death eaters ignore it. They broke the pirate code, so an eldritch portal appears and a tentacle grabs them and sucks back into the portal.

*** Southern United States schooling uses September 1st as a hard cut off line. Kids born on August 31 are the youngest in our classes. If they are born after September 1st, they must wait until the next year. I know in more northern states, it's a later cut off, because they start later than us, but same concept. Applies to the Wizarding World as well, apparently.

** I think all the Hogwarts letters come around mid July as long as the child is 11 or will be 11 before 1 September

Harry just got his on his birthday

Schools (at least here in Australia) have cut off dates, usually 30 June

My nephew is 30 June and went at 4.5 years. My daughter is 10 June and went at 5.5 years

*** This makes the most sense.

Here in America all the cutoff dates fluctuate, even in counties throughout the states (which is dumb imo). For example, in pre-school I had two friends born in December and November respectively. I was born on August 5th. The cut-off to "graduate" pre-school was August 15th. Therefore, I left them behind even though we started together and were at the same level. I graduated highschool in 2018 as one of the youngest in my class while they graduated highschool in 2018 as some of the oldest in their class.

Cut off was 30 April and my birthday is 27 April

***** Imo, if you are intellectually able to move forward then you should, no matter if you're the youngest in class or oldest. My mom's ex was born in plenty of time to graduate at the age you were supposed to, but he was socially inept as a child (still is tbh) and they held him back a year before kindergarten to help him out.

** Harry's getting his letter on his birthday was pure coincidence. It was supposed to have arrived earlier but for Dursleys interference.

The actual reason he got it on his birthday is because he needed to confirm his school registration and that was literally the last day. Remember Harry's first question after reading his letter? "What does it mean, await my owl?" Hagrid immediately pulled an owl out of his coat and sent it off.

Granted, I assume an exception would've been made if Hagrid was delayed. But at that point Dumbledore was trying to keep things as normal as possible.

** This has honestly been a pet peeve of mine for years, I swear, the letters come in mid-July. Not on the students' birthdays, because if they did that, muggleborns born on August 31st would be SO screwed for that year. It's just a coincidence that Harry's letters came around his birthday.
