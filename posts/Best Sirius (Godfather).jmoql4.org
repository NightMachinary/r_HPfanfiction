I've had an itch for the comfort fics and some of the best I know is where Harry goes to live with Sirius. So can you recommend some good godfather Sirius fics.


** A Marauder's Plan is one of my favorites - it's extremely long, but very well written.

*** I'll second the recommendation, but to expand: Sirius accidentally escapes Azkaban five years earlier than canon, and since he doesn't have any leads on Peter this time, he instead goes to check on Harry. And finds him unhappy with the Dursleys, and offers him another home. Cue a massive uproar throughout the wizarding world; not only has Sirius Black escaped, but he's kidnapped Harry Potter, no doubt to perform some dark ritual for his master!

Lots of really good characterisation of Sirius, Remus, Tonks, eight-year-old Harry, and even Severus. It's really sweet to see Harry getting a childhood and a caring parental figure, albeit one who's often immature and has had his head knocked around by Azkaban. Sirius still does his best for James' son.

  Nope, nope, not doing this again. With a little help from a sentient Hogwarts, Harry and Sirius destroy Voldemort and decide that they can have the childhood they both deserve. Remus as an Uncle? Why not? But how? And who is who's father?

** Harry Potter and the Unexpected Dogfather

But... that's part two of a Daphne series, and you should read book one. Which is Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend.

I think it stops there. On a goddamned cliff hanger. In fact I came here to post looking for part 3. :(

** Mild bashing, and a very OP Sirius, but linkffn(A Bond of Family) is really good imo. Warning, it's only the main part in the series, so you should check the authors' profile to get the timeline.

  After the holidays Harry returns to Hogwarts, but this time he's not alone. Follow Sirius and Remus as they put their own personal stamp on the castle and every resident in it as teachers.
