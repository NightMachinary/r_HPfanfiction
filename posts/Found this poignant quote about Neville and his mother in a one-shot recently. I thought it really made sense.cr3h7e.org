  "I went to see my parents", he mumbled rubbing the back of his neck. He still felt uncomfortable talking about his parents and their conditions no matter how many years passed. "Today's their wedding anniversary and I thought it would be a good time to visit them even if they don't remember it ... or me."

  "They remember you, Neville. Your mum knows you're someone special that's why she gives you those gifts every time you visit", she replied squeezing Neville's hands. "Not even wrackspurts, nargles, or curses can make your parents completely forget who you are. They'll always know you're their son that they love".

Source, for anyone who's interested, is an incredibly short one-shot called "Gaudeo" by thekinglystar


** I'm sorry, but I read wrackspurts and nargles and I cannot help but feel let down already.

*** I don't know why but your comment reminded me of something that Robin Williams once said on the Graham Norton Show -

"Let him have his dreams. Don't you screw up his dreams! His feet are big too, let him dream!"

This YouTube clip provides the context - it's pretty hilarious and yet a weirdly appropriate reply to your comment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

God, I miss Robin so much.

** I don't really see what's poignant about this excerpt specifically. It's touching, certainly but I don't feel it reveals anything we didn't already know. All it's done is make subtext into text.

*** So, this is the original text -

#+begin_quote
  â€˜They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on. â€˜Highly gifted, the pair of them. I--yes, Alice dear, what is it?'

  Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.

  â€˜Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. â€˜Very well, Alice dear, very well-- Neville, take it, whatever it is. â€˜

  But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper.

  â€˜Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.

  But Neville said quietly, â€˜Thanks, Mum. â€˜

  His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life.

  â€˜Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs. Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. â€˜Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now. â€˜

  But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.

So, what I understood from this was that Augusta was simply going along with what was supposedly Alice's madness, and Neville fiercely holding on to that single tenuous connection with his mother.

The quote I mentioned in my post however points to the possibility that Alice still knows somewhere in the depths of her curse-addled brain that Neville is her son.

I'm glad you caught on that subtext - I, however, never realized that there actually was one
