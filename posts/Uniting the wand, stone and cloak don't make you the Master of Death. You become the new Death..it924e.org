Think of it as being like the Santa Clause, you wear the jacket you become the next Santa, instead you become the new death and have to start collecting the souls of the damned.

********* Depends on the book, really. There are some bestiaries (guides to creatures) out there, but he did write a lot of actual stories and actual books of said stories exist. Though I admit, as I only know English, I can't speak for what books might exist in other languages.

The stories themselves were originally published in magasines back in the day, so they're all pretty short. Novellas, I think is the term. Most books you'll find with actual stories tend to be large compilations of those stories, so they tend to be quite bulky and quite expensive. A personal favourite and the one I recommend most often is the 'Necronomicon: The Best Weird Tales of HP Lovecraft' and that's around £20 for a hard-cover, £10 for a paperback, and £2 for a MOBI (on Amazon). It doesn't have all his stories, but it has a lot of the best ones - even one co-written with Harry Houdini, the escapologist. :)

Speaking of, there were also many other people that contributed to the mythos, too. Robert Chalmers, as an example, invented whole extra swathes of Eldritch Creatures and wrote stories including them - Hastur, King in Yellow was one of his (aka 'He Who Must Not Be Named' - another similarity to Harry Potter. :D). If you do a little googling, you can probably find some of their books as well.
