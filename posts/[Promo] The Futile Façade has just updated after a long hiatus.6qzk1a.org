Book 4 in The Pureblood Pretense saga: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11911497/]]

Even though the description sounds rather unorthodox, the writing is great. Would recommend.

** Just saw the email alert. Can't wait to read the new chapter later. Hopefully the next one doesn't take as long, but it sounds like a lot of the delay was job related so further chapters will probably also take a while :(.
