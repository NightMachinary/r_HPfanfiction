I read bit completed fics and caught up on the third in 2 weeks and it was soooooo good! I can't believe I waited so long start it.

Does anyone have any similar fics to recommend?


** Have you read DrizzleWizzle's series? I know the plot is quite different (it's a Slytherin Harry fic), but it's quality is on par with White Squirrel, in fact I would go so far as to say that his rewrite of the 5th book is better than the Archimedes series, but that could be a matter of taste! Basically, long story short - if you want a similarly well written story that improves on canon realistically, definitely check the DrizzleWizzle series :))

** The other shorter fics of White Squirrel are also quite good.

Personally my second favorite long story is linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7).

If you want more badass Hermione, I recommend Starfox5's stories, especially linkffn(Divided and Entwined) or linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** No spoilers, but it gets even more epic.

Great use of foreshadowing and the skillbuilding is fantastic. There shouldn't be a point where badass!Hermione throws out something that you never know she could do because the pieces of the jigsaw are all already laid out well in advance.

Really? o.O

Personally I feel /Annals/ is just as important to the series as the first two. I love that WS didn't just let things drop after the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. It feels like many authors think "Oh, the war's ended, someone won; end of story" or "War's over; fast forward to main character death after they've lived a long and happy life". However, there's this long period in the middle there that it seems many authors tend to ignore - sure, someone won, but how does society rebuild? How do people move on? How do people deal with PTSD, with trying to live normal lives again? The end of the war is the end of one story, but more often it symbolizes the start of another that far too few bother to explore, and is something I sorely feel is missing in general fanfiction. /Annals/ filled perfectly a hole I wanted filled :)

Then again, I can certainly see how it isn't as exciting to others!

*** linkffn(9863146) is finished, but it goes only up to the end of the fourth year (and it is very good). There is small few chapters long finished linkffn(12076644), and the sequel to the first one is truly WIP linkffn(12088294), which starts after the first one and starts to the really nice and wild start. Muggles at Hogwarts!

***** I like both. Animagus has IMHO some problematic empty parts (like authors was thinking how to continue and tried different attempts), but some parts are extremely good (mostly those which are not writing into the canon story: beginning or the third year with werewolves). I wrote [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][a complete review of the series]] (and some other stuff).
