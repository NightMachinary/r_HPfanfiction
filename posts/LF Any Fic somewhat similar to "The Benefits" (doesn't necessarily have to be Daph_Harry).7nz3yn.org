linkffn(9606120) Doesn't have to be Daph, but please, NO HERMIONE or Slash. And what i mean by similiar is, Somehow Harry gets a girl pregnant or get a child from somewhere and starts to raise the baby while in school. I've read a few like this but haven't searched for it. One i remember I quite liked was "A child to lead him" or something with a title somewhat like that.

Thanks anyways.
