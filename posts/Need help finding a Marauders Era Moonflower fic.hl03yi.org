:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's the first in a series, and the premise is Lily, Remus, ten cats and a guy I can't remember the name of. It starts out with Remus showing up at Lily's house with the question:

"Why do you need chloroform at 3am?"

The line is actually one from a list of prompts that show up in the fic. Such as:

"She [did something] and ate all my cereal!"

"Quick! Grab that cat! It stole my wallet!"

"I feel like I got hit by a car... Wait, I did? And it was your car?"

"Why do you need chloroform at 3am?"

So it turns out the Lily found ten cats and they're trying to lead her somewhere bc they escaped from there and want her to free the rest of them. Lily and Remus get lead to this guy who turns out to be Lily's brother. He trys to do /something/ to them and they get away. Remus leaps off a building. And then accidentally runs Lily over while trying to hit the dude. I don't remember anything else really.
