He adopts/takes guardianship of Harry and I remember he confronted his family about how they treated his mother. Then he finds out his mom was/is being kept secret but she's very sick or something.


** Possibly "Reboot"; linkffn(9552519). Snape and his mother meet up with her parents a couple times; the reason she hastily married Tobias Snape had to do with an extremely squicky marriage contract they were trying to pressure her into. Severus does not approve and Takes Steps. As for his relationship with Harry, it's more of a favored uncle, although I believe he does become a backup magical guardian for him.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
