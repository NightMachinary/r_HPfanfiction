** "The Seventh Horcrux" linkffn(10677106)

#+begin_quote
  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying."

  I would like to reiterate the horror that was Ginevra Weasley attempting to speak Parseltongue. The Basilisk silently accepted this butchery of the language, returning to an empty corner where it curled into a ball.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
