What does it like actually do? It's used in SO MANY SITUATIONS in fanfics yet we've only seen it like once or twice in the books

Those sirius/harry mirrors PROTEAN CHARM

Any piece of jewelry that will alert another of them being in danger PROTEAN CHARM

how to make an animated painting? MODIFIED PROTEAN CHARM

I've seen this charm talked about and used SO much in fics and in such diverse situations. It's like ”hmm idk what charm would do this..” ”eh duck it MODIFIED PROTEAN CHARM”


** Protean Charm links objects to each other so that when one changes all of them would.

It was used in canon by Hermione on DA coins. Harry would transfigure his coin to show the date of the meeting and every other coin would change to show it.

So it can be used as a way to alert others of danger if one transfigures it to show SOS or something.

*** Ok that makes sense, so why tf does everyone use ”modified protean charms” for everything in fics? Are the writers just lazy or is it because they don't know what it does?

***** But how tf does one charm do so many things even if modified, and besides, if it's modified then It's not even a protean charm anymore

******* Well of course it depends on the size of the modification. But you cant honestly call it the same charm if you've changed the whole composition of the spell and the function of it completely

This is probably the only legit usage here. It links a bunch of things together: Hermione's coins, whatever Draco used to alert Crabbe and Goyle, and probably the Dark Mark where Hermione got the inspiration from.

  bk5 ch19 para4: “You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. “On real Galleons that's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you're carrying them in a pocket you'll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he'll change the numbers on his coin, and because I've put a Protean Charm on them, they'll all change to mimic his.”

  bk5 ch19 para14-17: “You know what these remind me of?” / "No, what's that?"/ “The Death Eaters' scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they've got to join him.” / “Well ... yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That is where I got the idea ... but you'll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members' skin. ...”

There is no sign in canon that the dark mark actually is a protean charm, it just gave Hermione the idea to do something to establish a magical communication from one person to many.

*/Definition of protean:/*

1 *:* of or resembling Proteus in having a varied nature or ability to assume different forms 2 *:* displaying great diversity or variety *:* [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/versatile][versatile]]

*/My interpretation:/*

The protean charm is used to make objects able to vary their form in accordance to a master pattern (Harry's coin). The shape-shifting seems to be pretty limited (Hermione's gelleons only go coin to coin with minor marking differences) , but considering Hermione is only a (very gifted) fifth year, we don't really know the extant of possibilities.

- For the mirrors, I don't think it make sense, because each mirror would need to mimic the other (show the other's reflection), so there is no Model/Replica dynamic here , plus there is the sound to transport...
- For the jewelry it seems possible. Danger-detection is already demonstrated in canon by the Weasley's clock. Imagine if the hands of the clocks heated up when hitting danger and you could wear protean form replicas of these clock hands as a pendant to get the danger info on every Weasley... just shuffle the idea a bit and you easily get to a pair of necklaces, one which does the danger-sensing/heating up and a replica.
- As far as I'm concerned, animated paintings have nothing to do with protean charms.

*** I got an idea on how protean charms could have something to do with animated paintings

You know that they can move from one portrait to another similar one right?

Example; Phineas Nigellus Black in the headmasters office and Grimmauld place

Well the connection between them could be a protean charm in some way?

The animation itself would have nothing to do with the protean charm
