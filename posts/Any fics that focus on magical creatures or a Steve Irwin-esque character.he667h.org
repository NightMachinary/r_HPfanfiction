So I've been watching a lot of nature documentaries, which renewed my love for all things animals and nature. Is there any fics with this premise?


** I mean, Newt from Fantastic Beasts is basically magic Steve Irwin

** If you are also a fan of Hermione or Snape or (ideally) both, corvusdraconis (many stories on AO3 and more on ff dot net) has a lot of fics that involve magical creatures. Start with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14750382]] Born Unto Darkness, 100k words, where Hermione is basically Steve Irwin, and try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17656049]] Eye of the Dragon, Hair of the Cat, 50k words, next. A much shorter one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21875080]] It's the Thought That Counts, 10k.

Many of the stories are not marked complete but I have found that all are functionally complete - you can read them and not feel cheated. They just don't mark them as complete because sometimes they update them if they feel inspired.

*** Ok, that last one was...really weird. Are his other works like that? I'd rather not invest in 100k words just to be blindsided by Hermione falling in love with her dog at the end. To the author's credit, though, it's a premise that I've never come across before.

**** They're almost all Hermione/Snape. Hermione never falls in love with an actual animal but she and/or Snape are often turned part-creature. Sometimes they actually spend some or all of the fic as all-creature. You might not be interested in the rest, then. They're pretty much pure crack.

** Crazy Little Things has a Luna that's probably the closest thing I've seen to the magical version of Steve Irwin that also deals strongly with magical creatures. Also has a Hermione-Luna pairing developed really well. :)
