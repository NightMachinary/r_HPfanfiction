I often see the same old tropes for Sirius, and it's gotten oh so tiring. (If anyone has any well stories, where he's written well and believable, let me know).

People seem to forget that Sirius is actually a very complex character, and was incredibly talented and skilled to boot.

He doesn't see Harry as James, he might see similarities of course, but he is aware that Harry isn't James.

Sirius was with the Marauders, they became an Animagus at a incredibly young age; which becoming an Animagus is suppose to be a super hard thing to do.

He survived Azkaban as a dog, where as most people would surely succumb to insanity.

His "pranks" are often rather cruel, he takes things too far, is too hot headed/brash.

But he's still incredibly smart, helping create the Marauders Map, becoming an Animagus, overcoming his parents prejudice, leaving his family, is very loyal to ones he cares about.

I also highly doubt that he was a womanizer, but yet so many people write him as one. If anything I'd say that he was a virgin before he was sent into Azkaban, he'd be the sort of person girls fall for, but the girls are afraid to go near.

I mean yeah, he put up those pictures of those women, but come on; he mostly did it to piss his mother off. (And maybe even being attracted to them, at that point and time; I mean heck, he was 14/15/16 when he did it, what straight male wouldn't be at that point?)

But yeah, for a lot of people it's easier to make him someone he's not, but is too often portrayed as, in fanfiction. It's sad, but I see it way too often.


** Worth noting, according to the Minister in POA, Sirius Black seemed to be totally fine in Azkaban. Not crazed or anything like that, having casually asked for a copy of the newspaper when Fudge visited. That said, once he saw Peter in the paper he became obsessed and focused soley on that, not to prove his innocence, but the commit the crime he was imprisoned for.

I am trying to keep this in mind as I write him in Linkffn(Wolf Lord)

** I don't claim to write him perfectly, but I think I do okay. Sirius is one of my favourite people to write because the bloke is an exercise in unreliable narration. I feel like this is something that isn't utilised that much in fics, and it saddens me because it's so much fun to play with how he see's or talks about something. I think you can attribute a lot of it to JKR and her rubbish maths, but for me, it's far more fun to think of Sirius seeing things in his own specific way and having tunnel vision about it. Some of it is also on purpose because he feels a certain way about it or it's just used to his own advantage. Sirius may be a Gryffindor, but he was raised in a house rooted in Slytherin and he's got some of those traits right in there. It's just that his impulsive behaviour tends to override his more manipulative behaviour. Not to mention he's a huge drama queen, but look at Number Twelve, this house breeds drama and Sirius did not escape that.

Some of the random things I enjoy looking into with him:

- Sirius says he's related to Bellatrix when pressed but she's not his family. This shows how Sirius has his own definitions of what he'd call family and by far my favourite thing to write. He refers to them only as a married couple in Azkaban and manages to insinuate they were friends with Snape at school despite never having crossed over with him, choosing to not reveal his own connection to her. An interesting side note is Bellatrix refers to him as the animagus Black while Andromeda remains her sister.

- Sirius is people smart, which I think is why Peter throws him as much as it does. Obviously what he did was heinous and Sirius has every right to feel distrought over the betrayal, but there's also that Sirius can usually predict Harry's behaviour quite well and judges others on their behaviour. It makes sense, he can't choose who he was born to but he can make his choices and wants to be judged by them.

- His idea of pranking is possibly also rooted in attitude to magic. We are talking about someone who grew up around blades, bottles of blood, things that are designed to kill you as utterly normalised. I think it makes sense his idea of a joke is warped, which doesn't at all excuse his behaviour but does inform it.

- Sirius' sense of loyalty is so immense. He instantly becomes nicer to Ron the moment he illustrates loyalty to Harry (which I wonder if Molly found out who broke her kids leg). He judges others upon it, which probably plays into his dislike of the adult Severus as much as his childhood perception. He's made a life of trading loyalties. The kicker of this? Sirius is a blood traitor. He left his family, the first loyalty most of us have and I think that act in a lot of ways illustrates a lot about the complexity of the character. Even Peter, when begging him not to kill him, appeals to his loyalty above anything else.

- Sirius' voice changing. He sounds considerably more formal in PoA than he does in GoF (compare "I, the spy?" to "What do you think you're playing at" which I'm paraphrasing but you get the point) and it makes some sense. If you look at Regulus' note, it's also rather formal so I've been thinking Sirius thinks in a more formal manner but chooses to speak in a less so way. My headcanon is he's picked up a bit of James' West Country as well, but by the time he's left Azkaban, he's mostly been listening to his own thoughts and has lost it. It takes being around people from his life for it to reappear.

- Sirius has spent his whole life being told what to do in one way or another. He's initially trapped in a family that he feels out of step with (I personally believe his blood beliefs came from Hogwarts so this was more of a personal thing), experiences true freedom of a sort at Hogwarts despite it being a school with a schedule and then he joins up with the Order. He has spent his entire life answering to someone else, from parents to the Order. I just find this interesting for a character so rooted in his own sense of freedom.

- Sirius does admit to Harry that he killed his parents, so every chance he actually did confess to it when asked. The Ministry should have given him a trial, of course, but by this point, Sirius considers his mistake such a misdeed that he does carry that guilt and perception.

- When Harry is trying to cast on him, Sirius tries to move Crookshanks out of the way. We also see a very strong bond with Buckbeak. Even in his lousy mood in OotP, he'll pet Crookshanks. Sirius has an extraordinary amount of love and compassion for those important to him, even animals. It's just that everyone else it can be seriously hit or miss.

- If we're going for dementors being depression inducing, the mental fog struggle is real. It messes with your perception of time, what you have or haven't done, stuff you absolutely know goes out of your head and it's incredibly upsetting. A good example is that Sirius attacks the dorm rooms in January in PoA two days after Scabbers disappears, but he admits in the confrontation in the shack that Crookshanks had told him that Scabbers had run off. I think that does speak to how his sense of memory must be screwed with, and that generally adds to his unreliable narration.

- Sirius is very much a Black. If you look at Sirius' explosions in the end of PoA, there's an uneasy echo to Walburga's portrait. He doesn't even want Peter to speak James' name in front of Harry. If you look at his conversation with the Weasley kids and earlier with Peter, he seems to think that dying while doing work for the Order is something they should accept. You die rather than betray who and what you believe in. That he chooses to say this when they don't know if Arthur will die or not is telling. It has a rather unfortunate echo of Bellatrix in her regard for Draco with Narcissa. I think it just again shows that Sirius is still impacted by his upbringing, which I think a lot of people can forget to incorporate.

If anyone has some recs that include the unreliable narration especially, please hit me up. It's my guilty pleasure.

Yes, but authors read stuff and review the things they read, if only to judge their own work. And if you read something which resonates with you, you will incorporate that. And if you read something you dislike, you might decide to write the exact opposite. I mean, a bunch of angsty Harry/Hermione Friends with Benefits are how I got the idea for "Bad at this", which is decidedly angst-free. I started writing "No Longer Alone" because there were no platonic Harry&Tonks stories. I like to shit on Snape because too many stories whitewash him IMO.

You can certainly influence what others think and write, just perhaps not in the direction you envisioned.

** HP fic Authors struggle with complex characters, they rarely have any depth at all. Typically characters are locked into whatever defining charcteristics mentioned in passing in canon, and even fanon.

Sirius is an immature prankster with a barking laugh who can't hear the word "serious" without making a name joke, Ron is a short-tempered glutton obsessed with chess, Hedvig is obsessively nipping at Harry's ears and fingers, and all owls are exclusively fed bacon. Dumbledore twinkles, Snape billows, Ginny throws Bat-Bogey hexes if you look at her the wrong way. Mad-Eye Moody shouts "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" every time he opens his mouth, and Voldemort is an insane sadist. Everybody's just a 2-dimensional caricature of themselves, which is a shame since they are so rich and complex in canon.

My tip to authors: Write down /at least/ 7-8 different characteristics for each character, and use them in inverse proportion to how well they're known.

Hedvig: One nip or flying headcuff per 100,000 words. The expression "furry little problem" may be used *once* in a story, the same goes for "twin speak" and "Gred/Forge". Dial back the twinkles, billows, sneers and smirks. If anyone calls Harry "prongslet", "cub" or "pup", I will find you and hurt you. Try to keep the pranking down to a dull roar. The twins are not allowed to kneel and say "we're not worthy" when they meet a Marauder, because that's been done to death.

I'm sure there's more.

** I don't really understand getting upset about this. I could see if a movie or derivative work mischaracterized him, sure, but this is fanfiction, written by fans to fantasize about a world they love. That kind of work doesn't owe anything to any reader because it wasn't written for you; its primary function is to do something for the person who wrote it. They're not getting paid to or tasked to deliver something to an audience, they just love a work and want to be creative and share and engage in wish fulfillment. A lot of fanfiction is written specifically because something the writer wanted isn't in the original work. Whether that's a relationship, a different character's perspective, a different interpretation of a character like Sirius, etc. Being personally upset that fanfic writers aren't upholding canon characterizations sorta misses the point. The beauty of fanfic is that you can find something you like, however niche, or even write your own story, but demanding all works fit neatly into the established mold undermines the whole purpose of fanfiction. I know it probably wasn't your explicit intent, but let's not try to limit the creative expression of others (even if we think their work sucks) just because it doesn't fit our idea of what fan work should be. Edit: for an apostrophe

** I think the main issue is that the popular avenues for Sirius are already covered (eg he does not go after Peter and raises Harry, he rescues Harry from the Dursleys). And although they are trope-y, removing the tropes wouldn't alter the story much. I mean, Sirius wouldn't be a very different adoptive partner if he brings home countless women or if he is monogamous (and most stories pair him with Amelia Bones or Marlene McKinnon either way). Getting rid of the prank fixation would improve a lot of stories, but not in a significant way.

I mean, I am writing a "Harry is adopted by the Tonks" story because there is pretty much nothing where he does NOT end up banging Nymphadora at some point. In some earlier versions that included Sirius, but I couldn't come up with something original for him. And a year later I haven't found anything new with him.

**** It's not dead. I was hoping to have published the next chapter already, but I originally planned to have an 3k chapter and I'm long past that. The biggest issue for the delay was the first chapter, which honestly sucked. It took me months to rewrite it and get rid of the walls of exposition and shade which was thrown around. I also made some tweaks to the Prague chapter after a holiday there.

**** Plenty of stories where Harry is adopted by Andromeda and it turns into a romance +later on+ as soon as it doesn't make Tonks look like a paedophile. De-aging is optional. And while I don't mind the general idea, I didn't find a single one where they develop a brother-sister like relationship, so I started to write one.

It turned out a lot more "slice of life" and slow-paced (82k for a summer and everything including the first task instead of being past the second one) than I originally envisioned, but at the same time it doesn't really include any scenes which I would consider unnecessary (and the Quidditch ones got very good feedback, so definitely not a waste).

** I totally agree. Sirius is protrayed in fanfics as dorky and not serious at all wheras in canon he is so focused : he is incredibly brillant at magic: his friendship with James and Lupin taught him to hate his family's pureblood mania : personnaly I don't think he started to be against his family from the first beginning ( everyone is influenced actually by their family esp children and teens ) but knowing James who is genuinely good and Lupin who was marginilized because of what he was even though he had nothing to do to change it made Sirius realise that you shouldn't think you are superior to people just because your are born pureblood. You see who the person is for real by seeing what they've grown to be and not by what they were born with. So Sirius' character is a lot deeper that people could think : the process of being a rebell agaisnt your family isn't easy and Sirius went through with belief and confidence. Sirius is like you said harsh sometimes and really dark. I want to see the sad frustrated Sirius at Azkaban sad for the death of his best of best friend.

I could see him being the sort of person who doesn't care what gender you are, as long as he finds you interesting/likable/attractive et cetra.

**** Yes, he's always seemed to me to be a man who, regardless of the terrible things that happened to him, was always comfortable in his own skin (skins). I have written him in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships without ever feeling that one contradicted the other. But I also think that the love of his life was only ever James, though I don't think they had a homosexual relationship. I don't believe anything else would have come close to that bond.
