Just finished reading linkffn(7405119) By: MSgt SilverDollar and Snake [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405119/1/A-Revelation]]. This is a very macho, male dominated story where Harry becomes super powerful. The style reminds me a little of Robert Heinlein (a poor man's version of RH without much subtlety or quality of writing). Nevertheless, I liked the first half of this story; the plot moved along nicely and Harry becoming badass and powerful was fun. The 2nd half really bogged down in lots of tedius details about how Harry will run the school and various military weapons and other irrelevant stuff. I skipped/skimmed almost all the 2nd half until about 92% when the plot picked up again and Harry takes down Voldemort and frees Merlin and becomes Super Duper Harry.

  REVISED AND UPDATED: NON CANON Features a super powered Harry with lots of money, titles and all that rot. Its meant to entertain those who like those stories and bash my least favorite JKR chars. Harmony all the way. Minor Revision: 7/12/14
