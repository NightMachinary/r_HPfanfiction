A bit ago I read “on a pale horse” really good fic and I wondered if there were anymore docs along the same lines


** How AU are we talking here? Because if you want Canon to be useless to you I'd recommend the Firebird Trilogy or the Wasteland Of Time pair.

Niether is quite the same kind of Anti Christ premise as ‘on a pale horse', if that's the fic I'm thinking of, but both are about as AU as any fic ever gets. The former completely redoes the whole magical world, where the later is a Groundhogs Day looping HP vs an Evil Overlord List abiding TR, taken to it's logical extreme.

I won't link either because I don't think either is what you really want, but I'd recommend that you put your request in the title of your request, and not the description; otherwise not all that maybe people will see it. Say something like ‘LF Anti-Christ!Harry fic's, similar to On A Pale Horse.'

** It's not exactly what you asked for - canon Harry is summoned to an AU universe, however the story very much still covers the lives of the other Harrys.\\
