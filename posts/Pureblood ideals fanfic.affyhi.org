Alright I really want to find a fanfic where Harry finds out about being the Potter Heir, at least, and learns about pureblood culture. Lots of fanfics good into pureblood culture but either do not explain it or show it as being evil. I want to read a fic where the reader learns about pureblood culture with Harry and it actually turns out to not be the evil thing it's made out to be. Preferably Harry could learn about this a ways into the actual books, having everything in cannon be the same up until a certain point such as fourth or fifth year. Also preferably dark!harry and manipulative!dumbledore. If someone does this or finds this pls no slash.


** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) Crosses of literally every box you're looking for, except for maybe the dark part. It focuses more on the war as a whole rather than Harry being a fighter.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Ell Roche's fics have a lot to do with pureblood culture. Not necessarily exactly what you're looking for, but always a fun read in my opinion.

** I made an account just to comment this because you would LOVE the Pureblood Pretense series. Actually my favorite HP fanfiction ever, I started reading the series when I was 12 (eight years ago) and have read every update since. linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

** Black Luminary has a lot of pureblood culture, but while Harry is part of it, pretty much all purebloods in that story are horrible human beings who would deserve a long prison sentence. No matter if light or dark.

Also, I'm hesitant to actually recommend it because Harry accidentally kills ten times more Londoners than the Blitz and shrugs it off.
