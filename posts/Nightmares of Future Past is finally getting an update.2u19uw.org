*** I'm so glad someone else has finally said this, every time I see something about NoFP I can't not think of that. He literally goes back in time and starts "dating" his girlfriend while she is /eleven/ and he has the memories of a 30 year old man. WHAT THE FUCK!

**** The memories of a thirty year old man, but the mental state of an eleven year old. The story goes out of its way to show that he feels more like young harry than old harry.

I agree with you by the way, I get very creeped out reading it sometimes, but the author has tried their best. I actually find the prior knowledge of each person and the implicit manipulation he goes through to be their friends more squicky though, particularly as it involves romance.

You can imagine a scenario where a character had implanted memories via memory charm but has only lived 11 years. Are they now a paedophile if they fall in love?

The story is right on the borderline for me, but written well enough that I am willing to play along with the author that Harry is in fact a child with adult memories, rather than an adult in a child's body.

***** Absolutely there is. Explain why you like it, what draw it has for you, personally, and perhaps address some of the more common complaints leveled against it. This is a fanfiction subreddit, not a cult or a witch hunt. Differences of opinion aren't just tolerated, they're encouraged.

******* Sorry, non-refundable. We already used the money to pay for the naked dancing permit. Bastards always hike the rates near the full moon.
