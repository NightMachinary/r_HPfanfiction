​

I made it to my destination with the six wands I created. I originally made seven, but one of them suffered a fate such that finding it has become impossible to me. I highly suspect one of the house elves took it when I had my attention diverted momentarily.

​

My plan is to present these to my eager nieces and nephews in two days time, and am working with the eldest to concoct a role play in which the wands are presented as a final effort at salvation from the dark forces besieging our world.

​

Each wand has a backstory that I wrote, detailed below. I hope you enjoy the origin stories of the six most powerful wands ever created!

​

Sincerely,

​

Daniel L

​

*The Eye of Tiamat* -- /Pine/ /Shaft and Handle, Dragon's Eye Core/ -- Entombed within its core is the eye of one of the most ancient and massive dragons ever to exist.  Tiamat was an anomaly, born with five elemental heads in one body.  When the beast was slain, ten wands were crafted from its eyes.  Four were destroyed during the ensuing War of Dragons, and the whereabouts of the remaining five are shrouded in mystery.  It's whispered that the wands cause their wielders to seek the slain dragon in an attempt to reanimate it.  Those powerful enough to wield the wands are granted extraordinary wisdom, strength, cunning, and elemental resistance, as well as an odd tendency, unnoticeable to the bearer, to wander the southern mountains.

​

*Unending Blight* -- /Walnut Shaft, Oak Handle, Bone Core/ -- The wicked scepter of an ancient Lich King, Unending Blight was used to slowly and almost imperceptibly drain the life force of an entire realm.  When the townsfolk first began to notice that famine and pestilence were becoming more and more prevalent, it was already too late.  As the townsfolk died, the Lich King claimed them for his undead army and used them to fortify his castle stronghold. Unending Blight can poison and drain the life from those unlucky enough to encounter it, and can summon forbidden magics to reanimate the dead. Only the undead can ignore its insidious side effects.

​

*The Apprenticeship* -- /Walnut Shaft, Cedar Handle, Kneazle Whisker Core --/ Seemingly innocuous, The Apprenticeship was a well-regarded wand given to top apprentices by one of Hogwarts' most esteemed professors.  Some of the brightest students in the annals of history have assumed the role of its caretaker and performed advanced magics effortlessly with it in hand. However, the wand is not the innocent enabler it pretends to be -- it is a siphon for the corrupt professor that allows him to steal its wielder's memories. These memories afforded the professor various powers and advantages over the wielders, their families, and friends. Due to the professor's cunning and prestige, his nefarious activities went unscrutinized for decades and his compulsion spells corrupted many powerful houses. The professor disappeared abruptly ten years ago, yet many suspect he's alive somewhere performing unspeakable evil.  Those who wield his wand now do so at great risk.

​

*Dementor's Wail* -- /Maple Shaft and Handle, Dementor Shroud Core/ -- An ancient wand, Dementor's Wail was an embodiment of pure evil.  It was so dark at creation that lights dimmed noticeably in its presence, swallowed into utter despair.  As the wand drained peace, hope, and happiness from its victims, it began to mysteriously change in color. This happened so gradually that one could've attributed it to mere imagination save for the diaries of a few prominent wizards who'd encountered it over the centuries. When contemplated in full, their records seem to tell a grand tale. From the color of darkest night recorded in its earliest days, the wand's hue has shifted subtly toward a lighter amber color in the past century. Recent wielders have noted unpredictable behavior from the wand, and their killing incantations seem to be fizzling with increasing frequency. The wand loses an imperceptible amount of material each day, and an uninitiated observer could almost make out faint shimmers of colored light streaking across its surface towards the core. The wand's creator could not foresee that the souls swallowed by the wand would endure within it's ghastly depths, and an ancient war rages within its wooden confines. No wizard alive today seems able to reliably bend this troubled implement to their wills.

​

*Wasp Hollow* -- /Walnut Shaft and Handle, Wasp Nest Core/ -- Wasp Hollow was the pride and joy of a powerful sorceress who entombed the horcruxes of fellow wizards within the wand's crystalline core.  Still alive in a fashion, the wand's captives lived out the remains of their shattered existences in symbiosis with the wand, swirling restlessly and relentlessly to carry out the agenda of the Wasp Hollow's master.  The anguished cacophony of shrieks coming from the wand is said to resemble the sound of a wasp nest, getting louder and louder as the rate or magnitude of spell casting intensifies. This gnarled implement is especially adept at spells of binding and stasis, but requires an inordinate amount of focus to drown out the deceit spewing forth from within. Failure to do so could result in unintentional spells being cast, the death of the wielder, or much worse.

​

*Oblivion Coil* -- /Walnut Shaft and Handle, Osmium Core/ -- This wand was created when two powerful wizards simultaneously incanted gravitational spells toward one another.  The ensuing event drew both casters into a black hole and their wands became intertwined.  The darkly scorched sprig was the only evidence of their cataclysm.  The wand feels much too heavy in the hand for its size, and displays strong magnetic properties.  Levitation, anti-matter, and spell cancelling are all within its powerful domain.  However, great care must be taken in its proximity as prolonged exposure causes rapid pooling of heavy metals in the body.  It isn't uncommon to see the Oblivion Coil's weilder sporting a bloody nose or similar effect.

**** Holes like that are typically a sign of beetle infestations. Termites almost always eat along the grain, so it's easier to salvage some of the wood, but beetles burrow into the wood which can lead to more problems, like rot and decay.

***** Ah, yes! I was wondering if you were thinking powder post beetle or something similar. The Emerald Ash Borers are rapidly killing up here in the Northeast, too.
