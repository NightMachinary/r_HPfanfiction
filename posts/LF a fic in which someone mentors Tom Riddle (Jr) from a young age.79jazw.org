I've not really seen this concept so perhaps there are only a few stories about it. I'd prefer a longer fic to a shorter one.

Light or Dark doesn't matter much to me, but I think a fic in which a good guy like (Dumbledore) mentors Tom to stop him from becoming Voldemort would be pretty cool.

I'm fine with time travel to change history, or just straight up AU.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

** linkffn(Realignment) linkffn(Altered Destinies)

Realignment is a WIP that has an attack on Hogwarts throw Riddle and Dumbledore into a mentor like relationship. Hasn't been updated in almost two months but still worth following.

Altered Destinies has Harry traveling back in time to kill Tom and raising him instead. Very good story with a good mix of Grindlewald and development of Tom. The sequel is long abandoned but the first story works perfectly fine on its own if not better.

Edit: Bot linked to a different Altered Destinies. Trying again.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Harry goes back in time due to a quirk of being the owner of the invisibility cloak (reincarnation deal). Time-travel, professor Harry with new (OC) identity, child Tom Riddle. No bashing involved. HP and canon belong to JK Rowling. Complete. This is less of a show and more of a tell story i.e. Dialogue gets really scarce at about ch. 13 and lots of time jumps.
