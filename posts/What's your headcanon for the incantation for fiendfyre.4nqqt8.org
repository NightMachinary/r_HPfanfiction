I decided to add a latin for word bad/evil mal/malum to ignis for fire and used MAL-ig-nisss as the incantation which is a feminine plural of [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malignus]] which means malicious.

I know IG being the emphasis sounds better but having the emphasis on Mal leaves the word to end on more of a hiss sound which feels more malignant to me.

Thoughts?


** Azreth. Joe and some others use it. I'm not sure which was the first usage. (I have a horrible suspicion that it might be HPMOR).

But the word... Azreth. There's no way that the word could mean /anything/ good.

Joe's use of it (spelled Az-reth) in Wastelands takes place in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/14/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][section 14 (chapter 13) of Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] and has a runic component. I don't have an exact date for which that chapter was posted (a function I wish ffn had), but it was sometime between Feb 12, 2008 and Aug 4, 2010.

The only time the incantation for Fiendfyre (spelled +azreth+ az-reth) is seen in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/107/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMoR chapter 107]]. From what we know from Professor Quirrell is that each use of Fiendfyre requires the caster to permanently sacrifice one drop of his or her current body's blood. I know for a fact that chapter 107 was published on February 18th, 2015 at 2PM Pacific Time, as per the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/106/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][author's note at the end of chapter 106]].

This means that, at minimum, the use of Azreth/Az-reth/azreth/az-reth/etc. as the incantation for Fiendfyre has existed for 1659 days before Yudkowsky's use of it in HPMoR.

And I completely agree with you on the sound of the word. Reminds me of the names for various... things you see in Robert E. Howard's original Conan the Barbarian tales.

EDIT: Fixed up the incantation HPMoR actually used. Whoops.

***** Does anyone know of any other stories that use Azreth/Az-Reth/etc. as well? I'm kind of curious to see who came up with it, though Joe certainly wouldn't surprise me.

EDIT: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2vpk01/similarities_between_hpmor_and_harry_potter_and/][This thread on /r/hpmor]] seems to imply that Yudkowsky used az-reth as an homage to Wastelands of Time.

***** Well, this was all because I knew that Wastelands was before HPMoR did Fiendfyre, because I read that chapter of HPMoR during a boring seminar the day it came out. What surprised me was that HPMoR started BEFORE Wastelands was finished.

Barely. About 5 months.

*** You deserve to be tickled with Freddy Krueger's claws for even harboring the suspicion that MoR invented /Az-reth/.

I used to use it myself, but when I rewrote the fic that featured the incantation I came up with my own, with a little help from Google. It's /Ignis Maledictus/.

**** I saw this while reading your story today, and I really think this is the best cantrip for fiendfyre. Anyone who has ever studied prefixes and suffixes will automatically recognize the mal- and ignis is quite similar to ignite, but the best thing is reading the phrase and then having that "Oh shit it's about to go down" feeling conveyed by the words while reading.

** Well, your idea fits. It's a vaguely latin-sounding mashup of words that evoke a particular idea, so it fits with the Potterverse's 'Eh, fuck it' approach to incantations. Or it might just not have an incantation at all, and silent casting is a requirement.

*** I like that idea but my headcanon for silent casting requires significant familiarity.

I kind of imagine it using +||||||+ as a codification. As you use a spell more and more, you soon realized that the spell enters in column two, descends to the slashthrough, moves over to the fourth column then exits from that column. (obviously not actually this but as a way to draw it quickly.) So once you know HOW the magic moves through you which is codified by the words and motions used, you no longer need to know the words/movements and can just make the magic move through you in the way you want it to.

** I've forgotten what my incantation was, but whatever it was, Malignis sounds much better.

I do have this one headcanon on Fiendfyre, which is that it is sort of like an Patronus Charm at the opposite end of the spectrum. Where a Patronus protects you and requires happy thoughts to create an animals representing someone you love, a Fiendfyre destroys everything and requires malicious thoughts. The animals it is made of represents everyone you hate.

** "Voracious Fires of the Third Ring - Consume!"

In shitty faux Latin of course.

There's a HPxMass Effect crossover where Harry cuts open his own wrist and uses his blood as a directable conduit. linkffn(Getting Too Old For This), chapter four.

I think in Bungle In the Jungle, or maybe its sequel, there's actual BloodFyre used.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) Dumbledore uses the biblical "Reduce all of Creation to Ash" line. It's not fiendfyre, but it's bloody awesome anyway.

** The one I use is "Terror Infernus". I felt like it nicely combines the Latinish nature of Rowling's spells with the way she generally makes them suggestive of the nature of the spell via familiarity with similar words in English.

E.g. you know that the Cruciatus curse is going to be painful without any knowledge of Latin because of the way it is reminiscent of the Englsh "excruciating".

** I just use /"Fiendfyre!"/. I imagine the fire to literally be the "desire to destroy" by the caster, channeled into the spell. In my fics, its one of the spells within the desire based magic family, including the Patronus and Crucio. While the first stems from the desire for happiness and the second comes from a desire to hurt and torture, Fiendfyre stems from the desire to destroy. I included those in the broader family of primal magic, but that would go waaay too much into my almost AU headcanon for HP magic.

** It's a riff from the movies, but I like the idea that Fiendfyre is the stuff breathed out by Voldemort in the Atrium fight, as well as the streaming dragon of fire demonstrated when Durmstrang first arrived for the Tournament.

As such, it would have to be nonverbal. I never worked out an incantation for it. The essence of the spell is breathing life into the fire- giving it animation and independent, dark purpose. Maybe something like 'murderous fire', translated from middle English, given the odd spelling of 'fyre'. It may be pronounced 'fain'd-fie-ree'

*** Having fiendfyre be the demonstrated spell from Durmstrang would cement their Dark Arts attitude for all watching and able to discern what it was but their Headmaster would be quite aware how dimly Dumbledore would look at a demonstration like that. I think the demo was more of a firesculpture type spell.
