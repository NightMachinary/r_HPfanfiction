Give me the longest rant you have stored up in you of why a certain character is so bad.

EDIT: gosh damn it. I started this because I wanted rants about characters like Snape, Hermione and you guys give me rants about my favourite characters like the Marauders.


** Umbridge. If I had to choose just one character to hate, that's who it would be.

She believes in nothing. She simply is on the side that can get her power. Everything she did at Hogwarts - especially the punishments! Her denying the truth and going to any lengths to do it. And then the part at muggle-born trials..ugh.

I think my hate is also compounded by the fact that real-life Umbridges still exist and so she becomes more real

** Severus Snape is a bully. Period. A middle-aged, grudge holding bully. Yes, he's a victim of circumstance, but that doesn't make him any less of a bully. He was bullied by the Marauders, but that doesn't permit him to become a bully as well. Being the boggart of a boy who has seen his parents not know him- that's harsh. Yes, he was a spy. That does not give him free reign to terrorize teens. No matter what “cover” he had to keep, he could do so without insulting Ron, making Hermione cry or trying to poison Neville's toad. I can barely accept favouring Slytherins or being meaner to Harry as a valid “cover” reason. But the others? That's going too far. Yes, he loved* Lily into his 30s. That doesn't make his actions towards Harry palatable. No, Snape will never be a good character in my mind.

*as people have pointed out, “love” is debatable. It might be more of an obsession.

**** I completely agree. Not only that, but go back to Halloween of 1981. He willingly told Voldemort about the prophecy and only begged to spare Lily's life, knowing that Voldemort would kill her son and presumably her husband too. If she truly did survive that attack, her life would be miserable. But Snape /didn't care/.

Flash-forward to Harry's school years. If Snape /really/ loved Lily and was repentant of what happened at Halloween, he would have treated /her son/ better. Sure, I get that he had to put up a facade because he's undercover, but he could have just ignored Harry. But no, he went out of his way to make Harry (and all those around him) miserable as well.

What he felt for Lily was /not/ love. It was an obsession.

I can't stand him.

He's a selfish coward.

He abandoned Sirius without a question when the Potter's died.

Abandoned Harry without looking back as a baby.

Didn't contact Harry at all once he was back in the Wizarding World.

Didn't tell anyone about Sirius being an animagus and thus putting the students at risk.

Didn't tell Harry he knew (and was best friends with) his father for months.

Didn't contact Harry after 3rd year until the summer of his 5th year and even then it sure as hell wasn't meaningful interactions.

Abandoned Harry again after Sirius died.

Treated Tonks badly.

Tried to abandon his pregnant wife because he was ashamed of his unborn child.

*** When it comes to Remus, I blame the whole thing on JKR. He is the best example on the fact that the books are plot and not character driven. Remus couldn't tell anybody about Sirius because that would have ruined the whole concept of POA. He also couldn't have a more familiar bond with Harry because Harry must be independent to the end. Remus.

I do disagree with you on one point though. Remus didn't try to leave Tonks and Teddy because he was ashamed of Teddy. He was disgusted with himself about potentially passing the disease to his own child and most likely destroying Teddy's life. They were at war at that point. Werewolves were still being treated like garbage and Teddy would face a lot of prejudice for simply being the son of a werewolf. I am not saying Remus was right on leaving Tonks, because hell no. But I just sympathise on the why he took that step.

**** Fine. He's disgusted with himself. I sympathize too. But he just helped make a life. He needs to put on the big boy shorts and be responsible. Instead he tries to duck it. Just like he ducks nearly every other moral responsibility he has.

Remus had a duty to Sirius and possibly a duty to Harry because of his relationship with James... But he 100% had that duty to Teddy more than he ever owed duty to anyone else.

I can sympathize with his absolute horror at making a kid. But his response to it is so absolutely cracked in the head that I find myself not blaming everyone for distrusting him in 1981. He's not a brave or reliable warrior or spy. He's a suicidal death seeker too cowardly to just get it over with.

That would be because he had every reason to believe Sirius is not only the one who betrayed them, but also the one who killed Peter. Sucks to be Sirius but the circumstances were really against him, his only hope was a fair trial and they're apparently optional in the wizarding world.

Harry was deliberately kept away from the wizarding world and the Dursleys certainly weren't about to allow any exceptions. Besides all that he has no relation to Harry, no claim to him and no obligation.

** Remus and Snape. As Remus has already been covered in someone else's comment above, let's talk about Snape.

He's a death eater who bullied children. There is absolutely no way to defend his treatment of Harry and Neville in particular. I think the bit about Hermione's teeth really sums it up -- he's cruel because he enjoys it. Threatening to test a poisonous potion on a child's pet and then punishing them when the pet doesn't die? Come on.

He was Neville's boggart for God's sake. The same Neville whose parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and who was dropped out of windows by his own uncle.

Snape would have never stopped being a death eater if it hadn't been Lily's son. If the prophecy had said sixth month instead of seventh, he'd have been completely fine with a baby being killed and would have kept in being a death eater, including all the atrocities that entails. IIRC, JKR said as much during an interview. How anyone can defend him knowing that is beyond me.

He spread Remus's secret at the end of third year, ruining Remus's job prospects, making him a pariah as well as giving Umbridge the ammunition she needed to put through anti-werewolf laws (if I've got my timeline correct). Like, say what you want about their school days because frankly the Marauders were little twats as well -- although Snape was using the Dark Arts and targeting muggleborn students so I'd say I know who was worse -- but ruining the lives of hundreds of people out of spite because you didn't get to kill an innocent man is so far beyond excusable it's not even funny.

As a little side note, that whole series of events puts a pretty big hole in the "Remus wasn't allowed to see Harry pre-Hogwarts because he was a werewolf" thing I see in a lot of fics.

Harry's occlumency sessions were also pretty messed up. To me, it looks like he spent hours deliberately causing Harry excruciating pain under the guise of teaching while giving no instruction beyond "clear your mind". Admittedly, we don't actually know how much instruction there is for occlumency in canon, though fanon has created plenty, but I assume there must surely be more than that one sentence for a supposedly difficult skill. Even if there isn't, it was pretty clear that the 'lessons' weren't actually helping, so what was the point in continuing them if not purely to hurt Harry?

This bit isn't about why I hate him, but as it's always confused me I'm going to put it anyway. Maybe one of you can explain it.

How could Snape be a spy during the second war when Dumbledore publicly said he turned traitor to stop him from going to Azkaban? We know he said it at Karkaroff's trial, and had said it before at least once as well, and as Crouch Jr was there we know Voldemort would have been told. What sort of Dark Lord allows a known traitor back into his inner circle?

Oh there was nothing resembling teaching in that moment. Even if we don't know anything about Occlumency in canon, I'd say he didn't teach Harry anything and just tortured him.

What Snape did was equivalent to a teacher punching a student repeatedly in self-defense classes and yelling "WHY AREN'T YOU DEFENDING YOURSELF" without actually teaching him anything.

** Severus Snape. I think he is one of the most interesting characters in the books, but the man deserved everything that happened to him, especially after reading "The Prince's Tale" in DH.

*During Hogwarts :*

- I'll admit it, the Maraudeurs were little assholes when they were at school, but Snape is far from innocent either. First, he was also a bully, whatever Mulciber tried to do to Mary Macdonald, it involved Dark Magic, you can't call that "a laugh" and they cry when Potter and Black hand you by the leg. And according to Sirius, "he gave as good as he got".
- Yes, Sirius was an asshole when he sent toward the Shrieking Shack, and the only reason he wasn't expelled was probably because it would have exposed Lupin as a werewolf. But technically, Sirius only told Snape how to enter the secret passage, and Snape already suspected Lupin to be a werewolf, he desserve a part of the blame for sheer stupidity.
- Calling Lily a Mudblood wasn't the reason why he lost her. Calling every Muggleborn besides her a Mudblood and hanging out with Death Eater wanabe did. That insult was just the straw that broke the camel back, but he would have lost her sooner or later. While I am also at it, nobody forced him to be friends with this crowd, he made this choice alone

​

*After Hogwarts*:

- He joined the Death Eaters (going from a wanabe terrorist to a full fledged on).
- He told Voldemort about the Prophecy, starting the whole chain of event that would made Harry and Neville orphans.
- When he learnt about the fact that Lily could be targeted, he begged Dumbledore to save her, and her alone. Not caring about the fate of her husband and son (and proving that he never cared about condemning people to death, only about condemning Lily to death).
- Years after the war, his first reaction when seeing Harry was to bully him, even though he knew that Harry had spent his childhood with terrible guardians (he knew Petunia), and that it was his entire fault.
- He also bullied several other students while being a teacher. There are several situations where I could try to justify his acts as being a "firm" teacher. But purposely break Harry's potion vial to give him a 0, say he couldn't see any difference when Hermione teeth were hexed, and test a probably failed potion on a student's familiar (and punishing another student when he somehow got it right) have not excuses.

​

I know Snape had some extenuating circumstances considering his upbringing, but the Weasleys are also poor, and managed to send 7 children at school without any of them turning as bad as him, while Harry is also an abused kid who managed to grow up.He may have played a big role in the war, and deserve to be respected for his sacrifice, but he was still an asshole who did most of what he did for the bad reasons.He started Hogwarts being the best friend of Lily, while she disliked James. The reason why he lost her in the end is because James used his student's year to grow up and become a better person, while Snape became worst. Being with Lily would have been the best thing that could happen to him, and it may even have stopped him to join the Death Eater. But being with Snape was not the best thing that could happen to Lily, far from it.

** Hermione.

I don't exactly hate her character, but after rereading the series again I found myself not liking her either. I wouldn't want to be friends with her in real life tbh with you.

She nags a lot. I'd find that very suffocating. I am a very independent person and I barely stand my own parents' nagging, let alone someone else's. If a friend of mine would nag to me about homework, I'd go bonkers.

I find it a bit annoying how Hermione has more knowledge about the Wizarding World than a guy who has been living in said wor ld his whole life. There should have been a lot more instances where Hermione's booksmarts weren't enough, and only someone who was raised in the Wizarding Workd would be able to enlighten the problem.

Her dismissal of Lavender and Parvati feels a lot like "I am not like other girls" types of situations.

Speaking of other girls. The way she treated Fleur. She rants and rants about the prejudices of the Wizarding World and then goes and prejudices herself because Fleur is beutiful and she is not. She let her own insecurities get the best of her. A bit hypocritical of her don't you think.

People get angry at Ron for the way he treated Hermione. Well, I get angry at Hermione for the way she treated Ron. That scene on book six when she attacked him with Oppugno simply because the fella wanted some quality time with his girlfriend and nothing else. But Hermione didn't like that, so...

Lastly, her actions on book three left me with a sour mood. Some examples at to why:

When Harry gets the Firebolt from Sirius, instead of Hermione talking to Harry first and fully explaining to him why he should have the broom examined, she goes straight to McGonagall. Harry was rightfully angry at Hermione and I stand by him and Ron on this. Hermione had good intentions that, but the execution was bad.

Another thing that bothered me is the fact that every time that Ron would notice something related to the time-turner, Hermione not only would be defensive as hell but most often would criticise Ron's intelligence.

Then it's the matter between Crookshanks and Scabbers. Forget for a minute that Scabbers is Peter Pettigrew. Ron had every right to be angry at Hermione on that whole matter. She bought the cat even though in the shop Crookshanks attacked Scabbers. Then had the audacity to ask Ron to keep Scabbers in a cage at all times if he didn't want Crookshanks to eat Scabbers. And when Scabber "died", it was logical for Ron to assume that Crookshanks ate his pet rat. But no Hermione insisted on the contrary. You don't have proof that Crookshanks ate Scabbers, Ron. Check under the beds. The cat hair must have been in your room since Christmas. Before you come at me, I know Crookshanks didn't kill Scabbers. But that's not the point. The point is that Hermione should have acknowledged that her cat might have eaten Scabbers instead of getting angry at Ron. The chances of Crookshanks, which until then had attacked Scabbers plethora of times, having actually eaten the rat were more greater than for him not having killed it. She didn't have any proof either and not to mention she also didn't take enough action to prevent Crookshanks from attacking Scabbers.

. . . . I will probably get downvoted for attacking the princess of the Harry Potter Fandom but oh well. I don't really care 🙃🙃🙃

*** Most of that is entirely valid, plus her general bullheadedness and refusal to consider other people's perspectives, but I have to disagree regarding Crookshanks. Cats are on the approved pets list, and there's even one as a staff member's pet - it's honestly stranger that /none/ of the other cats in the castle are ever reported as going after Scabbers. In real life, pet rodents are generally kept in cages except when being handled, not just left to run loose constantly. In my experience, if you left a real rat (even a tame pet rat, let alone one your brother found in the garden) loose all day and night, it would probably just disappear and you might or might not ever see it again depending on whether it found a nice place to nest up.

Ron already had a not-on-the-approved-list pet (probably a concession due in part to the Weasleys' poverty). Saying "control your cat" places all the burden on cat-owners (you know, the ones with pets they're actually allowed to have?) and none of it on Ron. That also completely ignores the fact that a real rat would have also chewed on all kinds of things, eaten whatever happened to be around, and urinated and defecated all over the dorm if it was left loose all the time. Granted, Pettigrew probably had higher standards of behavior than that, but still...

Hermione was certainly not blameless, as she responded by trying to shift the burden entirely to Ron. I would say though that, as the one person with a rat in a school with at least three pet cats that we know of for sure (Crookshanks, Mrs. Norris, and Millicent Bullstrode's cat) and probably others, as well as a LOT of owls (which also eat rats), Ron should have had a cage for Scabbers to sleep in, with some sawdust or shredded newspaper or whatever as litter. It would have kept his rat safer and more comfortable while also keeping it from causing trouble.

**** Edit: I was mistaken. Ron didn't keep Scabbers on a cage.

Ron did keep Scabbers on a cage most of the time. He mostly let him out of the cage in the Gryffindor dorms where he could keep an eye on him.

I was more focusing on the point that Crookshanks actively tried to go after Scabbers. So even if other pets did attack Scabbers, they didn't do it as much as Crookshanks did or we'd know something about it.

This was a very important part on the third book too. Crookshanks being part Kneazle was more intelligent than most pets and knew something was wrong with Scabbers. However, Hermione didn't know about this. Her pet was going continuously after her friend's pet and she didn't do anything about it.

In her place I would have locked Crookshanks in the girls rooms during the times that Ron left Scabbers out. And on the times of day that Ron kept Scabbers on the cage(when going to classes, for example) I would have left Crookshanks free to go wherever he wanted.

Another thing that I'd like to point out is that Scabbers had been in the Weasley family for years. Ron had left him sleep in his bed multiple times and Scabbers hadn't run off. So, it makes sense that he would be comfortable with letting his pet free a couple of hours a day.

If you knew that your pet was well-behaved like Scabbers most likely was, why would you put constrictions on them?

Also, keep in mind that in Harry Potter because of magic some matters like urine and defecation wouldn't be much of problem. Or that magical pets in general are much more different that their muggle counterparts.

  Ron did keep Scabbers on a cage most of the time. He mostly let him out of the cage in the Gryffindor dorms where he could keep an eye on him.
#+end_quote

No. No he did not. Please find me proof of that.

There are 103 instances of the word 'cage' appearing in the seven books of Harry Potter. None of them refer to Scabbers. The majority of them refer to Hedwig, Pigwideon or various magical cages.

Scabbers is mentioned 125 times and from the first time we meet him, he is /never/ in a cage. This is every mention of Scabbers relevant to Hogwarts where a location is mentioned.

So Scabbers is kept variously in Ron's pocket, Ron's bed, free roaming around the dormitory and Ron's bag. /Nowhere/ is a cage mentioned.

Whatever your opinions on who should have done what during POA, the fact of the matter is that in canon we never see Scabbers in a cage.

**** Added to that... the odds of a cat actually killing a rat are rather low. Crookshanks would much more likely be out trolling for birds or mice if there weren't extenuating circumstances (because plot). Rats though? Cats really aren't that good at killing them and dogs are the animal of choice for hunting rats.

I have a big (indoor) tom cat. I doubt that he'd take on a rat if confronted with one, and he WILL go after mice. [[https://i.imgur.com/AW131Ja.jpg][And shrews]]. I didn't even know what that was until I found a dead one being batted around my living room.

*** The most frustrating thing I feel about Hermione is she set up for this ideal arc that never happened. She was this introverted girl who could be accidentally insensitive and struggled to socialize because of that. Ths not like other girls and scabbers incident is a good example as is her lashing out at Ron in book 6. So she struggles to express herself better and be more empathetic. But she gets better and her peers see her progress and learn to understand her better which causes her to develop more healthy relations and gives her a arc. An internal thing to struggle with and it honestly makes her very compelling .

But for it to happen she has to be wrong more. The narrative cant always be on her side or diminish what she did wrong compared to someone else and that doesn't happen in canon or tbh fanon. So she's denied a better story.

Because unlike /way too fucking many/ people Hermione is actually /interested/ in participating in society. Democracy dies when people don't care about the other people living in it - not just in the HP series (top-most example being Giants and Werewolves who got recruited by Voldemort!), but also in the real world (just look at the current impeached holder of the US presidency).

And when then the population does not show interest in holding up society and keeping its bureaucracy and especially the representatives - and that includes the media, come on, the Prophet is a propaganda rag and the Quibbler is, at best, outright lunacy, and that's it?! - accountable, then evil characters have it all the easier to seize power.

The way most of Wizarding Britain is depicted in the books, I am not surprised at all about Grindelwald and two reigns of Voldemort. I mean... fucking Arthur Weasley, it's his /job/ to deal with muggle artifacts and he doesn't even know electricity?! What's that, a fucking joke?

** Reposting an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dki5gj/-/f4hppm3][old comment]] of mine:

Albus Dumbledore.

First chapter of the first book. Rather than knocking on the Dursleys' door in the morning, informing Petunia that her sister and brother-in-law have been murdered, that her nephew is now an orphan, and asking her to look after him, he abandons Harry at the doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter. But /fuck/ common decency, right?

Then, it gets worse. And /worse/.

- Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
- Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
- Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
- Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
- Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
- Keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts knowing a Dark Lord was after it and thus risking the lives of all students.
- Suspecting Quirrel but not confronting him even after there's an attempt on Harry's life during the Quidditch match.
- Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
- Not doing anything about the Chamber of Secrets even after five decades, though he knew Voldemort was the culprit. Twelve year olds solved the problem.
- Leaving the petrified Muggleborns in the hospital wing for months rather than buying the restorative draught. Not evacuating Hogwarts even though the attacks killed a student last time. (Why was the Ministry not involved except to arrest Hagrid?)
- Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
- Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
- Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
- Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
- Then, telling him half the truth when Harry was emotionally vulnerable after Sirius' death. Emotionally manipulating him throughout the conversation.
- Isolating Harry in an abusive, neglectful household and forcing his friends to cut meaningful communication, even after he's witnessed a student's death and the resurrection of his parents' murderer, even though there were viable and safe means of communication available like the bodyguards following him secretly.
- Having bodyguards follow Harry /secretly/. Trusting Mundungus for the position.
- Allowing Malfoy, a wannabe murderer and terrorist, free access to the school knowing that he's been tasked to kill him, even after two students are nearly killed. Admonishing Harry when confronted about this and then blatantly lying that he gives a shit about the students.
- Leaving the hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes to three teenagers rather than a few trustworthy and qualified adults. Not telling Harry /how/ to destroy horcruxes straightaway.
- Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)
- Scheming Harry's forced suicide-by-Voldemort with Snape, leaving Harry with no *practical* choice but to walk to his death because he was informed at the last possible moment that he was a horcrux. (Why? Because his answer is the only possible answer and that no one else could've found another way?)

This list (or rant) is not comprehensive by any means and my disgust for utilitarianism is showing, but honestly, Aberforth was right about his brother.

And I sympathize with Dumbledore!bashing fics coz their worst flaw is that their authors lacked the talent/skill to express their anger and disgust with Dumbledore properly.

I get your point, but I don't agree on the hiring choices.

- Snape /is/ an asshole, but he is probably one of the best potion brewers there is - I mean, the guy literally improved the textbook while still being a student.
- Hagrid definitely has the knowledge regarding magical creatures, but he would have massively benefitted from getting some education in pedagogy beforehand. Him and Snape... that raises the question, does that subject even /exist/ in Wizard Britain?! Muggles took until late 19th century to develop proper concepts after all.
- Trelawney proved herself to be a true Seer, before and after hiring. And unlike potions and other witchcraft, Seeing has the disadvantage of... not being science!
- Lockhart turned out to be a fraud, but given the circumstances - especially him being widely recognized in the Wizarding world - I don't blame Dumbledore.
- Lupin... what, other than him being a werewolf, disqualifies him as a teacher?

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

Snape, Trelawney, and Hagrid were hired for his own agenda, not for their teaching skills. It's pure nepotism. It is canonical that they were bad teachers, with /Hagrid/ being the best among them. They may be skilled in their fields but that does not translate to teaching ability. And Grubbly-Plank was a better CoMC teacher than Hagrid.

Lockhart might've been the only one who applied for the job that year, so I can let that pass, but you might want to take a look at what Rowling says it the [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][reason Dumbledore hired him.]]

Lupin? He's negligent and a danger to the students. Yes, there's prejudice but social justice isn't a good reason to risk the lives of children. He forgot to take his potion and nearly killed two students. He shouldn't have been on premises during the full moon days. He also knew Sirius was an animagus and the presence of a secret passage that was unknown and unguarded. He didn't say anything because he cared more about Dumbledore's opinion of him than Harry's life.

#+begin_quote
  That one ran by the Unspeakables in the Ministry of Magic, they signed it off.

That doesn't absolve him of responsibility since he /also/ signed off on it. I could write a longer rant on the Ministry but that isn't the point at all.

  Hogwarts is the oldest building by far in Wizarding Britain, with the strongest magical protections there are, protected by the most powerful wizard alive. Not a bad choice for protecting something as incredibly dangerous as the Stone.
#+end_quote

It's nice that you care about the Stone but I'm more concerned about the students in the school. As Headmaster, his responsibility lies with the latter, not the former. And I also find it amusing when people claim that he was "protecting" the Stone. If he wanted to do that, he'd have worn it around his neck and told nobody about it. No, what he was doing was "Hey Tom, here's the Stone! Come and get it!!" Which would've been fine had it not been in a school.

#+begin_quote
  I agree, but ... whom? Half the order was killed or otherwise incapable, the Ministry out of question after Fuckdge's reaction...
#+end_quote

/So/... The Order has only four capable members in the Second War, one of them Sirius Black, who spent a dozen years in Azkaban? Because the only ones dead at that point were him and Emmeline Vance. I'm not counting the ones dead in the previous war. Are you saying that the trio were more capable than Moody, Kingsley, McGonagall, Lupin, Bill, Arthur, Molly, Hestia, Tonks, Podmore, Aberforth, Charlie among others? The reason is plot induced stupidity and what happens when plot drives the characters rather than the other way around.

#+end_quote

Keeping Malfoy from committing a murder is as simple as stunning him and throwing him into prison, with Snape telling Voldemort that Malfoy had got Dumbledore and Potter suspicious. Malfoy is irrelevant beyond that, and his parents deserve worse.

Ensuring that the Elder Wand dies with him is as simple as taking poison. You know what kind of people opt to make a grand tragic drama of their deaths instead? Mad cult leaders.

He could've made contingencies for the fall of the Ministry and Hogwarts, informed trusted members about what was happening to him, and a whole host of other things to ensure the fight goes on. What we got instead was "Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him" and "Severus, protect the students" with the only "saving grace" being Authors Fiat.

** Draco Malfoy, he is not some bad boy who needs a redemption arc, he is a racist little shit. I cannot stand seeing him paired with the very people he relentlessly bullied all though the books, let's not forget that at age 12 he wished death on Hermione, and continued to call her what is essentially the wizarding version of the n word for the rest of the time they were at school. You do not pair an abuser with the person they abused and try to claim its a perfect match. Yes he was raised by racists, but that doesn't mean he gets off lightly, he showed no remorse for the way he thought, and the only times he did hesitate was out of fear for his own life. If theres one thing I hate more than anything in Cursed Child, its them giving him a redemption arc, Scorpius was cool, but his dad can go rot in Azkaban.

** Even with several posts already about Snape, I've got more to add:

- His actions almost certainly reduced the number of possible Aurors, and probably also Healers, with a war coming up. No other Professor we know of (including Slughorn, who was clearly an effective Potions teacher) had such high requirements to continue their subject to N.E.W.T. level. This, plus generally making anybody miserable who wasn't in Slytherin, would necessarily have led to fewer students getting Potions N.E.W.T.s, something we know was required for Aurors and would make sense as a requirement for Healers and for any other career dealing extensively with Potions. How many students gave up on their dreams because they just couldn't take his relentless bullying?
- How long would Thestrals take to fly from the Scottish Highlands all the way to London? Because that's about how long it apparently took for Snape to pass along Harry's message to the Order. Then again, why hurry? What does he care if Sirius gets horrifically tortured to death, other than to be annoyed that he can't join in?
- Was it really necessary to keep the Pensieve right on his desk, out in the open and with no protections, during "Remedial Potions"? Given the number of ways it could have been secured (including such arcane methods as "a locked cupboard" or "another room"), the fact that he's supposedly a spy and thus should have at least some caution and sense, and the relative non-sensitivity of the memory Harry saw compared to what he could have seen (either in terms of "don't let him find out about that" or "he might be leaking intel and we /really/ don't want Voldemort seeing this"), I favor the idea that he was baiting Harry. Due to the low staff-to-student ratio of Hogwarts, it would be reasonable to expect that he'd eventually have some crisis or another to deal with that would leave Harry alone in the room for a while. The exact memory he put in, at least as #1 in the 'queue', showed enough negative about Snape to keep Harry from rejecting it as unbelievable while painting the Marauders in the worst light possible.
- Snape's own words in his memories indicate that he suspected Remus was a werewolf (he brings up to Lily that Remus disappears every full moon, and if it was after the memory Harry sees in OotP he'd also overheard the Marauders talking about running with a werewolf every month). That being the case, it paints a very different picture of why he went down the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack. Perhaps he just wanted enough evidence to out Remus as a werewolf, to ruin him socially and possibly see him expelled. Maybe he hoped to spin it either as "That dangerous Dark creature attacked me, and I barely managed to escape unharmed!" to get Remus expelled, imprisoned, or even executed, or as "I had to kill the beast in self defense!".

** Draco Malfoy is not some flawed protagonist. He has no redeeming features whatsoever. You know why he panicked in half blood prince? It wasn't because he didn't want to be bad, that cunt couldn't care less about the genocide to come, as he made clear and continued to make clear. Draco was in over his head, out of favour with the king and being forced to kill the most powerful man in the country without even having a full education. If could have done it easily he'd of done it straight away. He knew the first few attempts would likely fail but he wasn't stalling because he “couldn't bare to kill”, he needed to be see making visible progress or be tortured or killed. It is baffling to me how many people like him as a character, and I blame Tom felton for being an excellent, good looking actor. That tit.

Oh and before you mention him delaying bellatrix in the Malfoy manor, he didn't immediately call it in. And neither would I in his position, because if there was a 1% chance you're wrong that's a big risk when the alternative is waiting 20 minutes and being sure. He's a spineless neo-nazi bastard.

** I dislike Hermione so much. As if her character isn't bad enough, the fandom is glorifying her, making me dislike her even more.

She is annoying - all the way through the series, bossing Harry and Ron around. It's a wonder they haven't exploded on her. She's got this arrogant sort of "I know better than you" and has to show it off at every opportunity she can. Her bossiness would make her the worst prefect. Here she is breaking rules left and right, since that's okay, because when Hermione does it, "it's for the right reasons". But when someone else does it, no matter what reason, she's relentless and tries to shame people for it.

She's smart academically, as in memorising stuff, but there are other kinds of smartness where she's severely lacking. She has very little emotional understanding of other people when it comes down to it and no tolerance for people who are different than her. Just look at the way she immediately hates Fleur the moment she steps into the Great Hall, and the way she dismisses Lavender over her dead bunny and criticises Luna for believing in things Hermione doesn't. Just because Hermione doesn't think it's real. She blindly refuses to see anything that doesn't match with her view. Both in terms of Luna's views, divination, and of her fight for House Elf rights while they blatantly told her they didn't want to be freed.

She seems to look down on and quickly fed up and impatient with people who aren't as intelligent as her or doesn't know what she knows, or just are different as girls. It seems a bit misogynystic, especially since it's frequently aimed towards other girls (Fleur, Lavender, Luna).

She's being mean to other people, and then starts crying when someone is mean to her. She tries to bully Harry into sharing his feelings about Sirius' death and about Cedric's death, not even considering that people deal with grief differently. /Her/ way is the only, and the best way to go about it.

Most of all, I find her abusive, especially of Ron. She is constantly criticising him, and insulting him, covertly or not ("I only like /good/ quidditch players!"), and she's even attacked him more than once. Putting them together was a mistake, in my opinion. She is physically and emotionally abusive for instance going out with Cormac for the only reason that it would make Ron jealous. I would not be surprised if she ended up ignoring Ron's need in their relationship and let him drift while she focused on her career 24/7. She takes him for granted and tries to push him around every chance she gets. Her attacking Ron in HBP strikes me as spoiled and entitled.

Even today, many abused women stay with their abusers because they're afraid of what said abuser will do if they try to leave, or because they have nowhere else to go and don't want to end up even worse off, or simply because of the degree of control abusers often exert psychologically over their victims. Back in the 60s and 70s there wouldn't have been much of anything in terms of resources for women escaping abusive relationships, and Tobias Snape would have faced little if anything in terms of consequences legally or socially. Throw in the fact that she was from a Dark-aligned family and how they seem to treat their children, and such abuse may have even seemed "normal" to her because she experienced it from her parents as well.

***** Women in real life can theoretically do a lot of things too - we have things like guns, and poisons (goodbye Earl!). Unfortunately, abuse creates a toxic mindset where even once abused children grow up and become physically equal to or stronger than their abusers they are often still terrified of same because they've been conditioned to be. There's also the fact that unless she did something permanent, there'd always be a risk of the magic wearing off (just ask Tom and Merope Riddle), and if she /did/ do something permanent then either the Muggle or magical authorities might well have something to say about it. Even today, a victim killing their abuser can face prosecution.

We know that Sirius was miserable enough to move in with the Potters partway through Hogwarts. Considering what we see done by the Longbottoms, an ostensibly "Light" and "good" family and treated as nothing strange, does it really seem implausible that families like the Blacks and Princes would be even worse towards a child that didn't fall perfectly in line? I'm pretty sure it's also a documented phenomenon that people who grow up in abusive households tend to end up as abusers and/or victims later in life, since that's what they learned as "normal".

** I realize this one's going to be unpopular. But you asked for it.

Ron.

Understand that my dislike of him hinges upon two factors that are personal to me:

I knew kids who behaved like Ron did toward Hermione before they became friends in book one. I'm fully aware of just how vicious and spiteful children can be and I saw every bully I ever had to deal with in Ron's behavior at the beginning of book 1. I never had a troll to help settle my differences with a kid who made me cry for at least half a day. This was not a great early impression on me. (I'm not neurotypical. I don't react to a lot of stimuli the way most people will. I just...think differently.) Had Ron treated me that way I highly doubt even a troll would have been enough for me to ever consider him a friend. But I'm aware that I'm not normal, so I can accept that Hermione is capable of that.

He's lazy and mocks people who aren't lazy as well in the early books. He can't understand why someone might want to learn or read: again I experienced exactly this attitude as a child. Ron's comments on this matter were perfect echoes of things I'd heard from horrible children who apparently hated me for existing and not being just like them.

Those points alone made me dislike Ron from book 1. But Ron's fight with Harry, his belief that Harry was lying, in book 4 was really what dropped him into my "this character is pretty much irredeemable in my eyes."

I realize that most people see this as a stupid playground tiff that they just had to get over. That it wasn't that important and it all just needed to blow over.

Again: I don't think like most people, so I'm going to try to explain why this was such a heinous and unforgivable crime to me on a personal level.

I don't give my trust out easily. I hold it closely and dole it out to a very selective group of people who have proven by their actions that they won't be abusive to me. The longer the relationship and the deeper the bond the more trust they are extended...and I expect the equivalent from them in return. Integrity is very important to me.

Had I been Harry and Draco Malfoy had called me a cheat and a liar I'd have blown it off like nothing. Had Dean or Seamus called me a liar or a cheat I'd have been moderately upset, but I would have written them off as "people unworthy of any real trust. Do not pursue a stronger relationship." After all, we'd been living in the dorm together for over three years. At the very least they should know I'm not a liar.

But Ron? It was the verbal and emotional equivalent of getting stabbed in the back by a friend who just offered me a hug. "He thinks I'm a liar? How long has he thought this? Why is he still my friend if he thinks I am?" This sort of accusation, coming from someone who was closer to me than anyone else. From my friend and brother? It would have been utterly devastating. I'd have questioned every bit of his integrity and why he'd ever been friends with me in the first place. I'd have tried to discuss it with him over the next day or two and after being met with more disbelief and anger I'd have written him off too. It would have left me utterly gutted, but I'd have done it because letting someone back into your life who turned on you after being that deep inside your heart would be a foolish risk. It would be just asking to be mauled again.

I never would have taken him back as a friend after the first task because my trust in him would have been irrevocably shattered. I accept that Harry is not me and he doesn't think like me. That he was practicing the virtue of forgiveness and should be applauded for that...but as a reader I no longer had any faith in Ron.

When Ron left in book 7 He moved from "pretty much irredeemable" to "death would not be enough to erase the stain of his actions. Because not only was he given a second chance, but he used it up at pretty much the worst possible time because the stakes weren't just Harry's life but the fate of the wizarding world, RON'S world, as a whole. I'd considered him a liability ever since book 4. In book 7 he just proved he was. Harry wasn't the best chance to win the war. Harry was the ONLY chance. And Ron didn't have the self restraint to hold back his temper. Yes. The horcrux was influencing him. He didn't say "I need some air. I'll be back when we all cool off" he made it very clear his intent was to permanently leave. Demoralizing Harry and Hermione in the process and possibly dooming the war effort to save his home and family.

That he lacked the self control to stop himself removed any remaining shred of redeemability that he might have had in my eyes. For me, the horcrux actually doesn't matter in the evaluation of the situation. If Ron was so weak in moral or mental fiber that he couldn't restrain himself from abandoning his friends under mental coercion...then he was still a liability who had no business being in that tent or even knowing about the hunt in the first place.

There are probably dozens of petty quotes I could look up to point out all sorts of things I find unacceptable about his behavior. But that's all just filler. These are the core reasons why I started disliking Ron and why I finished the series disliking him more than ever before.

He doesn't value what I value. He ridicules what I value. And he makes no effort to restrain his temper and minimize the collateral damage it causes or has the potential to cause. I would rather have an enemy like Draco than a friend like Ron, because I would always be able to tell when Draco was going to go after me with the knife. With Ron I wouldn't be able to see it coming.

HOW DID HE KNOW A LOVE POTION CONCEPTION WOULD MAKE THE BABY NOT ABLE TO LOVE?! DID HE TEST THIS OUT?! DID HE DRUG PEOPLE TO TEST IT OUT?! Like COME ON! Nothing? NOTHING?! He could've taken Tom under his wing! He could've adopted him and shown him true (good) magic! He could have taken him out of the orphanage and shown him good muggles! Those who break themselves to help people! He could've shown Tom /good/ snakes. Like in one, admittedly, fan fiction Harry gets a light snake. A snake that is GOOD. He warns Harry of danger and can heal. It's a magical world. I'm sure a good snake can exist. BUT NO DUMBLEDORE JUST FUCKING LEAVES TOM TO BE EVIL. THEN, THEN, Snape. Everyone hates Snape and omg Snape bullied Neville. Yeah? Well FUCK Neville. I was bullied in school and years later I had a chance to GET EVEN and I DID. Granted I didn't bully kids while I am an adult but still. I get where Snape comes from. It SUCKS BEING BULLIED. ITS AWFUL. and when Snape NEARLY GETS KILLED BY SIRIUS!!! NOTHING. Fucking NOTHING HAPPENS. NOTHING. Sirius gets away free as a daisy and Snape is left with the probability of nightmares of nearly getting eaten and the sickening, disgusting, slimy dread that the one person you hate the most saved your life. Like, I don't know Snape, but if my abuser saved my life and I owed him... please just let me die. I don't want to owe that shit bag anything. Like doesn't anyone get it?! Or was it because I was abused and I'm a Slytherin that makes me get it?! Your so rage bent and so full of hatred that you want to kill yourself but your too much a coward to kill yourself so you suffer and suffer and if Voldemort came to me like “hey I actually like you” and your like “WHAT? No one likes me. I don't even like me!” And then yes I'm a fucking death eater because sure Voldemort might be a monster but he LIKES ME. He NEEDS my potions. So FUCK OFF. Snape blames the marauders but I would blame DUMBLEDORE. Because DUMBLEDORE could've helped or TRIED TO HELP Tom Riddle before he became VOLDEMORT and he DIDN'T, and DUMBLEDORE could have stopped the marauders from BULLYING SNAPE, but he DIDN'T CARE.

IRL?! Harry would've probably became evil. If it was ME. I'd have said FUCK YOU muggles and FUCK YOU wizards who won't FUCKING HELP ME NOT BE ABUSED ALL THE TIME. Maybe, maybe, I wouldn't have joined Voldemort but you can damn well bet I wouldn't have killed him. I'd have told Dumbledore, /fucking/ Dumbledore, to fix the fucking mess he started back when Tom Riddle was a /child/ and needed /help/. So yeah. I hate Dumbledore. I hate him and I'll never ever ever fucking like him. And sure, one can fucking argue that maybe Dumbledore didn't read Tom's mind or Harry's or Snape's but I doubt it. He hated Tom from the start; he isn't giving Tom any privacy, he doesn't think Tom deserves that much respect (I'm assuming this since he DID FUCK ALL to help him!). He probably didn't read Snape's mind as a child. He wasn't important to Dumbledore. Harry is a grey area. Reading the books and making your own opinion is all you can do. I think a couple times, at least, he read Harry's mind. That's my opinion, all this is my opinion, I got very angry all of a sudden and I'm not sure where it came from... sorry but not sorry. Mostly sorry to Neville. I actually really like Neville so, sorry to Neville. Not sorry to Dumbledore. Fuck him. He just makes me so mad and people talk about him like he's Jesus come back to Earth but he's fucking not. So yeah. Just my opinion.

Pretty disappointed I have a downvote but no response on to why. Because I like Snape? Because I don't like Dumbledore? Because I tossed poor Neville under the bus? Because I cussed? The lack of feedback is saddening but not surprising. I knew tossing Dumbledore out there would get me downvoted. He's basically the Jesus of the Harry Potter world so, that's why I keep my opinions to myself usually. My mind isn't changing tho. His manipulative tendencies and how he just /refused/ to help anyone who needed, desperately needed, help is just disgusting and freaking sad.

*** Dumbledore is a terrible, awful human being. Very possibly the worst person in the series, or at least the one who does the most damage with his screwups.

I downvoted you because your rant was rambling and incoherent, went off on pointless tangents, and lacked paragraphs to make it readable. but mostly because your argument and analysis required that characters possess knowledge they would have no reason to know to reach your conclusions.

Even if Snape knew Dumbledore's history with Riddle, what on Earth does that have to do with Snape's awful life situation? "You neglected this student decades ago. I hate you for that with a deep and burning anger because it made my life hell in some nebulous and undefined way." ... that's pushing utter insanity for a motivation.

And while I agree he certainly should have hated Dumbledore for not stepping in and squashing the bullying...I'm baffled as to why he should have hated Dumbledore INSTEAD of the Marauders. The Marauders were treating him badly by their own choice. If they hadn't decided to harass him then there would have been no need for Dumbledore to step in at all. This isn't an either or situation here.

But yeah, you also got the downvote for ripping on Neville for no reason. He's the victim of a bully too. He goes through the same nightmarish trauma. Because Snape became the abuser. An abuse victim doesn't deserve scorn and dismissal for not striking back at their abuser. Especially when it's a CHILD who's being abused by an ADULT.

**** You misunderstood me. My rant did go off track, I did warn it was an emotional rant that I did /not/ edit. It was raw and from the heart.

Dumbledore didn't help Snape. That's my point. He didn't help Tom then he didn't help snape. One could argue that perhaps Dumbledore didn't know but I'll tell you my HS principle KNEW which “bad” kid was abused at home. And he also knew which “bad” kid was a spoiled brat. He KNEW when a child was having social services called. He bought in my friend when she was put in the system. He talked to another semi friend who teacher was told was thinking self harm. He cared about his students. How? Well I'm sure he was told so much being principle. I'm not sure what they're privy to know, but I do know when a kid is a called to his office he isn't throwing fingers. He talks it out, he questions, he talks to parents, he questions. If things don't add up he would dig for answers. Kids trusted him and supported him. The “baddest” of the apples opened up to him and admitted abuse to him. He did everything he could to help them and be understanding. He opened the door for them to take a break in his office if things were too much.

Sure, it's a book, whatever, but the fact Dumbledore KNEW about Tom, and he KNEW about Harry being abused just pisses me off and I would bet a lot of freaking money Dumbledore knew about Snape. I'm not blaming Dumbledore for Snape's bad home life. I'm blaming Dumbledore for 1. Not helping Tom Riddle 2. Letting the bullying between Snape and the marauders take place (and YES I know Snape fought back) 3. Not helping Snape's bad home life and etc. I won't post my points again they're already above.

And for the other thing - my best friend E bullied me. My mom called her mom (and my mom was called a Bitch so we know where E got her issues from) and my old principle was called (not the nice principle this is a different one). I was told to stop making up stories and that I needed to straighten myself out or else etc etc. instead of yelling at us both, instead of caring or trying to help, I was threatened. Just me. Yes, I hated E for her bullying me, but that Principle? That one who called me a lair, said to suck it up buttercup, and didn't care? I hated him more. E was a stuck up little brat whose momma kissed her ass and spoon fed her chocolate on a silver spoon. E didn't know better. Not /really/. She was told her shit was made of diamonds and the ground she walked on turned to golden. She believed it. The principle? He should've been an /adult/ and found solutions for the problems. He should have given us the same punishment for the issue that we were both involved in because as far as he knew we were both just pointing fingers at the other. What made /me/ guilty? The teacher knew as much as the principal did but she blamed us both equally. The principle didn't. He took one look at me and blamed /me/. He wasn't an adult. He had no evidence I was more guilty than E. And that's what Dumbledore did. Dumbledore was worse actually because he did have one fact down that my principle didn't - the marauders are Gryffindor, in Dumbledore's old house, and Snape is a Slytherin. Slytherin's must be evil, right? It's just sickening and completely unfair and not right. As Snape I'd blame Dumbledore more than the Marauders, because Dumbledore could've stopped it, but he didn't. Dumbledore just didn't /care/. The marauders, however, were /children/. They didn't know better. Not in the beginning at least. By 16 years old they should've but you get my point. Kids do stupid stuff. It's an adults job to make sure they don't burn the house down (or kill a classmate).

(So to make above clearer- I was bullied and not believed by a principle. An adult. I was accused. That hurt me more than the bullying. I blame the adult, the principle, over the abuser because we were children. It's the adults job /to do their job/ and stop bullying in a school setting.)

Dude/Dudette/humanette I already feel bad for Neville. I /love him/. I apologized to him multiple times. Threatening to kill Trevor was just cruel. I'm NOT saying Snape isn't a dick. Just saying if I was Snape and had his life... well I'd probably have joined Voldemort too. I highly doubt I'd have tortured the students of Hogwarts though. I /love/ kids and I /love/ animals (toads and frogs included!). So I get it. Snape /is/ a dick. He's a grey character and I think he could've been a decent guy if Dumbledore would've just freaking helped him out as a child. I hope this was more together and not as confusing/ranting. I went off. Didn't know I was holding so much back. But yeah, can't diss Dumbledore in the fandom without being crucified so I keep my trap (fingers) shut (off the keypad) when it comes to him or questions on who you hate most.

He is a bully, a spoiled son of a witch, filthy rich littler shit. First day of hogwarts, calling another kid snivellius and legit makes every Gryffindor turns against Severus. What did he do to you, Potter? He just exist with your little crush! Your so fucking jealous that you have to gang up on a neglected and abused kid who's just trying to have to good time? Well fvck you.

Years YES YEARS Severus had a harder time in hogwarts, in maintaining his friendship for lily. Every year push him a little closer to the arms of the death eaters. If he could not have support in anywhere, where else could he turn to except to the dark lord? Hufflepuffs r usually close to the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws are interact more inside their house. Well James fucking potter turn most of the school against Severus since no kid wanna be targeted just for helping out a bullied kid so fuck you you little bitch.

And this all stems from James fucking potter can't accept being rejected when mummy's not around. And when his money can't give him what he wants. So yeah, that ass, picking on your crush's friend is the way to go.

And later when he “matured” and lily starts to like him. Ever considered going a step further and APOLOGISE to Severus of 6 years of misery? No! He flaunted his relationship with lily knowing it hurts Severus.

JAMES POTTER IS A FCKING GIT.

He didn't love Lily. He was obsessed with her. Nothing about what he did could ever be defined as love; he literally joined an organization that wanted to kill people like her.

And please tell me what he did as a spy? What important information he brought to the Order that was in any way useful? What actions he did in the war that couldn't have been done in a simpler way? The stupidity of the Seven Potters was a laughable disaster, the Sword of Gryffindor could've been simply given to Harry right from the start, he didn't protect anyone in Hogwarts, there was no reason to believe Harry would believe anything he received from Snape and it was pure luck that he even received that information.

He is a hell of a spy, Voldemort subject his followers to Legilimency often and Snape must defend his mind against a bloody prodigy in the art. He also protect everyone secretly so they don't die but that can't be said for their mental wellbeing. He bring information or just knowing what information Voldie knows may be a huge advantage for them in the war. Handing misleading information may give them time. He was legit forced to kill Dumbledore who he has a great relationship with just to stay a spy. And at the end, maybe its luck maybe it's fate idk he managed to give Harry his magical tears just before he die.

During the death eaters stay in hogwarts, they could've done much worse to the students, a lost limb? Death? Insanity? Most students as stated don't have major injury that are life threatening and even if their mental health is bad, THEY ARE SURVIVING under a whole year of death eaters being death eaters.

He was not useless, if he is, dumbledore will be gone much earlier, Harry Ron and hermione will be werewolves, the light will have a harder time in the war and Voldie might possibly win, dumbledore cannot employ the philosophers stone in the first book since he will lack someone to spy on Voldies spirit, the school in their seventh year will collapse since McGonagall will be dead most likely and the death eaters in charge with major student death.

********** Disclaimer: I am not defending any of Snape's actions. He was a death eater. He killed people without remorse. He made multiple wrong decisions in his life

#+begin_quote
  He didn't love Lily. He was obsessed with her.
#+end_quote

This does not explain the form of his patronus. Like [[/u/Failure007][u/Failure007]] said, we can't know exactly how he felt but I don't think loving Lily means he /has/ to give up hating muggleborns. It would also not explain why he would continue helping Dumbledore and then Harry after Lily died.

[[/u/Failure007][u/Failure007]] also explained most of the reasons he was a good spy. A lot of information that the Order acted on was from Snape. He is the reason why the Order could read the Ministry in time to fight the death eaters in 5th year.

#+begin_quote
  The stupidity of the Seven Potters was a laughable disaster,
#+end_quote

The entire idea including telling Voldemort the correct date was Dumbledore's not Snape's. And it failed because Harry used Expelliarmus.

#+begin_quote
  Sword of Gryffindor could've been simply given to Harry right from the start
#+end_quote

Dumbledore did try to do it in his will. But after that, the only way would have been to have someone deliver it to Harry. If any other teacher or someone from the order tried to contact Harry for it, they would have been tracked and Harry would have been caught. But at the same time, I do not understand the true mechanics of how the Sword appears so I agree that this is a loophole, just not one in Snape's story.

#+begin_quote
  he didn't protect anyone in Hogwarts
#+end_quote

Snape knew about the Room of Requirement but the DA members there still survived. I wonder why he wouldn't have them all brought out and killed if he knew where they were.

Snape has been shown to be playing both sides since Book 1 when he is heard arguing with Quirrel and saves Harry from falling. The only reason that we don't see a lot of this and see more hate towards him is that Harry does not know all this. And the books are from Harry's perspective.

#+end_quote

The form of his patronus is explained by Rowling's in-your-face attempt to "tell" us that Snape "loved" Lily. Bad writing. His form was a doe, so a female deer and counterpart to James' animagus form of a stag; and thus representative of Snape's obsession with another man's wife.

#+begin_quote

No, he didn't. He stated it but didn't specify anything reasonable.

#+end_quote

A lot? Do tell, please?

Harry and co /flew/ to London all the way from Scotland yet the Order didn't reach them until the very end of the battle. The Order could've easily stopped the teens before they could even enter the DoM and turned the ambush on the Death Eaters. Seems to me that someone /purposefully/ delayed sending the information.

And the entire fucking thing could've been avoided if they'd told Harry that you could send messages using a patronus, since he could perform the charm. That is crucial information that should've been given to someone who is a target for assassination, and has had multiple attempts on his life.

Again, bad writing and inconsistencies, with plot driving the characters.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He's not a /child/, and following a dead man's stupid orders is his fault.

And I called it the "stupidity of the Seven Potters" because of the method of transportation used, and the pointless duplicates, among other things. They could've all simply apparated away like Mundungus did; they know the Ministry has been infiltrated and have no reason to follow any stupid laws. Not to mention, they can legally claim self defence.

And Harry using the disarming charm may have inadvertently saved Kingsley and Hermione, who were then being targeted by Voldemort.

The entire plot of this stupidity was because Rowling wanted to get a few people killed and injured, and have an aerial battle in the book.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore did try to do it in his will.
#+end_quote

I meant given it to him in sixth year (and keeping a fake in the office) along with telling him that it could destroy horcruxes. You know, that thing they were supposed to be doing and was the entire point of those "lessons". Me thinks it was because Rowling needed some thing that Snape needed to do in the next book, even if it should've been logically unnecessary.

#+begin_quote
  Snape knew about the Room of Requirement but the DA members there still survived. I wonder why he wouldn't have them all brought out and killed if he knew where they were.
#+end_quote

Because he bloody well couldn't do it, even if he wanted to. Did you forget that Malfoy and the entire Inquisitorial Squad knew about the Room? So the Carrows definitely did too. They couldn't because Neville had told the Room to bar them entry.

**** *sigh* Looks like I have to explain this again...

/SIRIUS DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MURDER SNAPE./

Snape's own memories make it clear that he at least strongly suspected that Remus was a werewolf. This wasn't Sirius going "Hey Snivellus, go here at this time, it'll be awesome!" - it was "Oh, you're implying that you know Remus is a werewolf? Well, if you really want to be sure, here's how to get close." As Sirius himself explains, he expected Snape would get close enough to hear Remus and run away like any sensible person would if there's a transformed werewolf nearby. Personally, I'm pretty sure that Snape was actively trying to get close enough to claim that Remus had attacked him, to get Remus expelled and/or executed, or to justify killing Remus "in self defense".

Were Sirius's actions stupid? HELL YES! He knowingly enabled another student's reckless risk-taking behavior, but worse than that he put Remus (you know, his friend?) in danger. After all, even if he somehow escaped any punishment (unlikely), how would Remus have reacted to discovering he'd mauled, infected, and/or killed somebody?

***** THANK YOU. No one fucking forced Snape to go down that damn tunnel. As Sirius says in a fic whose name I can't remember:

"Why did you pick THEN to do what I suggested? You never listened to me before."

I'm paraphrasing, but unholy fuck I get so sick of hearing about that horrible attempted murder when all it was, was a snide comment that Snape decided to use to try and get one over on the dreaded Maurauders. Were they saints? No, and Remus admits it openly. But did Dnape have his own agency and free will and still make a really fucking stupid decision? Fuck yes. And did he blame everybody else for it as usual? Of fucking course he did.

Also, I find Snape absolutely indefensible, not just because of his treatment of his students in general (which would have had his ass fired damn neat immediately in any competently run school), but because he's a massive shitheel that has such a deep schoolboy grudge against a DEAD MAN that he spends several YEARS taking it out on the man's son just because he can and is in a position of authority to do so. Fuck Snape.

***** I do not agree with that assessment of the situation. I understand where you are coming from I really do but the vindictiveness in Sirius's actions puts it past a prank and past bullying.

The callous disregard for danger and the knowing that telling that tidbit of information to Snape would send him after Remus is a murder attempt if by accident. I don't think Sirius understood the ramifications of what he was doing but he never regretted doing it either.

Sirius was still a Black even if he didn't buy into the blood purity of his forefathers. Their cruelty was renowned from all of them. Sirius and Andromeda included. The only difference being that Andromeda grew up while Sirius got sent to Azkaban.

What Sirius did was goad Snape to go wrestle with Lions knowing fully that it would get him killed. It was stupidity yes but it was also more than that. Sirius bragged about sending Snape to his death which prompted James to have to go save Snape's life.

Except that it wasn't. He specifically states (and we have no indication he was lying) that he expected Snape to turn tail and run as soon as he heard Moony. It /was/ still terribly irresponsible, and a betrayal of Remus's trust, but his intention was always to /scare/ Snape, and maybe embarrass/humiliate him, nothing more. And again, given the indications that Snape knew exactly what he was dealing with, his intentions were likely far worse.

This doesn't excuse adult Lupin who still had a habit of hiding behind his condition way too much, however.

***** I won't say anything about Pettigrew because, well I hate him. We already know how much his cowardice ruined.

As for Lupin, I think he /could/ be given a benefit of doubt. For example, most people enjoy the Weasley twins' products and would not report them. I am sure, if we had seen a point where they hurt a Slytherin (especially Malfoy), no one except Hermione, or maybe Neville, would have reported them.\\
With Lupin, it could be said, he started the same way and then when James and Sirius moved on to bigger things, he found it difficult to go against them because he had never done that.

I am not saying Lupin was right in doing it, I do not condone it at all. But just trying to keep him in a different category from James and Sirius.
