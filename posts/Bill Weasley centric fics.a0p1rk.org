Are there any fics that focus on Bill as a main character? My preference would be a cannon compliant exploration of his hogwarts years (how DID he get to be so cool?) but I'm open to anything. Just in the mood for something different.


** I recommend you play Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. A.K.A. Hogwarts Misery.

** I agree with the other comment suggesting playing Hogwarts mystery, your little avatar thing interacts with him a lot and it's a really neat aspect of the game imo. As for fanfics, Order of Mercy on I think ff.net is a solid pick, percy, bill, fleur, and an oc are the main stars. It focuses on percy, bill, and fleur's personal quests and activities during the war and is very moving.
