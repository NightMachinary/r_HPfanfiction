** Well, if the address on letters is handwritten: at least someone knew he spent at least one night there. I guess the only people who really knew that Harry actually lived in the cupboard would have been Harry (duh), Petunia (A New Duh), Vernon (The Duh Strikes Back), Dudley (Return of the Duh), Dudley's gang and Aunt Marge.

*** Given how many letters Harry received I doubt they were hand written. That said things from PS don't often make sense with the rest of the series.

I don't think Dumbledore or the Hogwarts staff knew about the cupboard.

** No, they didn't. For one, had it been all that traumatic he wouldn't be keen on letting people know because really, contrary to what some fanfiction authors believe, shouting for the entire world to hear that “surely [you] must have had a sucky childhood because reasons” does not a great person make and thus is not something Harry would do. And for two, rather than being a one-square-meter iron maiden that the movies (and many a fanfic) make it out to be it was something like a four-square-meter littlest-room-ever; sure, it was crappy, and sure, it doesn't really count as a real room when they had a room to spare and didn't, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.

PS. Also, it's “canon”, not “cannon”.

** There was a post several months ago --- which I don't have any way of locating, so I can't give due credit, unfortunately --- that depending on the exact architecture, a cupboard under the stairs actually makes for a pretty cozy bedroom for a child, though having someone there all the way to 11 would be pushing it. So, maybe people knew, but wouldn't be particularly angered.

Alternatively, maybe Harry never told others because he knew that Hermione wouldn't be able to resist Doing Something About It, and he didn't want her to meddle.
