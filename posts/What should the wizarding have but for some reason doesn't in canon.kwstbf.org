There are a few but I'll go for magic to fix eyes. They have magic to alter luck itself but eyes are apparently a problem. Many stories have an opticians in Diagon that can either fix your eyesight or give you glasses with many different features. This is the part of the shopping trip I actually like.


** Cinemas. They have wizarding wirelesses, moving photos and animated portraits. Surely they could figure out some way of creating wizarding movies as well.

Actually, the arts sector as a whole seems to be sadly lacking in the wizarding world.

*** From the films we know there's a choir at Hogwarts. So it would certainly make sense if there was a wizarding theatre group.

I like the idea that over the summer they rehearse a play that's mostly done by a Hogwarts age cast, they rehearse all summer and then put the production on for a week at the end of the summer holidays.

Thinking about it...that'd be a great start for a fic. Harry gets invited along to the theatre rehearsals by a friend, and it becomes his route into becoming his own person outside of being the chosen one, gives him more friends than just Hermione and Ron, etc. Probably best written by a former theatre kid, who knows all the hijinks that that sort of group would get up to.

JKRs original estimate was that the British wizarding world had a grand total of about 6000 people. That's barely a small town.

Nowhere near enough to have the audience necessary for pretty much any media and arts.

The wireless, sure, that's something everyone can keep on at home while they're doing other stuff, but cinema is something to actively visit, you NEED enough people. And there simply isn't enough.

Even if you take the "solution to many problems" and make that population ten times greater, even at 60000, that is still just enough to maintain ONE SINGLE cinema in a world where everything already exists.

My country has 10 million people, yet it wasn't until computerisation(last 10-20 years) that it became realistic to do serious dubs of big movies, 10 million wasn't a big enough market for it to make up for the pricetag.

And if you look globally, even if we stick with "10 times as many as JKR meant there to be", that means there's still just 6 million magicals around, split up over a few hundred languages. That just isn't a viable size economy for it to develop even if they can come up with the idea, which they very clearly didn't with the wireless.

And if we go with JKRs original numbers, just over half a million total worldpopulation? If not for magic, they probably wouldn't even have barely any books.

**** OK, fair point about cinemas. But what about live theatre or music? Surely there are more musicians around than just the Weird Sisters or Celestinia Warbeck (sp?)?

I've lived in towns with a population of around 2000 people where there is a very active theatre and/or music scene. It's totally possible to do something with a highly mobile population of 6000. Performances might only happen once or twice a year, but it's doable. Failing that, I'm surprised that there isn't more interest in the muggle arts scene. People still need to do something for relaxation and entertainment.

Also, I kind of question anything JK says when it involves numbers. She's openly admitted in interviews that she's terrible with numbers. The obvious example that has always stuck in my mind is in DH when Harry and Hermione go to Godric's Hollow. She lists Lily and James' birthdates as being in 1960 and their date of death occurring in 1981, yet also lists their age at death as 31. It doesn't take a mathematical genius to work out that those dates are only 21 years apart. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that was never picked up in the editing process and corrected before publication.

***** Sure. But you said it yourself, barely a handful of performances per year.

That's something that enthusiasts might do, but it's going to be really hard to live as a professional actor or artist in such a small "world".

And the lack of interest in the arts of normals, well, are you really surprised? Magicals are basically their own, extremely insular and isolated society, why ever would they bother with something so obviously inferior!?

*lol*

I had not heard about those birthdates... BIG whoopsie.

And yeah, her worldbuilding is absolutely atrociously bad on the technical side of things. Just does NOT work!

Value of galleons is another of those always present issues, totally unrealistic, when you count on it, 25 pounds per galleon tends to end up the more reasonable minimum value. Many fanfic authors use 50 and that's drastically better than the canon 5.

Same thing with population, my headcanon reverts to 60000 as a nice and simple number, simply being roughly 0.1% of the British population, which would make worldwide magical population 6 million, a number far more realistic based on the canon information.

*** Perhaps a cinema industry makes less sense in a world with a thousand times less people. In our world movies can have million dollar budgets because millions of people will watch them. In the wizarding world, the revenue would be much less simply because of the smaller population, and it's quite likely that a Hollywood style movie industry would never get off the ground.

Normal theatre with magic special effects might be a thing, since that's what the world had before cinemas mostly replaced them. With a country's population the size of a town, cinemas don't make as much economic sense but the economics of normal theatre aren't changed too much. Magic powered special effects would also make theaters more competitive with cinema.

*** They do have everything needed to make phones. Connected mirrors are a thing and have been for decades (used in the Marauder at school era), parchment can be enchanted to store, process and display data (Marauders map), the Protean charm can be used to transmit information between items.

Building a fully functional magic powered smartphone capable of connecting with both a wizard only and the entire internet would likely require a few dozen very smart people working their asses off for a decade, but it'd be possible.

Given the low creativity output due to the small population, it's unlikely that a wizard would come up with the idea themselves, but as soon as Smartphones become big in the muggle world it's quite likely that someone's going to try to copy it.

I'd expect early wizard phones to come out around 2010, with full smartphone/internet capability around 2015. By 2020 they'd be pretty widespread, with the inventors likely on top of the list of richest wizards. Since the inventors would be quite likely to be muggleborn, it'd probably cause a lot of anger in the old wealth pureblood families.

** "Mister Potter," said Madame Pomfrey, "Magical healing, by definition, restores your body to its natural state. Your myopia, same as your height, is a part of your body's natural state. While in principle some very subtle and complex Transfiguration can be used to change the shape of your eyeball, I do not know anyone with the skill to do that, and it would certainly have the same risks as Muggle eye surgery. Furthermore, casting healing magic on that area could cause it to revert.

"There is a potion that changes the natural state of your eyes. However, that potion requires the eyeballs of a person with perfect vision, ideally extracted while still alive. If you could find a donor, and prove to myself, Severus, and the Ministry that the donation is entirely voluntary, I believe that one could be prepared.

"Otherwise, I recommend keeping your perfectly good specs."

Her vision stabilised when she was around 25, she got eye surgery about 10 years latter (it's expensive). This was 5 years ago and she still sees perfectly well without glasses or contacts. My own myopia also stabilised in my early 20s.

**** Funny. I actually have a very similar idea where past Malfoys placed a blood curse on their own family so that every firstborn would be born male. The catch? No children afterward.

This ended up producing a plot bunny about how a fem!Draco defied the curse. Thought it made for a good prompt so I kept it on a notepad.

But to put aside the smartass reply, let me list a few things that other comments haven't already tackled so far:

1. */Body modifications./* Gained some weight? There's a potion, literally takes a second to reach perfect weight. Wanna have the body of a Greek god? Potion. Want to alter your appearance in any way your imagination desires? A few minor rituals will do, Saint Mungo will perform them relatively cheaply and safely.
2. */Occlumency and objects enchanted to protect against intrusion/posession/Imperius/Obliviation/.* With so many ways to turn someone into a slave more obedient than a house-elf, it's rather shocking how blase wizards are about their own safety. And speaking of house-elves...
3. */A (largely) post-scarcity economy./* With magic alone, it should be enough to achieve this, but throw in a magic-capable servant race into the mix? I guess the only thing that couldn't be mass produced/copied would be specialized items like brooms, pensieves and others like that, but other than that?

******* My headcanon for this is that the Patronus needs legitimate (but not necessarily healthy, see Snape) love, not raw happiness, and that history has warped Wizarding knowledge of this, because for the vast majority of people, love is also what made them the happiest. This is why Harry can't use his broomflight to fuel it. I'm convinced that in that moment, he felt unadulterated joy, but not really love. It also explains why the spell backfires for Dark Wizards -- they're trying to fuel the Patronus by a moment when they felt happy, but also fueled by hate/cruelty. It also explains why the spell is "hard", yet not really. They're too fixated on selecting a happy memory, instead of a loving one. Hence why Hermione had trouble with the spell.

For similar reasons I always thought the Malfoys could cast a Patronus if they knew what they needed to do to accomplish it. They're cruel people in the grand scheme of things, but remains a very much loving family.

It gets even worse when you stop and look at the magical police.

We hear a lot about aurors, yeah, but they're supposed to be the ELITE.

There's wizard patrol and there's hitwizards. Based on writings, there appears to be at least over a hundred aurors. Meaning that almost 2% of the entire population makes up the magical elite law enforcement. Based on some texts, closer to 3% or even more.

Which means magical britain has more elite forces for a population of 6000 than most cities of 60000 have police forces in total.
