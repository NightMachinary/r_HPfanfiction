Hogwarts was founded around 990 AD, and Oxford has no known founding date, with earliest references being about 1090. Could it be plausible that Hogwarts and Oxford were established as sister schools, before the Statute of Secrecy? They are both supposed to be the premier schools of the UK, and are both highly regarded, and the founding dates are probably close enough to make it work.

I was vaguely considering that it would be a good way to have an Oxford professor teach at Hogwarts, as there could be teaching reciprocation agreements grandfathered in.

Note-I am American and know nothing of Oxford. Is this even plausible?


** Very interesting idea! Although Oxford is a university aimed at older students - but perhaps hogwarts could have been a feeder school into it at a time when wizards were more integrated and university was a thing they did.

Oxford also looks very magical- many of the colleges look wizardy and various parts of it were used in filming for the first two films.

** I, for one, think that's an absolutely fascinating idea and you should totally go for it.

Edit: Just spent a little while thinking about this. Here's what I came up with.

The University of Oxford has had a long association with Hogwarts, occasionally offering higher-level magical education, but primarily as a means of furthering one's mundane education after graduating Hogwarts as well as for seeking magical apprenticeships. Though it operates separately since the SoS and offers no classes these days, the Oxford College of Magic remains the premier British academic association for higher-level magical scholars, provides help for recent Hogwarts graduates searching for apprenticeships, and aides in publication of mastery research.

** I actually have a fic that uses this premise. Oxford maintains a magical section that was warded off after the Statute of Secracy went into effect.

**** Well, I don't have that much of the fic published at this point. I've done a good amount of research and outlining into the schools history and where the magical section of the school would fit into, but that hasn't worked its way into the fic yet. Sorry :/.

Here's the fic anyway, but it's only a couple chapters in and updates are going slowly. linkffn(Poison and Cure by Blandge)

***** I really like it so far, it's a good premise and executed well. I normally don't go for Hurt/Comfort because it generally ends up being filled with one charachter angsting endlessly, but your choice to tell it from different POV makes it fresh. Are you planning on changing the POV every chapter?

****** Yes, the POV will switch to whomever is most relevant to drive the plot, but primarily the POV will be either Luna or Harry. One of the themes of the fic is that everybody in Harry's life seems be thriving and has moved on from the conflicts from their youth, but Harry seems to be stuck there.

That's where this fic kind of differs from many fics in the Hurt/Comfort category, because it's set in peace time where everyone has already started to move on. Harry's really good at living during war. It's all he's ever known. He needs learn how to live in peace.

******* Cool, there needs to be more fics exploring the fact that this is a guy who's entire life has revolved around war and survival. He doesn't know how to live without those conditions.

** The problem is that in those times Oxford largely taught theology, which isn't exactly the best ally of wizardry.

** Though it's a thing to note that Hogwarts is even close to being the oldest school in the United Kingdom. The King's School, Canterbury was founded in 597. And there are at least 14 others in England and one in Wales that predate Hogwarts.

** A big part of my canon is that it's possible for Hogwarts students to go to University, but it's a rarely-picked option only taken by those who want to pursue a non-magical field of study, such as Astronomy, or those who fancy making a career in the Muggle world, such as my main character. Here's a snippet that more-or-less explains it......

#+begin_quote
  Last term's career discussion with Snape had gone about as well as I expected. Being in his house, yet no bloody use at his subject meant I was never going to win much esteem from him. But I'm sure I managed to even lower his opinion by meekly voicing an interest in going on to a Muggle university. I'd somehow latched onto the idea that a degree might give me more interesting options then the usual wizard jobs, which struck me as either boring or terrifying.

  However, Wizardry in general views all Muggle education as worthless. If you ever found yourself facing the interview panel for some prestigious Ministry job, and you proudly mentioned your three /summa cum laude/ degrees from Oxford, Harvard and the Sorbonne, they'd look at you like you'd just relieved yourself on the carpet. So spending three years at university carried the reputation of being an option only picked by a small handful of academically-obsessed oddballs -- the sort that are considered a bit peculiar even by their Ravenclaw housemates. Despite this, I assumed one or two Slytherins were bound to have made that choice in recent memory -- we are more of a mixed bunch than outsiders generally assume.

  Apparently not. Snape reluctantly admitted that such a thing was possible for those who wanted to take this “eccentric route” and the rest of the short interview was spent in him rummaging around in his desk drawer for the appropriate leaflet and the name of the person at the Department of Magical Education I had to write to. He signed off on my choices of NEWT subjects, only commenting that they were a challenging selection, but well within my abilities and would serve me well when I eventually came to my senses. Then he dismissed me.

** Well Morganna Le Fay was supposed to have a school that predated Hogwarts. Maybe she had her original school in Oxford and then it slowly became just a muggle school after Hogwarts was established.
