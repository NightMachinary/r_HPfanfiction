Ok, so I love a good badass, politically savvy, beats seasoned aurors in duels and seasoned politicians in debates, all around awesome Harry. HOWEVER. I'm currently burnt out on suspending my disbelief that all this is being done by a 13 year old. Can I get some recs where Harry becomes this during adulthood?

I don't care if the story focuses on 20 year old Harry starting his badass trajectory or is set at any point after, I don't care if it's straight canon compliant or ridiculously AU, I don't even care about pairings - I just want a Harry who grew into badassery at a remotely believable age.

One exception that I will accept is if something happens to young Harry that basically obliterates/sidelines kid Harry and replaces him with an adult, ie, DeSalvatore's Rebirth of the Founders where all the politically savvy is coming from Salazar, or time travels where old Harry overwrites young Harry.


** Lots:

linkffn(Realignment): technically it stars Tom Riddle and to a lesser extent Dumbledore, but Harry (its never stated but its him) goes back in time to kill Tom in 1943. He basically curbstomps everybody until Dumbledore throws his hat in the ring. First chapter should give an idea.

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): Harry is basically a cackling maniac in here, but we learn how he became both badass and insane as the story goes. Chapter 6 is great too.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): this is incomplete and may never finish, but the fights in both chapter 1 and 2 between Harry and Voldemort are easily in the top five action scenes I've read in HP fanfiction.

linkffn(The Skitterleap): massive AU where Harry is a soldier in Grindelwald's army. Pretty much non-stop throw down.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): Harry time-travels as an adult back to 1995 and speed-runs Voldemort and his horcruxes in 12 hours. Examples of badassery include battling Dumbledore and Voldemort one-on-one, fighting a chimaera, and Fiendfyring the Malfoy house.

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation): Harry is believable yet still a talented political operator and badass fighter (though the latter is relatively low-key).

linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban): an old one here, but a thirty-something Harry leading the last bastion against Voldemort from the fortress of Azkaban. Highlight is the Morsmordre and Azkaban battle scenes.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
