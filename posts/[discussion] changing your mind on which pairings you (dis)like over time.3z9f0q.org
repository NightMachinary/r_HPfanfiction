So over time I came across different pairings, some as the main pairing some as a side pairing and I was just wondering which pairings went from the dislike into the like category for you guys or vice versa over time.

For me, I hated Harry x Snape, mostly because I just saw him as devoted to Lily too much for it to make sense, but over time that changed.

On the other hand I never liked Hermione x Draco, and I still don't like them as the main pairing mainly because I prefer to read from Harrys POV, but I read a few good fics with them as a secondary pairing. I like how they fit intellectually often.

I once came across Hermione x Draco x Ron which made my eyes bulge in surprise but worked somehow in that particular fic. I love triad relationship when done with depth and not as PWP, so that was not the problem.

Well, I am also wary of Hermione x Snape, that might just be because I'm a girl and I knew someone who when we were 15 had a 30 y/o boyfriend and it weirded me out so it still gives me the heebie jeebies to this day. I'm just not affected the same with boy x boy fics. So I keep my eyes off of Herm x Snape if possible (eg as a main pairing) but it slips into as a side pairing from time to time. Some good some bad, still mostly icky.

What about you guys?


** I've stuck with H/Hr since I got into HP fanfiction and I feel pretty set in my ways. I've tried to read other ships (Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur), but even if the main pairing is written really well I find myself wondering what's happening with the other person of my preferred pairing.

I've even tried looking into three-way pairings that preserve H/Hr like linkffn(4321881; 7718942; 5681042) but it just feels really strange. I'm certainly all for forgiveness in real life matters, but not in the HP universe so any story with Draco or Snape is right out. I've recently branched out into reading stories with no pairing, so I guess that could be considered a change in preference.

But I'd never presume to speak for anyone other than myself. The million different preferences on this subreddit is one of the things that makes it so great.

**** That's a really hard question to answer and I probably couldn't narrow it down to just one because there are so many different subgenres.

Favourite crack!fic is probably either [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6133][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by serpentclone]] or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion). I can't enjoy Champion's Champion without calling it a crack!fic, thereby giving Driftwood a pass on the ridiculous amounts of Ron bashing.

For canon compliant I like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7460&chapterid=&agree=1][Love Lost, Love Found by Harry's Mistress]]. Most of the other canon compliant stories are focused on a clandestine relationship between Harry and Hermione and I'm not a fan of infidelity.

One of the best stories that also mixes in some interesting ideas on magic is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=4723&chapterid=&agree=1][Magic Never Dies by Lynney]]. It won the Felix Felicis competition on portkey, so it's probably one of the better quality stories on that site.

linkffn(Harry McGonagall by witowsmp) does a very young Harry quite well, although admittedly there aren't very many of those to choose from.

But if I had to choose only one H/Hr story based purely on its technical merits and the depth of thought the author gave to developing the romance, it would be linkffn(Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic). I probably rec it too often, but it's really an excellent story.

If you have any that aren't on my overly long list, please let me know. I'm always happy to read another story.

**** It's one thing to dislike canon, as most of us have numerous problems with it, but too many fics wind up trivializing the conflict with Voldemort while turning the Weasleys and/or Dumbledore into unforgivable and pureblood rhetoric spewing, potion/memory charm using bastards. I don't have anything against alternative interesting conflict, but some of it just gets so tiring.

It is one thing for characters to be willing to go to extreme lengths to accomplish their goals (and some of it can be rationalized as being in-character), but it is another thing entirely to make them amoral and /stupid/ when it is out of character. "Love makes us do crazy things" isn't quite good enough for me.

** I've changed my mind on pretty much everything. Back when I started reading fanfiction, the only pairings I read were canon pairings, and the thought that people could actually read/write anything else horrified me.

These days, I'll still choose Harry/Ginny as my favorite pairing if pressed, but that's mostly because I like Ginny and Harry/Ginny stories are the only stories that generally have her in a prominent role.

I can read pretty much anything these days, though I still dislike Harmony. I don't think that is going to change any time soon, but we shall see.

** Snape/Harry got me into fandom, and I'd still rank it as my OTP. But the thing about being around so many talented writers and artists is that they can be /very persuasive./ Although I suppose it's not so much that I changed my mind as that I enlarged my scope.

Adding Snape to a pairing helps (unless you turn him into a Byronic, sophisticated, misunderstood woobie or any version of Alan Rickman, because no), but it's not required. Some things just don't float my boat - most of the canon ships, for example, not from hostility but from lack of interest. And generally speaking, hetfic is low on my list, since het content is provided by the entire rest of the world and the cultural marketplace.

And some things haven't changed. I still have zero interest in Harry/Draco, despite the number of excellent writers who've written for ship. Remus/Sirius and Snape/Hermione ditto, although that's more "meh" than actual dislike. I still have trouble shipping Luna with anyone, although I like seeing her as a secondary character in fic.

For most other ships, I'm open to having a conversion experience at the hands of a good writer. I've become a "McGonagall/almost anyone" fan through the sheer force of talent exhibited by a small band of LJ authors. I used to adore the HP Beholder fest precisely because it focused on unconventionally attractive characters, including the older or unheroic or unsympathetic ones.

HP is a godsend of potentially interesting characters and ships, and I've enjoyed exploring them through other writers' eyes. In the end, though, and for whatever reason, I always come back to various Snape combinations.

Then I stumbled onto a time travel fic with Hermione going back in time and being sorted into Slytherin in Tom's year. It wasn't quite a romance, but it led me to believe that this ship could actually make sense in the right context.

** I used to think "if Snily then not Snarry", but I've mellowed out enough to consider other ways Snarry could happen. The more I think about Snape, the more I run away from all other Snape ships and towards Snarry.

I used to be okay with Tomione but ever since falling hard for Harrymort, Tomione doesn't make sense for me anymore, and has turned into my greatest NOTP. It's a terrible shame, considering how the ones I read before my converting were pretty good, and there were so many Tomione fics I had on my to-read list that I can't enjoy anymore. (Harrymort, on the other hand, used to be the-ship-which-must-be-mad, but the really good ones are responsible of converting me.)

To balance out the lack of tolerable ships including Hermione (and my worsening impression of Drarry), I'm gradually becoming more open towards Dramione. Not that I actively seek it, but I am fine with it happening in the sidelines.

Though I have likes and dislikes, most of the time, I'll probably end up nodding to whatever ship the author writes about if it's well written.

** I was quite late to fanfiction, I only started reading it three-four years ago, so I had already read all the books and seen all the films. First one I read after MoR(yes I know, it's not my cup of tea either) was a H/Hr and I went in coming from enjoying Hermione's characterisation in the books (she got irritating at times but didn't everyone apart from Luna?) and hating her Mary-Sue film version only to find her character felt based off the Mary-Sue version. I tried another H/Hr thinking it's just that one that was so OP surely this one can't be it has over 2000 favourites.

Stupid, stupid, WRONG, WRONG.

I tried another, it was just bad luck right, they can't all be bashy bashy super Hermione? Wrong again kidder.

I've read a couple H/Hr over the years but if I see H/Hr I tend to avoid a fic because I'm sure there could be non awful Hermione stories but there is so much shit that it's not worth wading through.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** I didn't care about shipping at all before, but I ship Sev/Lily now. Partially because of how entrenched shipping is in fandom culture and the discussion/justification surrounding pairings and characters.

I could never get invested in Hermione as part of a pairing at all, despite fandom shipping her with anything that moves. I'm chill w/ Ron/Hermione, but I have no thoughts about them /as a pairing/. Sevmione/any student/teacher pairing is bleargh.

Contrariwise, I ship Sev/Tonks. It only works for me in AUs where they were never teacher/student, though. It's psychologically easier to envision that, since we never see them interact as teacher/student, only as adults, so you can just pretend it never happened.

Tom Riddle/anyone was a no, is a no, will always be a no. He's a combination of Petyr Baelish and like, Christian Grey. No.

Wolfstar was always weird to me. It's always in the backdrop of the Marauder fandom. James/Sirius seems more intuitive to me. Jily is a no also.

** When I first came back to the HP fandom a few years ago as a fanfiction reader, I only really liked Snape/Lily. Personally I couldn't understand how people could like Draco/Harry or Snape/Hermione, but I thought that Draco/Hermione could be okay.

*But then, I read a fanfic based on the pairings I didn't get/understand and it changed my opinion*.

Draco/Harry is now my favorite pairing and I like and read Snape/Hermione and Draco/Hermione. I don't care for Snape/Harry because I'd rather see him with Lily or Hermione. But I came to that opinion AFTER I read a few SS/HP fics and determined that pairing wasn't for me.

So bottom line is, if you don't understand it, read a good rec fic to see if you can see what the appeal is. I did it and my favorites have changed because of this.

And OP, in the SS/HG stories I come across, Hermione is NOT 15 years old in a relationship with Snape. She is usually 17-19 if she is still in school (remember she is almost a year older than everyone else), but there are tons of fics featuring them that take place when she's in her 20s (Post Hogwarts). Snape/Hermione is not a 12 year old Hermione with a 31 year old Snape!

*** Well the Hr at 12 and Snape at 31 is a bit over the top, but I see a lot of Hr being 15-16 when she falls for Snape. I guess I just prefer my fics to be set at year 5 to 7 and not way post-hogwarts so thats my own shortcoming. And the few post-hogwarts I enjoyed simply never had Hr/Snape. C'est la vie.

I get what you mean , sometimes a pair just snucks up on you and changes your opinion of them somehow. But finding that elusive fic that will is hard imho. So much fanfiction is too OOC its not even funny - except in crackfics of course. ;)

** I've never really been a shipper. I do go through phases to be certain (currently in SS/Hr mode), but said phases don't usually last terribly long. I'll read nearly any pairing, although I avoid femslash unless it's very highly recommended. Same for HP/DM, but that's mostly just because so much of it's dreck and badly mischaracterizes Draco.

** In answer to your question, I felt exactly as you do about Hermione x Snape, and then I read Pet Project. It's not my favorite SS/HG, but it eases you in so slowly that there never seems to be anything amiss. Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten is my favorite SS/HG and takes place ten years after the war, and at that point (especially if you consider the longer lifespans of witches and wizards) the age difference doesn't seem like such a big deal.

You mentioned you like triads so linkffn(Brilliant Magic) is a Fred x Hermione x George WIP that I've been following for a while and is absolutely amazing. It's a Slytherin!Hermione, that I think really stays true to all the characters.

  "Someday you won't care what they say. . . and you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own.- FW/HG/GW, starts in Hermione's 1st year. Rated for a triad relationship and future chapters.

** The only non-canon pairing I've ever been invested in is Remus/Sirius. I tend to be open to pretty much everything else but in the four or so years I've read fanfiction my dislike of Draco/Harry and any pairings with large age differences has never wavered. This is the only fandom where I continue to hate the pairings I hated going in, and I'm not sure why - maybe it's because I've been reading HP since I was a kid?

** In the beginning I was very much into Severus/Lily, but as I grew older I saw why that is a terrible pairing. Now I read a lot of Lily/James, particularly in their last Hogwarts years.

Also, while I don't have anything against Ginny at all (Book!Ginny is actually incredibly well written, I think), I usually pair Harry with Tonks, as my otp, or other lesser used canon girls like Fleur, Susan and sometimes Daphne. (Canon lesser used, as in fanfiction I've found them to be the main pairing for a LOT of fics).

I even came across a James/Hermoine timetravel fic that I really enjoyed, against all odds.
