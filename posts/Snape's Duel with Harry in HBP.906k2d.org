So here's an interesting question. When Harry tried to attack Snape, what exactly did Snape do to stop Harry's spells like he did?

Did he cast a counter-spell or counter-curse?

Did he interrupt by attacking Harry and we just don't hear it?

Like to hear your thoughts. I'm working on a fic that has dueling in it, and I am looking to get as many options on the table as possible.


** Harry kept trying to cast an unforgivable. We know there is no counter curse or shield that can stop them, we do see physical objects take the hits however. In this case I believe Snape was using banishing spells or minor jinxes to interrupt Harry's casting. We know magic is more than saying some words and waving a wand. It does seem however that simple spells likely take very little effort. Snape could cast simple spells to interrupt a far more advanced curse that takes a moment to get the mindset right. Small efficient shields probably dealt with the jinx and stunning spell Harry through and then another death eater interrupted another spell by cursing Harry. Snape's parry physically knocked Harry back. I believe the word parry was miss-used. I don't believe the curse itself was parried.

Exhibit A

#+begin_quote
  When cast, a (usually) invisible shield appears where the caster's wand is pointed providing a protective barrier between themselves and their attacker. The shield itself does not give off light, but rather, the spell bouncing off of it does. The only spell the Shield Charm can't defend against is the Killing Curse, since it's unblockable.
#+end_quote

Its only the Killing Curse dude. That is the only "Unblockable" spell in HP.

******** The problem is, the wiki gathers data from everywhere, even sources of dubious (or worse) canonity, and when there's no word from the books it just shows things from those other sources, sometimes without noting that this is what happened. In this case, it took the mention of the Killing Curse being unblockable, and instead of writing that it's the only spell /known to be/ unblockable, it wrote that it can block everything bar this one spell, with no proof that would justify such a change, which is tantamount to giving false information.

We know the Killing Curse to be unblockable, and we know the lesser stuff to not be, but the other Unforgivables are an unknown there.

Moody stated the Killing Curse's unblockability as a contrast to the other unforgiveables, though. It was highlighted as a unique feature. Add to this that we literally saw Snape block the Curciatus in HBP and it seems very clear that the Cruciatus and Imperius are blockable.

While this doesn't rule out the possibility that some other spells are unblockable, it does mean the unforgiveables are not all unblockable.

The shield hats work only against "minor to moderate hexes or jinxes" - any strong spell will beat them, and the Unforgiveables are provided merely as an example of strong spells.

You're attempting to prove a positive with a negative. "No one ever says that the Imperius isn't unblockable, so it's unblockable. That logic just doesn't work - such logic would mean that everything which is not explicitly ruled out by canon is true.

Ultimately, it's simple: only one spell is stated or shown in canon to be unblockable and that's the Killing Curse. To add other spells to that list, you would need positive canon evidence.

No, I'm saying we have a direct quote saying Shield Charms cannot stop Unforgivables. You yourself quoted it. Evidence can be given in favor or against any proposition. "Positive" and "negative" are imaginary properties. Or even if you think they really mean something here, they're irrelevant because there's one evidence to support Shield Charms blocking them. Ergo there's simply no reason to suppose otherwise, while there is reason to accept that they are unblockable.

************* You're falsely extrapolating from Fred and George's Shield Charm on the hats to all Shield Charms. For example, we know the Shield Charm is capable of stopping strong spells generally (if cast by a powerful enough wizard), but the version on the hats cannot. The act of putting the Charm on an object clearly limits its strength.

We see in canon that the Shield Charm varies massively in strength based on the abilities of the caster. There's no set of spells that it can and can't stop (other than the Killing Curse), because its capabilities vary. For example, in GoF when Harry first learns it, it can barely stop minor jinxes. By HBP, he's able to block powerful spells from Snape with it and in DH he uses it to cut Voldemort off from the other fighters of the Great Hall.

************** I don't see what those examples show. In HBP, Harry didn't stop Snape's spells with the Shield Charm, he knocked Snape himself back with the Charm, not his spell.

#+begin_quote
  “Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here --- let me show you ---”

  He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinc- tively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protego!”

  His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.
#+end_quote

Similarly in DH, he blocked Voldemort physically, he didn't block any of his spells. There is not a single example in canon of the Shield Charm even hindering an Unforgivable. The strength of the Shield Charm may well depend on the user but it only goes so high (otherwise would Voldemort have even bothered with that silver shield in OoTP?)

********** For the Shield Charm, yes. Notice how Dolohov's curse partially went through Hermione's shield charm, even when powered down. Stronger Curses most likely require a specific countercurse, if one exists. But the Unforgiveables appear to have no such things besides the sacrificial protection.

  If absolutely nothing can block them, why did they even need to say that?
#+end_quote

Because people aren't always smart and might ignorantly assume all they need is a hat a bam, they're good to go. As they point out, most people can't even do a Shield Charm so they wouldn't know it's limitations.

#+begin_quote
  But never mind that, let's see the actual quote.
#+end_quote

...Ok? Literally nothing changed by quoting the whole exchange. If anything, it shows how off you were. The Shield Charm only works on "minor jinxes, Hexes and curses", with the twins directly saying Unforgivables aren't blocked.

**** From canon, 4th book, chapter: The Third Task. '..the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected *MINOR* curses...' In my year 2000, british version its on page 529 if you want to check.

Unless you're calling the unforgivable a minor curse I doubt the shield charm could stop it. Your source is the wiki, not known for being fantastic.

***** Yeah, but we know :

Shield stops legilimency and summoning, so that description is not completely accurate.

Crouch jr as moody stated unequivocally that the killing curse is the only unblockable spell. That was NEVER stated as true of the imperius and cruciatus curses.

  Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again...
#+end_quote

Shortly afterward, he interrupted Harry's casting of /Levicorpus/ with what appears to be a rapid, silently cast /Expelliarmus/.

It's canon that curses can be repelled and interrupted, which is arguably where the fanfiction trope of deflecting spells came from.

** It is entirely within the realm of possibility that Snape was casting invisible spells to disorient him. There is a fanfic out there where Dumbledore tells Harry that only poor wizards say there spells after graduation. He could have also simply entered into to Harry's simple, lazy, and defenseless mind to distract or simply prevent the mind from connecting thought to action. Snape has about 30 years of magical experience on Harry. In that time he has fought against James and Sirius (2 students at the top of his year and magically powerful), possibly against Moody and other Aurors before they became incompetent after the 1st war. Studied under Dumbledore and Voldemort. In the same time it takes Harry to flamboyantly swing his wand and yell, Snape could have done a wide variety of things to kill him. Dark curses, hexes, jinxes. Charming Harry's clothes to suffocate him. Transfiguring him into an animal or changing his clothes to lead. It was like a housecat fighting a starving tiger.
