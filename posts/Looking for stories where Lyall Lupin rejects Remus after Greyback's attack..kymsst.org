** That's part of the backstory here. It's not clear what happened exactly, but Lyall takes himself out of the picture. So does Hope.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** linkao3(Casting Moonshadows)

Is quite a dark Wolfstar Marauders story where Lyall really hates the fact Lupin is a werewolf and how Remus deals with that.

Its good! I really enjoyed it. But its quite abusive so be careful.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders.
