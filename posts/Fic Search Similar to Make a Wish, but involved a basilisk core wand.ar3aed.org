I'm looking for a fic that was similar to Make a Wish (it was acknowledged by the author), but it was a bit more tropey. I remember that it was incomplete, sort of long, and that Harry got a basilisk core wand and unlike in most fanfiction, it had a very obvious effect. His curses suddenly became absurdly strong, so his disarming spell was actually taking arms off. I think a similar thing happened with his armor, but it's been a few years.


** This actually sounds fucking hilarious.

*** It was, though the author had clearly written themselves into a corner towards the end of it. I'm guessing they took it off the internet, based on the fact that no one here was able to find it.

** Of cause! This is what happens when you use the disarming curse instead of the disarming charm :D
