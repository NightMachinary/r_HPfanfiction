:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe it's a Slytherin!Harry fic, where Harry can use his magic to control shadows. He freaks out the first years on the train, then the rest of Slytherin after the sorting. At least I think so. That's all I remember except that I liked it, any help would be greatly appreciated!
