Most likely an abused Harry story. He has severe (fresh-ish) burns on his hands and wears gloves to Hogwarts. Nobody makes a big deal of it at first since they handle dangerous ingredients in class. Once that handling period is over, Snape wants him to take the gloves off and eventually rips them off by force(during detention?). Probably turns into an adoption or mentoring fic, not entirely sure on that.

  A pair of shoes, a set of mittens; how are two seemingly mundane items going to change the lives of both a snarky man and a troubled child?
