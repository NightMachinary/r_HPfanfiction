Hello, I am looking for any fanfics where an oc/si is reincarnated into the world of harry potter and has some kind of relationship to Severus Snape. The oc/si can be his sibling, child, friend or even lover. If the relationship is anything other than his child then I would prefer if the story takes place during the Marauders era when Snape was still young, and maybe the oc can be friends with him and Lily or something. If it's his child then I would prefer if the child could be in the same year as Harry.

I haven't been able to find anything like this for an oc/si, the closest thing I found was a percy jackson x harry potter crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446944/1/Quest-to-the-Past]]

I'm basically looking for something similar to this but with an oc/si with future knowledge instead of Percy.


** He's a side character in my SI, but he is friends with the character. He's one of the main reasons she decided to keep fighting and they even spend Christmas together (though that's kind of fad to black because it didn't really enhance the plot).

  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.

** I read this one recently. It's on hiatus but it's long enough to be worth reading, IMO. SI shows up right after Harry's first year at Hogwarts. Linkao3(17373680)
