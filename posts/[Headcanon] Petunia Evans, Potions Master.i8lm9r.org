:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
After her letter from Hogwarts didn't arrive, Petunia wrote a letter to Dumbledore, pleading to be accepted despite her lack of magical ability. She was, of course, politely declined. Though it broke her heart, Petunia's fascination with magic didn't end there. She would get copies of the daily prophet from Lily, and was determined to show her worth to her sister's headmaster. One summer, she snuck into Lily's room and found her textbooks. She began reading, fascinated by magizoology and magical history, she became even more disappointed when every book required certain wand work. Every book - besides potions.

Petunia thought that she had found her calling. When Lily discovered her amidst a pile of books, she asked her what she was doing, to which Petunia replied: "I'm going to be a potions master". Amused and slightly worried, Lily tried to explain to her sister that magic was still required to brew a potion (as it was necessary to awaken the magical properties of the ingredients in the end), but to no avail. Petunia kept stubbornly claiming that it was no different than chemistry, and that since she was acing that she'd have no trouble brewing a potion. Finally, Lily stopped trying. As summer went on, Petunia tagged along with her parents and sister to Diagon Alley, and begged her parents to buy her a cauldron and some ingredients, which they reluctantly did after seeing how excited she was.

She spent the next day cutting, crushing and brewing her first potion, but to her surprise it didn't do anything. Lily watched from the hallway as her sister laid her head down on her desk, sobbing. She came into her room and told her that maybe she'd have better luck next time, as it takes time to master even a simple potion, and made up an example of her first potion which was a disaster. She managed to cheer Petunia up, and stop crying.

Later that night, a brown owl landed in Dumbledore's office. It was carrying a letter from Lily, explaining the situation, begging for permission to use her wand to help her sister make her potion. Dumbledore, who was aware of the situation, assured her that she shouldn't worry and complimented her for her great gesture. The next day, Lily woke up hearing screams of joy. Petunia came running, begging her to come to her room. Lily jumped from bed and followed her sister. In her room, both Lily and her parents saw a proud Petunia, holding a small vile, excitingly saying that it works. Their parents were very proud, and Lily looked with a bittersweet smile from the edge of the room.

As the weeks passed, Petunia kept brewing, and Lily would sneak in and enhance the potions. To her surprise, every potion was brewed to perfection. She kept making more advanced potions, and would sometimes wonder why it took so long for the affects to take hold, only to be assured by Lily that her cauldron wasn't like the ones they used in class, so it would take longer (just enough time for Lily to enhance it, that is).

When autumn came, Lily went back to school, and so did Petunia. But she kept coming back from school and brewing every day, as she did before. To her complete surprise, her potions didn't work. She was baffled, so she wrote to her sister about it, hoping to hear an explanation. When Lily saw the letter, she knew she had to confess, so she did. Petunia was furious. Her entire progress was based on a lie. She told Lily how she always had to ruin everything for her, and how she'll never become a successful potions master now. Lily wrote back. She told her sister that although it was true, magic was needed to enhance the potion, it was just a small portion of the whole process. She told her how excited she was that every potion was perfect, and that her sister was on par with some of the best student in Hogwarts, and that she did it all by herself. Petunia said that it didn't matter, as she couldn't make potions by herself, so Lily came up with an idea - every summer, they would make potions together, and once school is over, she will help her sister become the greatest potions master that ever was.

Petunia, still sad, decided to agree with her. And so they did - every summer, they would brew potions together. By the time Lily was getting ready for her O.W.Ls, Petunia was reading books that were meant for 6th and 7th year Hogwarts students. After Lily finished school, she and her sister went traveling, to learn from the greatest potions masters, most of whom didn't agree to teach a muggle and a mudblood. But that didn't stop them.

Many years later, Diagon alley welcomed it's newest store - Evans' Enchanted Elixirs.

** Perhaps Squibs have a device to assist them in maneuvering the magical world since so many things seem to only be activated by magic or present of a magical cord. So perhaps Lily (or that annoying boy Potter trying to get on her good side) sends home a Squib's Crystal, a jewel that when beside a wizard slowly syphons off their ambient magic and stores it to activate the magical properties of Potions, Ruins, Enchanted items and devices, and if raised in the air can summon the Knight's Bus

I mean the ingredients are already a pain to get and clearly magical, so I don't see why she would make that claim.

** There's a few fics that give Petunia just enough magic to brew potions, but not enough to attend Hogwarts.

Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian: linkffn(13308768) Petunia brews potions and does other little bits of magic. The Dursleys are nicer to Harry than in canon on account of magic not being as weird to them, and Dudley being a Wizard (he gets sorted into Hufflepuff).

It's incomplete but updated July 22nd so I don't consider it abandoned.

Another one is There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving: linkffn(13137899)

In this one, Petunia is a "hedge witch" - enough magic to cast a few first-year spells, nowhere near enough to attend Hogwarts. She basically ends up homeschooling herself. Fair warning, Dumbledore is /heavily/ bashed in this one - he's basically Grindelwald but as Headmaster of Hogwarts.

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

** It's a relatively common trope that Petunia is a squib, and thus is capable of making potions. (Squibs have magic --- they can see Hogwarts and Dementors, after all --- they are just unable to access it. In a world where the brewing process leaches the necessary magic from the brewer, squibs can make potions but cannot perform spells, even accidentally.)

*** If we're going purely by that one scene with Figg in the courtroom at Harry's trial: I thought it was heavily implied by the author that Figg in fact could /not/ see the Dementors...only feel their effects. Rowling had Harry think that Figg sounded like someone parroting the description of a Dementor from a textbook whilst she was describing them visually- only growing more confident in the recounting as she moved onto their non-tangible effects

*** Petunia can't be a Squib since Lily is a Muggle-born. therefore her parents are Muggles and therefore they are non magical and therefore they cannot give birth to a Squib (someone defined in the books as non-magical born out of magical parents). The only "magical" thing about Filch is the fact that he has a familiar but otherwise we are not given enough information about him to know what he can or cannot do. Also, with regards to Hogwarts, it is only said to appear as ruins for Muggle seeing it from outside but I would be surprised that during Dumbledore's time, at least, no Muggle-Born had their parents come over (at least Moaning Myrtle's parents came to recover her body) so I think those charms were selective.

**** It depends on how you define squib. If you define squib as somebody born into a magical family who doesn't exhibit magic, then Petunia is not one. If you define squib as somebody with a small amount of magic that can't use it (either accidentally or on purpose), then she can be.
