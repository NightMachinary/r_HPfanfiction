I would love a "Dark" Harry fic where he kills with very little thought, but he isn't insane. Like, he's charismatic and listens to reason and logic.

A big thing I /don't/ want is torture. No second chances. You mess up big enough, you die. Not to say he isn't merciful, no, your death will be swift and your family will have a body to bury. He's not a monster.

I really don't want the dArKnEsS to consume him either. The way I see it, he doesn't really see his actions as evil. He can still cast the Patronus and such because he feels no remorse for the things he's done. I don't want a build up of Harry coming to terms with killing, or worrying about the lack of feeling when he kills. He just kills. Maybe a "hm, so that's what it's like." And then he moves on.

Maybe a post Hogwarts Harry that finds it easy to kill, because he knows that dying is easier than falling asleep.

Idk, I just want a Dark Harry that isn't Voldemort. I want a Dark Harry that is his own Dark Lord. The Boy Who Killed.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: Not only does this Harry relish fighting/killing on the battlefield, but also is bent on launching wars of aggression/conquest. And he is not above manipulating his own family to further his political goals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: This fic depicts a canon Harry who has been pushed too far by the incorrigible establishment of Wizarding Britain. It's not only him who gets progressively more cruel and ruthless though, Hermione, Ron, George, and Neville are all with him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and kill their enemies again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry time travels and kills his enemies again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]]: This powerful Harry/Ginny couple likes to torture their enemies and have rough sex after battles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Together they are unstoppable. Harry finds looting and war profiteering can be quite fun, and Hermione delights in spreading revolutions around.

** It's ongoing and early on, but this one seems to have a ton of potential. It's really well done and the author has said it will get quite dark in time. linkffn(Harry Potter and the perversion of purity)

  AU: Harry Potter was a naive, malleable child when he first entered the wizarding world. What if instead of meeting a good, noble family and being guided towards the light, he met a shadier bunch and was warped and twisted in ways that led to a much darker Magical Britain? Realistic, Dark Harry, Slytherin Harry, Good Dumbledore and Weasleys, Mostly In-Character Harry at the Start

** I don't give a shit what anyone else says, the single best Dark!Harry in the fandom would be Lesser Evils and the WiP sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106769/1/Ascended-Vices][Ascended Vices]], both by ScottPress.

** Shameless self-rec here. Don't know if you're inerested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few cliché tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them. Basically his main motivations are to reunite Voldemort's soul and getting Sirius a trial but he doesn't care much for anything else but Death

Harry will end up at some point staying with the Death Eaters. There will probably be torture (from there side) but Harry won't find enjoyment in it like Bellatrix for example.

He kills people, not feeling very guilty about it, though body counts will only start later in the story

  "A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life.
