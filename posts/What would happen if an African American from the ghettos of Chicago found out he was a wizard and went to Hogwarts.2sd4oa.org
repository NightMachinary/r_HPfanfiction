*** Salem is just outside of Boston, and his mother wanted to get him away from gangs. She figured being hidden in Scotland was as far from his 'brothers' in the Vice Lords and still have him taught in English.

***** Don't act like it's impossible. Draco mentioned that he wanted to go to Durmstrang, except his mother didn't like the idea of him being so far away. Choice is relevant, and the mother of a kid about to be lost into the gangs is likely to want the least gang-active area for their child. If they have the option for a more rural school and the scholarship is paid either way, of course she'd say 'Hogwarts'.

****** I don't understand why you're so invested in this. If you're interested in a fic concerning an American going to Hogwarts, I could tentatively recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse Of Truth]]. It's *far* from perfect, and the idea of an OC flirting with Hermione reeks of desperate wish fulfillment (and makes me queasy), but there is no finer example of self-insertion among fanfics - making it the least rotten apple of a very bad bunch. The OC isn't described as /not/ being black, so I guess that might fit your bill.

My wat is directed at several of the bizarre elements in your post. What are Vice Lords, how do they add conflict to the story, and what motivates their actions? You take it for granted that we'd know the intricate components of some silly world you've made up. How would we know that??? Why on earth would you conflate gang activity in Muggle Chicago with a school in Magical Boston? There is very little about Hogwarts that I'd describe as rural. The wide diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is certainly more akin to urban environmental tropes than insular rural ones.

******* You asked why a black kid in America would go to Hogwarts- I gave you a scenario that would explain it. As for Hogwarts being urban, you need to brush up on the terminology. 400 students and a dozen teachers. Maybe 200 residents in Hogsmeade. That isn't a city, or even a country estate with neighboring market towns.

It's a cloister. An isolated near-religious retreat. A freakin' bunker. NORAD is jealous.

As for the mention of the Vice Lords, they're a significant gang presence in Chicago. They fit better as the threat for corrupting a black kid in an economically-depressed urban pocket of Chicago instead of the Latin Kings, who, you might infer, are primarily Latino.

I like to play with ideas, and the contrast of a kid raised in a very different and depressingly real environment being sent into the midst of our fantasy playground... it's /interesting/.

**** How is Salem any different? The magical community might as well be another dimension for how secretive and well-hidden it is.

Also, it's just not going to happen. You cannot freely choose your school, especially not one in another country! You need to be invited to get into Hogwarts and they only accept British citizens.

***** Aside from the fact it's called the Salem Witches Institute, we have no further information to judge it on... and neither does our candidate's mother. All she knows is that Salem is where they burned witches, and it's in Boston which is another big city, which means there are gangs there, too. If she has the option and no difference in cost to her, she'd send her son abroad.

We also have no information to suggest that Hogwarts /wouldn't/ take a foreign student- for all we know, the Patils, Cho Chang and Blaise Zabini are all far from home.

All of this is just collecting the building blocks of fanfiction- the writer has to start with 'this thing is different' and work from there. An American student is, to me, much more plausible than a gay Snape. His whole story in canon is about pining for decades after a hot girl who was nice to him.

It's not "in Boston", it's in Salem and a magically isolated area of Salem at that. There are no gangs in magical Salem.

She doesn't have the option, Hogwarts is invitation only and British citizens only.

We do have information about how the Hogwarts selection process works, it's on the wikia. We also know for a fact that everyone there is British or Irish and this includes all the students you mentioned.

A good starting point asks the question "What if this alternative happened at this critical point in the story?" it intrigues the reader with alternate possibilities but plays it straight so that the readers always think "this could have actually happened"

A bad starting point just proposes flat-out impossible canon-breaking ideas. Proposing this doesn't make me say "wow this is interesting, I never thought about that.", it only makes me say "man, this is stupid. That could never happen."

** Severe culture shock. He'd be considered a curiosity for a week or two and then have to adapt. Lucky Hogwarts has a strong students to teacher ratio and they want their students to succeed, that type of attention would very beneficial for someone with a low income Muggle background. Any negative behaviour that doesn't gell with the standards of the school or British wizarding society would be dealt with pretty swiftly.

*** This is 1990 rap was only really getting started then. It was no where near the big deal it is today.

I doubt Salem is the only school in America, its way too big for only 1 school and that on the east coast. I could see one maybe in the Southern States or Florida. Midwest/Texas/California/Seattle and one or 2 in Canada also.

**** I think you mean rap was just getting discovered in middle-America in 1990. Rap was extremely popular in the African American community outside of New York by the early-mid 80's. Sugar Hill Gang, Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-D.M.C., Whodini, Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, U.T.F.O., etc. etc. all had hits before 1985. Heck, even Blondie rapped in Rapture which came out like 1981 and she mentions Fab 5 Freddie (who hosted MTV Raps for a time) and Grandmaster Flash.
