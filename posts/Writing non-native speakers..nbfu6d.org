Given how popular a character Fleur is, and how often the triwizard tournament is covered, there are lots of fanfics which have people speaking English despite not being fluent. Other than the often outrageous accents, a common way that authors show this is to have them drop words from their native language into their sentences.

The thing is, I feel that they often switch the wrong words. For example Fleur will never use the word 'yes', but 'oui'. Yet the rest of the sentence will be perfectly translated. As I seriously doubt she doesn't know the English for 'oui', as that is one of the first words you learn in another langauge, that must be deliberate. While I am not good at foreign langauges, when I studied them a bit at school, I would only tend to lapse back into English if I tried to use a word I didn't know, otherwise I would have to mentally 'switch gears' constantly. This may be different if you are at a higher level than I was.

While I get that it is a way to remind the reader that they are foreign without having to go to the effort and confusion of putting in obscure french/bulgarian words which the characters might genuinely get stuck on, I do find this sometimes just feels weird.


** My best language at this point in my life is English. Even when having a full conversation in Portuguese, my immediate reaction to agreement is "yeah", or "yes".

I'll often say "yeah, sim [continue in Portuguese]". It's just a very quick reaction before the brain really kicks in.

Fleur never does it in the books. At least when I type "oui" into the kindle books, it never comes up. But I can see why a fanfic writer would do it. It does remind the reader of a french speaker, while not having to mess around with the accent

** As a person who's second language is english, the best way to represent non-fluent english speakers is to stop mid-sentence and try to remember what the word your thinking is in english. For example,

"Hey, can you uhh, pass me the, that, thing, yung* uh, g, gobent? OH, GABLET**."

/'yung' means 'the' in my native language, Filipino. */that means goblet in the "Filipino-English" (don't know what to call it) accent.

*** Precisely, you slip back if you aren't sure of the word, so for the more niche words rather than 'yes' or 'with'. The problem is that by definition these are the words the reader won't know in the 'foreign' language so you just end up being confusing (unless that is deliberate).

**** I'm still processing what are the words you just said but (bear with me if my understanding is incorrect) we don't speak or whisper the filler words super often. And yeah, I agree, less 'foreign' words is less confusing.

(And oh yeah, to add to my original comment, the pauses can be so long you just brush it off sometimes or describe what you want to say in more simple words)

***** I am probably just not being clear. If you are not completely fluent in a language, slipping back into your native langauge for a word every now and then can be quite common. IMO this is normally because you don't know (or immediatly rember) the correct translation, so it is usually unusual words which you don't come across much or idioms. But when authors write 'foreigners' speaking, they normally revert back for common words which the reader is likely to understand, but also the speaker would definitely know the translation of, so it doesn't break the flow, which I can find jarring.

*** When I speak in my second language and don't know a word I sometimes end up describing what it is, or does. Best example I can think of was the time I asked a hotel receptionist if the hotel had "a machine for the washing of clothes." A Dutch friend of mine, after sweeping a floor, asked where I kept the... the... and then mimed a dustpan and brush.

** I think the reason that those words are used as the ones switched is because they're the ones that are recognizable to non-speakers of that language - eg, if you asked english speakers for what French words they knew, "oui", "bonjour", and "Merci" are probably going to be towards the top. So inserting them in doesn't require any research, and can be fairly comfortable knowing that whoever is reading will probably know what it means.

It's not the most realistic, obviously - but at the same time, realistic/accurate descriptions of accents is... meh, in written text. Same with actual conversation - we pepper in pauses, /uhmmms/, and other verbal noise that sounds fine when in a conversation, but does not read as well - because they get overemphasized in the writing.

Personally, I'd rather authors stuck to not using overcomplicated words & adding in signifiers from time to time about the accent (eg, 'Fleur said in her pronounced accent'), rather than trying to make every sentence filled with accents or random words from the other language.

** Slightly off topic, but I am a native English speaker and also Scottish and I can tell you I find it so cringey when someone tried to type the Scottish accent. Honestly, it's the worst.

Also, wee tip, if you are going to use words that sound 'Scottish' or 'foreign, google them first. I recently read a fic where a character was called MacFusty. Ok, it might sound Scottish but it means 'Son of Damp Smelling.

** I usually write Fleur as speaking perfect English but she'd occasionally throw in a "Baguette", "ooh-la-la", "sacre bleu", "tour Eiffel" but otherwise she'd just maybe forget the "H" and pronounce her r's as French r's.

** In general, I think the best method is to simply mention the accent. However, when the character gets upset or highly emotional, toss in a French word, rather than try to display the accent.

In my experience, people who swear, even if completely fluent, slip into their mother tongue, for instance. :)

** I write her (and Hagrid and others) in normal standard English and just add “she said with heavy French accent”. Anything else makes me feel like belittling non-English speakers (and yes, I am a non-native English speaker myself, so I am a bit oversensitive about it).

** I decided to write my Fleur without an accent. By the time my fic takes place, Fleur has been working for Gringotts and with British wizards for a good while, and I feel she is smart and proficient enough to work it out of her English.

That being said, she does intentionally use words like 'oui' and 'non', 'papa' and 'maman' and phrases like 'mon amour' and 'mon chérie'. And she is known to switch over when she's very emotional, but she tends to catch herself quickly.

** I have had this exact thought! People are substituting in the words they're most likely to know, like if Fleur is saying “oui,” she's making the intentional decision.

I agree with everyone's comments that it's better to just mention an accent or have them search for niche words. Writing accents has really gone out of style in original fiction nowadays, but HP ff still has it because HP had it.

I've never written Fleur specifically, but I wrote a chapter where a British character is in France recently. Essentially what I did is have the French original characters speak English very well but speak slowly and deliberately and get confused when the native English speaker talked too fast or used some idioms, because my experience with study abroad has been that students from most European countries are MUCH better at English than native English speakers in schools that teach in English are at their foreign language of choice. The British character would occasionally mistake similar words or conjugate verbs incorrectly, use the noun form, etc. when trying to speak French.

I don't think I'd try even that for something other than a Romance language because I wouldn't be confident enough in the standard mistakes people make. If a character weren't confident in their proficiency (unless it's a British or American character being played for laughs), I also wouldn't even try. I'd probably just use a modifier like “clumsy” and keep the mistakes vague.

But yeah, it strikes me as really lazy when people just throw in the few words they know because those are the words that someone who is pretty close to fluent definitely knows. You can get in some fascinating holes if you research this stuff too. I casually googled to see what “ghostwriter” was in French and spent so long reading about it. And I'm really glad I did because I think any native English speaker would be really uncomfortable saying that word and got a good moment out of it (although realistically any native English speaker would probably just translate “ghost” and “writer” separately, which might also be correct).

** It serves a practical purpose, which is to remind someone that the speaker is speaking with an accent without having to format the accent.

It's also not entirely without precedent, because some people who are bilingual do, in fact, occasionally put a word in, though normally it's not simple words, but complicated ones. However, that reversal is also largely out of necessity: it's easy to insert and properly use simple words like yes or sorry, it's much harder to insert and properly use obscure or difficult words that someone who speaks multiple languages might trip up on.

It's an understandable methodology to lean on, non?

** If anyone is writing a french character (yes including Fleur) and needs help for their accent etc, send me a message. For the exemple, most french people have trouble with what we call diphtongue. E.G: in French, you don't accentuate any part of the sentence except the very end. You rarely accentuate mid-word. Which is the thing that cause most trouble with english for us poor froggies. Like, 'the', most of the time, at least in my case, i will more or less overaccentuate the end of 'the' than the begining. which means that I say "Zhy" rather than "The" But the begining of the word is much less present than the end, because it's not natural for us to accentuate anything else but the end. So it end up being ZhYYYY" rather than what I wrote before.
