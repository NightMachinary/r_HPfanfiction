:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember Harry working in the hospital wing either as an assistant/apprentice to Pomfrey or as detention. The scene is something along the lines of a pair(?) of slytherin girls come in while Pomfrey is gone forcing Harry to deal with them. I think one of them may have been Daphne Greengrass? It's not really an important detail though. Anyway, she has rashes/boils/idk in rather private areas because of some sort of prank soap or something. He treats her while being as professional as possible and when he finishes he "gives her life advice" (pretty sure he used this phrase, he says something along the lines of " medical advice... and now life advice...") which boils down to Harry calling her out on the whole thing being a ploy Malfoy talked her into to try and embarrass and/or blackmail Harry by tricking him into fondling her. He then proceeds to tell her that she needs some self respect and that she'll never be more than a tool to Malfoy etc., etc.

Sorry if I'm a bit all over the place, just wanted to get everything down. I've been googling everything I can remember in different combinations but I can't find it for the life of me. If someone can help me I'd really appreciate it!

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
