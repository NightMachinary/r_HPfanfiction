A while back, I was trawling through the cesspit that is Reddit search to fund new fics to read, when suddenly I came across a link to the titular fic. Intrigued, I clicked on the link, only to find a blank story. Later, I saw a mentioning that the writer was a cult leader. So, can any of you fanfic vets tell me what happened, why it happened and if there are any surviving copies on the internet?

** Andy Blake lies as easily as breathing.

I remember him saying that he was Irish (I actually am from ROI and it was the most godawful, rubbish made up accent - look at Seamus in DAYD - that is actually how he thinks Irish people sound) and fought on both sides of the Troubles, despite the fact that he would have been a teenager at the time!

His writing, while technically competent, lacks heart and relies on tired cliches and shock value. He claims that DAYD is better than anything JKR could ever write and the characters he mangled should really belong to him.

You can read more about his never ending bullshite and general unpleasantness here: [[http://failfandomanon.wikia.com/wiki/Thanfiction]]

#+end_quote

Why is it that this view ("my fanfiction is better than anything JKR could ever write") is so common, especially among big-name fans in HP fanfiction circles? Even though JKR is thoroughly college- and self-educated in literature, whereas the people making these claims usually aren't, or have yet to achieve JKR's level of experience and expertise? It doesn't make any sense to me.

**** Well, you notice a few things that are flaws from your perspective, you see ways to fix them, and you write, and then for a lot of people that gives you an ego. You fixed this one thing in canon to be more to your liking, possibly even better in a sense that the original author would agree with, which proves you the superior author, no?

Of course, the ability to identify and correct one flaw isn't anything near the same as being able to write an overall superior work. I can fix the problem of having a relatively passive protagonist, but my prose kind of sucks, and my characterization is spotty. Except was it a problem for the original series that Harry was kind of passive? It's less suited toward me, but the series has obviously not suffered commercially for it.

******* Various sources one can easily Google, but in a nutshell, most of HPMOR, when you read it, basically comments on "all of the plot holes / things in the series that the author disagrees with J.K. Rowling on" (paraphrasing).

The biggest points are the themes of friendship (Yudkowsky kills off Hermione, Harry's best friend, in later chapters, and writes Ron out of the story altogether as Harry's best friend, belittling Ron in the process) and accepting death (Yudkowsky basically goes, "Voldemort was right all along to want to defeat death [never mind that he only wanted immortality for himself], and Rowling was wrong about accepting it").

Yudkowsky also takes the "intelligent" aspects of Hermione that Rowling has stated in interviews were clearly meant to be exaggerated for satire purposes, i.e. Hermione being "an insufferable know-it-all" in PS/SS, and writes his version of Harry's character as seriously encompassing them "because it makes Harry a much better character" (paraphrasing). Yudkowsky goes on to basically use them in what he views is "making Harry badass, and everyone liking him for being so smart (i.e. [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]])", even though everyone pretty much hates "know-it-all" Hermione, and thinks she's swotty and horribly pretentious and annoying, for the same things in the actual book (PS/SS).

There are also numerous accounts of Yudkowsky belittling, and even directing harassment of, those who criticize or disagree with his assertions and work in turn, while forming a "cult of personality" around himself (LessWrong). The case of what happened with Roko's Basilisk also details Yudkowsky's less-than-stellar actions, and attitudes, towards anyone he disagrees with.

******** I actually was looking for whether or not Eliezer Yudkowsky has specifically made this claim that you mentioned in your comment.

#+begin_quote
  my fanfiction is better than anything JKR could ever write
#+end_quote

Every fanfiction writer has their own take on the story, each of them (Yudkowsky included) writes what appeals to them and hopes that their audience will find it equally appealing. No one would write fanfiction if they thought there was nothing to expand/improve in the story that inspired them.

That does not equate to putting their own work on a pedestal above JKR's writting/characters. Unless they specifically said that. To my knowledge EY never has made that claim. Do you have a source quote in which he stated otherwise?

I have not found any evidence of these claims in my googling. Can you provide a primary source?

Side tangent regarding your description of HPMOR:

Friendship is very important in EY's story, and the [[/spoiler][death]] of an important character actually shows how important that connection is. Especially if you read the final chapter.

Harry is an intelligent protagonist (given a run for his money by other intelligent characters in the fic) because it's an example of the Rationalist genre ([[/r/rational]]). Not everyone likes Rationalist stories. That's fine.

Yup, he has. [[https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][This answer]] goes in-depth, sources (and quotes from Yudkowsky) included.

Also, it appears you didn't look up the incident with Roko's Basilisk, which is pretty clearly explained by a quick Google search of the RationalWiki page. It's also included on the full explanation above.

Googling "Roko's Basilisk incident" also brings up this source:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3jrj3t/whats_the_deal_with_the_whole_rokos_basilisk/]]

Yudkowsky literally banned / censored anyone from talking about Roko's basilisk on LessWrong, because he claimed it "distressed some people". (Which isn't the truth. The real reason is listed on the full, linked answer.)

Likewise, due to Yudkowsky's censorship, this is why people who are "fans" of him "don't talk about it". Because Yudkowsky declared it "taboo", and used his power and authority as a LessWrong founder to forbid open discussion. (Because it offended Yudkowsky.)

One poster says:

#+begin_quote
  *Roko's Basilisk is a noodle incident that turned into a scandal of sorts for EY [because he reacted to it badly].* Everyone on Less Wrong concluded it was a mess and should not have happened and mostly forgot about it. Everyone outside Less Wrong treat it as though it is a core tenant of LW-style rationality, and then point and laugh because it looks kinda like reinventing christian eschitology, but with AI instead of Jesus.
#+end_quote

Another one says:

#+begin_quote
  It's a thought experiment that terrified a bunch of EY's followers a few years back.
#+end_quote

Note how he says EY's /followers/. Not "fans". /Followers/, like he's a cult leader, or something. Based on what I've read from multiple online accounts of him, he seems to honestly believe that he's some sort of Jesus-figure "against the dangers of AI" (among other cult claims, see comments here: [[http://alrenous.blogspot.com/2017/04/basilisk-incident-dumb-or-smart.html]]).

Another poster stated on another thread:

#+begin_quote
  Robin Hanson started the Overcoming Bias blog in 2006, which was him, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom, and a couple of other people. *Eliezer's posts got a cult following*, and in 2009 he branched off to found Less Wrong, which was supposed to be a higher-tech group blog anybody could post to.

Actually, I read through the opinion piece in that link and didn't see any negative quotes from EY. The author of the opinion piece quotes many other random people who strongly dislike LessWrong, HPMOR, EY. etc, but the direct quotes from EY himself are all civil and make no grandiose claims about being better than JKR.

Most of the direct quotes are:

- Random people stating their strong dislike towards EY and towards people who enjoy reading HPMOR.

- Random people making unsubstantiated claims about cultlike activity with no primary sources to back it up.

I did look that up before posting, and I read the [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk][RationalWiki page]]. TL;DR some people had a wacky idea about AI, some other people disagreed, the wacky idea became a meme, and poor community management occurred. Since foobars of community management occur in many online communities, and the LessWrong community at least had the grace to admit it was a mistake, I don't consider it noteworthy.

It's interesting that you only quoted part of that comment, because your omission completely skews the poster's actual message. The [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3jrj3t/whats_the_deal_with_the_whole_rokos_basilisk/curw9w3/][full comment]] is as follows:

  *No one takes it seriously. I can't speculate on why it's still around without being uncharitable.*

  *I have criticisms of Less Wrong. None of them involve Roko's Basilisk or EY, because Less Wrong does not believe in Roko's Basilisk and does not worship EY.*
#+end_quote

Thank you for posting a link to that reddit thread on [[/r/HPMOR]] by the way, because it does contain some interesting and civil discussion, both for and against the silly AI idea, as is normal for an internet community. It's interesting that you picked the only 2 (partially) negative comments out of the 50 total, many of which discussed why the "Basilisk" was silly, why the reaction to it was ill-advised, and why in the long run it is not important.

That was an interesting comment thread, which actually is about the community that grew at the LessWrong website, not about EY. It's neat to see an explanation of how the online rationalist community both grew and dispersed during that time period (2009-2012ish?) Looks like a fairly normal life cycle for an online community of people with only tangentially related interests.

Due to this, I don't see any reason in actually taking this conversation seriously with you (or continuing it) in any regards. You're not giving any respect or credit to someone who's trying to provide their perspective of how they view things, and are brushing off any and all disagreement.

** Infamous fic. Originally a mixed reputation; it was dark and followed Neville, Ginny and Luna's year at Hogwarts after Harry, Ron and Hermione dropped out of school, and Snape's reign of terror flanked by the Carrows and various OCs including a Nazi-esque torture scientist.

Most of the violence was pretty gratuitous and basically any character that wasn't explicitly listed as alive in the canon epilogue was killed off in quite vicious ways, including Cho Chang (crushed), Parvati Patil (dissolved in acid), Romilda Vane (literally cut to pieces by Bellatrix) etc.It was one of the first fics I read as an adult so a lot of the elements have stuck with me.

There was also a sequel which veered into batshit crazy territory with rituals, the UK-Irish civil war, and (I believe) both time travel and sacrifice of Ron and Hermione's unborn child with Ron forced to watch.

Having said all that, it was quite well-written despite the batshit crazy elements, and the stories gained a decent following for a while because certain people felt their depiction of violence and insanity was closer to actual civil war featuring an extremist faction than the perhaps slightly sanitized version JKR presented readers with in Deathly Hallows.

I vaguely feel as well that Thanfiction's Neville started to become a bit of an OC too; by the end he was definitely much more of a hero to his peers /and/ outwardly a leader and competent etc. than canon Harry /or/ the Harry in the story, later on after things came out about the author this became another stick to beat them with.

As to copies, I'm sure there are web archive versions somewhere.

  "Ernie, I'm going to be honest with you ... the only reason Slytherin had the Quidditch Cup all those years before we had Harry as Seeker is because they play dirty. You guys always turn out the best athletes."
