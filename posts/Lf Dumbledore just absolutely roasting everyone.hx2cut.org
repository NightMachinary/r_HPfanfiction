  "Sit down, Harry, and shut the fuck up."

  Dumbledore pulled a cigar to his mouth and inhaled. Then he blew the smoke out, letting it spread throughout the room and form into obscene words.

  Dumbledore pushed him back down, pulled out a revolver, and set it on Harry's chest, the barrel pointing directly at Harry's neck. "What the ---" ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, indeed," interrupted Dumbledore, and he pulled out a long pipe, lit it, and began smoking it in front of Harry as though this was a normal everyday occurance.

*Dumbledore comes into the stage raising his hands...

"Thank you, thank you... Thank you Severus... that was a hell of an intro. The best Potions professor we have had... Good thing you were not into Herbology, as you were not able to keep a single lily alive! Ha!"

*Laughs echo in the back.

"Greasy git!!!" Sirius howled, with both hands next to his mouth to make it louder.

Albus saw him, and pointed in his direction, "Sirius Black! A funny man, people. He has the funniest shit in Facebook. He spends his days there. All alone with his profile picture and writing in walls. Guess not much has changed since your time in Azkaban He!"

*Sirius lost his grin.

"You know what? I'm sorry. My father, Percival, always taught me better. Never laugh at prisoners or unemployed people, he used to say. I should know better. I certainly don't look down at unemployed bloke, granted, werewolves are too tall to look down at... Isn't that right Remus?"

The Marauders ran cold, but the rest of the room was in laughs.

"Sorry, sorry, that was too much on the nose. Wasn't it Tom?"

*Voldemort, who had been laughing, suddenly dropped his smile and glass. He avada kedabraed a waiter who laughed.

*Dumbledore drops his mic and walks down from the stage.

"Fifty points for Gryffindor," the headmaster said, "Dumbledore out."

"Ladies and gents. Albus "I-should've-let-his-hand-rot" Dumbledore" said Snape.

** As I recall, that happens quite a bit in linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby) but it's less a Dumbledore out to roast people and more of a Dumbledore who has completely run out of fucks to give and is waiting for people to call him out on it.

So far, he's disappointed. Haven't read the fic in a while, but the first couple dozen chapters are hilarious IMO.

** "Good evening everyone, I'm glad you could make it." Albus Dumbledore stood in front of a room of people sitting at tables with small candles and colourful drinks. He smiled gently at his audience, hands resting on a podium. "I'm afraid this will not be pleasant for my friends, who have the misfortune of both being the victims of my roast and of being my friends, however, for everyone else, I'm sure you'll have a grand time." He took his time to look out into the darkness, to try to spot his first target.

"Ah, Severus. Good to see that all of your years of studying chiropterology has paid off. One could hardly tell the difference between such an awkward and creepy creature of the night and, of course, bats." He started off, pleased with the chuckles he earned and the glare he could practically feel in the dark pub. "Truly, when you first came to Hogwarts I was certain we had taken on a vampiric student and were in for trouble. I wasn't exactly proven wrong by your utter disdain for sunlight and aversion to mirrors but as soon as I smelled your breath I thought there's no way a student could eat that much garlic and also be a vampire."

"Enjoying tonight so far, Sirius Black? Yes, I recognize that bark anywhere. I also recognized his whimper when I passed a certain alcove at night when he was still in school. In fact, I've heard that particular whine so often, I could pair it with cheese. Say what you will about Sirius being a top dog but when it came to liaison locations, he was a basic bitch." Another laugh but a little louder from his audience, Albus smiled, he was on a roll. "Oh he was a smart student, don't get me wrong, but let's just say I'm surprised there weren't any puppies running around after he left."

"Oh good, I see our golden trio is here. The hero who saved the day and is a true inspiration to all wizardkind and her friends Ron and Harry." A loud guffaw came from that particular table. It was nice to know Ron didn't take it too seriously. "I was sincerely worried during the first half of Harry's first year. I thought we were doomed. Thankfully Ron had the grace of a troll, and defeated one too, and somehow a friendship was born. After that I was certain we would win. If only because they could look at the finely crafted mind games that myself and Voldemort came up to fight each other with and break right through that with all the elegance of a bunch of monkeys with sledgehammers." Another guffaw. "I suppose I'm just glad Harry got to live happily ever after with the love of his life, Ron Weasley. I'm sorry, what's that now?" Albus pretended to hear someone speaking off stage. "What's a Ginny? Is that anything like Gin Rummy?"

"Anyway, I'm afraid that's all for tonight. I thank you all, Gryffindors, Slytherins... And the rest of you. Goodnight!" Albus turned to walk off the stage then doubled back. "Oh and fifty points to Dumbledore."

** Not /everyone/, but there's an excellent scene in Enter the Dragon where he invites Lucius Malfoy to dinner, and proceeds to calmly and politely explain how stupid it was to hand the Diary to a student under Dumbledore's protection, and how if anything of the kind happens again, Dumbledore will ignore due process and evidentiary standards and just bury as many Death Eaters as possible before turning himself in to the courts.
