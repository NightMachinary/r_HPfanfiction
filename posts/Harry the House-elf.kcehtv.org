Harry Potter was always forced to cook, clean the house, do the gardening, and whatever other menial labor that the Dursley's could find.

In the summer before second year, a creature named Dobby who introduced himself as a house-elf tried to stop Harry from going to Hogwarts.

When Harry said that he was going anyways, Dobby apologized to the "Great Harry Potter" before sending a bolt of light at him.

Harry was confused as to what happened when Dobby disappeared. In the next few days, Harry found that his magic felt different, and that he could do things wandlessly. He also found that he was happy to do the labor around the house and was more accepting of his punishments. Needless to say, he was confused.

One day, while he was cleaning the living room Vernon called to him.

"Boy! Get over here and put my jacket in the wash"

Vernon threw his jacket at Harry.

For some reason, when Harry caught it, he felt free, and the irresistible urge to jump around and shout

"Free! Free! Harry is freeee!"


** It's a fun concept, but Vernon accidentally freeing Harry by giving him clothes to wash (and expressing a clear intent to do that, rather than free Harry) is a bit too convenient---and probably contradicts what we see in canon.

*** What I imagine would do it is Christmas. Remember how he sent Harry a old sock?

*** I mean, Lucius's intent wasn't to free Dobby when he threw the sock at him, but it still worked.

**** Lucius didn't have a specific intent, which left Dobby to interpret it as he chose. He could have chosen not to accept the freedom. For comparison, Winky was given clothing with clear intent to free her, so she didn't have a choice.

**** Lucius was discarding the sock as trash. There's a reasonable argument that, implicitly, anyone who caught it was welcome to it. If he'd said, "Dobby, incinerate this," and then thrown it to him, then perhaps it would not have worked the same way.

I tend to agree with turbinicarpus that handing an elf a pile of clothes that clearly remain the property of the master, not for the elf to be allowed to wear, would not qualify.

** I read a fic where Lily cheated on James with Kreacher so if that counts, then Harry is an elf in that fic. Sadly, I cannot remember it.
