The way I see it and have always seen it, is that Fleur is supposedly considered one of the most sexually attractive characters in HP book canon that we know of and that's why she gets paired with Harry. But judging by the amount of people who love it and don't just go looking for smut, I guess I'm wrong. So what else is there?

Side note, it paints a funny image in my head to imagine Bill's reaction to tons of people much preferring the idea of Harry being with his wife than him.


** Fleur is from another school and named in the canon books, so authors have a lot of creative liberties when writing her. The best Harry/Fleur stories I have read make them similar ages, and do a really comprehensive job of creating a new universe. I hate horribly constructed and unimaginative veela plot devices just as much as the next person (Harry being the only one to resist 'allure', Harry helping Fleur cope in Britain because people see her as non-human). But in general she is a very attractive French girl (whats not to like?), and a really cool heroine to read about.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]

- This one's pretty good. It's got a bit of bashing and Harry becoming overpowered, but it's an interesting read, it's well written, and it updates regularly which is a lot more than most fics can say.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts]]

- This one's great. Premise is that Harry becomes a pickpocket while living at the Dursleys. It is unfortunately dead, but it's still great. Harry ends up unknowingly marrying Fleur, teaches Gabrielle how to be a cat and steals everything that isn't nailed down (and some stuff that is).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]

- No, this isn't that Robst fic, this is a good one. Harry isn't the boy wholived, AND he isn't the "wrong boy who lived." Harry gets raised by Remus, goes into Ravenclaw, is overpowered by a fair bit, and is a hilarious asshole. He's also a couple of years older than in canon, so he and Fleur are the same age. This one's well written, it's the fic that made me start shipping Fleur and Harry, and it's got bottomless bottles of Coke. It's dead though.\\

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864381/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Veela]]

- Here's a similar fic, except it's a wrong boy who lived one. Basically the same thing. Starts in 4th year. I'm not as big a fan of this one. It doesn't have bottomless Coke bottles or internal monologues about the morality of kicking small children to ward off fangirls. On the bright side, it isn't dead. Probably.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]]

- All you need for this one is the summary. It's a great fic.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

- This story is fucking spectacular. Like 10 out of fucking 10 spectacular. It's got phenominal world building going on. Reading it feels like your smoking something. I really can't praise this fic enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]]

- This one's odd. It's got Dumbledore making Harry his apprentice. For some reason I can't remember, this makes Harry a target for the magical world's equivalent of the Illuminati.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate]]

- Here's a happy fic that ships Harry and Fleur's little sister! :D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy]]

- AND, since I've posted so many other fics, here's a much happier one that doesn't have any shipping in it! It's even canon compliant! Brilliant!

Edit: And of course, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]. Wherin Harry acquires his father's memories and the best sorting hat knowing to fanfiction.

Edit 2: I managed to forget [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]]

- The Harry/Fleur ship is secondary in this fic to the rarely seen Tonks/Lord Voldemort pairing. Voldemort is the main character and yes, he is Harry's brother. On a side note, this fic has one of the best endings I've ever read. Just sit and think about it for a minute when you finish.

********* Eh, well, I didn't say it was mean. I'd actually already read both “Playmate” and “A Promise From Her Boy” before you recommended them and my knowledge of those stories combined with the whole “evil, evil fiend” (which I'm pretty sure was a joke reply anyway) combined with your “Yup!” made me try to make a reply in the same tone.

So yeah, I'd tried to make a joke and failed yet again; sorry about that. Still, the last one is appreciated since I've not read it before and I like female Harry stories if they are done well. And if you being evil means you'll be recommending stories like the aforementioned two, then by all means please be evil.

But Fleur is a competent, attractive, foreign witch who enters the story around the time Harry would start looking at girls.

** I prefer Harry/Fleur as my main ship, it is, guiltily, for the main reason that Fleur is suppose to be the hottest girl in the universe, and that can leads to some good stories. Their dynamic can be a fun and interesting one. She is confident, sometimes arrogant, and Harry is somewhat naive and shy. In a lot of the H/F stories, the good ones, Fleur helps Harry come out of his shell and become more confident. "The Lie I've Lived" is probably the biggest one I can think of; while, personally, I prefer "When a Veela Cries". There are numerous others of course but those two are the ones that really stick in my mind when I think of H/F.

** I feel like you asked such an open-ended question. It's like asking what the appeal is of asking any specific pairing.

Personally, I like her because we know so little of her character. She's so malleable much like Daphne Greengrass, so we are able to leave it up to the author to depict said characters however they wish.

She's an older woman who is not as affected by his fame.

She has political connections that can be useful.

Veela is an interesting concept that deserves more exploration, and unless you want to dx Gabrielle into being older, or are into young girls... Fleur is the choice to explore it. (I prefer Gabby)

** One of the big draws for me in that pairing is that she hasn't been around for Harry's past adventures - so he gets to humble brag and impress the pretty girl.

Other OC characters can satisfy that requirement too, but Fleur is sort of unique among HP characters in that she is from another country so can be excused to know nothing at all about him, but unlike many OC characters she knows enough about magic world to understand the full scope and all the nuances of his adventures.

Imagine first telling a new muggle character "this 11 year old took out a troll" or "this 12 year old took down a basilisk" or "I had to fend off a hunting pack of dementors" or my personal favorite "when I first screwed up in school, as my punishment the teachers gave me a cowardly dog for escort and sent me out into the Dark Forest to look for whatever was hunting down and killing unicorns there. I found it, but unfortunately wasn't able to take it down before it escaped... that first time".

It all sounds impressive, but only a person who grew up in the magic world would get the nuance of just how impressive. She also has the potential of coming from a slightly more 'sane' society. The fact that in the book she first wasn't impressed with Harry at all and made that pretty clear adds to attraction - what guy hasn't dreamed of that new hot girl who took him for a loser at first meeting to than have to utterly reverse that opinion?

I would guess that this particular kind of wish fulfillment would resonate on some level with any hetero guy on the planet.

** Like others mentioned, Fleur is intelligent/talented -- at least more so than a majority of Beauxbaton students, she's got political connections (HP people love politic plots), has a beautiful name, is beautiful, isn't going to act like a lovesick fan around Harry, isn't that shallow (see: after Bill gets mauled by a werewolf), is part creature.

All in all, JKR left a damn near Mary Sue-able character in her world.

The Daphne Greengrass thing is more irritating because people make her background up. Ice princess? I always imagined her as an above average attractive but quiet and fairly unremarkable girl.
