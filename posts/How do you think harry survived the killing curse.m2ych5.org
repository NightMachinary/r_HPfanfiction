I think lily also cast the killing curse or had muggle explosives my logic being maybe two killing curses hitting could in theory blow everything up and reflect off each other making lily's curse hit harry but since you have to mean it and she was sacrificing herself to would barely scar harry of course that's a headcanon and a big stretch the most likely thing is canon events with muggle explosives blowing up after the curse hit Voldemort and that's why there was no body but of course that doesn't explain why lily is ok although I assume she could have protected her and Harry's body even in death as evidenced by Harry's protection

** Muggle explosives make no sense at all, Harry would've died too. Lily didn't have a wand when Voldemort was about to kill her

*** Lily didn't have a want when protecting harry from explosions the "power of love" could have protected her after death obviously these are untrue as far as canon is concerned

** The real answer is that Lily Potter placed a Reverse Uno Card on Harry.
