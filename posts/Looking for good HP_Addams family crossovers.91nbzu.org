Are there any good HP/Addams family crossovers that are long and good without slash?

** Jeconais' series Perfect Slytherins is very good. The first year is here: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/]] and there are four years in total.

** Oml the harveste Addams series is the best kind of trash [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6343441/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Sorceror-s-Stone]]

** kyaru-chan has written a few fanfictions (book 1 - 5 i think) about Harry being a Addams.

Else there's only the already linked When Harry met Wednesday, which is great.
