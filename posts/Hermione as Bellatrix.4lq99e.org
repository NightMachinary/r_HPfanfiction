So, this is my first ever new reddit post. Sorry if I did it wrong, but are there any fics out there where Hermione becomes the equivalent of Harry's Bellatrix? You know psychopathic murderer or whatever?


** Speaking of Hermione, I feel she was more of the mastermind, dark lord/lady, Tom Riddle type personality.

--------------

Ginny, on the other hand, seemed to have a lot more in common with Bellatrix:

- Completely loyal to her love

- Absolutely devoted to her cause

- Reasonably intelligent

- Magically powerful

- Easily angered

- Prone to aggression and violence

Considering how her sisters Andromeda and Narcissa turned out to be, I highly doubt that Bellatrix was born evil.

Voldemort, in his earlier times, was charismatic, convincing, persuasive, and handsome. What Voldemort preached was also in line with Bellatrix' family ideology, so she was probably groomed to fangirl him (just like Ginny was brought up to 'like' Harry). As a result, she chose Voldemort as her love, and she became a monster herself.

If these two persons had their upbringings swapped, we would very likely have had a Ginevra Lestrange who was Voldemort's chief enforcer and a Bellatrix Weasley who became great Harry Potter's wife.

**** In *The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971), although not as insane and cruel as Bellatrix, Ginny definitely played the role of Harry's ruthless enforcer. As for the story itself, it began with Muggles surprising and seriously threatening the survival of Magicals. Under Harry's leadership, they built a magical spaceship and headed out for stars. This fic is a nice merging of magic and technology, and they went through heck of an adventure. The ending was pretty sad though, but there was always A NEW HOPE!

****** This is hilariously shit. From "Avrada Kevrada" to the endless walls of unreadable crap, every chapter starting with "and now... its... "SHOWTIME!""

This might very well be the worst fic I've ever read. It's an abomination.

EDIT: in the author's notes of chapter 24, the author actually forbids you from "stealing" his characters. he thinks his grotesque versions of Harry and the others ("Jester King Harry", anyone?) are so good that other people actually want to use them. And he, a fucking fanfiction "writer", doesn't want that to the point where he thinks it's a shame he doesn't have any legal basis to enforce his copyright.

** Not exactly what you are looking for, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste]]) in the later parts of the series gets pretty close.

Don't know how much I can tell without spoiling too much, but she becomes a bit unhinged as the story progresses (well, Addams Family level unhinged, but since it is Addams Family crossover it may not look like much in comparison).

Overall it's pretty nice series, every part is longer than the previous (starting 5k with the prologue/pilot and getting to 80k at OotP), but HBP one hasn't been updated since November 2011 and looks abandoned.\\
Still, I enjoyed it very much and is the only Addams Family/Harry Potter crossover I've read that does not ship Harry/Wednesday. I know, Wednesday is awesome, but it's refreshing to read a fic where they are just siblings.

  COMPLETE - Dark Volmione Short - Post-War - They all won but somehow, for Hermione, it wasn't at all how it was made out like it was going to be. A slighted woman is a dangerous thing. To slight the brightest witch of the age? Possibly more so.
