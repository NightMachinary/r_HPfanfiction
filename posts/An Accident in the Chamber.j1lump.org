The 29th of May, 1993. The Chamber of Secrets. The split second between the Basilisk fang piercing the pages of the Diary and the subsequent agony of the Horcruxes destruction, Tom Marvolo Riddle recognises that he is SCREWED.

He can feel the dissolution of his very being in the milliseconds that follows the Basilisk venoms entrance into the equation. Far too late for the genius prodigy (that would have later become a Dark Lord) to do anything but curse and watch.

Unbeknownst to him however, he WAS doing something. Instinctively with results he would never get to see...

Roughly an hour after Fawkes, Ginny and Harry had vacated the Chamber /she/ popped into being.

In his final moments, Tom had instinctively reached out for anything and everything that could save his life. Magic reaching out for more magic, in the hopes of staving off the inevitable.

Of course, the main source was Ginny. Comatose but still linked to Tom by their fracturing link, he drained as much magic as he could in the moments he had left.

He also did so to Harry.

Though the link to possess him had never solidified in the same way it had for Ginny, he had still set up a small psychic presence from the boys brief exposure to the book. Allowing him mere moments to siphon power from the very being that was murdering him.

The girl was in her mid to late teens, hair sleek and black as Tom's but down to her hips and an uproarious mess. Almond shaped eyes a gentle mix of hazel and bottle green. Skin pale, as if sun deprived, inspected curiously by its possessor.

Somehow, she found her way out. She stole clothes from an absentee seventh years locker in the Quidditch pitch and fled the school.

Unnamed, but working on it, a young lady with the knowledge and memories of the Darkest Wizard in centuries but the temperaments (and memories) of his two latest victims. Escaping to make a life for herself, free from the responsibilities of her "parents" .

▪︎▪︎▪︎

She is eventually dragged into the war of course, because story needs drama. But she attempts to remain neutral for as long as possible, even as she literally is the lovechild of the two biggest players of either side...


** Is this a prompt or a self promo? This sounds like it could be very interesting

** This sounds like it could be interesting: even more so if you consider that this new girl is, essentially, Harry and Ginny's /daughter/.

*** That's the plan, she'll look physically older (as Tom was in his late teens) but angst and mischief ensues as she refuses to call them anything other than Mum and Dad.

**** ...Oh God, the Parent Trap situation.

"...You do realize I'm thirteen and she's twelve, right?"

Ginny blinked and quickly slapped his arm, making him wince. "Don't mind him: he doesn't know what he's saying."

Yeah, Ginny was still fangirling at that age, heh.
