I know there are lots of fics of questionable quality out there where Harry is somehow Merlin's heir, or Merlin visits him in his dreams or some such. Harry is immediately granted immense power.

I'm not looking for a fic like that.

I'm looking for fanfics where Harry is on the way to becoming, or has become the next Merlin. It needs to be done in a reasonable, at least somewhat believable and "realistic" way.

The best example I can think of at the moment is Blindness - Harry is becoming extremely powerful and breaking the limits of what is thought to be possible.

Of course, this Harry is kind of cheating with his "Blindness". I'm pretty sure there are more than a few wizards & witches who would happily gouge out their own eyes for it. But that's okay, maybe Merlin cheated too.

I suppose For the Love of Magic could count as well.

Any recommendations?

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

In ALJH we have a Harry who happens to be a girl. It's the difference between a Fic that was written around a pairing, and a fic that happens to have a specfic pairing down the line. Sure, it influences the plot, but it's not like the whole world wraps around that.

**** Yeah sorta. I guess it is kinda annoying that he encounters every famous historical wizard and that they all want Harry to be able to use their magic. But it doesn't really do anything too bad to detract from the story IMO, it's tedious sometimes because there really isn't much of a point as far as I can see. Even before they all start doing it, he's already one of the very best and certainly the most knowledgeable wizards in the world; it doesn't really make sense why he agrees to all that other than to kill time and to learn something new, which sort of makes sense in universe, but like I said it does get tedious to read.

But my main point is that all that nonsense isn't really a bunch of wish fulfillment stuff and that it doesn't make him OP.

This phrase drives me crazy. It so overused it's become a cliche all of it's own and it makes me not want to read the stories that contain it! Stories with Manipulative Dumbledore smack of paranoia and being written by people who secretly smoke to defy their parents and teachers with a "that will show 'em" attitude.

** Semprini's has a series where by the end Harry has discovered a whole new way of doing magic, essentially reaches enlightenment, revolutionizes the way wizards are taught magic, and is absolutely considered the Merlin of his time. I enjoyed it a lot, and thought the author did a good job of making Harry's progress believable. it was written pre-HBP so is not canon compliant with anything past OotP.

**** I read it, mostly because I thought the emphasis on runes was interesting like how in The Name of The Wind, Kvothe is an Artificer which is kinda the same and that was pretty interesting.

I don't think it's very good, I'd call it average on all counts, but somehow everyone still recommends it. If I had to guess, it's because some of the way magic is described is much better than in canon. There's more too it than the "swish and flick", also that it's kinda a wish fulfillment story where Harry gets sort of OP.

All in all, it's not worth reading if you're hoping to find anything unique, but that doesn't make it terrible. It has Harry/Luna which I was excited about since that is never a pairing that happens, but Luna in this story could be substituted for anybody else. I think Luna is hard to write well if she is more than a side characters, and in this she is #2 to Harry and she doesn't sound like Luna at all. It has a whole "masked vigilante kills death eaters" thing, and it's one of the worse ones that I've read. I don't really remember the overall writing quality, but I don't remember it being great; dialogue was passable, plot was passable, I don't think I've ever heard anyone claim it was amazing.
