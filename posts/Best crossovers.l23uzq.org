Just wondering what you consider to be the best crossovers in the fandom. I've read some but they all seem to be major fix fics and I'm looking for something to read today


** The Denarian Renegade and its sequels are are all fantastic. It actually introduced me to The Dresden Files, which has like 17 or 18 full length novels written by the insanely talented Jim Butcher that I highly recommend for any fans of urban fantasy.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

** Not really a crossover but linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) was a Handmaids Tale HP world.

Now, while this story was brilliant, very well written with a great arc and set up I do recommend it with caution. Its a Handmaids Tale story. Therefore it is veeery difficult to read a times with a lot of warnings so I wouldn't read it unless your ok with reading about enslavement and gruesome war things basically.

But it was very very good. I haven't read anything else like it and it is in my top 10. But again, mind yourself. =)

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

** Darkness Reborn; linkffn(13485808)

Fem Morgoth (Harry's twin) x Sauron (Harry/Jon Snow). HP x Lord of the Rings x Game of Thrones. Evil MCs. Dlow to start and may get turned off early, but really becomes good after chapter 9. Complicated to explain but makes sense when read. Highly recommend.
