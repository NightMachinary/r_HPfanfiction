Something happens to Fry so he is unable to help Nibbler and his people in the future, they do find a suitable replacement in Harry Potter, due to his magic protecting him from Delta waves. Harry hops in the cryo tube and wakes up in the future. Harry also gets the career chip for a "Troubleshooter"

It was recent but not under the Futurama Crossover section. Please help
