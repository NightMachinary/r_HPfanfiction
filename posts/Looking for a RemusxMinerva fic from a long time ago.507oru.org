Hey everyone! I'm looking for an old (I think I read it about 11-12 years ago) fic where, during third year, Remus and Minerva get together. I remember it was (or seemed) rather angsty. I think it was from Remus' perspective, it may have switched PoV though.

All I can really remember is at the end, it doesn't work out because he resigns after everyone finds out he's a werewolf, just like in canon.

Thanks in advance all!
