Hey. I read behind blue eyes by elmembrila awhile back and it is still one of my favourite reads. Looking for fics that are similar in regards to running away, summer adventure/romance, etc. I've searched in this sub but the last thread related to my query was a few years ago. So figured I'd ask :)

Thanks!!
