I was thinking about Neville tonight and realized I haven't read any Neville-centric fics in probably a decade even though he's one of my favorite characters.

Anybody have any recs for great Neville fics? Gen, het, and slash are all welcome, but no Death Eater pairings, please. (Draco is okay if redeemed or trying to redeem himself.)


** My two favorites are linkffn(The Cactus and the Toad; Becoming Neville)

The POV of "The Cactus and the Toad" is half Snape, half Neville. There aren't any pairings.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  With a sly smile he eyed the time turner. It gleamed like gold, just the way the Malfoys liked it. With this, he could save his son. He went for the door but came to a sudden halt when realization hit him: With the time turner, he could save more than one person. (Draco-centric time travel fanfiction, 3rd year)

** linkffn(You'll be the death of me) Isn't DE pairing, but its a Malfoy (OC sister). Its really really good, if you like slow paced romance (the romance itself isn't slow paced, but the story is) with twists of angst and drama and overall teenage reactions to things, where they blow stuff up out of proportions, but still being fair to their characters. There's also a few cool interactions with Harry, because Neville likes "the other side" and stuff. If its not your thing, that's fine.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.
