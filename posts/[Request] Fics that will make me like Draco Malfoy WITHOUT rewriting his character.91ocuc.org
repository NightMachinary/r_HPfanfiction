I pretty much see Draco as boringly irredeemable. Most fics I've read have him either a) get steamrolled at every opportunity just so the main character can rub their superiority in his nose or b) magically turn into [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in leather pants]]. Are there any fics that don't downplay his racism and other faults (or turn into the whole "purebloods are actually right" shtick) but still manage to develop him into a compelling or interesting character?


** I liked Draco's portrayal in linkffn(The Malfoy case). Its a Malfoy/Astoria fic that focuses on Malfoys trial after the war. The fic did a great job with his character and described the trial in a realistic way (The author clearly has some knowledge of the court system which shows).

I also liked Exile which another poster recommended. It was a good take on clueless wizard having to navigate and figure out the muggle world.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

Tea and No Sympathy by who_la_hoop is another good one.

Helix by Saras_Girl [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812]] doesn't do a bad job either but it's Harry's POV, so I suppose what she's really captured there is Draco through the eyes of a pretty in-canon Harry. It's good though!

Ironically, his character is more like an honest version of Draco from canon: he freely admits the reason he wants to join the Death Eaters is because of his father, and decides not to because Voldemort treats him like garbage.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834182/1/The-Little-King-s-Road][The Little King's Road]] by Lily-lamaire. I want to say that this is one of the most original, but closely cannon story that I have ever came across. The fic takes a fresh perspective of Draco and /kept/ him in character in the form of his prat-ish view of the world. He does not even realize what he was getting into. Another bonus that got me hype was the fact Draco is learning about Regulus' story and that was when he begins to opens his eyes. Sadly, it has not updated in awhile.

  When fifth year Draco Malfoy becomes the only wizard to learn what exactly has become of Regulus Black, he makes a vow. Never will he share the traitorous Death Eater's fate. Yet every choice he makes - siding with the light, siding with the dark, siding with only himself - seems only to prod him further along that path.

** Draco is interesting if he's written well. I like writing him as a bit cowardly but also fiercely loyal to the ones he loves.

These stories mostly have an A plot of HG/SS, but Draco is mostly in the B plot or has a large role.

Also, there is a Dramione story I read awhile back that was incredibly intense and involved them being trapped in a crevasse for over a week, but I simply cannot find it. It really does Draco justice, without minimizing his positive or negative qualities.

  No one knows that they are missing. No one knows where they are. No one knows that they are trapped. No one knows that they are dying. Dramione. WINNER for Best Drama/Angst and Best Tragedy in the Winter 2017 Dramione Fanfiction Awards!
