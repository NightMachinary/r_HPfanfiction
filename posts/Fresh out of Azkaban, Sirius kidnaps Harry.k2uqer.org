Sirius just randomly grabs Harry and apparates away or sth. Does it happen before or after the Marge Incident? Idk it's up to you. Is he alone when it happens or on a shopping trip with the Weasleys? The possibilities are endless! What happens then, how does everyone react? Let's find out:)


** Is pre-Hogwarts fine? Linkffn(innocent by marauderlover) There's also linkffn(forging destiny by white angel of auralon) that one, and its sequel, have some bashing. I don't remember how heavy, though, as its been about 8 years since I've even thought about them.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Sirius broke out of Azkaban with the intention of hunting down Wormtail. He stops by Surrey just to take a quick look at Harry. Just a glimpse to see if he's okay. He won't stop, he won't talk to him... Then Vernon Dursley wraps his hands around Harry's throat and any plan he had is out the window. But Remus will help. Sirius has Harry, he has a way to make Remus listen. He has to...

** This should be close enough, Regulus Black stuns both Harry & Sirius & brings them to 12 Grimmauld Place after Harry runs away from the Dursley's after inflating Marge. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13070707/1/Secrets-Keepers-Collision-Course]])

  When Harry ran away from the Dursleys after blowing up Aunt Marge he never got on the Knight Bus or to Diagon Alley. Instead, he found himself in 12 Grimmauld Place with Sirius and Regulus Black and boy do they have something to say about how his life looked up until now. Contains manipulative!Dumbledore.
