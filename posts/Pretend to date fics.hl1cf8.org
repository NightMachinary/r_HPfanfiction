Hi, I'm in a bit of a sappy mood and would like you to throw your 'omg look, they pretend to date but then they develop feelings for real awwww' fics.

My favourite pairing is Haphne, but will go for anything. Thus I've already read the Importance of Intent.


** *How to Get Engaged To Hermione Granger*: Hermione's extended family are dicks, they're massive dicks, her grandmother cut contact with her mother because her mother got pregnant with Hermione out of wedlock. After the War Hermione's family is starting to reconcile, so Hermione who's sick of being talked down to by her family invites Harry to a dinner party as her plus one to kinda get her through the evening, Harry being Harry accidently gets them engaged to each other. It's a fun fic, no real high stakes plot wise just two close friends pretending to be engaged and then eventually ending up in an actual relationship. I am enjoying it and this is coming from someone who has been thoroughly burnt out on Harmony for the past year. linkffn(13581651)

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. Rated M for later content.

/The Legacy/ is probably my favourite Haphne fic. It's also the fic that made me realise what a good marriage contract story is meant to look like.

Fair warning; it's super long and abandoned basically a few chapters from properly finishing. However the romantic plot is essentially the first third/half of the story before it becomes more of a subplot and the story focuses more on the war.

  Harry and Hermione are sick of Ginny and Ron shoving their relationships in their faces. So, when Hermione gets the idea for them to pretend to date, Harry agrees. Because, it's only pretend, right? H/Hr. HBP.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
