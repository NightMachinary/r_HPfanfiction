I remember it being rather AU with bashing of Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Dumbledore and despite it being Bashing I rather enjoyed it and once harry gets to Hogwarts he puts a rune on them that prevents them from harming or lying about him and if they try it hurts them.

Edit. It had Harry have an "Isolation room" and McGonagall wasn't portrayed in a very good light.


** I think I saw it in a community tab once. It was bonds of fate I think?
