Ideally with a pairing involved, but not required.


** "Dudley Dursley and the New Normal": Dudley deals with werewolves and wizard prejudice.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6884016/1/Out-In-the-Open][Out in the Open]] by little0bird is probably one of the best Dudley stories I've ever read. Focuses on Dudley after he got out of his parents house and realized (as Dumbledore puts it) "The apalling damage" his parents did to him.

Warning: The romantic relationship is slash, so if that's not your thing, then this may not be. Although it isn't graphic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]] is pretty good, as is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486190/1/Fortunate-Son][Fortunate Son]] which is sort of a companion piece.

Second the little0bird recommendation.
