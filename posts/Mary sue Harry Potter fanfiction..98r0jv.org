** You mind paring that down a little? Like general plot points, pairings, slash, specific tropes, ect? I know a boatload of fics that fit what you're looking for from back when I was on a WBL kick but I don't think I'm going to have the time to summarize/review my pile of links and (from what I remember) the summaries of most of these stories are awful enough that linking them with the bot would be worse than useless.

**** Here are a few off the top of my head. I'll sift through my favorites list tomorrow and post more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9976928/1/The-Bloody-Ashikabi][Bloody Ashikabi]] Crossover with a Harem Battle Royale anime. Harry is super duper powerful and has a harem of bird aliens. probably dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761202/1/The-Forgotten-Potter][The Forgotten Potter]] Seems to be a fem!Harry x Loki (maybe?) where fem!Harry gets turned into Black Widow lite and becomes a magical serial killer

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] Time travel, not quite wbl but the Potters did abandon him and they do have other children. None of whom are bwl though. Included because it does similar things with anti-Dumbledore stuff and expansion on what it means to be dark. Three parter so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12485597/1/Marvalous-Potter][Marvalous Potter]] Wrong Girl who lived where she becomes Ms. Marvel. It's a rewrite of one I'd read a while ago so I haven't finished it but the first couple chapters are hysterical (and I don't know if the author did that purposefully).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761860/1/The-Child-of-Azkaban][Child of Azkaban]] Harry gets tossed in Azkaban at age 6 and now he's going to Hogwarts with his brother "Saeviour."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11035459/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]] Harry/Daphne. Harry is a daedra of order from Skyrim and has erased his existence (mostly) from his parents and everyone elses minds. His sister is the GWL (but not really). There are other daedra wandering around and from what I remember it's quite well written for it's genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] Harry becomes some super duper bodyguard. Dead. HarryxFleur
