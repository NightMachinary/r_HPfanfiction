Does anyone know any decent LF Hermione/Ginny/Luna fics, where they are a trio instead of Hermione, Harry and Ron? They can be on some grand adventure fighting evil together or just be in a slice of life melodrama hanging around. (They can just be friends but bonus points if they are in a cute romantic triad relationship haha)


** I don't. Heck, I'd settle for two out of three. Can you imagine a buddy-cop mystery starring Hermione and Luna?

*** The only clear image I get from it is that Luna insists on wearing a deer stalker hat at all times when solving a crime :)

** Shamelsss self plug time:

My fic Flutter has quite a bit of the three of them as a trio! During the break in 3rd year after the firebolt incident, Ginny and Luna spend some time with Hermione.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

**** Fair warning, it doesn't happen right away! The beginning is pretty Ginny centric, and then Luna gets tossed into the mix around chapter... 3 or 4? Hermione starts spending time with them around chapter 6-8 I think. Been a while since I wrote it/reread it, the exact details are a bit fuzzy.

I hope you enjoy!

***** That fine! sounds like natural progression anyway as Ginny Luna were always closer than Hermione/Ginny or Hermione/Luna, makes sense they'd come together in that order and slow burn fashion. :)
