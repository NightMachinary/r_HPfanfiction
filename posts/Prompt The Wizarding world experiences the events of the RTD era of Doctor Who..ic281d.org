There was a theory a while back which stated that the HP Movies take place in the 2000s, rather than the 1990s. DW series 1-4 takes place from 2005-2007, IE movies 5-7. How about a fic which covers the Wizarding World's interactions with the events of those seasons? Like the Aliens crashing in london, the Battle of Canary Wharf, the Master's takeover of Earth, and the Dalek's invasion.


** I know you made a promt and not a request, but I hope you'll like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4922483/1/][visited by a doctor]] . It begins with the classic doctors meeting harry throughout his life, and then when Harry is an adult he starts an organization that's basically a magical mix of UNIT and Torchwood. He does get to the RTD era, but unlike what you asked the HP-parts are on the 90s, so that's a bit of

** Well, the Statute of Secrecy probably won't survive, and Wizards being revealed will probably be less of a big deal, with all the other stuff going on. On the other hand, the Wizards might be driven deeper underground by all of it.

The Royal Family are /probably/ werewolves in the Whoverse, so there's that.

I could see Wizards cleaning up a lot of stuff left behind by aliens, because of its resemblance to magic. They might have a formal or informal agreement/liason with UNIT.

Wizards will be involved in the fight against the Daleks- that could help unite the worlds against a common enemy.

Prisoner of Azkaban, with its time travel plot, could be an obvious point for the Doctor to get involved.

I wonder if the Master's global self-cloning program would work on Wizards? Be interesting if all the Wizards changed but the magical creatures didn't, and lead a resistance. Also, I wonder if Occlumency could offer some resistance to the Master's mind control/hypnosis.

Voldemort isn't a big deal any more (no more than any other terrorist or serial killer or cult leader anyway). If he becomes a big deal, it'll be because he got ahold of something alien. Voldemort is small fry compared to the stuff the Doctor deals with.

*** 1. The Wizards are pretty much as hidden as practically possible.
2. Voldemort and the Death Eaters would probably become UNIT wizards. Nothing unites like a common enemy, and when there are aliens out there who view you as ants, you tend to want to join together with your fellow 'ants', even if you view them as, atleast for now, inferior. They'll start to view themselves as superior ants, but ants nonetheless compared to the aliens.
3. I was referring to the Master's takeover in Sound of Drums, actually.
4. I was actually thinking of having Bellatrix and Voldemort report splitting headaches(Like Migrane-level), because of the Master's Archangel Network constantly pumping out hypnotic signals. It would be a subtle clue of things to come.
5. I agree with you on the Daleks.
6. The Second Wizarding War would be over in 2005, because of the invasion of the Cybermen forces the two sides to be absorbed into UNIT, which earns the support of the ICW.
