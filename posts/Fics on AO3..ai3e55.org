So the other day I was at work and I realised I could get onto Archive of our Own on my work PC's. I work in a call centre and the internet is quite restrictive so I found this to be pretty good.

So, I'm looking for a few fics I can read in between calls.

- Anything set directly after the Battle of Hogwarts showing the rebuilding of the wizarding world.
- Fics where Cedric didn't die and has a active role in the formation and running of the D.A.
- Fics, perhaps a series, that is set entirely in Ilvermorny. Mostly OCs preferred but I don't mind if a canon or two slip in.
- Slice of life fics. Hogwarts. Classes, homework, detention that kind of stuff.

-I don't care for pairings. No pairings or at least stories that don't focus too much on pairings. No slash please.

Anything like this around? Has to be on AO3.

Cheers

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.

** I don't really know any specifically to link, but I've used their search filters pretty successfully in the past to find a few good H/Hr if I can recall correctly.

I ended up abandoning Ao3 though a while back due to what seemed like 99% slash fics
