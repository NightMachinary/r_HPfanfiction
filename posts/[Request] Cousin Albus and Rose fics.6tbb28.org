/Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/ was...not very good. And one of my least favorite things was how Rose Weasley, Ron and Hermione's daughter was really mean-spirited, especially towards Albus.

Setting aside my disbelief that such behavior would be tolerated by their families, I am curious--are there any good fics where Albus and Rose's friendship/cousin-ship is emphasized?

I'm not opposed to a Trio with Scorpius, but I'd prefer fics where it's just Albus and Rose. And please, no shipping between cousins.
