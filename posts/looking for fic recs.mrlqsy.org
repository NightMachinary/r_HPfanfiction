hello!! i just finished reading a wrong boy who lived fic, it was my first time actually reading one of those the way to the end and it was absolutely amazing.

can anyone recommend me a really good wrong boy who lived fic, possibly genderbent? thank you so much!!


** linkffn(Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) are usually top of the list when one looks for quality WBWL fics.

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) isn't too shabby as long as you're okay with harem pairings.

I've read a few genderbent ones but none that were good enough to recommend, not that I can think of.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
