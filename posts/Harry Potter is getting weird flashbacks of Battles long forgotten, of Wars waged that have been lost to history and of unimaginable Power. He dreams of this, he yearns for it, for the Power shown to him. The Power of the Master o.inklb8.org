** "We... we... we must retreat, commander! The cliff has all but gorged our army, and the goblins have done the rest!"

Harry turned his head, and looked over at his army dying by the hundreds. Blood flowed down the cliff looking like a gory waterfall. Wand were snapped, necks were cutoff, and the goblins continued their march.

"Charge," Harry said.

"But..."

Harry turned again, and looked directly into the eyes of his captain. "Was I not heard correctly?"

The captain swallowed the bile in his mouth, and turned around, jumping into his horse in one swift motion.

"I understand, commander. Our sacrifice is needed to win the greater war." The captain swallowed again.

Harry just stared ahead, as the horse galloped towards the blood thirsty goblins who didn't differentiate between human and horse meat when they tore them through their teeth.

The captain put up a commendable fight. But the numbers proved to be too much.

The wave of goblins charged straight at Harry.

Harry sighed.

He then pulled out a grey coloured stick. "Sorry, captain, I couldn't allow you to witness this. It was better that you died valiantly in battle, than poisoned the evening thereafter."

Harry raised his wand.

"Mr. Potter!"

Harry jolted awake, fell backwards with his chair, and hit the floor. He groaned in pain.

"That'll be 5 points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter." McGonagall's glare could cut through ice.

"Sorry, Professor," Harry mumbled, still disoriented.

McGonagall gave a miniscule nod, flicked her wand to set him upright, and began her lecture again.

"Again?" Ron asked from the corner of his mouth.

Harry nodded without turning his head where he knew Ron was sitting. He heard a sigh from him in return.

As soon as the class was released, Hermione grabbed his hand and started pulling him. "We are going to Madam Pomfrey right this instant, and nothing you will say will change my mind," she spoke fiercely.

Harry gave up on his feeble attempt to open her grip, and started thinking back. "It's different. Every single time. Sometimes I'm an assassin. Sometimes I'm a politician. Sometimes a commander. But never the same."

Hermione slowed her pace but continued walking. "How much do you remember?"

"Bits and pieces, like always. This time I was a commander. There was a lot of blood. There were goblins, too."

Harry's heart thundered. He couldn't say it. He couldn't tell her that he remembered everything. How to slice a throat just right to ensure a clean kill. How to weave your words like a spider, trapping your enemy in slowly but meticulously.

He remembered it all.

And it had started showing.

He was a lot more jumpy. Loud noises that were mere annoyances before, were now like a ringing bell in the quiet class. He couldn't ignore them.

He was a lot more stressed. The dark under his eyes were a lot more prevalent than a month ago.

He couldn't sleep properly.

"Here we are," Hermione broke his thoughts. "I'll wait outside... you know... just in case..."

Harry nodded, and entered the den of the mother lion alone, like only her cubs could.

** "So, what will you do, /Peverell/? What will you do without your army, without your lieutenants and friends?"

The tall broad-shouldered man seemed to take great pleasure in mocking this Peverell fellow.

"You are surrounded," the man drawled.

Peverell looked up. Sighed. His expression hardened and he pulled out /the Wand/ out of his sleeve. It was the same one every time. Long and very unusual, brownish and radiating power like no other Wand ever could.

The man, though, seemed to not notice the fact that he had just been condemned to Death. He /laughed/.

"You are surrounded, Peverell, drop this charade!" he mocked.

Peverell's expression shifted into a malicious grin.

"All I am surounded by is fear, fear and dead men."

He pointed /the Wand/ to the sky, heavens themselves opening up and lightning torching up the evening sky.

The man who previously mocked Peverell now /stared/ at him with shock and not a small amount of fear.

All around, soldiers were falling like flies, lightning piercing through their magical and non-magical shields alike as if they did not exist, loud screams getting more numerous.

Peverell seemed to revel in all the chaos, all the destruction, all the /Death/. His expression was soft, loving even as he commanded devastating amounts of destructive magic as a conductor would their orchestra.

"HARRY!" a shrill, panicked voice penetrated his dream. Or was it a vision?

Harry groaned and sat up, still in a daze after the dream, and looked under his pillow.

The Wand of Destiny was indeed still there. Safe.
