Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure it's dead. Hasn't been updated since 2015 and the author hasn't written anything since, which is a damn shame because I thought the fic had quite a bit of potential. Was definitely looking forward to this since there definitely isn't enough decent Harry/LilyEvans stories out there.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

** This gives me the idea for a Harry is James story.

James is tortured into insanity just like Neville's parents will eventually be. Instead of keeping him in St. Mungos he has his room in the potter house and is taken care of by Lily and a house elf.

Lily performs a ritual to protect Harry.

Voldemort decides to incapacitate Lily and kill Harry in front of her.

Because Lily did not die the protection ritual is half-done. The killing curse does rebound and kill Voldemort but it also kills Harry.

Lily is suicidal because both the people she loves are gone. She performs a desperate ritual to resurrect Harry by putting James' soul in Harry's body. The ritual works but kills Lily.

Harry's curse scar is essentially James' horcrux at this point.
