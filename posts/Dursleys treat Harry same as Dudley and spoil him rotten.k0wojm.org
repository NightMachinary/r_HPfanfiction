How about instead of using neglect to wean Harry from Magic, Dursleys instead spoil him rotten. Treat him same as Dudley. Ever increasing amount of expensive presents, all the food & sweats he can ever want, anything that catches his eye is his to be had. Instead of being disliked, he grows up being part of Dudleys gang, bullying others, taking their stuff for his own ...

In short Harry grows to be obese, glutinous, selfish, dumb and a bully. Just as narrow & closed minded as his family.


** I've posted a plot bunny along these lines that features a Harry like that (well, not obese or glutinous, and not so much dumb as intellectually lazy, but selfish and a bully), and also deconstructs the Slytherin Persecution Complex. I don't have the talent or the time to write it, though.

When Dudley is beating up other school children for their lunch money, Harry (who can run much faster) is right there cutting off their escape. When Hagrid takes him to the Diagon Alley (without having to track him down to an island in the middle of a lake), Harry almost dies of embarrassment having to be seen next to that uncouth oaf.

And, when Draco offers to help him find a better kind of friend, he takes one look at Draco's expensive new robes and at Ron's hand-me-downs, and he knows exactly whose friend he wants to be and in which House.

Once there, he invariably chooses what's easy over what's right, following Draco's lead in sneering at the Gryffindors and bullying the Muggleborns and the blood-traitors. He mocks Hagrid, badmouths Dumbledore, and ingratiates himself with Snape (the latter with mixed success). He exploits his Quiddich talent and his BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot---to the point of people doing his assignments for him---for doing very little. On those occasions when Harry is absent, Draco riles up Ron by rubbing the fact that Harry chose Draco over Ron in Ron's face.

All the while, the Slytherin Persecution Complex would be on full display. Young Slytherins would parrot their parents' lines about "good old days" before Dumbledore ruined the country, when newcomers knew to respect their betters. They would complain about Ministry persecuting upstanding citizens, then turn around and flaunt their parents' wealth and influence. They would cry oppression when McGonagall justly takes House Points from them, and revel in Slytherin superiority when Snape takes every excuse to award Slytherins points and penalise and punish Gryffindors. They would, in short, complain about stereotyping of Slytherin, then behave in exact accordance with the stereotype.

But then, things begin to go wrong. The friendless Muggleborn girl in Gryffindor who doesn't know when to shut up and has the gall to get the best marks in their year and the pudgy blood-traitor who is good at Herbology and is practically a Squib otherwise---they seemed like logical targets for Draco's and Harry's ire and entertainment alike. But they begin to fight back, and they turn out to be surprisingly good at it.

At first, the vaunted Slytherin cleverness prevails: Draco and his gang use magical items, gang up, and make sure that Snape is nearby to interrupt the fight and punish the Gryffindors if the fight does go badly despite the precautions. But, the Gryffindors also become increasingly well organised, recruit more of their year, and they even begin making revenge attacks, apparently with that annoying Muggleborn in the lead.

And so, the Gryffindors quickly become too dangerous to bully, but even when Draco and Harry take out their frustrations on other targets, the do-gooder Gryffindors have the gall to intervene.

And then, Voldemort returns. Harry is eager to make a deal, but it turns out that the Dark Lord isn't the libertarian meritocrat that Draco had waxed poetic about, and he isn't particularly interested in recruiting or even a truce with Harry. It also turns out that Harry's Slytherin friends value their own safety far above their friendship. The most he can get from Draco is a whispered, "Sorry, Potter. My family's more important. It's been fun."

And so, Harry has to swallow his pride and go to Dumbledore and the pesky Gryffindors for help, beginning his redemption arc.

One twist that I do envision is that when Voldemort gathers intelligence about Harry, he finds a lazy, unambitious follower, an unsubtle bully who lets others do his thinking for him; someone who is brave enough to laugh at the stuttering Professor Quirrel behind his back, but would never confront him over the Philosopher's stone. He despairs over having such an unworthy nemesis.

He also investigates Neville, whom Hermione and Ron will have taken under their wings when Draco and Harry had gone after him, and who comes into his own perhaps earlier than in canon. Having not heard the second half of the prophecy, Voldemort wonders if perhaps he had been mistaken about which of the two children the prophecy had truly been about, and whether magic had punished him for the wrong choice.

And so, he would have little interest in taking Harry's blood, nor in testing his wand against Harry's. That, in turn, would deny Harry his canonical escape clause: to destroy the last horcrux, Harry must truly die. Can he become the sort of person who would?

*** Plot twist!

Adjusting his expensive custom robes Harry smiled to the crowded hall and confidently dropped the sorting hat onto his head.

"You lack the bravery for Gryffindor, the curiosity for Ravenclaw, the loyalty for hufflepuff and the cunning or ambition for Slytherin" the Sorting Hats voice rang out in Harry's head.

"You are spectacularly unsuited to all 4 houses"

"Now just one minute" Sputtered Harry

"My father happens to be -"

"Not here." the hat cut him off

"My only option is to sort you into the house I deem most capable of removing your head from your arse"

"Wait!" cried Harry starting to panic

"I want to be in -"

"HUFFLEPUFF!"

  Petunia and Vernon are able to put their grudges aside and raise the boys as brothers, completely equal...so they end up with two spoiled, greedy brats.

**** Lol, imagine Harry dissing adult Sirius and supporting adult Snape because he supposedly hates bullies. Sirius didn't turn into a child abuser even after 12 years with literal soul sucking demons, but we're supposed to sympathize with Snape bullying his own students because of his suffering due do to choices he himself made as an adult.

**** It would take the plot in interesting directions.

For example, although Dumbledore prioritised Harry's survival over everything else, he still needed Harry to be a hero in order to have a chance of destroying Voldemort as opposed to being destroyed by him. So, what does he do when Harry shows up at Hogwarts and is not even an antihero, but a spoiled brat and bully like Draco?
