I was just looking over a few works and I notice how Harry always throws a tantrum when he has to confront the Malfoys or the Dursleys. But, according to the books, all it took for Harry were some simple ambiguous gestures to become sympathetic to them. He seems to appreciate Uncle Vernon's awkward farewell, Dudley's admiration, Draco's attempt to not rat the trio out, Narcissa's attempt to cover his death, Snape's schemes. Hell, he even feels pity for Wormtail and Voldemort. All of these people have been at the very least nasty towards Harry at some point.

Therefore I wonder whether fans might be mislead by the books in the sense that we only see the scenes where one of the characters above (or others) get under Harry's skin and think he is petty. But overall he seems rather understanding. He becomes friends with Dobby, despite the latter making him doubt himself, almost getting him expelled and almost getting him killed twice. Also he doesn't even give a second thought to people taunting him, such as Pansy, Zacharias Smith, Fleur (at first) or the Hufflepuffs when they thought he attacked Justin.


** People write what they want in fanfiction, even if it's not exactly consistent with what was in the books. I would imagine people can't bring themselves to be forgiving to certain characters and their writing reflects that.

***** Quite honestly I've always seen Voldemort more like the Jesus of Dark Arts. You know... that teacher of Dark Arts who gathers followers with the promise that he'll give them a world only for them as long as they blindly believe in him. Harry is the opposite. He doesn't promise anything and gathers followers through his kindness. I guess his forgiving nature is actually meant to contrast Voldemort's statement that he "does not forgive or forget".

2 of the people risk their lives for him, though I do think it was too much to outright forgive both, Dudley thanks Harry, but they don't get together that much if at all later in life, and Vernon doesn't give him a farewell.

I think Harry is entirely too forgiving and a lot of that can be chalked up to him wanting family and friends. This is one trait that wouldn't stand if Harry had grown up with people who loved him. I also think some of what people consider forgiveness is Harry simply letting things go.

** Fics don't have to follow canon characterization. It depends on the plot and characterization but generally if both of those things are really well done in fics with canon Harry and ooc Harry I'd still like the ones in which Harry is ooc. I suppose, for me and many people, it's more interesting to see Harry in a different light than simply "The forgiving, good hero who has done nothing wrong". It's boring. But on the flip side, I can see where you're coming from because lately "vindictive and petty" Harry in most fics has no layers and people simply write him to be an evil asshole who suddenly wants revenge which is just cringy and I can't stand for those.

**** Yes, of course, I can see your point as well. But we're talking about fanfiction here and isn't the great thing about it that the story can be written in many different ways? It's reasonable for Harry to be white and Voldemort to be black in the books, especially with the emphasis on the "hero-villain" relation in the entire plot.

But in fanfiction, I think the reason why authors like to write Harry as a less forgiving and empathetic person and why readers such as myself like to read him like that is because it's more realistic and relatable (and definitely more intriguing in my opinion).

Grey Harry is a hero who makes mistakes, he's a hero who gets angry and goes into irrational rages, he's a hero who's conflicted and afraid, he's a hero who doesn't want to forgive and empathize because he knows that some people just don't deserve it, he's a hero who wants to avenge the ones he loves, he's a hero who's prideful and that can get the best of him - that's why he's vindictive and petty. He's a hero with a traumatic childhood who doesn't know how to overcome it, who can't love and trust people so easily because he doesn't know how to and so fucks up many times. Love isn't his greatest weapon - he doesn't know how to love a wizarding world who has shunned him many times. He's a hero who doesn't know how to deal with the responsibility and expectations and wants to run away.

There's so many different versions of grey Harry but the main point that connects them all together is that grey Harry is still a hero. He still stays, he still fights because he knows that he doesn't have to but chooses to anyways.

Above all grey Harry is a human with flaws. He's not the perfect hero like all the heros in the worldwide folklore and like all the heros in your typical protagonist - antagonist novel. And that's why authors love to write him like that and readers love to read him like that.

***** I guess you're right in a way... but even canon Harry is still grey. Disregarding his famous "ignorance of the rules", he almost kills a classmate, he blatantly lies multiple times, he uses two of the unforgivable curses. Even so, as a conflicting human being, it's still possible to forgive people. I have been myself in that situation. All it took was a kind word and an apology and afterwards never held that person's transgression over their head for my entire life. So a forgiving Harry is also more relatable to me (I guess) than a vindictive one.

****** I suppose it depends on the standards each of us have. You said earlier that Harry Potter is the typical hero and Voldemort is the typical villain- white and black, respectably. But at the same time we can see that canon Harry is not as white as he's made out to be if you take a look at the details. For me it was made clear that he was grey when the conflict of his feelings happened after Dumbledore's death when he felt angry and betrayed.

Being gray doesn't mean being evil. It just indicates that we're human. We have good and bad parts.

Ooc Harry and canon Harry can both forgive, but it seems like a lot of people feel like canon Harry just forgives way too easily that's all.

For example for me, it isn't right to forgive the Dursleys at all considering the fact that they literally abused him daily emotionally (I can't remember if they did physically). How can a simple "I'm sorry, I regret it" make up for or erase all the trauma Harry went through? It's just something that should take much more effort and continues work from them for Harry to be able to even think about forgiveness. It's normal for Harry to be more resentful, vindictive and petty in this situation.

But on the other hand, I can see why he forgave Ron so easily during the triwizard and during their on-the-run time period. The first time ron didn't feel good enough and it was hard for him to constantly be compared. These are reasonable and normal feelings. The second time Ron was scared about his family, he was tired and confused. Still reasonable and normal feelings.

So yeah, just depends on your standards.

Canon Harry is close to a doormat, he basically instantly forgets any wrong done against him, 2nd year when pepole shunned him for being a paraelmouth, 4th year as 4th champion, and he still goes on to teach all of them how to defend themselves. That dosent even go about the fact that he goes ahead and basically commits suicide for the same pepole who shunned him.

** I've always thought Harry isn't so much forgiving as he is desperate not to be alone or hated. We can form our own opinions on the characters in his life, but he cannot because his first priority is to not be abandoned. Harry's opinions came into play too late to influence his character.

Few people can empathize with what that side of him and instead they insert their own reactions to the treatment that was only possible due to his character.

This is (IMO) the reason why the Hat offered him Slytherin at the start and the reason he declined is because he thought it would make him an enemy to his (at the time) only friend.

** A lot of authors forget that Harry is starved for love and any positive behaviour from the Dursleys or the malfoys or severus is seen as much less self serving than they actually are. If you apply how someone with a more positive emotional background would react, they would rarely react like Harry. There is also the whole political context from the real world that Harry is missing wrt the DEs as well as the very cavalier attitude with bullying taken at Hogwarts.

** For me, I actually enjoy reading some badass wish fulfillment Harry, it's not always done well, but it can be fun to read even then.

On a serious note though, I actually really enjoy the exploration of forgiveness in fanfictions. I'll admit I'm more likely to hold a grudge, but even when I forgive, I don't forget. I think that is what bothers me most about canon Harry. He's not exactly a doormat since he stands up for himself in the moment, but imo he's entirely too willing to wipe the slate clean after someone apologizes. If someone apologizes, but does nothing to correct their previous behavior then that seems meaningless to me. As such, I like that to be explored more than it is in canon. Additionally, I don't mind as much his forgiveness of children (Dudley, Draco) as I do his forgiveness of adults who had full awareness that what they did is wrong (Lucius, Vernon) and as far as I can tell never really repent.

I don't mind him being petty or vindictive because that's how most children are. There's a conflict in forgiveness because you can't just pretend nothing happened. An example here, I might forgive Ron in 4th year but I would have a hard time fully trusting him again. It's not that I think Ron is a terrible person, but for me trust is a fragile thing.

I actually enjoy it most when Harry gets revenge or plans revenge, but has actual guilt about it. Or when he tries to tell himself he shouldn't care about people who "betrayed" him, but in reality he cares a lot. I enjoy reading that internal conflict, though I admit it's rarely done well.

** Yeah he's understanding but you gotta draw a line somwhere. Because let's face it, it was fully intended that Harry was abused by the Dursleys but it had to be cut out of the books because of the editor so I really don't understamd why Harry still tolerates the Dursleys, especcially after he learned what a real family was like with the Weasleys.

I also think that Harry is wayy too forgiving. All that shit the wizarding world put him through and he still fights for them, all the times Ron abandoned him out of jealousy and they're still friends and let's not forget everything Snape and Dumbledore did and he names his kid after them...

*** I will start with Ron. Ron abandoned him twice: the Triwizard situation (which was petty and unfair towards Harry, but tell me with a straight face that you never felt upset with your friends over petty things) and the Horcrux hunt (where he made up for his desertion by saving Harry's life).

With regards to the Dursleys (I don't know about the editor), they were awful and vile people, who abused Harry and deserved all the shit that they got every time Harry was leaving Privet Drive. I can't argue for them, but Harry, in his kindness, chose to forgive them, protect Dudley and encourage them to go into hiding. In the end, no matter what, blood is still thicker than water.

With regards to the wizarding world, Harry was under attack from the Daily Prophet and the Ministry of Magic, two institutions in which he never regained his trust. But not the whole magical world shun him. Neville and his grandma believed in him, the Weasleys believed in him, the Lovegoods believed in him and at least the people who joined the DA believed in him. Even if were Voldemort reincarnated, he wouldn't have reasons to punish the people that fought for him.

Edit: Snape did his stuff while enduring constant hatred from Harry. Dumbledore was a charismatic, charming guy who gave the news to Harry after he was dead. I honestly don't think he was ever ill-intended but things had to be done.

**** I don't disagree with that, but nearly all of Hogwarts turned against him in second and fourth year with the exeption of a few individuals and I'm pretty sure if I were Harry, I'd have given up the light side after all that already.

The Daily Prophet, time after time, shuns him, causing some of the wizarding world to hate him during fourth year.

The Ministry threatens to snap his wand and expel him from Hogwarts, forcing him to undergo a trial which could have ended sooner if they had just used Veritaserum or watched his memories. The Ministry also sent the Lord of one of the most ancient and noble houses into Azkaban, without trial, for 13 years, when the maximum time one can be arrested without trial is a week, and even after Sirius died, noone ever made a real effort to get him freed.

Also, by forcing him to compete in the tournament during fourth year, he was emacipated and, in the eye of the law, would have been an adult (the age restriction said only wizards of 17 years or older can compete, and as 17 is the age where you become a legal adult in the wizarding world, he became an addult), so the trial in fifth year of 'underage magic' would have been null and void.

Harry had to watch countless of his friends, family and other people he knew die (namely Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, Tonks and many others) and he nearly withnessed Ginny's death if he would have come a second later.

Snape acted as if it was Harry's reason James and Sirius tormented him and that Voldemort didn't spare Lily, when he could have helped Harry become a person so mhch better than his father, but he didn't let go of his hatred for James and love for Lily, wich, ontop of how the Dursleys treated him, should have forced Harry to snap way sooner.

And about Dumbledore, don't get me started. He was the reason Harry ended up with the Dursleys in the first place. He could have helped Harry improve and he should have told him about the Horocrux. The whole Blood-Wards shit around the Dursly's house could have easily been evaded by giving Harry to Sirius to live.in Grimmauld Place under a Fidelius Charm or giving Harry to McGonnagall, who would have been able to raise and protect him as well.

** It isn't really so much that authors misread Harry so much as that they are annoyed by Harry's cannonical habit of forgiving so easily. To be fair it does get unrealistic and annoying at times, the Dursley's, Snape, Wormtail... all of them did things that royally pissed off many of the readers (myself included) and to see the MC just forgiving them over a minor gesture after all the atrocities they committed over the course of the story leaves a sense of dissatisfaction, feeling as if they just didn't suffer enough to balance all the bad they did.

Though there are many stories in which Harry is as forgiving or even more so than in cannon. The best example I can think from the top of my head is a Xover with the MCU called “On Punching Gods and Absent Fathers” in this Harry is so forgiving it gets on your nerves.

** I think a big part of it is we only see the dramatic moments. At the beginning of book 1, we see Harry sitting down and eating with his relatives (as opposed to being the fanon starved slave) and I imagine most of his childhood is like that, excepting the instances that he remembers in the narration. The Dursleys were not nice to him and definitely neglected him, but it wasn't the extreme that fanon portrays. The same with Malfoy - most of the time they ignored each other, and Malfoy didn't bully Harry. They were minor schoolyard rivals rather than whatever was going on between James and Severus. In canon, there was no deep well of hate in Harry - his life could have been happier and more comfortable, but it wasn't miserable.

We get the emotional extremes condensed into seven books that cover almost two decades of life. Obviously, we react to the extremes we read about, but since we don't get the calmer moments (except when they're skipped over during the Hogwarts year) we don't have an accurate perception of Harry's life.

** Being vindictive lends itself to action and moving the plot along, while forgiveness is inaction and doesn't typically move the plot at all. Forgiveness is a character development tool, and that is something that fanfic writers have trouble with. It also ties into the self-indulgent fantasy that a lot of writers fall into. Obviously people can't rant and rave in real life at every perceived injustice, but watching a canonically “doormat” type character stand up for himself allows people to scratch an itch that they just don't get to do in real life.

** Im totally with you on this one. People might call him a doormat, but in all scenarios he forgives when the other person sees their mistake, or is genuinely sorry. He has a lot of empathy, and people that dont deserve it like wormtail or voldemort, i felt a strong reluctance to kill anyone in general. Fanfic writers think its easy to take a life, even to someone who killed your parents. But I think his own personal feelings and empathy were all valid, and not very strongly explored In canon the power the dark lord knows not was love, and well despite people laughing at that line it actually made sense He has empathy, and love, love enough to sacrifice his life for everyone. Where we all know as JKR was attempting to demonstrate, voldemort was technically a phsycopath who literally cannot feel love.
