As the somewhat long title says I am looking for something new to read, things like Dumbledore thinking that Harry is evil, crazy goblins, taking over the wizard world by accident would be a nice bonus but in general, dimension / time travel and the alternate self raising with a focus on being amusing is all I want! :)
