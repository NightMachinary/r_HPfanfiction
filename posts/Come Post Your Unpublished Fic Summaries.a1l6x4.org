Come post the summaries to your unpublished fics! Get criticism, see if anyone's interested, brag about how epic your summary is, whatever. For an extra challenge, don't explain past the summary what the fic is about! Here's mine: ------

Harry Potter can brew a flawless potion. He gets all his spells right on the first try. His Quidditch skills are second to none and he can charm anyone. He's perfect. At least when he's not in control.


** *The Snowstorm over Svalbard*

The war is over and life as an Auror is good for Harry Potter. Until he's assigned to go investigate mysterious storms in the Arctic. Bringing along his partner, Daphne Greengrass, he makes his way into Svalbard, where myth becomes truth and the truth is far more sinister than anyone would have guessed.

--------------

*An Abnormal Amalgamation*

The Veil which kept the Eldritch Truth away from seeing eyes is ripped away, and horrified by what becomes of the world, Harry travel back in time to stop it. Harry's not sure what's worse, however --- the eldritch horrors, teaming up with Tom Riddle, or being reborn in his mother's body.

--------------

*Murder on the Hogwarts Express*

The war is over and Harry is on his way to Hogwarts for his seventh year. However, an hour into their ride, someone is murdered. Fingers are pointed, trust is tested, an unlikely partnership is formed, and Harry is put under extreme pressure yet again. How many will be murdered before the killer is caught?

--------------

*The Terrible No Good Day*

Harry Potter liked his life. It was nice, peaceful, and the danger of his youth had dwindled down to an occasional date-gone-wrong with Daphne. So he was quite displeased when dark wizards take everybody hostage at a gala. He's sick of saving the day, but what other choice does he have?

--------------

*Flower and Feather*

The first Battle of Hogwarts takes a disastrous turn, leaving more than Dumbledore dead. Harry begins the Hunt for the Horcruxes without Ron or Hermione. Fleur and Fawkes, however, having lost Bill and Dumbledore, respectively, won't let him do it alone. Harry/Fleur, no bashing.

** *A Texan Potter in King Albus's Court*

James and Lily Potter made sure that if something happened to them when they went into hiding, Harry would be protected. Instead of going to the Dursleys, Harry instead goes to Texas where the descendants of Abraham Potter -- one of the original 12 Aurors in the United States of America -- are now living. Sirius, Remus, and Hagrid take him there to ensure his safety and end up staying. Due to pressures placed on Harry by The Wizengamot, he is forced to return to Hogwarts and compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Raised by the Potter clan with the three f's of Texas: family, freedom, and firearms, the British Wizarding World will never be the same.

** *Shattered*

The moment He touched the Philosopher's Stone was the moment everything changed. Everyone, even His old family, gave Him pitying looks and pleaded for Him to get help, but He was stronger than ever now. Yes, He was crazy, but He was not stupid. Madness was not a weakness and He would prove them all how wrong they were.

Still not happy with it. I hate summaries.

**** Exactly why I hate summaries.

Anyway, his mind is shattered. So, the weird capitalisation on 'he' is because it's referring to a different part of his fractured mind. In essence, he sees himself as more than one person. Often using our when referring to himself.

** *Firefly*

The traces of Dark Magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

** */Untitled I/*

Percy took a deep breath. It was because he left his family that he came into this position, and the irony wasn't lost on him. “You can be my cousin,” he told the terrified muggle-born. “Everyone knows we're pure-blood, and there're so many of us nobody would notice one more.” // The size of the Weasley family exploded during Voldermort's reign.

*/To Crush a Beetle/*

Magic regrows bones overnight. Magic heals gashes in a second. Hermione Granger forgets that magic, ultimately, doesn't make life any less fragile.

*War Before the War*

Time-traveler Ron Weasley knew he was a manipulative twat, but he found the accusation that he was engineering events because he was after Harry's money a tad bit offensive.

** *The Infinite*

A twist of fate, and Harry falls with Sirius through the Veil. With his strength, a little luck, and the help of someone unknown, Sirius and Harry emerge, far away in space and time... (specifically, the Firefly-verse)

*Fight Fear with Fire*

Harry learns something different in Fourth Year DADA, and when cornered in the Graveyard, surrounded by Death Eaters and Voldemort, he unleashes Fiendfyre.

*(I don't have a name for this one)*

Dumbledore is a little more worried after the Triwizard Tournament, and tries to summon someone with "the Knowledge to defeat Voldemort." Imagine his surprise when he summons a Muggle, who has happened to have read 7 childrens' books...

Lavender Brown POV with a Dark!Harry who thinks he's getting away with all the edgy things Dark!Harry tends to get away with, but the rest of the school isn't going to play along this time.
