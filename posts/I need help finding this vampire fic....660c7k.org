I remember in this story Harry gets some staff, dates Snapes daughter, kills Dumbledore.... thats as far as my memory goes.

Another one I need help finding is where Harry is an "Elder Vampire" forced to protect the Girl-Who-Lived or whatever. I remember something about unprepared wizards never able to take on an Elder Vampire.
