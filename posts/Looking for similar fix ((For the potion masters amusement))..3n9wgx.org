First-time time poster sorry if this adult content isn't allowed?. Looking for something similar. I like the length. Doesn't have to be as "hardcore".

Edit : omg so many to read now...thanks everyone ! I don't know where to start


** Slightly less BDSM , but you could try For Someone Special by ladyofthemasque on Restricted Section...

** I'm not the biggest fan of this ship but it does have it's appeal!

I looked up a previous thread on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3i9m4n/looking_for_snapehermione_fanfiction/][Snape/Hermione recs]] and I found a giant list of [[http://sshglist.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-list.html][completed epic fics]].

Hopefully this helps you on your search.

** I don't read Snape/Hermione, but even so I'd rec TeddyRadiator's work. She posts to AO3, it's primarily Snape/Hermione, and she prefers a dominant Snape. Also, her fic tends to be explicit. The first couple of pages of her collected works on AO3 are mostly drabbles, so skip those. The longer stories start showing up after that.

If you haven't checked out [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/][The Petulant Poetess]], you might want to poke around there. The community favors Snermione fics, and you can sort by keywords.

#+begin_quote
  In the ten years since the Battle of Hogwarts, Severus Snape has worked very hard to free himself from his old life in order to become a respected Headmaster. Of course, his wife Hermione loves him regardless, but will an innocent board game change the entire future of their marriage, not to mention Severus' view of his own kindler, gentler self? Written as a gift for the incomparable Subvers in the LJ 2011 SSHG Exchange.

***** Yay! This is my favorite thing to do on this subreddit tbh.

The Problem With Purity - linkffn(4776976) incredibly long and epic, but you have to be patient to get to the smut

The Love You Take - linkffn(9646277) only 150k but pleeenty of great adult content

Chasing the Sun - linkffn(7413926) long & completely amazing

Care of Magical Creatures - linkffn(3814832) one of the best marriage law fics, imo

And a personal favorite I have to add since you asked, it's only on ashwinder.sycophanthex.com but it's a duo called The Amber Solution and The Amber Effect by wandlimb (and if you're not already familiar, the site has an excellent top 25 read and top 25 rated list!)

** I would recommend pretty much anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1317626/Ms-Figg][Ms-Figg]]

All of her stuff is on fanfiction.net. She doesn't write anymore but she is pretty much a strictly Snamione writer with 112 stories on there, many over the 100k mark, and a few that are over 200k. I think one is 310k.

Pretty much all of her stories are filled with smut and many have a dominant Snape with some light BDSM.

This is my favorite: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4374633/1/Through-the-Looking-Glass][Through the Looking Glass]]

This one is where Hermione falls through the Mirror of Erised into another dimension and a different Hermione trades places with her. It's good and has a ton of sexual content. This one is about 170k words.

You really can't go wrong with anything that she has written.
