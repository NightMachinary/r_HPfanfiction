Hi!

I'm sorry to bother anyone with my question, but is there any sarcastic Harry fanfics out there that are worth reading? I've already read a few, and I liked them quite a bit. A good one is "Oh you didn't know? Yeah, he's awesome." That's literally the title.

Anyways, any suggestions would be appreciated. Also, are there any funny Harry fics that you might want to mention to me?

Yeah, I'm weird. The only characters I like are some of the Weasleys, Luna, Harry, Cho, Flitwick, Marauders, and Professor Sprout.

Thank you for any replies that you come up with!

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
