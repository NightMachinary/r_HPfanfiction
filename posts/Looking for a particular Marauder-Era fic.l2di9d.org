:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a Sirius/Remus fic that focuses mainly on Remus and his illness. I believe it goes all the way from early childhood to his death. Might be that I am combining two fics, but here are some details I remember:

- Remus lives in a muggle orphanage during the summers, and he meets a muggle boy that he eventually gets close with in his adult life

- Peter is afraid of him because he's a werewolf but is still his buddy and helps him get raw meat to much on during the full moon recovery periods. Peter is an aspiring chef or something.

- James and Lily get together as in canon and at the end of their seventh year they go camping. Remus and Sirius have trouble with a hike due to all their chain smoking.

  Can't blame you...I actually finished it last week. It's phenomenal...makes you feel like you're right there with the characters. Did not want it to end.

****** Yeah I'd love a sequel but also I thought "I don't want to read an entire fic of Remus crying over Sirius."

******* Oh wait! Maybe this isn't the one I'm thinking about. At the end of the one I read, I think the muggle boyfriend meets Teddy Lupin or something. After Remus has been dead a long time

******** I'm quite sure it's ATYD in your original post. I dont recall Peter being a chef ever though.

*** Question since you finished it.

For the first prank they planned. Remus found out where the Slytherin common room was. It was Remus' idea to use the rosehips. Remus knew the spell to vanish the evidence. Peter was lookout and James was just an invisibility cloak plot device. I didn't read any further than that because it was giving me major Hermione sue vibes where the trio encounters a problem and Hermione does 90% of the work, Harry does 20%, and Ron does -10%.

Does the group dynamic get better? or does it continue like that because Remus is the main character?

**** It def gets better. Remus does go from an illiterate thug wannabee to more of a goody goody. But I don't think any of the four are Gary Sues.
