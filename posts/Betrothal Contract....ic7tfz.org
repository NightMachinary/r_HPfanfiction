/But why?/


** Because you have 2 personalities who might never have interacted forced to live together. It's like Big Brother in miniature, with the added stress that they may need to have a child. How do they react? How do their relationships with others change? Can they find a way out? What if only one of them wants to? How do they navigate a romantic relationship when they know they can't just break up if they're incompatible? Especially if they dislike or hate each other? How does this tie into the wizarding world as a whole? Why do these contracts need to exist? What side effects have there been on the world? All of these are questions that can make a betrothal contract story really interesting if it's handled well.

Pretty much every trope that's become hated by the fandom can actually be fun and fresh if the person writing knows how to use it, and that's the sticking point, unfortunately. A lot of fics are not written well, and this includes betrothal contracts. They end up full of tropes that are poorly thought out, or thrown in for a quick laugh or to make a plot trudge on. Sturgeon's Law says that 90% of everything is crap; the 10% are what make any type of fanfic worth reading. Including betrothal contracts.

*** The problem is that those stories never, ever consider the most basic, most important question: Why would James and Lily do this to Harry? And if it's an older contract, why could every other Potter skip it until Harry? Why would people even make such contracts without specifying the individuals involved?

Authors using this trope never, ever think things through. They always keep the canon background, not realising that if such contracts existed, the canon world would look very, very differently - and everyone would be aware of such contracts since teenagers at school would be talking about such stuff all the time.

The only good explanation I've seen is that James and Sirius got really pissed and had a "You know what would be awesome? Imagine if our children got married. If your son and the daughter I am going to have eventually..." kind of dialogue. Only works for Harry/Sirius' daughter (and to a lesser degree Tonks, Narcissa, Bellatrix and Andromeda as next of kin).

Unless you go the whole "artificial insemination" and possibly "artificial womb" route, but that would utterly defeat the point of the trope, forcing a relationship between two characters. The entire trope is basically "use rape/the threat of rape to force a relationship", and that's a problem.

Getting out from such a contract is not using the trope, anyway - the marriage law/contract trope is about a relationship resulting from said law/contract. It isn't about people resisting rape.

******** Who died and made you the arbiter of what constitutes a marriage contract fic for all fandom?

Once again, everything comes down to the writing. Rape, in and of itself, is not a bad thing to include in a story. Marriage contracts that, as you say, "use rape/the threat of rape to force a relationship," are not inherently bad things to work with. How do the characters handle it? How do they deal with the repercussions if they fight it? You're looking at fics where people take this idea and run with it and don't handle it well, and you've decided that this means the idea itself is bad.

I honestly don't know how to get through to you that tropes are never inherently bad. They can be discredited, they can be overused, they can be used poorly, they can even be used to try to harm. But in the context of writing as a whole, they are not in and of themselves a bad thing. They are tools in a toolbox. That's been my entire argument this whole time. Take the tool, use it in a way that makes the story interesting. Cause conflict for your characters. Explore the world you're creating. If you don't like a trope, don't use it and avoid stories with it. But don't tell people they can't or shouldn't use it.

********** I really don't agree with your definition here. You're telling me that if a marriage contract is the driving force of the fic, the premise under which everything else happens, and the characters manage to invalidate it that it's not longer a marriage contract fic? What is it, then? This makes no sense.

But let's work under your definition here. Your problem, as stated in previous comments, is that a marriage contract is essentially a form of legal rape. But it's only a marriage contract fic, according to you, if they get together due to the contract and fall in love. At that point, it's consensual. There's no rape at all. There's not even the threat of rape with a clause demanding an heir because they want to be together and have children together.

Sure, in real life arranged marriages probably shouldn't exist and can be highly problematic. But they can also work, if the people who are under the contract make it work. In any case, this isn't real life we're talking about. This is fanfic, where we can explore things that are or are not true in real life without actually having to go through them. So again, what's the problem here? If all the marriage contract does is get the characters together and force them to put effort into a relationship they normally wouldn't, once they love each other and consent to having sex there's nothing weird or skeevy or wrong. It's just the impetus for the relationship to start.

*********** The trope is: Marriage Law/Contract forces two people together and they fall in love. If that doesn't happen, the trope isn't played straight. That's a huge difference. It's like the difference between a story where a king actually has the divine right to rule, and one where the king doesn't, and is toppled when he tries to enforce his rule against the people. One uses the "there is a divine right to rule" trope, the other doesn't.

Or, in other words, if the trope is subverted, then the trope isn't being used. And it's a toxic trope since it normalises rapey behaviour and teaches people that they have no rights.

************ To me, the existence of the contract is the trope. Everything after is a subtrope. this is similar to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/apocalypsehow][Apocalypse How]], which is the trope for the end of the world but can happen in many different ways and has various classifications as subtropes. In our case, the trope splits off. Do they fall in love? Do they not? Is there pressure to have a child? Is this a weird thing for the current society or a societal norm?

As for your argument that this normalizes rapey behavior, it really doesn't. The trope, as you define it, is about how people can find love while under the societal pressure to do so. It's not "Welp, you're married, so just lie back and think of England." It's "Well this isn't what I would've chosen, but how can I make it work?" Which is, in fact, a part of life for many people globally. Would you like to tell people who have had a successful arranged marriage that it was rapey and should never have happened?

**** The vast majority of the ones I've seen don't come from the Potters, but rather from the Blacks as part of being Sirius' heir. Or occasionally you get the James and Sirius were drunk fics and thought it would be a great idea.

As for the older contracts, it can just have some asinine requirement that made it skip generations, i.e. it only activates when there is a male Potter who is an only child reaches the age of 17, and whose parents are deceased. Typically goes hand-in-hand with blood and family magic. As for why it wasn't specific, maybe one of the intended participants died before it could be completed. Or the people who made it didn't want to restrict themselves, who cares about their far-off descendants. Or it was a demand for repayment of a debt and solidifying an alliance in the future. Sure, most of those are a stretch, but so is a magical contract story in the first place and I'm just spitballing.

Any contract of that kind would be cancelable, so the story would consist out of one scene & The End. However, I reject the last bit. After all, betrothals historically /made/ sense. Just between existing children, because the entire point was the alliance through marriage, not between some future offspring that may never exist and therefore would be meaningless for current relations.

You obviously need a sufficient AU, in which alliances matter and children are only regarded as bargaining chips, but after that, you sure can write a story /with/ a contract. It's just not going to be a /Contract Story/ (in as far as those are a genre/trope, and the contract is the plot).

And the "Older contract" once again fails utterly at answering the question why anyone would make such a specific contract. What reason would they have to stipulate such conditions? If it was a political or debt motive, then "our kids will marry" is the logical answer, not "in some far, far future, our scions will marry into each other... maybe" clause. If the people involved didn't want to restrict themselves, why would they even make a contract in the first place? If only one side didn't want to, the other wouldn't accept such stupid conditions.

Or even a straight forward one of requiring an eligible daughter for the other family while there's an eligible son for the Potters. Linkao3(The Ilvermony Champion) had that happen to Daphne Greengrass as the first daughter of the family in three generations.

Although I did read one Harry/Fleur one where the contract was supposed to go to James, but he and Lily either eloped or were engaged. Which since the Delacour it was supposed to go to was "already in the family way" meant it wasn't that hard to negotiate skiving it off to the next generation.

**** Its fanfiction, it doesn't have to be realistic. Marriage tropes are often used as a tool to bring two characters together and explore enemies to lovers trope. The consequence are usually the focus of the fic, not how this arrangement came about or how the world would look like with marriage arrangements in it.

I am not a huge fan of any pairings in Harry Potter fandom so I haven't read many HP fics with this trope but marriage tropes are my guilty pleasure in a few other fandoms. When I read them I really don't care about how marriage law came to be, I just want to read about two characters having to put up with one another. I love in character fics and its a trope that can lead itself really well to allowing two characters to grow closer while not completely rewriting their personalities (as long as you can ignore the fact that these characters would more likely leave the country first). At least I prefer it to two people all of a sudden developing the hots for one another and making out despite being considered mortal enemies the day before. I do like the dubcon elements of some of these fics as well so they are really not for everyone and are often not examples of healthy relationships.

***** There are much better ways to force two characters together without going the "rape law/contract" trope. The trope is actually a really shitty way to force two characters together since it generally needs a rewriting of their personalities to accept the law/contract, instead of working on a way to break it. If the characters were such doormats that they go along with such a law/contract, even though they didn't really want to, then the contract wouldn't be needed in the first place - the parents/guardians/public opinion could simply tell them to get hitched.

****** Is there much difference between guardians telling them to get married and a contract saying they should? I guess I was thinking in terms of other fandoms which don't usually have binding contracts so to me they are the same thing. The result is still the same either way - two characters who now have to deal being in a relationship/partnership with one another despite not wanting to be in one. I imagine characters like Draco or Harry don't exactly have guardians that would want them to be together in the first place so it makes more sense for there to be some magical contract.

I don't think it requires that much deviation from their personalities either. Once you get past the fact that for one reason or another these characters have to or chose to stay together, they are now free to hate each other as much as they want. To you it might be a non-negotiable part of their character that they would never be in a contract in the first place, but to me them keeping their personalities during their time together is what is actually important. In contrast with developing pairings the usual way, the only way two characters would be together is because they wanted to in the first place. This is a completely different type of romance story and doesn't work well for pairings where two characters wouldn't even be seen in a room together otherwise.

I believe the rape/noncon/dubcon is also a big appeal of this trope as well. Rape fantasies and domination/submission fantasies are some of the most common fantasies for women so marriage law trope fanfiction could be a safe way to explore those. It is for me at least and considering just how popular these tropes are I don't think I am the only one.

Like, I can get almost everyone who aren't mortal enemies together in 2k words. And in the cases where it would require a marriage contract/law to get them together, the pairing isn't believable in the first place and the likely outcome of such a contract/law would be murder and/or suicide rather than a happy relationship.

**** The whole point of marriage law tropes is often to set up relationships that are in no way healthy or make any sense otherwise. Enemies to lovers trope is often the entire point. Two characters may make the worst couple ever, but have interesting conflicts and drama that could be explored in a fic.

Its also way easier to write than actually developing a realistic bond between people who hate one another so a lot of authors tend to rely on it for specific pairings. You may not get the point of them, but they are very popular and quite entertaining to read for those of us into them. I don't care about any pairings in HP fandom to read many HP fics like this but I do occasionally enjoy them in other fandoms.

Your plot example just sounds boring and way too fluffy for my taste. If I read a romance fic give me conflict and drama instead. If I wanted something super normal and cute I would go out on a date with my fiance in real life. In fiction I prefer relationships built on more than just bumping into one another and going on a date. Whether it's by fighting Voldemort side by side or exploring a crime mystery or being forced to live together by a silly marriage law its all good to me.

#+end_quote

There are way better ways to do this though. I can outline what I think would make a decent Draco/Hermione or Harry/Bellatrix fic without the forced marriage bit (although by the point they would get together, the death eater characters would be barely recognisable due to the necessary growth).

Short of Harry(or Hermione)/Snape, /Pettigrew or /Voldemort, you can make everything work somehow, and those three are the only exception because they are directly responsible for the murder of the Potters, the very premise of this series.

Bellatrix can redeem herself if she defects before the DoM, Malfoy can grow up early if he has an attack of common sense and actually uses his brain for once (diverge before he calls Hermione mudblood), Parkinson did little other than running her mouth...

*** Its easier than thinking up an original twist. Like say, a good role reversal idea. Perhaps Harry has to work for it. Perhaps the person you select to pair him with. Romance is nothing if no effort is not put in. Don't just let them fall in love willy nilly. Let Harry or someone else take someone they like out on a date first, let them buy gifts and bumble through the necessary steps. That is far more interesting than forcing a relationship or love at first sight. A relationship takes work.

** It plays into the pure blood rewrite fantasy, I think. It also gives a reason to ship characters that make no sense together unless you change their whole lives and gives a whole “enemies to lovers” type thing.

** The trope only works as an evil to be worked against, not a relationship device. As in - "Harreh m'boy, you gotta marry x person and then have at least three children with them, and also can't divorce, and also can't be with anyone else" - and then Harry says "fuck this sideways" and gets the hell out of there. The story would then revolve around dodging the contract's various trigger conditions (acceptance, saying she looks pretty, being within 2 miles) and finally finding a way to break it and any others like it of their power, maybe by invading the ministry of magic with a non-human army and smashing the mcguffin that keeps magical contracts binding in the framing of a nonhuman rebellion.

As a relationship device it's just a piece of rape paper.

** Yes, that is a question more authors should ask themselves. Not just about contracts, about anything. Unmotivated nonsense is a major cause in creating the typical badfic. In this case, there are many possible plots that aren't making sense, and very few that do. Virtually every story in existence uses the former, however -- because the latter invariably invalidate that plot vehicle as a raison d'être for the story. You'd have to come up with an /actual/ story.

** I think the reason for all contract fanfics is that authors either want harry to have arranged marriage but most arranged marriages are fixed by parents/elders but harry is an orphan so they use marriage contracts or to bring their heroine into Harry's life because in most romance stories introduction of harry and most girls are unrealistic. Also these stories are funny and popular at start as people enjoy their fights between harry and the heroine.

** What I really would want to read is a fic with: yes there is a contract but no one want to enforce it not even the parents/guardians but they have because bad things would happen if they don't. So over the course of the story they search for invalid/break/make it non-enforceable and are successful in the end but still fall in love but not because the contract, despite of it. A kind of love/companionship- trough- adversary thing. Wouldn't even have to be the main plot just a notable part.

** The reasons are always wrong. One of the most secure methods how to make me leave story unfinished. There are so many of them which started well, and then suddenly this thing happens (also compounded with necessity of harem) ... and that's it for me. I really hoped for linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion by Vance McGill) to be good: promise of really hurt and socially inept Hermione growing into Harmony sounded very well, but then it turned into “need to have three wives” for Harry, and I don't know what's the next sentence of the story, and I will never learn. Oh well.

As soon as I read that he would need multiple wives, I stopped even if I skipped a little and read that one of his wives would just be his wife so she could have a girlfriend on the side because they were already dating but society wouldn't accept them and I was like "coolllll???"
