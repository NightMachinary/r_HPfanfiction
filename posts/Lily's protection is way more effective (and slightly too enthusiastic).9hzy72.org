Instead of being a one-time gimmick, Lily's protection is a very effective tool to protect Harry from any harm. Even smaller actions against Harry lead to a spontaneous combustion of the offenders.

Examples could be:

"Draco gets burned in GoF when he tries to curse Harry", "Pettigrew gets roasted when he tries to prepare the ritual", "Lockhart makes the front-page by combusting in a bookstore" or even "Snape turns into a nice campfire over an arbitrary detention/bad mark".

Obviously, the results won't be very serious.


** It could be called Harry Potter and the Spontaneous Combustion, and go through short mini chapters of everyone who's tried to harm harry in any slight way, whether they're teachers giving him detention, friends arguing or playing pranks on him, or people ACTUALLY trying to harm him. Playing Quidditch? The Bludgers, the beaters, anyone who tries to tackle or block him all spontaneously set on fire. Giving Harry the most Yandere mother's protection ever.

All joking aside, it could be a plot point that everyone is scared shitless of Harry and the mysterious deaths surrounding him.

  After Harry's second encounter with Voldemort, Lily's protection goes haywire, turning everyone Harry touches to ash. It's very inconvenient.

** There was this fanfiction in which a bloody image of Lily Potter appeared and she killed Vernon Dursley after Vernon beat Harry to the near point of death. She also killed Voldemort later on while protecting Harry& Diary!Tom after Harry almost died again in the middle of a battle. It was a good fic and the imagery I had in my mind was that Lilith scene from True Blood. It is such a great idea.
