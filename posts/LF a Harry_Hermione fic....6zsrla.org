It starts with two girls in a bookshop finding a set of dusty journals that belonged to Hermione. She has a little sister in this fic and Sally Anne Perks was her friend before Hogwarts? I can't for the life of me remember the title, so can anyone help a gal out?


** Maybe linkffn(6700976)? I haven't read it though.
