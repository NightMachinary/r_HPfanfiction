I'm trying to figure out how to sneak in gnome army Onto the Hogwarts express without alerting Albus Dumbledore if it's alright I would like to bounce some ideas off the members of this sub? My first thought is to just put them all in Neville Longbottom's trunk, because Well They are Hermione's Gnomes . Hermione Reminds Neville a lot of his gran So he does what she asks. Trevor the toad ends up eating the Gnome King and become the a living god for the Gnome super colony of the UK. They Paint Trevor gold and chant hippy hop everytime a gnome sees the toad . The 7th Care of magical creatures class Spend most of the first term of the newt year Documenting the strange behavior.

Idea 2 is to mail the gnome to Hogwarts via owl Over the course of a few weeks, The kids will be getting a lot of letters from home , so sending a Gnome based care package Wouldn't be a big deal for Mycroft Holmes.

idea 3 , Hermione doesn't even bother hiding the gnomes and brings 1000 of them with her. The gnome Effectively take up three compartments on the Hogwarts express, and Temporarily seize control of the train until Professor McGonagll apperates on the the Conductors compartment at the head of the train , she , and Hermione Negotiate The return of control Hogwarts express to the headmaster in exchange For dogs to be allowed as pets At Hogwarts, The negotiations fall through, Hermione is the first first year to ever get detention Before she's even sorted. Harry, Dudley Watch the negotiations while eating contraband popcorn and Ron Cowers in the corner because An irate Hermione And an angry professor McGonagll Combined are enough to scare any Weasley. The gnome end up Fleeing the train And end up somewhere near Cheswick Near Derbyshire. The Enlist the help of a few snakes and ride them to Hogwarts like Hannibal with his elephants when he invaded Rome.

Idea 4: The gnomes are left at Holmes Manor, and Sherlock Holmes when bored Throws them off the roof because John took his gun away again.( as you can't shoot the walls in a house where 3 year olds like Sherlock!) So instead Sherlock tosses Gnomes off the roof, After strapping functional mini parachute to them and timing there Dissent.

I can't decide which to go with? Thoughts?

Edit: Just to clarify the gnome army belongs to Hermione Granger.

** Why not just expand her book bag (or buy an expanded one) and ship them in that. Bonus, she no longer needs to worry about which book she needs once they're offloaded at Hogwarts.
