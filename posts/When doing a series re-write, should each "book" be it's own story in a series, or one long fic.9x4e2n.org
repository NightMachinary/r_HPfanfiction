I'm doing a series rewrite where Lucius Malfoy is caught trying to attack Harry at the end of Book 2, the diary coming from him comes out, and he is sent to Azkaban. Narcissa goes on the run, and Draco Malfoy is placed in the care of the Weasley family while the manor is raided and his parents dealt with.

Currently I am still in the Summer between 2nd and 3rd year, right after Sirius Black (and in my version Bellatrix Lestrange) escape. I have 14 chapters with 20,000 -ish words. I am writing on AO3, so I can divide in chapters, series,collections, but I'm not sure which is best going forward.

Opinions?


** I'd go with one year - one book - one story.

Always easier for new readers to see that the story is "completed" for a few books, and then get into it.

I, for one, most of the time search for completed stories, because I don't really like having to wait for the chapters to come out, I like to read it in one go, or at least knowing that I won't reach a dead end of sorts before the end of the year.

that being said, it also depends on the update rate you intend to do. If you want to post it all in one go, go for one long ass fic. people will most likely be more interested in a very long fic :)

** With the amount you currently have written and the time it covers, I'd say separate as different fics in a series.

*** Fanfiction spoiler- They aren't actually together. Bellatrix takes advantage of the confusion and searching of the prison that happens when Sirius escape to do it herself (possible gonna draw on that wandless flight thing Voldemort and some of his followers do in the movie, which most wizards have thought impossible). the ministry just sees that two evil people have escaped, and knows they're related, and assumes they worked together. The tangled family trees of pureblood families is gonna be a big part of my story.

**** I'm sorry, that just confused me more. I was talking about Draco being placed with the Weasley's - why doesn't he go to his aunt?

***** Honestly I figure she was a good person but also not very interested in being dragged into her evil extended family's drama. She had been disowned and even her name was different. i doubt she even met Draco. I also liked the idea of the Wealsey's actually being chosen as some Dumbledore scheme to make Draco a better person, like "here's a consolation family that's actually decent and you can learn to be less of a little shit with them, and Molly knows how to deal with kids even when they're moody little death eater wannabes".

****** I'm really sorry, but that is a plot hole as I don't think people would be interested in setting the precedent of having a non-related, non-ministry official putting kids here and there. Especially when the Weasley's are financially strapped, have a well-known tiff with the Malfoys, and Andromeda is healthy, stable, in good standing with the community and a close relative.

Edit: Even if Andromeda doesn't want him Tonks is of age, and if Petunia took Harry in, then I don't see why Andromeda would be any different. Also, putting Draco with non-relatives would put Harry's own situation into question since Harry's relatives aren't even magical.

******* Hey, if someone else wants to take the very basic premise of Lucius getting caught/Draco getting removed from that hoke, more power to them. As far as I can tell, the ministry has a hands off approach to these things. Harry was placed with Petunia because of the magical protection offered, bit reall seeing how was neglected and it was never brought up makes me think theres not much oversight. I mean, Harry was born in the 80s but wizarding society seems to be very behind the times. I can imagine this being allowed. I also explicitly had a scene where Snape (acting as Dracos godfather in this rewrite) allows this. Tonks is an auror with no experience with kids, so she seemed like a poor option. The Weasleys are also distant cousins according to the updated Pottermore family tree, since one married a Black a few generations back.\\
But hey, I put the fact Draco is placed with Arthur and Mooly pretty front and center and wouldn't expect anyone not interested in that idea to read 20,000 words about it.
