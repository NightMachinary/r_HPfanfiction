I'm looking for the name of a fanfic where Harry Potter from a dystopean future travels to the day of the final task of the Triwizard tournament and goes about destroying the horcruxes - leaving a trail of corpses in the process. He is thorough, even going as far as killing his younger counterpart and finally himself.

It was on fanfiction.net. It was well written and had one of the tightest narratives of any fanfiction I've read.

Can anyone remember this fic? Thanks in advance.


** I do believe this is it: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]]
