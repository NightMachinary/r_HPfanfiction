Does anyone know of any fics in which the protagonists use magic to fight against climate change? I think that would be an interesting read!

Edit: perhaps "fight" is too aggressive. Something more like "address" is what I had in mind, though I'm open to anything.


** How exactly do you want this "fight" to go down? Because a fic where someone invents magical air purifiers to slap on chimneys (localised vanishing charms) is very different from "Imperius the world leaders into enforcing emission standards with an iron fist which would make Stalin envious".

*** I'm open to any and all possibilities! I personally was thinking more about inventing charms that clean the oceans, weird rituals to bring back extinct species, encouraging population growth, stuff like that. Kind of a merging of science and magic.

**** I have seen fixing the environment in a few fics, but it usually was a throwaway line at some point. Sorry that I can't give you more, but the few fics which google shows you when you search for HP fanfics about global warming are honstly awful (and incomplete).

** I read a fic once where magic was sort of failing because of all the pollution of the ground and waterways and they cleaned up mountains of trash, anonymously, so that they could clean up the environment, is that something that you'd be interested in, if I could find it again?

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

This one only briefly addresses the issue, but with all the car makers starting to hire wizards to make the cars run on magic and with the possibility of enchanting power plants to run on magic fire, it's easy once secrecy is no longer a thing. Managing air traffic of flying cars and carpets is a whole different issue.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

***** It's mostly a documentary of the political situation after Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles. International politics with hidden magical nations, domestic problems with anti-wizard hate groups (think Westboro Baptist Church), Al-Qaida hiring wizards for magical terror attacks, Voldemort's trying to take over multiple muggle countries including North Korea, WW3 almost happens, Arthur Weasley gets hired by Bentley to make flying cars, NASA starts portkeying astronauts around the solar system, et cetera. The whole Hogwarts story is more of a subplot, although Hermione gets really famous after saving a lot of muggles.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir Series]] by mad_fairy addresses climate change somewhat. It has the magical community realizing that muggles are destroying the planet and that they are better off getting away before it's too late. Harry and his friends also start a project where they are collecting litter from rivers and recycling it into usable ressources.

It's a Marvel crossover, but I have no knowledge of Marvel/Loki/Thor and could read and understand it anyway.

** The Philosopher King by RedHorse touches on climate change as part of the setting, but it's not a focus of the plot. The general idea is that Voldemort won, decimated the muggle population and subjugated them under wizarding rule, and per per decree, people are supposed to care about sea levels and climate change now.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
