I feel like this little exercise will help us appreciate our most hated character just a bit more, and maybe raise up some discussion.

Don't do that thing where you give a backhanded compliment to your least favorite character. Something like "I sure do admire Ron's cunning in tricking Hermione to marry his sorry ass." That shit doesn't fly. Say something you genuinely like about them. If you don't have anything, pick someone else.

Seriously. Don't insult them, and don't go "uh I can't think of anything". Seriously if you can't think of anything why even post.

I'll start.

I admire Hermione's determination in trying to free House Elves. While I think she's going about it the wrong way (trying to free the Hogwarts House Elves without their knowledge), I do admire the effort.

EDIT: What the fuck did I say about backhanded compliments? Seriously, shit like "they didn't die" isn't a compliment.

**** It's interesting how people approach the question in two different ways. You can think of "least favorite character" in the meta sense or within the narrative. Obviously if I'd were a character in the HP world I'd dislike Umbridge, Snape or Voldemort a lot more than Ron or Dumbledore, but that's not at all what I was thinking about when I read the question. I hate Snape with a passion, but I think he's one of the best characters.

I wonder if the same question in a less meta-oriented community would get more typical responses about the villains.

**** Actually, I mostly read Harry-centric stories.

Basically, when it comes to fanfiction, I'm a fan of the butterfly effect. I enjoy seeing how a single idea input by a different author can change the entire story, and this is easiest to see when looking through the same eyes as we do in canon.

 

Now why do I find Harry as my least favorite character?

I'll start with saying, when Pottermore was started, I sorted into Ravenclaw. If I was shown a completely hidden world filled with magic, let me say that again, *MAGIC*, the very idea that would shake the very foundations of your belief in the world, I would stop at nothing to learn everything I could and Harry simply did not.

He was being abused at home, whether it just being emotionally or also physically is unknown, but he was abused by the Dursleys. Then on his eleventh birthday, shown a world he could escape to, learns that he was lied to about his parents his entire life by the Dursleys, and that his parents were a part of this magical world and had gone to the very school he was being taken to.

And what does he do within the first /five years/ upon learning this? Nothing... He does what school requires of him, but little more. He almost never tries to learn of his parents, and what little he does know he either stumbled upon accidentally, or was told without asking about them.

Even looking at the wiki, I can't see anything harry knew about either Lily or James in the first several years other than their wands, James being a Chaser, an invisibility cloak owned by his father, and what they looked like.

Heck, he was given a picture book by Hagrid with pictures from friends of Harry's parents, yet to this day, neither we nor Harry know who these friends were. Sirius was obviously out, Snape unlikely to help, Remus doubtful for having enough pictures to fill an entire book.

I'll stop my rant now... didn't mean to make it that big.

 

Tldr; I just disagree with most of his actions in canon, and why I'm in this fandom is to see how a small change can change him for the better.

He isn't really a protagonist who reacts to circumstances that much, much less a person who actively pursues his own goals. He doesn't even have much interest in his own life. He's got very few attachments and doesn't try to create more.

**** I'm another person who considers Harry as my least favorite character and yes, I pretty much only read non-Harry centric stories. In just about all of my fandoms, if there is a protagonist then my favorite character is usually the quirky sidekick or the not-quite-enemy (aka the bad guy who's not quite as bad as the main character thinks). So naturally, I lean towards Fred/George, Luna and Draco. I just adore the HP world that JK built and I since the story is all about Harry I like that there is still some mystery to the other characters.

To answer OP's post: I like that Harry tries to do the right thing even though he doesn't always go about it in the best way.

  James and Sirius immediately disliked Snape when on the train he revealed he wished to be placed in Slytherin
#+end_quote

I don't recall this scene this way. IIRC, James said he wanted to be in Gryffindor, "like my dad!", and Snape said something derisive about wanting to have more brawn than brains. Basically not only trashing the house he wanted to go into, but simultaneously insulting his dad who he had /just/ said was a Gryffindor.

Seems like a pretty good reason to dislike someone right off the bat, even if it's not cause to bully someone for 7 years. We only have Snape's /worst/ memory from school to make that judgement off of though. Everyone sees themselves as the protagonist in their own story, and sees their "enemies" as the antagonists. Snape could have (and in my headcanon, did) antagonized James just as much as James antagonized him.

Also, even though it was technically "4 against 1" (which I would disagree with on the basis that we only have one sample to go off of; Snape probably wasn't /always/ alone), in the one memory we see in canon, Remus and Peter don't get involved, and Sirius only goads James on without ever casting a spell.

Canon didn't say whether he was or not. (If Dumbledore had expelled him, Lupin's secret could have been put at risk, and Dumbledore would have been the guy who let a werewolf into the school. I bet Voldemort owuld have been chuffed.)

But how do we know Snape knew Remus didn't take his potion? We don't. For all we know, Snape saw Remus sometime AFTER Remus walked out of his quarters and followed him.

But regardless, it was not Snape's responsibility to make sure Remus took his potion. It was his job to make the potion, which he did perfectly every month DESPITE hating the recipient's guts. The fault of Remus not taking his potion lies with REMUS alone.

If Remus could get distracted that one month and forget his potion, what is stopping this from happening in a different month? If I had a colleague that turned into a homicidal maniac if they didn't take their medication and that colleague did just that, I'm sorry but that person is a major danger to those around them because how do we know when they are going to turn into that homicidal maniac again? They have already proven that they are capable since they forgot their medication in the first place.

Didn't the book specifically mention that Snape was in his quarters to bring him his potion, and then noticed the map? He specifically knew Remus hasn't taken his potion the whole time. He didn't remind Remus or notify anyone of this fact. Considering the fact that Snape deliberately set out to have an innocent man kissed for being part of the Marauders that evening, the idea that he did this on purpose too is entirely in-character.

Well yes, but that's quite beside the point. Snape didn't at all care about the safety of anyone. I just explained that he deliberately set out to get Remus kissed, or at least imprisoned in Azkaban for things he /knew/ he didn't actually do. He did it entirely out of hatred and spite.

Not to mention that he undermined the authority of another teacher, encouraged rule breaking, and neglected to inform the authorities of a vital piece of information that, had Sirius Black actually been à villain, could have gotten Harry killed.

So whether he did it because he was vindictive or whether he did it because he was trying to protect the children, outing Lupin was the right thing to do - he'd proven that he was simply too irresponsible to manage his condition in a boarding school context.

She knows better than anyone what it's like to be connected to Voldemort and be manipulated, yet she still follows Harry. When she finally gets Harry and he almost immediately drops her again, she isn't some crazy bitch, she just accepts it - and still manages to be friendly with him. That is really admirable, and not something that I would have managed to do.

She, together with Neville, restarted the DA during DH, tried to steal Gryffindor's sword at risk to her own life and trying to work against Snape and the Carrows to provide safety for students at Hogwarts.

When the Battle of Hogwarts began she came back immediately, and survived it.

So yes, she is a love interest, and she has an unhealthy obsession with Harry - but she still is more than that. She isn't my most favorite character either, but she is by far not my least favorite.
