I'd love to see this kind of subversion in a fic (or even a short prompt). While it's not necessary, maybe also Ron being attacked by the troll with Harry and Hermione coming to the rescue. I also think it would be fitting for Hermione's first friend to also have her as their first friend in return. Thanks!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9901010][baby birds and other adventures]] by dirgewithoutmusic has that exact premise. (No Ron with the troll though).

  Harry did not know this and would not know this until Mrs. Granger mentioned it casually over a Christmas dinner years and years later-- but she and Mr. Granger reported the Dursleys for child abuse and neglect, over and over.The reports got lost-- minds scrubbed down, papers vanished-- but they kept calling in reports. They considered kidnapping. They couldn't imagine why the wizarding world might want to keep their chosen one somewhere so toxic, why they might want to keep this underfed child and his messy hair with those people."My mother left me a blood protection spell," said Harry, whose scar had not ached in years. He poked at his mashed potatoes under the focused attention of Mrs. Granger's stern little forehead wrinkle. "I had to live with family, blood family.""Then they should have made them treat you right," Mrs. Granger said, as though it was that simple.Mr. Granger gave Harry another helping of peas.

  Finally, Harry is off to Hogwarts, happy to get as far away from the Dursleys as possible. The only problem is that he had no idea how to find Platform Nine and Three Quarters. Fortunately, the parents of a bushy haired girl are there to help him find his way...
