So people say Hagrid is irresponsible for showing dangerous magical creatures to students and that makes him a bad teacher. Nobody seems to have a problem with the fact that potions seem to explode regularly in Snapes classes and send people to the hospital wing. It's a magic school so it's no wonder it can be dangerous.

Also it wpuld be quite funny for Harry to correct Dumbledore about 'Professor Hagrid' when Dumbles just calls him Hagrid. A little pay back for all the Snape/Professor Snape's Dumbledore corrects.


** I think the issue is more that Hagrid is straight-up incapable of properly judging danger. He's used to being nigh-indestructible and can't grasp that others are not.

Classes like Transfiguration and Potions are indeed dangerous, but McGonagall and Snape (much as I hate him) are clearly aware of this and are generally pretty serious about it.

Hagrid's just like "lmao, help me feed my crimes against God, I don't know what they are capable of yet lol"

I disagree with this one. Look at his first lesson with Harry's class. After bullying Harry right at the start, he simply has them start brewing a potion. No discussion of what the principles are, what the class entails, the properties of the ingredients and their interactions, safety measures both general and specific to the potion being attempted. So no, he's not concerned about the safety of students unless maybe if they're Slytherins.

** I lean towards yes.

They seem to spend months on blast ended screwts, something it's implied Hagrid created as a lark, and the kids will never run into again. It's a complete waste of time.

If Hagrid gets depressed, they spend weeks on flobberworms, again a complete waste of time.

That said, there is a scene in Timely Errors linkffn(4198643) that I rather like. Harry has time traveled to his parent's (5th or 6th) year. The Care Professor is very knowledgeable, but sounds like he's reciting out of a textbook he memorized. Hagrid gives better practical, real world information.

*** there is a benifit to the screwts, he asks them to figure out how to care for them, the screwts are a way to find out how to care for an unknown creature which is pretty much what Hagrid always did. The flubberworms are pathetic on the otherhand.

**** Sure, but again, those things are dangerous. The Risk Assessment for those lessons must be a bloody nightmare to fill in. "Possible death, wild animals involved." etc.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** I do not think he is bad teacher per se, but woefully unprepared and inexperienced. To be honest his predecessor should have primed Hagrid for the job. He should have started as an assistant and then when he took over would know how to actually run a class, deal with teenagers and be able to better judge the dangers.

I think in time he'll mellow and become much better.

** Are you saying Hagrid's classes aren't bad because Snape is /worse/? Because that's not how this works. Snape being worse does not mean Hagrid is any good.

Because having all third years in his class interact with hippogriffs together rather than one by one where he could keep a close eye on them, or just having a viewing/demonstration as the first lesson shows just how irresponsible he is.

I think you're underestimating the number of people who agree that Snape is a terrible teacher.

** Yes and no The class is probably alright for older students who know how dangerous things could be but not younger students who aren't as conscious of the danger the creatures might pose Case in point Malfoy and buckbeack
