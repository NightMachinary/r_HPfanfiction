  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

  Sequel to Fixing Past Mistakes. Now that the past mistakes had been fixed what of the future? Will Harry be able to secure a growing legacy as he ages? Will Dumbledore find out who they are and make life uncomfortable or will he only realize who they were when they are gone never to be seen again...what about Voldemort? Has he already returned working in the shadows or not?

** I'm not sure the Dursley /could/ kill Harry. The "love protection" from his mother is supposed to protect him from harm. It's one thing in canon to not activate because, while unhappy, Harry was never in "true" danger, but if it can't protect him from an angry Muggle, it is next to useless. But since the Dursley (or rather Petunia) is used to fuel the protection, maybe it can't protect against her.

Anyways, if Harry does die before Hogwarts, I can see the story goes in 2 directions :

- Dumbledore reputation is destroyed, he loses all of his jobs, Voldemort comes back and with nothing to oppose him wins easily. Most wizard don't even try to oppose him when he kills muggle and muggleborn (why should they bother help people who killed their hero), and when he finally start to attack other wizards, it's already too late.
- "/Neville My Boy, would you want to come to my office to have some lemon drops? Oh and don't try to see what is in the Forbidden corridor. I know you are very interested to see what is under the trap door guarded by the Cerberus, but do not do it, and even if he is instantly fall asleep when he hears music, do not use this enchanted harp that I just gave you/".

*** Eh, seems unfair to Dumbledore, he always had a more hands-off approach to Harry's life (instead of micromanaging it as in many stories), he never pointed his wand to Harry's head and told him “stay with the Dursley's under surveillance or else...”, most of Harry's adventures consisted of things that he couldn't realistically have known unless he kept Harry (and probably some of his friends) under surveillance around the clock. Hell, for all we know he didn't even /have/ the authority to interfere too much on Harry's life, having him try to fit Neville on Harry's supposed shoes would mostly be a decision of the author.

Besides, him taking the fall would depend on him sidestepping the official canals, otherwise Fudge would take most of the fall (as he would be the one with the most power/visibility) with him taking just some damage, many would still defend muggles (though it would admittedly be a huge argument pro-Voldemort that would make things easier for the DE)

**** I was probably not clear. I really like Dumbledore and I think that he always had Harry's best in mind. When I say that he would be opposed to McGonagall (or anyone else for that matter) raising Harry into Hogwarts, it's because I think that the castle is, for Dumbledore, not a suitable place to raise a child, especially one like Harry.

Dumbledore placed Harry at Privet Drive because living with his relative would, by lack of better word, "maintain" the protections brought by his mother sacrifice. Since his relative are Muggle, it was also the perfect place for him to grow up far from his fame.\\
Hogwarts would fail on both these points:

- Concerning the security, Hogwarts is a school. Hundreds of student live there all year long, as well as some professors. The castle is also regularly visited by divers adults (students' parents, governors, and maybe even some spectators for the Quidditch' matches).\\
  Because of this, securing the castle for Harry would be very hard, and it would be impossible for Hogwarts to function "normaly" as a school while doing it. After all, it would only take one instant for an older student (say a 7th year Slytherin frustrated because his parents had been arrested) or a visitor to harm Harry. Knowing his position, anyone wishing him harm would also have more opportunities to plot against him.
- Concerning his fame, being at Hogwarts would just be terrible. Harry would constantly be surrounded by impressionable students who would want to see him. Ministry official like Fudge would bother Dumbledore daily to "meet" Harry (and try to use him). No matter how he ends up (a copy of Malfoy, or Moody), it is doubtfull that Harry would be well adjusted when he finally become a student there.

Add at that other problems (his potential guardian being too busy with his official duties to really take care of Harry, the lack of children his age to interact with . . .), and I don't think Dumbledore would either agree to such a plan, especially if he has Harry's best interest in mind.

​

As for the "/Neville my boy/" bit, it was mostly meant as a joke. We can't really know what would happen if Harry was either killed by the Dursley, mainly because "canon" Dumbledore would have never let Harry die (Figg was here for a reason after all). Since we can't really know what would happen, everyone is free to imagine whatever he wants.
