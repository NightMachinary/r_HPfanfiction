I'm looking for a fic where Harry was raised by Sirius and/or Remus. And I would like for it to be completed, and end up with the Harry/Ginny pairing. If anyone knows anything like this, pls let me know!


** You could always check the list of fics at [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]]. There might be a Raised by Sirius fic listed there.

** A second chance by Breanie - it's ongoing but has a seriously high word count and is updated weekly so plenty to catch up on! There's a lot of romance across different pairings and can get pretty steamy however

*** I started this and I really liked it but because of an death event that happens after 100+ chapters I decided that I couldn't bear to read the rest of it. Shame, it has such good writing

**** I think I know the exact one you're talking about. Sirius, just like in canon, right?
