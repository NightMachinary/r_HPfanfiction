It could be anyone (except those who know he is innocent) say Draco, Dean, Seamus, Daphne etc


** Draco would be a disaster, almost no question about it

Dean could be reasoned with

Seamus would be a smaller disaster than Draco but still a disaster

Daphne could honestly go either way, if it's a Haphne fic it'd probably be the starting point of their relationship and if it isn't a Haphne fic then it'd likely be a disaster, or she gets reasoned with like Dean and just ignores it

******** I feel like Ollivander would not take bribes and would also probably know of his innocence already, he just has that feeling of being omniscient more perfected than even Dumbledore

We don't actually know if the Black vaults have wands

************ Yeah probably, though idk if he'd answer to Sirius' call, I mean he is a free elf but whatever, my headcanon is that he secretly bonded to Harry in a way that cant be broken without death of one
