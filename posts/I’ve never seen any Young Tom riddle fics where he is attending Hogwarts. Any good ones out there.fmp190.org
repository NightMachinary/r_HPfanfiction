** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/]]

This is one of the best young Tom Riddle fics you'll find. It's about an AU Tom Riddle who gets sorted into Hufflepuff and turns out to be more far more frightening and dangerous than he did as Voldemort. He essentially winds up becoming the leader of the House and transforming Hufflepuff into his own network of contacts, spies, agents, and more. It's a chilling fic of just how dangerous a pre-Voldemort Tom could be, and what could have been.

** I've read quite a few, though none of them are canon compliant. It's relatively common to write about Tom attending Hogwarts with a childhood friend or timetraveler. Would you be interested in any of those?
