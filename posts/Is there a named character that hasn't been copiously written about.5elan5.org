Like, is there a character who's name is mentioned in the canon books who has never appeared in a fanfiction?


** There are very few fics that mention [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Evan_Rosier][Evan Rosier]] but he's kind of badass. He was the Death Eater that infamously fought Mad Eye Moody to his death rather than be captured and sent to Azkaban; he's the cause of Moody's scars and injuries. Voldemort's side lost a strong ally when he died.

  Slytherins--- this is a group who laughs when Neville falls off a broom and breaks his wrist. And what if we had Harry there, who had always been the one laughed at, who had a nice thirst to prove himself, who had green trim on his robes instead of red? This Harry still stepped out in front of Malfoy's best sneer and demanded Neville's Rememberall back--- though he got a detention from it, not a Seekership.When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. Harry did not ask Millicent to come with him; this was not a boy who asked for things. When he had asked for things, Dudley had laughed, Petunia had scowled, and Vernon had said, “no,” or just kept reading the newspaper like he hadn't heard anything at all. But when Harry went, Millicent bunched up her robes in her hands and followed.

There's a fair bit of Seamus and Dean out there and tons and tons of Nev, how you think he's on this list IDK.

Cho gets some attention in Ravenclaw and Flitwick is normally the duelling instructor or confidente in Indy!Harry fics.

Fudge gets some oneshots.

Depends on your definition of canon, but she's not fanon. She's never mentioned in the books. Not even hinted at, IIRC. But JKR says she's one of Hermione's roommates.

** Let me tell you: I cannot recall /ever/ seeing a fic that mentioned Yvonne.\\
"Um, Yvonne who?" I almost hear you asking... Yvonne the friend of Petunia Dursley who happened to go on a vacation to Majorca during Dudley's birthday and was thus unable to stay with Harry while Dudley went to the zoo.\\
It's never really explained why she was considered in the first place, which makes it all the more tantalizing; and I'm seriously considering writing a fic where Yvonne gets an extra ticket and ends up taking Harry to Majorca without telling the Dursleys (I know I'll never be able to do it justice, so my current plan has it as a side-plot in an otherwise unrelated story).

More seriously, despite his last name and location, there's surprisingly little about Mark Evans; and this side of /Harry's Island Home/, I can't recall seeing much about the Diagon Alley shopkeepers (not even Florean Fortescue) outside of their shopkeeper position either.
