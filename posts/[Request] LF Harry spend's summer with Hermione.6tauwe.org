I've read a couple of this "sub-genre" if you will, and I enjoy them a lot. Hoping some of you might have some recommendations for more with a similar setting. I like some amount of smut but not oneshots, I like some amount of story around it all, at the very least like 4 chapters. I am greatful for all recommendations and I appreciate them a lot.


** No smut at all, I don't think, but I liked the story.

**** The smut at the beginning was cut out (I believe from Chapter 2). And there isn't too many scenes later on either; some here and there but they are pretty tame and wouldn't label it "smut."

***** Oh, huh. Didn't realize it was edited. I had a .doc format I received from the author in my archive a few years ago.
