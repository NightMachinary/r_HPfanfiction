:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find a short incomplete fanfiction I read in the past.

The premise is that Harry is the brother of the Girl-Who-Lived. However while she attends Hogwarts, he went to Durmstrang to be away from his father. He and James have a strained relationship due to the fact that James blames him for Lily's death (not sure, but I think Lily died trying to protect Harry the night Voldemort attacked)

He's a lot closer to Sirius as a result.

The fic starts off with Harry returning to England after Voldemort's resurrection and decides to stay in England at Sirius' request due to the war getting started. I remember Tonks being the one to carry him to Grimmauld Place after his international portkey and also him meeting Penelope Clearwater at the Three Broomsticks where he finds out she's an outcast after an attack by Fenrir leaves her as a werewolf.

I really want to find back this fic, even though it's rather short and the writing standard is probably not as good as I remembered.
