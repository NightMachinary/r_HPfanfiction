#+TITLE: I had this idea and I realized I've never seen this done before. Why does Harry never try to reason with Peter in the Graveyard? Like, yes he is a traitor and all, but you are about to have Lord Friggin' Voldemort resurrected. Surely Harry would try to dissuade him?

** Guess shock first. Harry doesn't get more chance to process things. Doesn't seem he knows what wormtail is doing until he's at least halfway through it. Also, you usually try to reason with people before they kill people not after... so yes, Cedric lying dead was an argument against reasoning with him.

*** I mean calling Cedric a friend is kind a stretch, no? I agree with the general idea "he just saw someone get killed and was freaking out" but at the risk of pedanticism, friend is a bit too strong a word.

They clearly respected each other and acted friendly and nice, you know Cedric being a Hufflepuff and all, but I don't think the two ever spoke for more than a couple lines.

**** Not really. There aren't a lot of people who are very nice to Harry to begin with and he spent a good portion of his life surrounded by people who absolutely hated him and did anything they could to make his life miserable, meaning Harry gets attached to people who are nice to him faster than other people would. Also, not as relevant, but I do think that they would have been actual friends (not best friends or anything but still close) if Cedric had survived.

Edit: just want to clarify, I'm not discrediting the Weasleys or Hermione. I fully recognize how important they were to Harry and I'm glad he had them! That being said, beside them and Neville (and later Luna and kind of Dean and Seamus), Harry doesn't have a lot of friends or know people his age who like him for being just Harry (not the BWL). Also there are a bunch of people like Draco who hate him and his friends and he has people trying to kill him every year.

You are a bad guy who betrayed your closest friends out of fear. Better stick around nearby and feel guilty for a decade, then commit desperately loyal acts for the man you fear so you can be his toady.

*** There's the possibility he /said/ he did it out of fear, in front of Sirius and Remus. And yeah, maybe he actually gave up the secret of where James and Lily were hiding out of fear of what would happen if Voldemort found he was holding that secret.

But his actions kinda point to maybe he didn't join Voldemort as a spy in the first place out of fear. Maybe he really believed in the cause. And James and Sirius didn't really treat him the best from the very short memory we saw.

***** Yes, that's definitely the canon-friendly explanation for what he did. But when you think about it, there was more than a year that he was the one protecting Voldemort. He had no protection for himself during that time- just when Sirius would be the very most enthusiastic about hunting him down, too. Pretty brave of him if his only motivation was his cowardice. Plus he was restarting a war by resurrecting Voldemort- a war he eventually died of, and something you'd think a pure coward wouldn't be fond of doing.

****** See I wonder if he actually knew how much he'd have to look after the dark lord when he first went looking for him or for how long.. And once he did find Voldemort, he couldn't exactly leave him after realising. He probably thought Voldemort would still rise again even without him and when he did he would not be happy with Pettigrew for abandoning him.

Plus they found Barty pretty early on after Peter joined him so Voldemort would have risen sooner rather than later after that. Besides that, do you think the Mr I will kill my father for you, you are my everything, death eater would be happy after finding out Peter left his Lord?

I think as much as Peter was afraid to be with Voldemort he was more afraid of the consequences of leaving him.

** In-world, thinking and reasoning isn't exactly Harry's strong suit. He's a hothead, not a manipulator. He's more likely to just get angry and throw spells at something than talk it out, especially in the later books.

Also, he'd probably be too emotionally invested in hating Pettigrew to think of it. Generally, most people aren't exactly inclined to talk to or trust the murderer of their parents, especially as children. His reaction to Pettigrew in book three was "murder murder murder!" then "Put him in Azkaban so he can suffer the Dementors!" and anyone reacting that emotionally to someone isn't a person who's gonna think of persuading that someone to change sides. Remus and Sirius might try it (more likely Remus than Sirius) but Harry almost certainly wouldn't. That's my guessed assessment, anyway. YMMV. :)

Doylistically, Rowling needed the scene to happen that way, so she made it happen that way.

*** In world, he's bound and gagged, so he couldn't say much beyond "you!",

Reasoning is actually one of Harry's strong suits and we see it each book. It's pretty much all he does in DH. He isn't more likely to throw out spells. He's usually angry in those moments, yeah, but he also listens, either because he's forced to or because he wants the whole truth, which is usually the case.

#+begin_quote

But this is exactly what he does. He hears Sirius out in PoA, going as far as to knock Snape out to get the truth. He watches Snape's memories. He has an entire conversation with Voldemort, in which he offers/taunts him with an out.

Remus and Sirius were rolling up their sleeves as they prepared to kill Peter. Harry prevents it by suggesting suffering in Azkaban was a better alternative to them being murderers. In DH, while Peter has a hand around his throat, he talks Peter into hesitating to kill him.

** As many said around here... Harry is 14 and has no time to process what's going on. Also he has a piece of cloth in his mouth. I am more surprised that Pettigrew didn't rationalize that himself. Or maybe... just a thought so please don't kill me... before his first fall, Voldemort was pretty good to his followers. It was the madness and frustration accumulated over the years he spent disembodied that made him so nasty.
