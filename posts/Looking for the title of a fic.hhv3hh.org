So I read a fanfic that had Harry as the grim reaper and he helps everyone reincarnate but eventually he gets bored so he and Tom riddle recreate the Harry Potter time so they can mess around


** Hey, maybe it's this one?

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

*** Wait, in Full Circle the fact that they go back to their first life is not intentional.

Maybe it's this one?

There was another one I remember, where they drunkenly design their new (old)reality in Purgatory and they change some things but they don't remember until they wake up in their new life. But for the life of me I can't remember the title.

  Harry Potter, Master of Death, was reborn fifty-one times with his soulmate Tom Riddle in various eras and universes. They finally returned to their first life after a millennia of absurdity and amusement, and Harry's ready to make the most of it.Chaos shall reign supreme.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!
