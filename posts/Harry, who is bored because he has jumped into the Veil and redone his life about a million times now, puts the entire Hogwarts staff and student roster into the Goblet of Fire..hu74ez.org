** Harry smirked a bit as the Goblet's flames flared red for the first time and a piece of parchment shot into the air. Who, he wondered, would the Goblet choose as Hogwarts champion?

He knew it aimed, as far as it could aim for any outcome, to put on the best possible show. But what would that entail? Someone like Ginny, with little chance of success, but whose victory would be spectacular? Would it be Cedric once more, with his great sense of fair play? Perhaps the flamboyant and skilled Professor Flitwick would be selected; he seemed a likely contender. Oh, this was going to be amazing. Why hadn't he thought of it before? Harry hadn't enjoyed himself this much in sixteen reincarnations, and the tournament was nowhere near begun!

"The champion for Durmstrang," Dumbledore read, "will be Viktor Krum."

Well, so far so good. That one almost never changed, as Viktor was easily the best of Durmstrang's students. Still, he had thought it might well be Karkaroff.

"The champion for Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour."

A bit more variable, the French selection. He'd been on a streak of Fleurs recently, though. Why should that change now?

"The Hogwarts champion is..."

Dumbledore trailed off as the third piece of parchment fell. He cast a quick series of spells on the Goblet with a few flicks of his wand, then, unsatisfied, started muttering a longer incantation. When he finished his casing, he said,

"There appears to have been an incident with the selection of champions. I am sure we shall have this resolved in just a moment, but for now, sit tight."

With those words, Dumbledore, Madame Maxime, Karkaroff, and Mr. Crouch disappeared into the side room where the selected champions had gone.

A few minutes later, they returned, and Dumbledore spoke again.

"We believe the Goblet of Fire to have been tampered with. Still, the selected Hogwarts champion must compete, and that... is myself."

"While I will remain headmaster, Professor McGonagall will work with the other school heads to design new tasks, and she will be fulfilling my role as a judge as well. This is--"

Harry stared at the Goblet, tuning out the speech.

How had he not noticed this when he put in the staff and student rosters? Dumbledore was a highly skilled and powerful wizard, with a flair for flashy transfiguration. He had assumed the headmaster would be excluded by virtue of his position as a judge, but apparently that wasn't official enough for the Goblet.

"--we all have different strengths, and so I am sure that all the champions will be able to compete on an equal level."

As Dumbledore was interrupted a second time by an unexpected name coming out of the Goblet, Harry Potter (tragically short life #48) began to laugh.

This was going to be an /excellent/ Triwizard Tournament.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE
