I just want there to be more trans fic so that the fandom can run counter to JK's most recent bullshit. The story can directly revolve around a character being trans, or it can just be a trait of the character that's not super important to the plot.

Really my goal here is to signal-boost that there are trans-ally authors in this fandom who continue to make works in spite of the author, and also that the author hasn't caused this fandom to lose interest due to her extremely regrettable toxicity.

***** I've seen places that were not primarily trans spaces that were better though. It is not impossible. You're welcome.

*** This is more a question of the author being intolerant of an entire group or people than her political views not lining up with mine, and I don't think this is a political issue anyway, more an ethical one.

((I think that character is agendered, not trans, but thanks for including a fic rec anyway))

***** I deem it intolerance because she's gone on record saying (on Twitter) that she doesn't think trans women deserve to be seen as real women. Yes it is an important, complex issue, one that she shouldn't have made such unfortunate comments on, but the fact remains that she has continued to express her stance on, and that stance is that she does not tolerate trans women. Hence, she is intolerant.

******* I see now that your beliefs are fundamentally opposed to mine, and may I put forward that I intended this thread to be a space for people who do, in fact, agree that trans women are women, and that space may not be one you are comfortable in. With that in mind, I respectfully request that you perhaps find somewhere else to post, as you've stated your beliefs and i think it'd be more effort than I'm willing to give to change your mind, so this is where my interaction with you ends.

** There's quite a few 'Harry becomes a girl' type fics, if you count that. They usually involve some improbable accident or event causing it then Harry coming to terms with it, rather than transitioning due to desire though

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."
