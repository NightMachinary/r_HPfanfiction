It will have the Second Wizarding War(Circa 1997) being interrupted by a devastating global war, between a Wizard-Muggle alliance, and a third group of humans known as 'The Desolated'. They possess technology that is a combination of magic and Muggle science. Their technology devastates the UN-ICW Alliance(The name of the Wizard-Muggle Alliance), and even with the Death Eaters fighting on the UN-ICW's side, the alliance struggles to regain any territory.


** Ok so you have the basic premise, so what do you actually need help with?

** It would have to be a very compelling reason for the ICW to breach the Statute. Right away, that makes the threshold for suspending disbelief much higher.

*** Well, what would you create? There are many fictional civilizations that would be a large enough threat to breach the Statute. I was thinking something akin to a combination of the Imperium of Man from Warhammer and the Augments from Star Trek. The story would be based heavily off of Resistance:Fall of Man. The heroes win in the end, but Earth is devastated.
