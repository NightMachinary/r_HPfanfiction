I hate songfics. So many of them read like they're written by teenagers. It always has a talent show at Hogwarts in them. There's no plot, just copying and pasting song lyrics into their story. Argh! I hate songfics! Who else is with me?

Does anyone actually like them? Why?


** They generally ARE written by teenagers.

** I love fics inspired by songs, but absolutely dread the ones where there are legit songs being sung in the fics. They usually make no sense plot-wise and they just find some random way to have a character singing it without making it realistic in any way.

** If it is a period appropriate song (eg no Taylor Swift) and generally fits a British setting (NWA Fuck the Police would probably be weird if performed by Hermione), I don't mind them. But I've only ever seen stories where a song is woven in between a oneshot, not some stupid Hogwarts idol.

**** [[https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-FFN-Graphs-Vis/][~80% of writers are in between 13 and 17 years old, usually.]]. It has little to do with quality.

Though I'll grant that Sturgeon's law is still very relevant.

***** That's a six year old study of FFN users. Not very accurate. There are tons of studies out there that actually prove that the majority of fandom writers are women over 25.

***** I had a look through there and I'd point out that the 80% ages thing only references users who report their age, not authors as specified earlier when referring to the % of women. Furthermore the data itself comes from 2010, and for a digital platform thats only really useful as modern history.

** I have not heard of this type of story before, but I certainly can't see any appeal to it! Mind you, I find the idea of a Hogwarts talent show to be rather interesting as a story idea, if done well. I wouldn't want copied and pasted songs, though.

** [[https://youtu.be/CxK_nA2iVXw][I have no strong feelings one way or the other]] I don't often read them or happen upon them anymore, so there's no reason for me to hate them. What I've seen from them are usually songs vaguely related to the plot sprinkled throughout the story, and usually the plot is some ooc romance that would never happen how it's written.

So whatever.

** The closest things to songfics I liked was the old Ten for Ten thing that went around a decade or so ago. iPod on shuffle, write ten short fics/drabbles/whatever that are inspired by the first ten songs that pop up.\\
And...it was more writing than reading. Half the time it was a piece of music that kicked the Muse into gear.\\
And yes...as mentioned elsewhere...the fics are "inspired by". No songs being sung by characters, no verses being interwoven with someones inner most thoughts or ....whatever.\\
Although I /did/ do a 'Castle' fic to "Something In Red" (Lorrie Morgan) and stuck the song verses in between sections. Does that count?
