I always wondered at her pure panic over failing her classes. The abuse can have any range from neglect and high unrealistic expectations to physical, but the main point would be Hermione and her unfortunate home life. Pairings are fine and mentor fics are encouraged. Ty!


** I recall one where her parents 'had the obligatory child expected of yuppies' Check. one where : you're possessed by demons begone!"

one where: Hermione had a relationship with her dad, where they snuck chocolate , where her mom was 'Dr Puckle"\\
one where: Hermione's mom is obliviated and has divorced her husband, and she hooks up with Hermione AND Harry, Her dad tries to chat her up in a Las Vegas bar, not knowing who she is.

of course I can't remember the title of any of these.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
