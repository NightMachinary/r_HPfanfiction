I can't find any decent one save for a few. Any reccomendations????


** Could you share the ones you found?

I recently read a Snape/Harry story where Snape had a crush on James ("you are so much like your father, Potter!"), now I am interested in James/Severus.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19056670][*/Earning His Forgiveness/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/OwlsWithFins/pseuds/OwlsWithFins][/OwlsWithFins/]]

#+begin_quote
  When Snape brushes off James Potter's attempt to make amends, James makes a game out of winning the Slytherin's forgiveness. Instead of giving him some peace of mind, however, the game causes his feelings toward his once rival to spiral out of control in a direction he never anticipated.

#+begin_quote
  James dated Lily, but Lily applied for an internship in Germany and was accepted that she chose to break up with James three months before their graduation. Severus chose to apply for his potions mastery without Malfoy's money and connections. In this universe, life hits them with marriage, divorce, perceived cheating, pureblood politics and family magic. James/Severus

****** I mean even in canon we only get Harry's POV. Maybe Snape loved Lily because he was lonely and she was his only real friend. Maybe he had a big ol' crush on James. Maybe when his unrequited crush (James) fell for Lily and started taking her away from, as well as rejecting his love, he became bitter and turned to the dark side. WE DONT KNOW.
