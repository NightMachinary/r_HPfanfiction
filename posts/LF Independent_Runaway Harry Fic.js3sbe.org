What I'm look for are fics where Harry, because of some sort of event, starts taking efforts to become independent, and that he possibly runs away because of expectations or other emotional problems/traumas. Probably set somewhere around 3-5th year unless 6th-7th are AU enough that the war hasn't started yet, or something else, because in all reality, no decently written Harry Potter would abandon his friends in beginning or middle of a broiling war. And I'm not really talking about /dramatic realization, training montage, 1000 IQ/ kinda Harry. I want more of a...figuring-himself-out kinda Harry, where he probably runs away and starts to discover things about himself while becoming self-sufficient. A good example of this is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14340108/chapters/33095760][It Started With The Number 3 (and stayed that way)]] by blurredink.

It's Fred/George/Harry, but if anyone is curious, the fic is unfinished and Harry hasn't even kissed anyone yet---never mind the fact that the author made notes wondering about how the twins could work in that sort of relationship. Just a general jist: Harry runs away, disguises himself, gets a job, and has a whole bunch of self-discovery with his efforts of hiding in relatively plain sight.

I just want a whole bunch of self-discovery. If any of you have read this fic or will read this fic, you'll probably know what I'm talking about. The runaway bit is just a very lucky bonus if y'all got nada. I won't mind terribly, but I'd rather not have HP/DM or HP/HG or HP/GW. I'm partial to slash, but I don't really care as long as the romance is secondary and just the little pinch of salt to an already seasoned chicken.


** linkao3(Taking Charge by A_Perverted_Romance_Addict) Not a runaway fic but it has that self-discovery you are looking for, at least in the beginning. I haven't been keeping up with it so I can binge later chaptersðŸ˜‚

  Cedric's death marked Harry. It made him think. Really think. About life. About death. What it means to live and what is important in life. His priorities change. His perception of the world and people within it changes.As he evaluates his life until now, he comes to the realisation that his life has never been his own and that he was never truly alive. Determined to change that, he makes a decision; he is going to take his life into his own hands. He is going to be the only one in charge of himself and his happiness. Because he wanted and deserved to be happy. He wanted and deserved to live without people meddling and trying to control him, without trying to hurt him. He was aware people would be confused. They will have questions. Some will support him, some will absolutely resent him. He still wasn't sure who will fall into which category, but he honestly didn't give a damn about it, because almost nobody seemed to give a damn about him either.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.
