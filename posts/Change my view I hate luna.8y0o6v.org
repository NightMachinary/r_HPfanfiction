I just don't get how people can like her or even pair her with anyone.

She belongs in a mental ward and therapy.

Her passive accepting of bullying in canon and every single fanfic disgusts me. It is never a view on the powerlessness of the victim but always like, they don't mean it, they are under me, or some other bullshit.

I don't remember if she contributed anything ever in canon.


** Look, here's the deal about Luna. She is a conspiracy theorist character that was introduced by Rowling, in a similar way that Neville became important in OOTP, because they needed more people than Harry to see the thestrals, plus Rowling started to cotton on to it being a very pro-Gryffindor story. Diversity and all that.

But Luna is perhaps singularly unique in the Harry Potter series for one reason: there is never a point in the story where you can say she was mean or bad or stupid. There is no Ron-walks-away-from-Harry moment, or any Hermione-tattles-to-the-teachers moment, or Dumbledore's ten dark and lonely years move.

She is a kind person. The only people who dislike her or treat her badly are usually petty ignorant bullies. In this way, she is the most like Harry, and perhaps Neville, that the trauma of her childhood loss left a distinct mark on their characters. Her response was that she is never mean, always kind, even in the worst situations.

It has been said that adversity brings out the best, and worst, of humanity. Luna can in some ways represent the best of humanity: optimistic, open to the infinite, and kind in the face of malice and cruelty.

There are instances where she shows irritation or loneliness, like when she responded coldly to Hermione insulting the Quibbler and I believe she once referred to the DA meetings as "almost like having friends".

So more than not caring about what people thought of her, I think she very much wanted people to like her, but refused to compromise or change herself to do so, which is admirable. I probably wouldn't want to hang around her much though.

Luna thought they were laughing about her believing Harry, and does defend herself. But the fact that they were actually laughing at her radish earrings went completely over her head.

Yes Snape was the creator of the spell, and most likely the counter-curse as well, but I do believe others would know the curse, as Draco Malfoy wouldn't be the first victim of the spell. Sure there had to be deaths from it but I do believe there had to also be those saved from it as well. And I think Poppy might know it, if not the St Mungo's people after Snape switched sides. Of course my conception is that it's not just Harry and Snape that know of the curse but I'd assume other Death Eaters as well. Snape was a real Death Eater at one point and I'm sure his buddies knew of the spell, or at least seen it used by Snape at some point and would know of it.

A place where they are required to have little name tags in their clothes, to enable easy and speedy return. A place with a large staff off people who constantly clean up after them and sort issues out so efficiently they are never noticed most of the times.

#+end_quote

I personally love Luna, though I never pair her with anyone, for the very important reason that we never really see her interact with anyone on a potentially romantic level.

#+begin_quote
  She belongs in a mental ward and therapy.
#+end_quote

People who are admitted into mental wards tend to be either dangerous, either to themselves or to others, or else are unable to function in day-to-day life by themselves.

The idea that you think Luna belongs in a mental ward is, frankly, rather frightening.

As to whether she needs therapy, I'd like to remind you that these are fantasy books. As a general rule, therapists tend to be in very short supply in fantasy books.

And really, does Luna actually /need/ therapy? She seems to have accepted the reality of death and is at peace with it. That actually puts her above most of the characters.

#+begin_quote
  Her passive accepting of bullying in canon and every single fanfic disgusts me. It is never a view on the powerlessness of the victim but always like, they don't mean it, they are under me, or some other bullshit.
#+end_quote

It's important to point out just how far the bullying goes in canon. Luna's called Loony, which is hurtful, but also a really lame nickname. That's something five-year-olds come up with. If /teenagers/ are calling her that, Luna could quite justifiable find that beneath her.

We also know that her books and clothes are stolen and hidden. Luna's never described in the books as missing clothing--her walking the halls barefoot is from the movies. So the thieving, while hurtful, is also, apparently, not enough to interfere with her day-to-day activities.

Third, Luna describes the taunts and stealing as "all in good fun." You can say that it's "bullshit," but compare what we see with Luna with other bullies. While he doesn't do it often compared to using cruel taunts, Malfoy has been known to physically intimidate his victims. He uses Crabbe and Goyle as muscle and he casts curses at people he doesn't like.

Luna never gets treated like that. She's called an uncreative, if cruel, nickname and people swipe some of her stuff. But she is not physically bullied.

And if the people who pick on her and take her things wanted to attack her physically, it wouldn't necessarily be difficult. Most of the bullying is from her own housemates. She'd be outnumbered and outgunned if they ever decided to ambush her.

** Here's my argument: Your annoyance with Luna is kind of J.K. Rowling's point. I adore Luna because she's such an accurate depiction of the kind of person who is slightly shunned in real life. Oftentimes in books and movies, perfectly normal, smart, funny people are ostracized by their peers, and it simply doesn't add up. In real life, the people you tend to not want to hang out with are the people who always say things that leave you with nothing to respond with but, 'Er... okay...'

J.K. Rowling has Luna do a lot of subtle things that I think are realistic for a socially awkward person, like Luna /losing her shit/ over Ron's dumb joke.

#+begin_quote
  'I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,' said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle's low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. '/I ... must ... not ... look ... like ... a ... baboon's ... backside ....'/

  Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing.

  'That was /funny/!'

  Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and forward, clutching her sides.
#+end_quote

What Luna teaches us is that these people -- in all their weirdness and awkwardness -- are worth getting to know as well, that they are smart and funny in their own ways that are different from what we may be used to.

My reaction was towards the poster, who said she "belongs in a mental ward and therapy", because they are disgusted by her lack of reaction. I would argue that disgusting someone else by her behaviour is not reason enough to force her into therapy. Luna has suffered because she was bullied, we can not make chance the past, so we ask her the question if she still suffers because of what she has been through. If yes, then yes, I think she should be offered therapy. If not, then who are we to force it upon her.

********** Okay, I understand what you mean. I think it is definitely alarming how Luna and her father are described. Something with their relationship seems off. Though I think that this whole "children become exactly like their parents"-thing in the entire HP series is absurd and unhealthy. That goes so far that the suppossed wise guy of the series says that a certain child conceived in rape can not love and calls it poetic justice - which is just about the worst thing I have ever read. And let's not forget the whole Joke that is called HP and the CC.

I am not sure if Luna is that unaware of the world around her, or if appearing like this is just her way of dealing with everything. I am not sure if bullying for example can be stopped effectively, except by finding real friends that can protect you of course, which is never an easy task.

Have you read linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]) ? The main character in it hates the same things about Luna that you seem to hate. It is brilliant imo.
