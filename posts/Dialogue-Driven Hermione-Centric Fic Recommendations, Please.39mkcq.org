Title says it rather succinctly... I feel like reading a fic with a smarmy/sassy/snarky Hermione with lots of dialogue that makes one giggle. (As far as pairings go, I like quite a few, but shy away from hp/hg and rw/hg.)

Thank you!


** linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is a great one from what I've heard, but I've not had the pleasure to read it myself yet.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) Hermione is a bit OP and Mary Sue-ish but the fic has a very nice exploration of Arithmancy, which is barely touched upon in most fics.

** linkffn(The Debt of Time)

I'm rereading it right now, it's very long, complete, Hermione centric, and I do recall her being snarky/sarcastic at times.

  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
