Voldemort in canon is almost cartoonishly evil, held back from killing and torturing for only as long as it takes to get his body back, then no one - follower or foe - is safe. By the climax of Philosopher's Stone, he'd already tried to kill Harry (by throwing him off his broom) without any provocation, and was clearly unmoved by it. In that light, his invitation for Harry to join him was absurd. Harry had no incentive except perhaps immediate fear for his life, and even that wouldn't mean much when there would be no particular reason for Voldemort to spare him after getting the Stone.

Yet Tom Riddle was supposed to be charismatic and charming, able to sway almost anyone to his cause. We see glimpses of his teenage self in book 2, coming much closer to that description - horribly manipulative and not /actually/ caring about people, but able to at least make them think he did. Rather incongruous with the depiction of his adult self.

I'd be interested to see stories where Voldemort's actions are such that by the time he makes that offer to Harry, there's actually a reason for Harry to consider it (beyond having a wand aimed at his head). Not necessarily, "Harry was sorted into Slytherin, indoctrinated into pureblood ideals by Draco, and already half agrees with Voldemort by this point," but more of, "Voldemort actually has non-sociopathic - if controversial - ambitions and pursues them in a way that a reasonable and logical person might support." More like the Tom Riddle of The Pureblood Pretense, perhaps, although he was still all about "join me and you will become powerful."


** Or, if he understands Harry, "join me and we can bring your family back."

"You don't have the power to resurrect people!"

** 11 years old Harry would be easy to convince that all muggles hate magic (I mean he has the example at homes. History books have chapters about it), and people like the Weasley threatens the secrecy, and the safety of wizards.

Muggle-borns (don't use mudblood yet), are also a threat to this safety, since their parents and immediate family knows about Magic, and would hate it, and hate magics. Look at your Aunt Petunia, your Uncle Vernon. They loved Dudley but not you, while they raised you. It's not your they didn't love. It's the magic. See how muggle treat people with magic.

Your parents ? They were good people, that's true. Their heart was in the right place. I don't want to kill that many people. It never been the goal. But they threaten our safety. It's sad, and I really hate having to do it, but

Your scar ? Oh, but I didn't want to kill you. You were just a baby, and would have been raised by Sirius Black if he hadn't been caught. By someone who would want to protect us. That spell wasn't meant for you. But for Snape apparated away at the last minute. He wanted to kill you. It's him I wanted to kill, so you would be safe.

You know I'm right. You're a wizard that grew up among muggles who knew about magic, unlike muggle-borns. You saw for yourself how they are. Don't you want people to be safe? Don't you want to save the wizarding world, with me ?

But to do that, Harry, I need your help. Give me the stone, so I can continue to fight for our safety.

*** That could actually have worked, imagine if Riddle realised that Harry was a Horocrux aswell, him trying to sway Harry could actually work.

Voldemort probably needs to smack his followers in line though, young Harry could of easily been swayed, his relatives treatment could of turned him against all mugggles

**** I remember reading quite a while ago of that mostly happening, Voldemort had Harry in ropes in the final chamber in philosophers stone and legilemensed (unsure of spelling) him, learnt that Harry was a horcrux then kidnapped him and took him to this remote island. I ended up losing it at that point and can't remember the name but I'll attempt to find it again.
