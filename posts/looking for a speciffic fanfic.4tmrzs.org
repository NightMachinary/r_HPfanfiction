hey, i was looking for a fanfic that i read some time ago, but cannot remember the name of. believe it was a post order of the phoenix set one.

some things that i remember in it was that harry was taught legimancy by dumbledore and that he was taught to delve deep into the soul of who he was legimizing. and a big part of figuring out how to defeat volemort was by using this method, on Snape. this was a big poart of the story if nobody knows what it is i can provide more stuff but dont want to get too spoilery


** Does Harry march out from the castle's defences to legilimens Voldemort?

** bit more info hope there is no issues with spoilers, light on spoiler stuff is early on

harry eventually develops a rather good friendship with snape, to the point where harry is about do die and snape does a verry risky procedure to try and save harry's life.

another thing is final battle between harry and voldie is actually done thru legimancy

oh one of the main issues is all of the marked Death eaters of voldemort need to die before voldemort can be killed. so this is an issue with harry as he is friends with snape
