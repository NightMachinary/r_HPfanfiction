Title. Fics in which Voldemort has an end-goal, perhaps even a positive one, which he believes justifies his actions.

Edit: Preferably with a good, wise, canon-like Dumbledore.


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has this. You see, he's really doing all this to... oh wait, that would be spoilers, wouldn't it?

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

***** yeah, i've read loads where voldi is doing stuff like liberating magic from the muggle lovers who hide all the good books and make children rubbish at magic... etc. they often come with good run on sentences like that. but others where he does evil magic but is still with the order, like a mini snape.

** So, if you don't mind Voldemort having had sanity problems, Again and Again by Athey is pretty good. Even when he gets his sanity back, he's still dark. Dumbledore has good intentions, but lacks certain information that his opponents have, which limits how wise he can appear.

It is Harry/Voldemort, but it makes sense in context.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
