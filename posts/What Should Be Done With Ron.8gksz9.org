I'll be upfront and say I wasn't much a fan of Ron in canon. But mostly, I was disappointed that he lost any significant purpose after - at the latest - Chamber of Secrets. Hermione just ended up taking the role of knowing most things about the Wizarding world, and Ron was just kinda left as the funny one, disappointingly.

So my story is outlined pretty well, but since Draco, Hermione and Neville are also Harry's friends (quick note: Malfoys aren't bigoted pricks in this AU), I've been left wondering how I should write Ron in the story. I don't want him non-existent, but with Draco eventually set to become the more politically active one as he gets older, Harry with his own goals (no desire for being an Auror here), and the others playing their canon roles, what ought I do with Ron?

Maybe make him some kind of strategist, but how should I go about this? Would he be really good at duelling maybe, having memorized useful spell combinations and sequences in advance? All we got in canon was him being good at chess, but hell I'll take what I can get.


** If you don't want Ron to take an active role in the story, he can become a window to Harry's character.

Ron is the only character that groks Harry at a fundamental level. Harry isn't the type of guy who lets his guard down around most people, but he does around Ron. There's no posturing or posing, just two people who get each other and want to revel in that.

When Harry is at his lowest or his most confused, a conversation with Ron is what will re-center him. (Or if they are both still 14 and immature, a conversation with Ron will at least reset him.)

** I don't know your fic, but I would probably leave him out of it if you don't know what to do with him.

For the canon universe I have a very basic recipe to fix Ron, but it requires a major diversion from year 5 onwards. IMHO it was a big mistake to give Ron another huge fuck up so late in the game in DH and also having him remain so oblivious about Hermione through most of HBP. IMHO Ron's development should have mirrored James Potter's. His second big fuck up after the tournament should have been much earlier, possibly somewhere in OotP. After this wake-up call he decides to get his act together and try to achieve his dreams (like James when he rescued Snape from Lupin).

This, a little more mature and sensitive, Ron (who hasn't lost his sense of humor, but for example takes his prefect duties more seriously) would then have realized how terrible his dalliance with Lavender was for Hermione and handle that differently. During HBP he would then have truly grown into the role of the moral center, the heart, of the trio, by believing in Harry but stopping him from his worst bouts of rage and paranoia (the Sectumsempra scene would be perfect for this) and by growing closer to Hermione and making her see Harry's side of things better.

In DH it would then be Hermione who runs away (lets face it, she's way too perfect), though for different reasons: She feels they are not accomplishing enough, is scared about losing and she decides to do something dangerous to gain information or something. She realizes her mistake and when they later reunite it is now Ron who can relate to her, because he knows what it is like to regret and be hot-headed. This gives rise to a truly mutual bond of understanding and trust between them.

I absolutely don't think the role of "strategist" is right for him and I think most people are giving the whole chess thing way too much weight. Again, his role should be that of the heart (see Xander in Buffy on how it is done correctly... he's quite mediocre but still an amazing asset and a great friend).

**** Oh, thanks, but it's not a very original idea. I'm known as the Ron hater around here, but I think I have a good understanding of what he's supposed to be, I just find him to be poorly realized (other people are able to project his arch-type on his scenes and therefore don't see him as such). Although my idealized version of Ron would just be a red-headed Xander Harris and I doubt that would be very good.

*** I would have loved to see a window into dark!Hermione if she had been the one to wear the locket for longer and end up leaving the group. Though if I was writing it, I'd probably instead touch on some of the audience's thoughts about her by having her think she's actually the most important of the three of them and she can do it all by herself from here on out, they're holding her back; a resurgence of who she was in the first book before they became friends, the locket playing on who she used to be.

Then of course she would come back to herself once it was destroyed having learned a lot about herself, and with that mini exploration showing readers that even though it seems Hermione is the only competent one or the most competent, Hermione going out on her own to do everything is not a recipe for success.

I'd love to have her solo endeavours end not because she gets captured or anything either (avoiding damsel in distress trope), but because she gets so ruthless that she scares herself and is able to break the hold on her. Shades of her ruthlessness like how she deals with Umbridge and Skeeter would be great to be more fully explored.

  She acts very jealous and petty towards both Harry in Ron in HBP for different reasons.
#+end_quote

HBP is clearly Hermione at her worst, but she just got gravely injured in the previous year and fell in love with Ron who's being an insensitive prat. She's not operating at peak performance.

#+begin_quote
  She's argumentative to the extreme, and picks a fight with a lot of characters.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Isn't she awesome? I love that about her.

#+begin_quote
  She doesn't admit it when she's wrong.
#+end_quote

She does. She doesn't admit that she's wrong when she's right or when she hasn't been proven wrong yet, just to appease her friends, which is good.

#+begin_quote
  She nags.
#+end_quote

Nagging can be annoying, but it shows that she cares. Much better than indifference.

#+begin_quote
  She pushes relentlessly.
#+end_quote

Good. People who just roll over and accept defeat are sad and boring.

#+begin_quote
  She's a terrible listener and instead just tells Harry what to do without regard for his feelings.
#+end_quote

Oh noez, she honestly tells people what she thinks and doesn't coddle them. How terrible. People who don't tell me the truth or what they believe because they are worried about my feelings are terrible friends.

#+begin_quote
  So close minded that she won't just dismiss people's ideas, but them as people.
#+end_quote

Not sure what you're talking about here. She's pretty open minded considering she got the idea for the DA coins from Voldemort's Dark Mark.

#+begin_quote
  As for calling her out on her bullshit, I'm talking about things like how she treated Ron with the Scabbers thing
#+end_quote

Ron was much more in the wrong for accusing her being responsible for the disappearance of his rat. Even if Crookshanks had eaten the stupid rat it wouldn't have been Hermione's fault, not to mention that Crookshanks would have done everyone a favor. Crookshanks is a good cat and Hermione is in the right not to listen to Ron's silly complaints.

#+begin_quote
  he has now grown a lot as a person
#+end_quote

Harry is a giant fuck up and it only gets better in the final book (but maybe you mean that). He wanted to ride on a broom that was sent to him by the betrayer of his parents and a mass murderer. He would have been completely lost during the tournament and had no idea what to do. He forgot about the communication mirror and got his Godfather killed by not thinking things through (Hermione went along with him even though she knew it was a trap). In HBP she probably should have given Harry the benefit of the doubt in regards to Draco, but it's good that she has her own opinion about it. Harry is acting quite irrationally from an outside perspective and the whole Sectumsempra incident could have been avoided if he made a more rational effort to convince Hermione (instead of just going "I know I'm right"). But JKR gave both Harry and Hermione the idiot ball in that book in order to drive a wedge between them and create drama.

What about the Horcrux at Hogwarts? They are having an adult discussion about it and both Ron and Hermione think it wouldn't be at Hogwarts. They make good arguments and Harry basically has a hunch (his track record in this regard has been pretty hit and miss). Are you mad at her for not being a seer? In any case their whole Horcrux Hunt would have been a total non-starter without Hermione's support and encouragement.

You sound like a person who only wants to surround themselves with "yes-men" who agree with you on everything. Hermione is Harry's most loyal friend and almost irrational in her devotion to him (she memory charms her own parents and sends them to Australia for him). Yet, you'd want to dismiss her because she nags too much or is too argumentative about her opinions?

You and I clearly have very different ideas of what true friendship entails: If I were to start slipping into alcoholism I'd expect my friends to get mad, nag me, yell at me and slap me silly. Your ideal friends would just applaud, tell you how awesome and precious you are in order to not hurt your feelings and ultimately be spectators in your demise.

******* While I agree that Hermione was right about the broom, I think that she went about Scabbers death in the worst possible way. This is because as far as everyone knew at the time, Ron's beloved family pet had just been killed by Hermione's cat. All of the evidence pointed towards Crookshanks being the culprit (blood on the sheets) and she refuses to apologize. Also Ron repeatedly asked Hermione to keep Crookshanks away from Scabbers and she didn't at any point even try. The fact that Scabbers turned out to be Peter Pettigrew is entirely irrelevant within the context of Ron and Hermione's argument.

******** I might be wrong, but wasn't that during the whole Broom debacle? I wouldn't have given Ron the time of day either.

And I mean, Crookshanks is a cat (part kneazle, but whatever). If you're worried about your rat keep it in a cage or on your person. That's no problem for a rat. Keeping a cat in a cage or something like that is just cruel.

********** Not really. You're currently just complaining and whining about perceived personal attacks. If you're truly this offended I'm happy to apologize... though you are currently not doing a lot to convince me that I was wrong.

99.99% of my post was about the characters, but you're ignoring all of that just to feel offended about a single snarky comment on how your opinions on Hermione make you look (I even qualified that this makes you sound like x, not that you are x). The irony of throwing such a hissy fit over this instead of laughing about it, telling me that I'm wrong or addressing my arguments, still seems lost on you.

Can i assume then that bad/annoying behaviour is excusable if "not operating at peak performance" ?

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. Isn't she awesome? I love that about her.

  #+begin_quote
    implying being aggressive/hostile to other characters for petty reasons is not a flaw
  #+end_quote

  She does. She doesn't admit that she's wrong when she's right or when she hasn't been proven wrong yet, just to appease her friends, which is good.
#+end_quote

She doesn't even consider being wrong and just admits being so when she doesn't find any evidence of her not being so. While understandable from a point of view, it leads to her always assuming she is the right, leading to "always the tone of surprise, heh?"

#+begin_quote
  Nagging can be annoying, but it shows that she cares. Much better than indifference.
#+end_quote

It is worrying if one would rather been shown affection throught nagging than any other method. Having a good reason to doing an annoying/bad thing, while understandable, is no excuse (and as one says, /Hell is full of good reasons/)

#+begin_quote
  Good. People who just roll over and accept defeat are sad and boring.
#+end_quote

Yeah right, because reading about a character fighting a losing battle perceively out of spite (because there is no other reason for Hermione, as intelligent as she is even at 14/15, to counting fighting for House-elves while still in Hogwarts, to continue and try to liberate the Hogwarts house elves) is so entertaining and /fun/.

#+begin_quote
  Oh noez, she honestly tells people what she thinks and doesn't coddle them. How terrible. People who don't tell me the truth or what they believe because they are worried about my feelings are terrible friends.
#+end_quote

Hermione comes throught as worrying more about being right about what character B should do as oppose to, say, worrying about whatever bad thing is going to happen to B in case he doesn't. And before you twist what I said, i'm not talking about Triwirzard Championship and the like, i'm talking about day-to-day stuff.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Does the name /Looney Lovegood/ ring a bell? Dismissing something as impossible even thought she was a muggle? Hermione is close-minded in the sense that she cares about authority, as in "I believe what you are saying is impossible based on my knowledge acquired throught reading on authority asserted knowledge"

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If I recall correctly, Hermione is shown not listening to Ron based on how rude and a prat he is being, not the validity of his complaints. And as Sirius said, Crookshanks /was/ in fact out to get the rat, him being Pettigrew not withstanding

Hermione shouldn't be put in a pedestal as people tend to do. She is an incredibly intelligent, loyal and interesting character on her own right, without people ideolizing her. She has her flaws as every other character, but It seems because she is an exceptional witch she has lenience.

And since you guys touched on assumptions: from what i've seen on this sub , It's no surprise you should be adamant in protecting her, as you seem to share a lot of similarities

** If you're good at chess, you probably have a high IQ and have a very good memory, memorizing complex sequences of spells (For battle) actually wouldn't be that bad an idea. If your fic has a lot of action this isn't that bad, if it doesn't you're just going to have to motivate the lazy git somehow. (He's lazy, not an idiot.)

Even though Malfoy's aren't bigots in this AU do they still have a sort of rivalry with the Weasley's or not? (If so this could push Ron into wanting to compete with Draco in some manner.)

It is tough though, I don't really know how AU your world is compared to the canon. Ultimately you should know what's best. I like Ron but literally leaving him out might be better than shoehorning him into the story. (Especially if you have a clear outline.)

You may be right about not shoehorning him in. I had this issue with Dudley where I nearly ended up writing him as a Muggleborn, but then I realized I had no real idea why I was trying to do so. I'll give it some thought, thanks!

***** I wasn't the one who made the comment about chess and IQ. Some well known experiments verify that chess is more about memorization (this should be especially clear given how A.I. can beat even the best chess players because they can memorize every damn move and consequence of them so you're fucked). However, Dumbledore seems to make clear at the end of Book 1 that Ron's skill at chess was already considerable ("the best played chess match Hogwarts has seen in a long time"). Really doubt Ron was the only one to be into chess in for decades.

That's a good suggestion about Quidditch, one I was already planning to do since Harry won't be on the team. :) But the good friend idea has a lot of merit, a couple others gave a similar suggestion. I think I'll go with that, thanks!
