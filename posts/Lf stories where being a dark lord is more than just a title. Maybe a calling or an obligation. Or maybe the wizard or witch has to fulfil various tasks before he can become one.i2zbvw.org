** Well, the task one fulfills before being called a Dark Lord is amassing large amounts of followers, creating an organization, becoming super powerful with a reputation that makes the average person stutter when saying the Dark Lord's name... that is all what Voldy already managed to achieve.

You don't get the title Dark Lord just because you are a sadistic psycho that practice the Dark Arts to an extreme level.

Take Grindelwald, for example. He started WW2 by manipulating Hitler and Nazi Germany (to make the magicals see the threat muggles pose to the world), all the while he conducted his own war in the wizarding world. He isn't a single person, but the Lord of an entire organization.

So far, each of the Dark Lords we have seen in action didn't get their titles for free, but because of merit. They fulfilled multiple criteria that made the government declare them as such.

*** You're right except for one point; no one, not even Grindelwald, referred to him as a 'Dark Lord' ever. That's only found in fanfiction and he's only referred to as a dark wizard, but never a 'Lord'. In modern times in Europe, only Tom Riddle had the ego of (I) giving himself an unearned nom de guerre and (II) styling himself as lord of anything whatsoever.

** In linkffn(Princeps by Lomonaaeren) a lord (dark, light or in between) has to fulfill certain criteria.

- Demonstrate a high level of magic in front of at least 100 people
- brand followers as followers
- Choose a magical affinity

  Gen, AU. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. Surely nothing can go too wrong.

** In "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" linkao3(11800899) the Dark Lord/Lady title is granted by a demonic patron. It doesn't play a huge role in the story though.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.
