This will be where I post a link to a story that I liked so that I am able to better find them again or can easily give a recommendation to my friends. Everyone is welcome to find their next read here. If you want to recommend a similar story to those I post here you are welcome to do so but I would appreciate it if you wouldn't use the fanfiction it so I can clearly see which ones were the stories I already read and liked. Thank you for any recommendations that come and enjoy reading the stories that I post

  It took one look for Hermione to know the truth. Harry wasn't ready to become an auror. He would do so because people expected it of him; he would do so because he expected it of himself, but it wasn't what he needed right now. With that in mind, she gave him an excuse, a reason not to go down that path just yet. More importantly, she promised herself to continue doing so until he was finally ready.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Things worked out just as Dumbledore planned... then magic decided to make a few adjustments. For Harry, it was more than a bit of a shock to go from a battered 150 yr old body to his newly adult status 14 yr old body. He hadn't even had a chance to finish his morning tea! But then with his luck it wasn't all that much of a surprise. Finding out that he had a chance to do it right this time was something he planned to take full advantage of. Hopefully, he wouldn't have to kill ol' Tommy boy again but he wasn't counting on that.
