Spoilers, obviously.

I'm looking for a particular time travel fic. IIRC it was a oneshot. Can't remember if time travel just happens or Harry makes it happen, but he wakes up I think before starting Hogwarts and decides to save everyone he didn't the first time. He dies early. This repeats a few times and Harry is frustrated that he's not getting very far and has to relive years with every attempt.

At some point I think he just repeats his original actions and gets to live a happy ever after, but then dies of old age and wakes up at the beginning of the loop again. So he tries new things, like becoming a Dark wizard and getting executed and a bunch of other crazy stuff. I've been trying to find it for days, but no luck. I think the ending made a point about immortality not being so cool or something to that effect.

** I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again]] is what you're looking for. Has much of the stuff you mentioned. Around 200k words I think. Also has H/TMR just to let you know.
