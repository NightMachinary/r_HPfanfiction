The whole Tom Riddle cursed the DADA post thing is kinda dumb . How do you curse a teaching position ?\\
It isn't a physical thing .... it isn't a classroom or a seat at some table and we see how different each teacher is with their style and the material they teach so it clearly isn't about what is taught. Which leaves the title so just change the title of the professor and the name of the class I don't see why this wouldn't work. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk !


** ...magic.

Really magic around vague concepts is a canon thing. The fidelius charm protects a 'secret.' There is a room in the DOM that is always locked that has some connection to love. Umbridge couldn't get into Dumbledore's office because somehow the school itself refused to recognise her as Headmistress. How is a school meant to know about titles lets alone be sentient? Magic lets you just shrug it off and explains why logic isn't that valued. Makes sense from your perspective never accounts for the possibilities of magic.

*** I don't think it's right to say there's no logic to it. In the real world, we are used to thinking of things in a physicalist, reductionist way, but that is not a requirement of logic. It's simply a result of the physical arrangement of the universe as described by modern science and accepted by most of the educated population.

Wizards are perfectly logical within the world they operate in, and the magic system makes internal sense. It's not some random, shrug your shoulders and say "it's magic!" system where anything goes. It's rules based, and well-understood by wizards, who spend years studying magical theory in detail in order to be able to use magic (most of what is studied at Hogwarts is magical theory, from what we see).

So yes, magic largely operates at a conceptual rather than physical level. Protection spells are often placed on an address rather than a physical border. Job positions can be cursed. Secrets have their own existence. Linguistic items can be the subject of spells like the Taboo. "Food" forms part of the rules of transfiguration.

But none of these things mean that magic is illogical. It's just not physicalist or reductionist.

And in case it isn't clear, when I say magic isn't reductionist I mean this:

In the real world, what is a "secret"? Well, a secret would be a sub-class of information defined with reference to its social status. The precise definition of what social status renders something a secret would be a matter of opinion or arbitrary definition. Once you have defined it, the next level of analysis is to say that this sub-category of information is, in turn, something that exists within people's minds. The mind is in turn the brain, and information is essentially composed of electrical signals in the brain.

So what is a secret in real life? It is an arrangement of electrical signals across the brains of a number of different individuals which fits the arbitrary, stipulated definition of what a secret is. The concept of a secret is not its own thing; it is a social invention which reduces down (as everything does) to a physical arrangement of atoms.

What is a secret in the magical world? It is its own thing which has magical reality. Magic itself distinguishes between secrets and non-secrets; it's not something that is subject to the arbitrary definition of human opinion, but rather an objective fact about the world - a "natural kind". Those magically real items which magic classifies as secrets can be interacted with and magic can be cast upon them, including the ability to relocate them from one soul to another.

This non-reductionist way of viewing the world is fundamentally incompatible with the physicalist description of the universe. But it makes perfect /sense/. It's just not how the world works in real life.

**** That's fair. When I said shrug though, I didn't mean that there was no internal logic, more it could be understood but it would take more effort that a person might be willing to put forwards. Nuclear power and magnets are both something people can understand but how do they actually work is something it is easier to shrug and call witchcraft. I know they work, I have an understanding of how but not in detail.

******* Yes. The canon/pottermore descriptions of both arithmancy and runes are kind of pointless. Also beg the question of why Arithmancy would be Hermione's favorite class, when it's basically just a system of divination.

******** Hermione doesn't dislike divination because it predicts the future, she dislikes it because it does so by guessing and is very unreliable.

If arithmancy has a comprehensive way to predict the future which delivers reliable results it's easy to see why she'd prefer it over divination.

** We see magic showing a not-insubstantial amount of intelligence at times, so the curse could "remember" Riddle's intent and target any staff member teaching defensive magic. Alternatively, my headcanon is that the curse is anchored to (and possibly powered in part by) the Diadem Horcrux - an actual piece of Riddle's soul should be more than capable of directing the targeting of the curse.

** Actually, that abstract, conceptual kind of curse has plenty of historical precedent. It's easy to forget with how Harry Potter magic tends to be direct and visible, shooting lasers at each other, but the Defence jinx is not so different from eg cursing Sleeping Beauty to prick her finger /sixteen years later/, or cursing the line of Stanley Yelnats with bad luck.

*** Yes but those are curses that target the person or their decendant ( aka DNA and physical body) my point is that the job isn't a physical thing . I'm just saying that this shows how the wizarding population just accepts that it's a curse that no one can break, or that the post isn't cursed. Finding a new teacher every year sounds like a pain in the ass.

*** There are some things in canon that perpetuate the non-Potterverse convention that a person's spells end when they die.

- If a Secret Keeper dies, then everybody who knows the secret becomes a Secret Keeper. This arguably is the magic of the Fidelius itself, as canon is unclear whether the Secret Keeper is the one actually casting the spell.
- The gift Lily transfigured for Slughorn reverting when she died. This is a clear-cut case of a spell ending when the caster died.
- The Dark Mark fading but not going away when Voldie was a wraith, and getting darker as he regained his strength. Canon is silent as to whether they disappeared with his final death. It also is unclear whether the protean charm is an integral part of it, or whether it was a (magical) tattoo with the charm applied afterward.

There are also things in canon that completely disregard this, such as the enchantments on the Sorting Hat and all architectural and repairing spells. We've seen that the magical world has various categories of spells --- they differentiate between charms, jinxes, hexes, and curses. I can see a faux-scholarly article on what classes of spells can survive the caster's death and which require some sort of "attention" from the caster's magic to remain.

Cuses in particular are seen in the non-Potter world as things that can linger, unless you consider mummies to be undead. The best non-stupid (in my opinion) way to have a lingering curse is to have a cursed object placed in the school. We know that the curse dates from Tom being denied the DADA teaching position, posited as the time when he did Ravenclaw's diadem in the RoR. He could easily have placed more than one object in the school at the time. Treatments I have enjoyed in fanfiction include:

- The curse is imbued in Tom's award for Special Services to the school. (And why is this in the trophy case? That kind of individual award plaque usually goes home with the student. It's not like the quidditch trophies that have separate brass plates for each year.) [1]
- When he saw the way the interview was going, Tom surreptitiously placed the curse on one of the trinkets on Dumbledore's desk --- in this case, a paperweight in the shape of Hogwarts itself, symbolically "stealing" Hogwarts from Dumbledore. [2]
- Tiny runes carved into the threshold of the DADA classroom, discovered when a rune-fluent Harry accidentally trips in the doorway. [3]

I think the reason the curse is only a rumor in canon is that people don't want to be seen as crackpot conspiracy theorists. The "proof" is anecdotal at best, and as far as we know Dumbledore has never invited curse-breakers to search for one, even though he is a close family friend with a reputable curse breaker.
