** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is a crossover with Dungeons and Dragons (specifically 3.5e). Knowing something about tabletop RPGs helps, but isn't necessary, to enjoy it - a lot of the humour is universal, although some makes more sense if you know the terminology. It feels a bit like Seventh Horcrux at times, although it's older. I'd never played any WotC D&D before reading it, and enjoyed it immensely.

A few choice quotes that sell the story even without any context:

#+begin_quote
  The first years all filed into the Great Hall apprehensively as McGonagall explained about the four houses. Milo mentally filed them into: house for the PCs, house for the villains, and two NPC houses to make up the numbers. Fair enough.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "What's Quidditch?" Harry, Hermione, and Milo asked simultaneously. Ron fainted into his pudding. Once he came around, he described the rules. It was some unbelievably dangerous-sounding sport (two of the players' jobs were to send heavy leather balls flying at the opposing team!) played on broomstick. As Ron explained about the Golden Snitch, Milo considered it thoughtfully. From what he could tell, the Seeker's success or failure completely invalidated everything that the other players did. It was as if the sport was set up entirely to give Seekers a backdrop to compete against.

  "I like it!" Milo said. "It has everything. Magic, danger, and rules blatantly skewed for the PCs to shine. Harry, make sure to write this down." The Boy-Who-Lived dutifully added it to his growing list of plot-relevant items.
#+end_quote

It's also over 300k words long so far, and has completed the first two years of canon and started the third - at first, it's a little bit rehashy, but the second year is very original.

linkffn(End of the Line by Shewhoguards) is a series of related one-shots set in a train station. It's also quite sad. There's a minor crossover with some of the Diskworld books, but it isn't necessary to enjoy the story. Any more info could spoil it.

linkffn(The Serpent and the Crown by The Green Pumpkin; Wit of the Raven by japanese-jew) are both interesting AUs that are sadly both abandoned. What's there, however, is both original and of high quality.

  Shortly after Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard, he finds himself thrust into a world full of medieval fantasy, complete with kings and castles, knights and dragons, and everything else he never expected. An AU Harry Potter story.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** linkffn(A Little More Time) was my very first fanfiction. It focuses on Remus/Tonks, which is a relatively uncommon pairing in HPFF. The plot is that Teddy would like to save his parents and so he tries to bring them forward with time. Its internal logic is incredibly inconsistent and i cannot remember any glaring plot holes or other details that pushed my suspension of disbelief. In fact, it uses and enhances canon, which was what i looked for in my fanfiction at first. Read this if you like to explore the implications of characters stuck out of time, especially mothers who last saw their kid as a baby

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** I enjoyed linkffn(Out of the Dark and Into the Green). It uses a well known trope - Harry running away from the Dursleys - but makes it something unique. I love how we get to see Harry becoming his own person, instead of just being told he has x trait because y happened to him. Btw, if any of you know similar stories, I'd be interested!
