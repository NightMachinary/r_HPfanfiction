** The twins looked up as the kitchen door slammed open. Tonks almost ran into them in her haste to leave the meeting. The look of annoyance on her face was obvious.

"Leaving so soon?" asked George.

"Dumbledore hasn't even arrived yet," observed Fred.

"I know," Tonks said. "And until he does show up, everyone's arguing back and forth about what to do."

The twins looked at each other. "So what's the problem, then?" Fred asked.

Tonks shuddered, in spite of herself. "Bercow cast a sonorus."

Again, the twins shared a glance. "Oh, shit." replied George.

Before Tonks could say more, they heard the rumbling noise from the kitchen, where the adults were meeting.

"ORDER!"
