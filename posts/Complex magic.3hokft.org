I'm looking for really complex magic systems! Stories where harry manipulates the shit out of the rules <3 HPMOR and Wizard of the Kaleidoscope are good examples. Both have an OP harry, but I'll take stories that aren't that way!


** It's not Harry doing most of the rules abuse, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley) is full of this.

**** It's not massively graphic, but yeah if slash isn't your thing it's a skip.

  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

** I liked Kaleidoscope at first, but holy shit did it go downhill. Harry was overpowered as hell the whole time, but on top of that there's like a dozen train wrecks going on. I'd say it got unbearable just after that tournament and I only finished it because I was so far in. It starts to jam in Nasuverse magic which isn't horrible, but just derails so damn badly. And seriously whatever happened to Daphne and Hermoine was just weird.
