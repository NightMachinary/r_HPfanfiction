So I know it's really cliche when people write these elaborate shopping montages in time travel fics or canon divergence fics, but I have a big urge to read some of these montages. Basically, I'm looking for a chapter or two on Harry shopping that includes him buying more than he has to, or buying things that aren't on the shopping list. Like him taking a slip down Knockturn for some illegal books or something.

I know that [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144601][Grounding Magic]] has a really good shopping montage in it, and so does [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19793110/chapters/46860157][Burning Red]].

Thanks!

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
