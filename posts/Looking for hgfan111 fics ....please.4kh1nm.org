Hey, I've seen these posts before but they are a bit old. But here it goes...I'm looking for firs by hgfan111. I've been sick and home a lot and would love to have these to read. They were the best. Thanks so much in advance if anyone can send em to me.

**** Well, I was able to find [[http://ultimatehpfanfiction.com/ginny/bts/a/0/Brighter+Than+Sunshine/hgfan1111%20/21][Brighter than Sunshine]]

And I lied, I wasn't thinking of hpfanfictionarchive.com, I meant fictionhunt. I get the two backwards all the time. I have no idea how to actually search that site, but I know there are some there, such as [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4292813/1][Learning to Fly]]. I also have a PDF copy of Easier to Be. If you want it, pm me an email address.

EDIT: Searched through my internet history, here's a link for [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4937753/1][Away from the Sun]].
