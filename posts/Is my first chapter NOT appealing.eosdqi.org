I noticed from the stats for my fanfiction on FFN that a lot of readers didn't follow reading after the first chapter. At least half of them stopped, and I can't figure out why. I don't think it's terrible, it's pretty decent I think.

It's my first long fanfiction and the first one I write in English, I'm kind of worried there's something wrong in the first chapter or maybe it's not appealing enough for the readers to continue reading. I've had it beta-ed so I don't think it lacks in grammar or syntax.

Maybe I should re-write it or something? Can I have some opinions? Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13366996/1/A-Time-For-Wolves][A Time For Wolves]]


** Have you posted this before? I could swear I've read the first chapter before, maybe I just stumbled onto it.

I want to make clear that from this point on I am being very centred on me and I do not in anyway claim to be representative of the average reader on FFN. I am going to speak purely from my point of view with all my own biases.

I'm going to say something now and you're probably not going to like it, but you did ask. I think it's a boring premise. I like alternate reality stuff but I really don't care at all about your characters and have no wish to learn. As I am not going into the fic expecting much you have to start strong to win me over from my scepticism and for me you fail to do so.

As a matter of preference I prefer stories with older characters, post Hogwarts is what I read mostly and for a cross over I'll only read it if adult Harry travels to a new place. I feel like Hogwarts has been done and I feel going younger than Hogwarts is just irritating. Your first chapter describes them as teenagers but the dialogue and actions make me think its on the extreme low end of that. The summary makes me think they're meant to be 14. People here often rant about children sounding like adults, but to an extent, children sounding like children doing things children do isn't interesting.

Another very personal matter of taste is I dislike the premise that Remus and Sirius have children the same age as Harry. Harry's parents were so young when they had him, really young. Maybe, just maybe it's the norm in the wizarding world but to me, being in my mid-twenties, it's bonkers that three out of three of them had children so young, I can say Lily and James really did love each other, the pressure of the war led to Harry, in a world with magic and a locked room for love in the Department of Mysteries I can believe in true love or something for their sake, especially when talking about a world with prophecies, destiny and fate being real, tangible things. Like I said, its very much a personal thing but to me it feels very constructed, as in, you have created this situation, these characters because you wanted this situation. Obviously as a writer you construct characters for a reason. I would go so far as to say a character without a reason is bad writing. That being said, I don't think the situation feels natural. I don't feel like this universe existed, events led to this and this is simply the moment we the reader joined their journey, it feels artificial to me. Remus and Sirius happened to have children at the same point Lily and James did, in the middle of a war they are actively fighting in, just because. I know too much about Harry Potter and so this feels immersion breaking. When I read that Harry is still with the Dursley's despite everything else I can't help but think that this whole thing feels like a set up. I understand the safety precautions that they provide but I struggle to believe Sirius wouldn't have done more for Harry.

In my opinion you haven't done enough in this chapter to convince me to read on because I don't recognise anything I see. What I do see I question but not in the hooked way but in the 'oh really?' way. Perhaps if you had a prelude like the HP books did with their Vernon/Dumbledore/Baby Harry chapter then I could understand what is going on. As it is, I am thrown in the deep end but given no motivation to swim.

Your opening section does little but confuse me. It's on the wrong side of the mysterious and intriguing vs confusing line.

#+begin_quote
  /Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say they were perfectly normal.../ Why would someone take pride in being normal?. *The building was on fire and it wasn't my fault." * from Dresden files. Why is the building on fire and why would it be his fault?
#+end_quote

To this day one of my absolute favourite opening sections is

#+begin_quote
  /In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort./
#+end_quote

Each one of these gives me a piece of information but its just a piece of a larger puzzle. I feel however as if it's the corner of a jigsaw, a great place to start. In contrast, your opening section makes me feel like I'm holding a piece of a jigsaw in a room where everything around me is made of lego. I don't ask what is happening, I ask why is it there and the moment I'm questioning the structure I'm not immersed.

In conclusion your premise doesn't interest me, your characters don't interest me and I read the whole chapter feeling slightly confused.

*** I respect that it's not something you would probably read normally as you made it clear it's not in your taste. That is fine, but whoever read the first chapter must have been a fan of the tropes I have used. I also respect your criticism, it's your taste and all,but I think maybe you were a bit too biased because you didn't like the premise. What I was trying to do was making the reader interested in this sort of scenario, explaining every detail in the first chapter felt odd and rushed in my opinion. As for the characters I think it's too early to really judge them as not interesting , don't you think? At least I think so. If they sound like teenagers it's because they are! So I guess I did a good job at that! I personally made them sound like children because I happen to like children being represented realistically! So I guess we have very different opinions. I don't think it's wrong or boring. Also they are supposed to be 15 and a year older than Harry. I know it sounds sort of too coincidental that Sirius and Remus both had a child in the same year, but I personally don't think it's too far fatched. After all in the HP world it seems the norm is to marry just after they graduate! Look at Jilly, and the Weasleys and the Malfoys. In this AU Sirius and Remus making different choices is pretty much all it's about. So that is way things are the way they are. Again I personally don't like explaining everything to the reader, I feel like they have to piece things together. And I'm doing it in the next chapters. I probably can't demand that everybody likes it, of course. Thank you for your honest opinion. Also can I ask what would make the characters interesting to you? Just a question.

**** For me, honestly, you're both right in your own ways.

But Irene, it's important to realise that people in this fandom have ridiculously specific standards. There are people about who'll stop reading if you write 'Said Harry' instead of 'Harry said' (or vice versa, I forget which way round the thread went). At the end of the day, you're not going to retain a lot of the people who click on your fic for reasons you'll agree with and reasons you'll disagree with.

I agree that it's not that far-fetched that a group of close friends would spawn at similar times - we do have examples in the canon world of that pattern being a thing, and there's a possibility of peer-pressure-esque feelings of the friends having their kids at the same time and such. It's a reasonable idea to start off an AU setting with, that Sirius and Remus would make different choices, yeah.

What I do agree with Hero Wraith on is that your hook isn't quite there. A good first chapter should make someone ask questions, but specific questions. Why is 'Thing A' like this? Why would 'Person B' do that? I'm not sure what you could do to make your fic have that more, but right now your first chapter isn't very... hooking. I think it might be the way you talk about Harry being at Privet Drive, that it's a secret that the adults share, but the kids suspect Harry isn't happy and bad things are happening. You're telling more than you're showing with that entire conversation, so it's like you're informing us that there's a secret, but not trying to get us to wonder what it is. Maybe more 'They're hiding something. Is it about Harry? He did seem sad when he was here last time. Maybe they made him do chores - I know I get real sad when that happens!' thoughts from the kid? The first chapter in any story is basically there to say 'keep reading! I know something you don't, but if you keep reading, I promise you'll find out!' so that people will keep going through the first act where all the different characters, themes, and plot points are introduced. Again, I'm not specifically sure how you'd fix that, I don't know your full plot or your characters so I can't give you any specific suggestions, but I think a rewrite of your first chapter to give more show and less tell on Harry being abused elsewhere instead of with his parents would probably boost your retention a lot. I think the jigsaw in a room of lego analogy is pretty good, you need to give us something we can fit into the lego of the room later. That, I think, would really help.

There's also that Harry being abused away from his living parents is a very, very irritating WBWL trope for most, so you'll probably lose a few who are like that.

Wow, that's quite...harsh?, I mean we're all writing fictions for a hobby.

I also thank you for being honest and not sugar-coating this. The problem with the hook probably stems from the fact that I'm not a writer whatsoever, so I don't really know how to do this. I'm not sure either what to change to make it more interesting and keep the reader going. As for the telling more than showing part, again I wrote it as it came to me, without much thought. I feel like it's a style choice, though, I don't think it's inherently a bad choice? I've read opposite opinions on what's the best approach, telling or showing, so I guess there's not a right answer? I'm not sure, honestly. I haven't researched much on the topic.

I thought I wasn't doing a bad job of introducing a situation and keeping a bit of mystery to intrigue the reader, but apparently I'm not lol Thanks for letting me know!

But I think maybe you misunderstood something, Harry's parents are not alive? And the abuse he suffers at the Dursleys is canon-compliant.

I'm an un-experienced writer so I don't know how to do this, unfortunately. I wish I did.

Would you like to help me a bit? I can explain the whole plot plan and you can give me some pointers? If you have the time, of course. No pressure.

****** Honestly, I agree with you. It is way too harsh. Both for that reason, and the fact that they're stopping themselves reading pretty decent stories with their standards. But it's understandable. This fandom has a million million stories and we simply can't read them all. You've got to be picky or you'll never read anything. It's one of the main reasons I haven't started writing for this fandom yet - I've been writing Life is Strange for about five years and am working on an idea for a HP fic, but I haven't written it yet.

Sure - I don't think sugar-coating really helps much in this kind of situation, so I really hope I haven't discouraged you from writing. No matter how new you are, everyone writing in every fandom and every published writer started exactly the same place you did. It's something you learn how to do from writing more and reading more, essentially. Probably the best piece of general advice I can give in that regard is simply to read and write as much as you can. You're not going to be as good as the best writers on your first fic, no matter how much you work at it. But you can at least be as bad as them! And it's only upwards from there. :)

I'd be happy to give you some more specific advice once I can find the time - work has been a bit pressing at the moment. For the moment, I'd recommend poking through this ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-resources-thread.38750/]]) and this ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-advice-thread.37586/]]) for any advice you think meets your perspective on things. The best way to show and not tell is to imply rather than directly state a thing. For example, 'Harry narrowed his eyes. "You're a bastard."' is show where "Harry got angry. "You're a bastard."' is tell. It's like you said before, you want to leave some things to a reader's imagination. That includes the narrative word-usage itself.

And you aren't doing a bad job of either of those things! You're just not framing it in the right way, I suppose. Even things done well can be done better.

I did misunderstand that, actually. I thought they were alive.

******* Thank you for the links, I'll check them out!

Don't worry about it, whenever you have time it's fine. And you didn't discourage me, I'm fine ahah I like writing as an hobby, but of course I'd love to get better at it, every criticism can only point out in what area I'm weak and work on that.

I know the difference between show and tell, but I don't think about when I write? So sometimes I use both. I really should do some reasearch on this and practice!

Thank you for your time, I'll contact you privately and give you some links to my google drive, so whenever you have a bit of time you can check it out.

******** Sure. It's in all our best interests here to help new writers - that way we get more interesting stories to read! I'm glad that I didn't discourage you. In that case, I'd recommend considering getting a Dark Lord Potter account and posting your fics for review and help there moreso than anything I might be able to help with. The group there are very good writers and they've been writing in the fandom for a decade in some instances. Some of them are even published, I believe. They'd be far better able to help in specific Harry Potter stuff than I. They're just also... not people that sugar-coat things. If you're doing something badly, they'll tell you up front, but they'll also tell you how to do better. Thick skin and stiff upper lip and you will prosper, though. I don't mind if you still want to contact me privately and I'll do whatever I can to help, but they'd likely help a lot. Up to you. :)

It's a fair point, not really actively thinking about that division when you write. I've kinda gotten into the habit of mixing the two up a little as I go, but I've found the most helpful thing to get better at that is editing. Once you've written your chapter and you're happy with the plot you've covered - the events and interactions you want to write have been written, I mean - then go back and work out better ways to phrase things yourself. Even if you or whoever else feels you're writing garbage, you can always edit your way up to genius. :)

#+begin_quote
  Also can I ask what would make the characters interesting to you?
#+end_quote

People don't read stories about normal people. They read stories about extraordinary people made to look normal, normal people are boring, but the protagonists still have to be relatable. The Harry Potter books for example aren't written about Ernie MacMillan and Justin Finchfletchly, they follow Harry Potter, the boy who stopped Voldemort, the only person to have ever survived the killing curse, Triwizard champion, leader of Dumbledore's army and so on. Visually he has a distinctive scar and green eyes. Later on he gets glasses but glasses with tape in the middle. He's easy to recognise.

When do we learn Harry is special? We learn it in the first chapter of the first book. McGonagall and Dumbledore's conversation explain to us why he is special, this works with JKR showing us all these hints about all the strange people celebrating (we are shown this). What Harry has done by the end of the first chapter has caused nationwide parties, parties we are /shown/ evidence of and given context in Dumbledore's conversation.

Harry isn't the only character who is special. We are introduced to Dumbledore, not just any wizard but the greatest wizard since Merlin. Not only is Dumbledore the greatest wizard since Merlin he's also wearing knee high boots, bright robes and has a beard that can be tucked into his belt. Nothing about him is normal. Dumbledore isn't forgettable, he's a shining beacon of something, from the moment you know him you know he's special. Then he's the headmaster of a school which makes him normal and relatable again.

Vernon and Petunia are basically caricatures, they're exaggerated to make them more interesting. People talk about the abuse Harry suffers but JKR chooses to push it to make it less normal. Haggrid isn't just tall he's part giant.

Ron doesn't just have a couple of siblings, he's from a huge family, they aren't just poor they're notoriously poor, visually he's bright ginger and lanky. Hermonie isn't just plain looking she has wild bushy hair and big front teeth, she isn't just good at school she's obnoxiously keen.

Your characters, the minimal details we get, seem normal, fully normal. Childish and maybe emotionally fragile just doesn't do it for me and likely most people. We also can't trust the HP characterisation of canon characters because this is an AU. We also know they have to be different people making different choices to get to this point. You don't take nearly long enough to set the scene, to describe them, to introduce them. If I had to guess I would say your first chapter is only 1.5K or so words it could do with a lot more.

I'm not going to check but if I had to guess there are about 800,000 HP fanfics. Each one free, each one takes some of my time to read. I have invested nothing other than my time and therefore the only thing I have to lose is my time. If I bought a book from a book store then I might push on through a bad start trying to get my money's worth from the book. Fanfiction doesn't have this. If you don't get the reader right away, there are 799,999 other stories to try, and I lose nothing for closing the story.

** This is a fairly uniform trend across the fandom. Fanfic readers have very specific preferences; unless your story hits the specific points a reader is looking for, they are likely to stop reading very quickly.

50% retention is actually pretty good.

Looking at your fic, if you wanted to change something to improve reader retention, the most obvious change would be in PoV character. I.e. don't tell the story from the PoV of a pair of OCs. The moment you write an OC protagonist, you're going to lose a LOT of readers.
