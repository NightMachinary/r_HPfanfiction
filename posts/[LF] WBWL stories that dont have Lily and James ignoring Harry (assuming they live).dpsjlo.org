Okay so basically WBWL stories that dont have Lily and James (assuming they survived) neglecting Harry because he isn't the boy who lived or some such as in linkffn(three black birds) where Harry is basically forgotten and hasn't had James and Lily remember his birthday for ten years in a row and it is also the fic where I got this idea from.

Pairing preferably Haphne, Harry/ Luna or Harry/Hermione

Over 80k words (or under but still updating)

Thats it, thank you


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) has a Harry who was sent to the Dursleys because he seemed to be a squib. ^{(Spoilers for year 2})There are a bunch of factors, some mundane and some magical, that at least partially impede the Potters from finding about the Dursleys' abuse. While Lily and James are both not necessarily good people, they are both marvelously interesting characters once Harry starts getting to know them, easily my favorite Lily and James in all WBWL-dom. (I feel similarly about this fic's WBWL. I enjoy every scene of his from year 2 onwards.)

No pairing yet.

Over 800k words and still updating.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** I'd argue that's understandable given how many moving parts there are. I'm on the author's discord, so I can attest that the writer is still writing at a pretty consistent pace, albeit slower than the frankly insane pace they started out the story at. It is still in third year, but we're almost at the climax, and there's planned to be about ten chapters left. (For third year, not the entire fic.)

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

Edit: I feel betrayed by the bot. The fic is: Saving Connor by Lightning on the wave.

It's an extremely long arc of 7 fics. If you're not one for slash, dw, neither am I! Yet I still enjoyed it.
