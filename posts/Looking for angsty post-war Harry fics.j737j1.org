I just read Glimpses of Battle by TheAlmightySun (so. good.) and am looking for anything even remotely similar. Basically looking for fics where Harry's having a hard time coping with the aftermath of the war, whether that's dealing with PTSD, substance use, etc.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
