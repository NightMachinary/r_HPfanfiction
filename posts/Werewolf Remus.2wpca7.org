I'm looking for stories that really delve into being a werewolf, what it's like to be a werewolf. Maybe something with how magic is different for them.


** I find this one while traveling and i have loved it so far. It's a Mauraders story, so young werewolf Lupin. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]]

*** I second this! It's exceedingly well written, and the author is either British or has done all their homework - the Britishisms are regionalistically correct as well, as far as I can tell. Correct use of quills, and things like that. Great plot and characterisation to boot.
