*** I love FloreatCastellum!

Another fanfics I like by FloreatCastellum is linkao3(19087660) - part of Wood for Trees with grown up James as an auror working his dad. The story is great in showing their father-son dynamic.

And linkao3(18769666) - a funny story of toddler Hugo writing a biography for his favorite uncle, Harry.

  James has been a qualified auror for over a year. His dad is getting better at letting him actually work cases now, but one particularly nasty dark wizard puts his whole world at risk.

  Hugo would like to show his favourite uncle the biography he made. He needs to sign it too, so that it's worth more.

** I'll probably get downvoted bc I already recommended it a thousand times, but check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dun-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

Over 500k words and completed. Slash. linkao3(4267422)

** Stygian trilogy linkffn(ignite) and linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) are probably the best overall.

If you want a general picture of big next-gen series, there are basically 4 massive ones I'd consider worth reading: Stygian (covers years 5-7), Vekin87's Albus Potter series, NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series, and G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series.

The last three IMO are all fairly standard thriller fanfic stuff, all really well plotted and executed, although nothing particularly out-of-this-world except for some moments of NoahPhantom's series. They're all worth your time reading though, and since all of them are over a million words they will literally take up a lot of your time.

While many of the characters kind of have the same types of personalities throughout those three fics, the Stygian trilogy takes a somewhat different approach. For example, Albus looks nothing like Harry, Rose has to take a backseat to two people (imagine!) as the smartest in her year, Scorpius never has a rebellious phase at Hogwarts, etc. The OCs in this fic are also really individualistic and fleshed out, my favorite being a character whose role increases mightily during the second and third books of the series. This series is more romance-centric than the other three, which I usually avoid but didn't mind here as most of it was pretty well done.

HHD is by Inverarity, who's better known as the author of Alexandra Quick. It's not as good as those books, but it's a fine story about Cedric Diggory's first year at Hogwarts that doesn't try to do too much, and of course is immaculately written.

I haven't read the even more monstrous Grey series or finished Colin Creevey's or gryffin_duck's next-gen sagas, but I've seen them recommended. There's also linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) which is a slice of life fic (not really my cup of tea) but it's really well-written. linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) and linkffn(The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins) are two severely underappreciated fics worth mentioning.

None of these are Cursed-Child compliant, so that should fit your bill. I don't read slash fics but I'm sure there are some good ones out there as well, if anyone else wants to chime in.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).
