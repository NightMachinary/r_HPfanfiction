I'm looking for any crossover fics that feature Harry as a person from that franchise. Like Harry is Itachi or Harry is Ruby Rose. Wbwl and fem Harry fics welcomed. Fics where the wizards travel to the world harry is in are welcomed too.


** Linkffn(Ruby Potter) Harry is Ruby, was sent to Remnant as a baby and pulled to Hogwarts with her team by the Goblet of Fire.

  Ruby Rose lived to be a Huntress, wanting to be just like her Mom, Summer Rose, however her last name wasn't always that of the one she saw as her mother, she was once known as Ruby Potter. The Wizarding World has no clue where their savior is, but a Death Eater decides the Goblet of Fire is the best way to bring her out of hiding. Ruby Rose is Fem! Harry.
