Either a relatively new idea put forth by modern fanfiction and writers or an older trope that was never properly explored or even an overdone trope you'd like to see someone take a better swing at. More coverage for certain characters? Less coverage for others? A more popular ship? More homosexual representation? What about fanfiction today would you like to see more of in the stuff you read?


** 1. More Ravenclaw Harry. Bonus points if he reads what interests him like in canon and has a life outside the library.

2. More bromance. Kudos if Neville and Dobby aren't mentioned.

3. More Cormac McLaggen, Slughorn, and the Crouches

4. More charms and potions. Seen only a few potions or charms prodigy Harry

**** Fanfiction is a wish fulfillment, the author clearly wanted to take their own studies more seriously. Of course the logical step is to write a fanfiction where the MC study hard everyday. Why would you study in real life if you can make your MC study for you?

** I like fanfictions that I call "Butterfly Effect Stories." That means everything happens exactly as in canon, but somewhere along the way some detail happens differently. After that the story explores the ramifications of the difference. At first they may be very small, but eventually it turns out to be a totally different story.

For example:

1. What if Voldemort managed to steal the Philosopher's Stone and escape Hogwarts before anyone realized what had happened?

2. What if Harry and Ron did not find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets and Diarymort returned to life at the expense of Ginny's life?

3. What if Arthur Weasley did not win the Daily Prophet drawing?

4. What if Cedric Diggory found his way to the Triwizard Cup before Harry and went to Little Hangleton alone?

5. What if Cornelius Fudge was not a spineless coward and believed Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return?

6. What if Dumbledore did not put the cursed ring to his finger?

7. What if Dumbledore had left the real Sword of Gryffindor to Harry before his death, allowing him to destroy Horcruxes?

** More non-standard pairings - slash or otherwise

Less Gryffindor and order bashing - mostly because there's too much of this stuff and it's starting to get tedious - but I also get that good and balanced characterisation is hard and this is amateur writing

Definitely less Snape-positive fics - again, mostly because of this trend of Snape fics to eat into all other characters, and there's so many of these that a bunch of characters end up with distorted fanon personalities that get legitimised to near-canon extents. It sometimes feels like all other characters need to lose dimensions in order for Snape to gain more positive ones. Both can be true, you guys. Snape can be a heroic asshole, and Sirius can be both the best and worst person ever, which is central to their mystique.

** I wish there were more proper /stories:/ most fics seem to stem from a premise, and from there, it turns into a sequence of events; by contrast, it's pretty hard to find fics where the intention was to tell an actual story. Think of a canon divergence where the climax, assuming the author gets that far, is identical to the one in canon, and you'll see what I mean.

I'd like to see far, /far/ less of Snape and Malfoy. I've never found the latter compelling in the slightest, and I genuinely don't understand the fandom's interest in him (that's not a request for an explanation, by the by). As for the former, I get why people find him interesting, but I despise the suave, caring, and generally not-abusive version of him most fics feature.

Less character bashing in general, but especially less Ron and Dumbledore bashing, would be nice, and if we could get fics that don't bash Ron /and/ don't shift the bashing to Hermione, that'd be great.

That said, stories that hold characters responsible for their actions are a good'un. Basically less of Ron saying "I'm only pretending to be your friend for money" and more Snape going "why you so bad a potions, bro?" and Harry responding "would /you/ bother to make an effort in a class whose teacher made up his mind to hate you before you even walked through the door?"

Specifically, and I'm giving this its own section 'cause I think it deserves it, I'd love to see more fics where Harry calls Snape out for getting his parents killed, abusing him, disparaging his father's memory (despite James having saved his life), and acting like he's somehow worse off for Lily's death than her orphaned son who was sent to live with negligent and abusive relatives as a direct result all because Snape decided to give his allegiance to a terrorist.

Death Eater apologism: could it not be a thing anymore, please? Also, can we maybe stop rationalising ways in which racists are actually right and the real heroes of the story? Or, to put it a memeier way: "I don't care for these new nazis, and you may quote me on that." - John Mulaney

** - Marauders' era stories that give Peter an actual personality; he was as much a member of the group as the others, so why doesn't fanfiction reflect that?
- More Department of Mysteries.
- Fics about Tom Riddle before he became Voldemort, and/or where he didn't do so at all.
- Fics about Grindelwald's war and the connection with World War II.
- Fics with a dark/morally reprehensible protagonist that aren't edgy or emo, and that delve into the truth behind dark magic.
- Fics with ample amounts of whimsy and wonder (like What's Her Name in Hufflepuff).
- Fics that explore the lives of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs and the unique things about each house. We already know about Gryffindor and there are /so/ many fics that have such cool interpretations of Slytherin, so the other two houses should get the same treatment in my opinion.
- Snape fics that aren't focused on shipping.

** More (any) reconstructions of mercy and restraint. In the fic I'm reading now, a character showed up at around 400k out-of 500k words, who was an obvious reference to the "do it again, Bomber Harris!" meme. I am just... so... tired... of Edgy!Pragmatic!Realist!heroes killing Death Eaters and children of Death Eaters because they are Nazi Bigots™, with few or no realistic human motivations. There are some prolific posters here who seem to want to drag the fandom in this direction. And, "we are druids who dance naked in the woo-ids; mudbloods are dEsTrYiNg OuR cUlTuRe," isn't much better.

Plus, fighting non-lethally with magic shouldn't be that much of a tactical handicap, and it's a strategic win, 'cause anyone you capture can be pumped full of veritaserum.

More treatment of the fact that Azkaban is monstrous.

More exploration of why the muggle population is so much larger and the magical world is in hiding, when logically the evolutionary advantage of Fucking Magic should be enormous. I want to see Lucius Malfoy get Hannibal Lectured over being a worse contributor to the pureblood cause than Arthur and Molly Weasley. I want to see a conspiracy for peaceful demographic replacement of muggles.

More wizards colonizing the stars.

More exploration of the implications of magic for warfare and political structure. With apparation, physical location is almost meaningless. The Fidelius makes "consent of the governed" quite literal. It seems like all military operations would boil down to either intelligence gathering, or bushwhackings.

More exploration of magical combat tactics, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11572455/1/If-Looks-Could-Kill][If Looks Could Kill]].

- The tragically underutilized Imperius curse.

- Fewer fire tornados, more stealth and tracking. Like submarine warfare.

- The disillusionment charm is only the starting point. I've seen sound and smell brought up before, but what about disturbed air currents? What about strain in the floor?

- Magical combat should be 99% preparation and red-teaming, and 1% staking your life on your R&D being better than theirs.

- Gimmicks that work exactly once, like muggle guns.

- The bludger enchantment, refined to use proportional navigation, applied to hand grenades.

Believable Snape redemption stories. In many fics Snape suddenly changes from a guy who hates Harry and bullies other students to a hero and someone who can do no wrong. He also out of nowhere starts to care about Harry. That is just simply a bad writing.

More friendship fics with Harry and Luna/Neville. Their relationship with Harry is very pure and genuine. It's a shame that there are not many stories that explore these dynamics since I always found them interesting.

** More Ron Weasley.

And also as someone else said, more stories with a proper beginning, midgame and climax. A decent share of fanfictions have the beginning part figured out but after that it's just a long sequence of events with no climax to be found. It may be hard to put stories to rest in that way but the stories that stick with the most are often ones with the best ending.

Also Ron/Muggle OC.

** More post-Hogwarts fics that not everything is happily ever after. I have absolutely nothing against Ginny, I think Harry/Ginny makes sense but to me its a bit boring. Give me Harry struggling to be normal after years of being the 'chosen one,' give me mid twenties Harry meeting Gabrielle and seeing her as a breath of fresh air, to her he's a personal hero but she never went through the war and that means she doesn't see him the same way as everyone else. Give me Harry and a pureblood girl bridging the gap and showing that the wizarding world can move on from the past. Give me Harry struggling to deal with his friends wanting him to throw his weight around. Hermione is a crusader and Harry is the hero but he just wants to get on with his own life. Give me Harry realising who he is has been defined by Voldermort, take Harry on a holiday to discover who he really is and then give me fun adventures he gets caught up in while he's there.

More people realising that if things were as pro-pureblood as many authors make out, it would be the muggleborns not the purebloods doing the whole murder cult thing.

***** Then there are also the groups that want to radically change the system. E.g.

The KKK, CSA, Nazi Germany, Jim Crow, Hirohito's Japan among others are examples of historical right-wing extremists.

****** This isn't about left or right, but majority versus minority. The claim was made that if Wizarding Britain was biased against muggleborn - and as Pottermore proved, there were bigoted pro-pureblood laws Hermione got rid of after the war - then it would be the muggleborns, not the purebloods using violence and terror.

As history shows, this is patently false.

** 1. More world building. I see alot more of adult characters as MCs now so we have gotten away from hogwarts but its usually limited to like politics or crime in a familiar location. But there is so much to explore. The books reference magical rune booby traps in Egypt, Studying Dragons in Romania, areas where giants roam free. There are indications for extended study like magical college for specialized feels like healing. Just potential for so much more than what is shown in the books.

2. In the mirror of Erised you see he is very ambitious. His chess skills is indication of his cunning. And amongst the trio he has honestly the mpst social skills and ability to reach out to others and connect with them for reasons other than being the chosen one. Id love to see him nuture those qualities in him that canon didnt

3. Exploring the house of Ravenclaw. Its known as the intelligent house. Yet the most intelligent people in canon often come from Griffindor and Slytherin. Instead most Ravenclaws you get to know have specific interests they are experts in or obsessed with regardless of its usefullness. What is a house full of people like that like? Slytherin minor characters like Blaise Nott Pansy the Greengrass sisters and Millicent are often expanded on. I want Ravenclaw explored the same way.

4. Adult Sirius fics that arent about him raising Harry. Sirius is young when James and Lilly die while 21 year olds can be parents its alot of responsibility. In cases where he doesnt go after Peter he usually takes in Harry. But he could be given other options . Go to Molly for example or Andromeda both of which would give Harry unique families while also being able to bond with uncle Sirius. Post Azkaban Sirius is a ptsd ridden mess and should he get custody of Harry deffering the responsibility to someone else so he has more time for himself might be less stressful for him. A happy ending for Sirius that isnt revolving around him being a parent isnt a well explored one. Neither is him coping with ptsd post Azkaban and id like to see both explored.

5. " Weird" pairings often HP fandom are willing to explore unique concepts with little basis in canon. Even expand on characters who have little to no chatacterization in canon. However they arent as flexible with ships. And i wish they were sometimes for the more unique stories the popular ships arent the best option. I wish it was treated more like any other story element rather than a illustration of the authors favorite romances.

6. Magic is not science. Snape even suggests wizards arent commonly logical which suggests that they dont need to be. Perhaps because magical isnt logical all the time? Im not against fics where it can be understood through science i like it. But i want more fics where the study of magic is explored while keeping its mysterious mystical quality too.

** Good writing - and I don't mean that in a snarky way. Even the most canon-y canon story (and I love these, personally) or the most overdone trope or out there AU can be fun to read if the writing is good. The perfect example (whose name I'm now forgetting, sorry!) was a Hermione/Draco marriage law fic. I never read Dramione and don't really care for marriage law trope, but this one was well written. I want to see people writing what they want to write, even if it's been done before. Average writers (like myself) will get better and the best will filter to the top.

Also more “missing moments” fics - I've been reading a lot since I finished linkffn(Order of Mercy). I particularly love Bill/Fleur.

** Other types of magic. Usually people say that magic without a wand is either hard or impossible, but I think it's just a matter of creativity.

Trying wand magic without a wand is hard, duh, you don't have the correct tool. But I like the idea that it opens other methods of magic. Imagine magic like from doctor strange (without the whole multi-universe, drawing power from evil gods thing), portals, reality warping. Maybe stuff like the last airbender, controlling the 4 elements.

Obviously the biggest problem is making it so it isn't a free power up for our hero, if it was everyone would be doing it.

Also, bloodline/family-magic stuff. Provided not just the main character had it, you could throw some curve balls into the story, each friend and enemy having some trump card up their sleeve to use.
