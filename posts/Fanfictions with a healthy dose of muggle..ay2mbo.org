What the title said. Basically, what I'm looking for are fics with a fair amount of muggle elements in it. It doesn't have to dominate the story (in fact, I would prefer it didn't, I love the magical world after all), but in a way that incorporates the muggle elements in such a way that it shows the ignorant wizards (purebloods, especially) how wrong their ideas about muggles were. For example, I remember a fic where Harry explained to Draco the genetics of why incest and inbreeding is wrong. In another, he explained the Sandwich model (is that what it's called) of writing an essay. In yet another fic, the wizards of Harry's age group were taken to a muggle museum and they were amazed at the technologies used to see inside pyramids or Something. I want something along those lines. Not something that would completely dominate the story but just incorporating it nicely and educating the wizarding world. I understand that these kinds of fics can be hard to find. If you know any good ones, please recommend.


** All [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]]'s fics have reasonable amount of Muggle involvements without bashing Wizards. For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), dark Purebloods like Nott know Muggle problems very well.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** There's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]) which is 'the dogfather' by Hollimichele. Harry was left on the Dursleys' doorstep but they called the cops and said they didn't know whose baby it was (a conveniently ripped letter had Harry's first name). He's adopted by a childless muggle couple and has a loving upbringing. It's seriously heartwarming to read this version of Harry's childhood.

Nobody is bashed, everyone (except Voldemort) is treated kindly.
