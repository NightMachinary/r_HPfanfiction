Doesn't matter in what way. Is he the most dangerous, most skilled Dark Lord, who was just shy of ruling the entire world? Give me.

Is he a bumbling idiot, that trips on his face every 2nd step, and likes to joke around? Like, he's literally the /WORST/ Dark Lord ever? Give me this too.


** The impression I seem to get from both canon and fanon is that he's the most powerful individually but not necessarily the most effective as a leader. He fights Albus Dumbledore (The next Merlin) on even terms who owns the Elder Wand and has a half century of magical experience on him, whereas Grindelwald lost while owning the Elder Wand against a less knowledgeable though perhaps more physically and magically fit one.

It's not that he's not capable of scheming and manipulation, it is just that his pride and hangups get in the way. The fact he can inspire genuine loyalty in a good amount of his followers while treating all of them like shit implies how much more terrifying he could be if he bothered with a veneer of civilization.

He crucio's messengers and insists he must kill Potter personally in spite of, or rather because he is weak to Harry magically and prophecy-wise. He's scared of death and weakness and needs to prove his power. He prioritizes his image and desires above gaining advantages, because he doesn't think he needs them. Grindelwald did bother with his rhetoric and 'moral' reasons for his grab for power, he might have even convinced himself to believe them. If he went into politics or used Grindelwald's tactics he'd easily own the world.

*** I like the headcanon that Tom Riddle was a better Dark Lord than LV. Like, splitting his soul made his thought process really worse, and took the cunning part of his self away.

I always got the feeling Dumbledore wasn't going all out in their duel.

**** This. Their duel is presented as even in the movie, but in the book Riddle is clearly the underdog, though still a danger to Dumbledore - who was definitely not going all out. Strolling, insisting of acting the part of the disappointed teacher, casting slowly... I get the feeling Dumbledore had a visceral distaste for fighting, possibly acquired in '45 when he defeated Grindelwald (whom he probably had to beat within an inch of his life in order to be able to arrest him).

***** Yes he wasn't trying to be lethal, but he wasn't necessarily pulling punches either "/We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom. Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit ---/" Voldemort is well past Dumbledore's mercy and penchant for atonement, he plans to torture him in some personal way. I think we can infer he's giving as best he can without the lethality and has a phoenix (a rare and powerful legendary creature) to warp him around and take a killing curse (though I'm not sure if Fawkes helped during his Grindelwald duel), on top of his own magical prowess.

****** The very fact that Fawkes had to take an AK for him points me to thinking that Dumbledore isn't really being serious. I mean, he might be old in years and have that huge white beard, but HBP shows us that he still has a young man's athleticism.

As for the scary unknown spell that forced Voldemort to conjure his shield, if you're /trying/ you use that at the tail end of a (fast, ideally) combination of other attacks and distractions to give it the best chance to connect.

At no point in that duel I felt voldemort was afraid. It should have been more epic.

*** Exactly, people act like TMR/Lord Voldemort is incapable of being extremely charismatic and inspiring and think Grindelwald to be far far above him in these characteristics...

When Lord Voldemort got enough followers and power he no longer cared about subtle influnce and subterfuge unless the situation demanded it. You were either attracted to his power and goals or against him. Some of his decisions(mostly later on) on were dumb, although Harry an above average student has to win somehow.

This one has a Voldemort that gives me the creeeeeps! And I love it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29356095/chapters/72109323]] The author's other work Ouroboros is supposedly really good with a powerful Voldemort but I'm waiting to read it until it's completed.

** linkffn(12957404) fits, although he doesn't appear in person. His name is a literal WMD that people don't know, since the very knowledge of the name Voldemort melts your mind. Saying it without being loyal causes an explosion of power.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.
