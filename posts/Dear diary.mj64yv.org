The diary in Malfoy's possession isn't a horcrux. Rather, it's really Tom Riddle's diary, charmed to hide it's content. Harry get's his hand on it and accidentally disables the protection. The diary is full of Lord Voldemort's extremely embarrassing secrets.


** Dear Diary,

I fear that today I may have made a grevious error. There I was, walking along the third floor corridor busy with my thoughts of world domination and immortality when who should approach me but a filthy mudblood. But not any filthy mudblood, oh no, the one with the cutest little button nose that I told you about last month that I decided I would show mercy to when the mudblood day of reckoning came.

Well, so engrossed in my evil plans was I that I walked straight into her! But here we come to the crux of my heinous crime. So engrossed was I in that adorable noggin of hers that I seem to have lost control of my senses. I apologised dear Diary - to mudblood. I am so ashamed that I may never be able to look my fellow Slytherins in the face again.

As I write I realises there is only one course of action. To denounce all noses from henceforth. I shall work tirelessly until my nose is no longer casting its long shadow, even if it does wreak havoc on my devilishly handsome visage. Then I once I have completed my world domination I will ban all noses so that no one have to face such humiliation again.

Yours mortified,

The noseless lord
