** So, sort of like Lamarckian inheritance for magic. It's interesting enough.

*** That was my first thought when I read this. Though to be honest, I'd be more interested in seeing stories (besides mine) go Darwinian to explain why certain extra abilities pop up in certain lines (Parsletounge, Metamorphmagus, etc.). Like, perhaps the Gaunts did so much inbreeding because they wanted to ensure the Parselmouth ability didn't die out. Perhaps one could write a story that the ability originated in some magical environment where communication with snakes built up because it was extremely useful.

**** That's a really cool concept and would need thinking about. I think it might be difficult to explain why it might be beneficial for an entire population to be metamorphmagi though. Personally I prefer the Lamarckian idea for magic though because it delineates a development as explicitly magical and somewhat set apart from what is natural.

Also I'm definitely going to look up your story!

Oh I didn't write that. I haven't thought up how to explain Metamorphmagi just yet. Currently, I've only written Harry and Tonks as the only Blacks with the ability (I rewrote Harry to be Dorea Black's grandson). One idea that comes to mind is that since the Blacks are noted to have beautiful, aristocratic features (even after prolonged exposure to Dementors), maybe it's the result of generations of selecting beautiful people as their spouses (or even magically altering their appearances so often throughout time). Not sure it's quite Darwinian though.

Oops, I should note this hasn't yet been explored in my story. It's planned but I'm only a few chapters in. /sweats/ Although, funnily, the way I wrote Harry discovering his Metamorphmagus ability could be read as Lamarckian. But right now, there's just confusion among the Black family as to how he could be a Parselmouth.

****** This idea just popped into my head. The first metamorphmagus could have been a person born with an aberration as to their physical appearance. As a result of insecurity or anxiety they wanted to change their appearance and their magic complied. Accidental magic that is. It's only a very spontaneous thought that I might want to think about more. I've always loved accidental magic in stories - particularly where the solution that â€˜magic came up with' departs from any sense of logic, for example when a child wants to get a toy they don't just summon it but it sprouts legs and walks over to it.

******* Accidental magic plays a big part early in my story! Good idea, I'll definitely keep it in mind. :)

*** I hadn't heard of Lamarckian inheritance, so I looked it up. Interesting! I was thinking that magic can change one's epigenetic traits, sort of how the post WW2 famine did in Europe.

** Sounds like a fun fic, but it could probably easily turn into a mary sue story if you're not careful. Also, seems like it would b e fun as a rational!fic

This is one of the best videos I have found on Mary Sues, and what they actually are and why they aren't good from a story perspective. I recommend watching it, even though it doesn't seem like you're on that path. I don't even have the courage to share any of my personal writing, so I'm not one to give anything but grammar advise myself, but I look forward to maybe reading it.

Also. Seriously think about the rationalist idea if you don't hate that sort of fic. It would really suit a protag with an eidetic memory (even though intelligence and rationality are not causally related). If you don't like that sort of fic, I completely understand that everyone has different taste

** Well, seems like this idea would validate pureblood bigotry - muggleborns would be weaker than them in this setting, lacking such inheritances. There's no support for that in canon Harry Potter.

** Main issue for me, interesting though the idea is, is that I can see an almost inevitable Mary Sue situation. Oh there's a new character who is unexpectedly powerful? Well they had ten generations of ancestors who did X so voila!

In fact, it's almost a Catch-22. If there aren't legions of stupidly powerful people in this story I can't help but wonder why people haven't caught on to this and oriented the magic they practiced for centuries to produce incredible descendants. But if it is done in the story it loses all interest (for me anyway).
