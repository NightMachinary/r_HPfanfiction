What are the stories where things go full-on crazy? Power creep, God-level spells, huge battles that go beyond “a bunch of wizards have a Stupefy/Avada Kedavra contest.” I want to see magic change the entire world, I want reimaginings where everything is way, way different, I want to see Atlantis, and I don't really care about pairings, though I don't object to a wel-written romance. Help me out.

I've already read:

Methods

Significant Digits

Prince of Slytherin

The Philosopher King

The Seventh Horcrux

The Third Key Reloaded

Alexandra Quick (check out my audiobook podcast on iTunes, Spotify, etc)

I tried Super Bowl Breach but just couldn't get into it, and I'm currently on an extended try at Eclipse of the Sky, though I am waiting for it to pick up.


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]) and it Sequel Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh s Song]]) were clearly heading this way. sadly 3rd part was never released still a very nice read, esspecially if you enjoy Irish mythology.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle A Harry Potter Adventure]]) has some very nice fights, too.

** linkffn(Hell Eyes by Jezaray) fits the bill. In this case magic doesn't change the Earth specifically but as there are plenty of other worlds that /do/ get changed I believe it still qualifies. Very much not a crossover, all the weird shit that pops up (and there is plenty of it, believe me) is original content. Very good though.

** Wastelands of time is probably this. Harry pontificates like a Film Noir action hero, drawling his way through an epic-scale time travel adventure. I don't know about power creep, because I don't really know what that means, but everything is quite overpowered and grand-scale in scope. He's also looking for Atlantis, conveniently.

**** I described Philosopher King in a discord I'm in as “Voldemort won and he fucks,” though it truly is way more than that. Synopsis: Voldemort won the first war and now rules the world as an untouchable god-king known to everyone as simply “my lord.” The world he has created is very fleshed out and disturbing, and is the main thing that I would praise it for. It is super slow-burn Tomarry, which isn't my cup of tea but does seem to be handled in a very interesting manner. It's ongoing, and currently cuts off just as things are getting truly interesting.

SigDig is arguably better than HPMoR.

***** I had to google what that meant - I am totally not hip or down with the kids. When you say disturbing, are we talking like Animal Farm and Black Mirror and that Firebird Trilogy thing are disturbing, or is this more Veela's Worth and Saw kinda disturbing?

And is the Harry in 'SigDig' as irritatingly conceited as the Harry in 'HPMoR'? The whole 'I am the smartest, bow before my divine majesty' vibe was quite, quite irritating to me when I tried to read MoD.

****** Disturbing in that Muggles are chattel with only those rights that it amuses wizards to give them, everyone is subject to The Lord's whims. He will at times draft legislation by speaking an offhand sentence at dinner (every pureblood family prepares a place for him at table every single night in case he apparates in) and society generally has a pleasant veneer---if you're a pureblood wizard---that doesn't quite cover the casual cruelty that is sometimes displayed. Oh, and from time to time The Lord will take a “companion” of either sex, commonly for years at a time. Refusal is, of course, unthinkable. But it isn't played for titillation, and it is restrained in explicit description.

One should finish MoR before SigDig FOR SURE, so do that if you haven't. I would honestly say that being able to read SigDig makes getting through MoR worth it if it's not entirely to your taste. I won't go into MoR spoilers unless you have actually finished it and want me to, but I will say that Harry, while he is A main character, is not exactly THE main character of SigDig. And he is a lot wiser and humbler. A bunch of other characters get a lot of fun screen time too. SigDig is not a piece of “rationalist fiction” per se, it's an extremely well-written science-fantasy novel set in the unique and interesting (and vastly changed) world that MoR left us with. And it's important to me to note that while I am a bit of a sucker for the kind of story MoR is and have read it multiple times through, I do understand that the quality of the writing is very uneven and its overall structure and pacing are both...quite lacking. SigDig reads like a motherfucker wrote a book.

It's nothing to do with the writing or structure or pacing - I just really, really find the protagonist really, really irritating. Every time he talks it's just an instinctive eyeroll and a 'oh, that wanker is talking again, I can't wait 'til he stops'. I gave up a few chapters in and never went back. I can deal with sociopaths, depressives, and maniacs, but I just find the arrogant or the wilfully ignorant so hard to read. Kills my motivation to continue like nothing else.

Most likely, I'll either ask for a plot summary or find a synopsis somewhere and skip it.

** Alexandra Quick is the first HP fic I read and still my favorite. I've tried to find other fics that capture the same scale of it for a long, long time.

Here are some epic-level fics that you and others haven't mentioned yet. They're all truly excellent and I think if you like AQ you'll enjoy all of these. I also really enjoy White Squirrel's two long fics and highly recommend both of those.

The Phoenix and the Serpent: linkffn(637123) is a very, very old fic that probably lost its prominence because it's incomplete, but was very popular back in the day. Expansive world, new avenues of magic, adventures to all sorts of fantastical places. An interesting take on Dumbledore and a very well-written Ginny.

Stygian Trilogy: linkffn(8255131) I read this series recently and loved it. Magnetic characters and all sorts of different-than-the-books magical theory. While the first book is set at Hogwarts the second and third books see the characters literally jumping around the globe every chapter.

HP and the Boy Who Lived: linkffn(5353809) Another old classic that's unfortunately incomplete. The shortest of the fics on here and probably the one with the least world exploration, but great characters, a lot of magic creep and a vivid imagining of Durmstrang.

Pendant of Slytherin: linkffn(4324404) A lot of people don't like this one because of the writing quality, but I think it's ok, certainly better than A Second Chance at Life (which is exactly why I didn't recommend that fic, but it certainly fits your criteria now that I think about it). There's a really wonderful concept within Hogwarts that this fic explores and a whole lot of magic creep.

Albus Potter series by Vekin 87: linkffn(4380964)

This just takes Rowling's series to another level magic-wise, and in general does a really godo job carrying on the spirit of the series. Not that much magic creep. Read this before the series below.

Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom: linkffn(8417562)

HP on acid. Absolutely ridiculous execution and plotting, combined with magic creep x 10, actual Atlantis (I think), a magic base on the moon, and literally the first book is about revealing the existence of magic to Muggles.

*** Oh you should definitely check out my audiobooks of Alexandra Quick if you haven't! I've been working very closely with the author on the voices and delivery, and am almost finished releasing the second book. The third is recorded in its entirety and I'm plowing through the editing process. Sub thread here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AlexandraQuick/comments/d7n4ne/alexandra_quick_and_the_audiobook_project/]]

Does Albus Potter (Global Revelation et all) get truly good? I got well into the second book and too many things bugged me about it. I don't know why he replaced the entire staff of Hogwarts with such forgettable professors apart from Most Interesting Professor Ever (tm) doing transfiguration. Albus going into Gryffindor is a boring take, I can't stand the names the author seems compelled to give people and I just have so much trouble caring about much of anyone. It gets so much praise though. Am I missing something?

**** I lurk around on the AQ sub so I've checked out your audiobooks, good work! I much prefer reading but am glad you're making the series more widely available!

Yeah, I think I arrived at that point with Noah's series too. But there is a LOT of cool Fidelius stuff (not a spoiler) that happens in the 3rd and 4th books. The magical theory starts to hit really hard around that time as well and there's some interesting stuff with some of the other professors. After the fifth book it just goes crazy plot wise and it's almost impossible to wrap your head around everything that's happening.

But yeah, it has so many inconsistencies. I agree with you that I can't comprehend why everyone's name has to start with A. I think I conglomerated Alec and Aidan's and Mia and Holly's characters until about book 6 and it didn't make a difference. The names are also just in general really stupid - there's a character in the third or fourth book that you will groan at after a couple chapters. As long as you're fine with passable writing the plot more than makes up for it at the end though.

** The fic, Made of Common Clay by Lomonaaeren, has what you're looking for! Harry, at age 30, is an extremely jaded auror. He is fed up with the politics and scheming in the Wizarding world. And then, a mysterious visitor provides Harry with an opportunity . . . It's such a great story: Powerful!Harry, Independent!Harry!, which I love in fanfic when it's done right. There's no romance (a nice change, I think). Just Harry being a total badass and using amazing, powerful magic to freak people out and bend them to his will! Give it a try. At 43 chapters, there's plenty of plot. Lomonaaeren has written nearly 600 HP fanfics, so she knows her canon.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

** Wizard of the Kaleidoscope by OnTheImportanceOfLungs. I get the vibe that it's kinda controversial but I'll be damned if it doesn't have a huge, sprawling magic system. Probably because it's a bit of a crossover with Naruto and the Nasuverse, but you don't really have to be familiar with those fandoms to enjoy it.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

**** Agree with you there, having started reading a few days ago and already being up to World Away (the bit where the Grannies explain Troublesome's story to Alexandra). Random question that doesn't really count for a spoiler, but is Shirtliffe's scar ever explained?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is definitely a great one as well. Dumbledore bends the world, Grindewald survives having his chest blown open, and even more fun stuff happens.
