I have read a few smaller pics about Harry being raised in different countries - such as India.

And I quite enjoyed the idea behind.

Do you guys per chance know any other similar fanfiction?


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Harry was raised by Sirius in France, went to Beauxbaton, and never attended Hogwarts.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort that night. They fled Britain altogether and had to relocate every few years to hide their tracks. Young Harry was not pleased and swore revenge on whoever chased them. He later attended a Muggle boarding school in Liverpool under a disguise, where he made a very important contact.
