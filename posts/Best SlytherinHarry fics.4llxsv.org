I've already read On the Way to Greatness, but are there any other good ones? Preferably no slash or bashing. Or WBL's.


** linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do? by Big D on a Diet) is a great little fic with Slytherin!Harry. It's a little unrealistic, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a really fun read.

This'll probably get mixed reviews, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is a great subversion of many of the tropes in the fandom (especially surrounding Harry). It starts of a little weak though, but the second year is awesome so far imo. Not perfect as it has its missteps, but really good.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** Check out linkffn(magical relations). It features magical Dudley and that's the catalyst for Harry winding up in Slytherin. It's extremely well written and the characters and friendships that develop are very real and enjoyable. And it has some really great humor moments!

One of my major issues with a lot of the canon rehash fics out there is that Harry doesn't really act like a kid, but in this one his character feels real and authentic.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** linkffn(they shook hands year 1 new version)

I like this story for the most part but Harry's meanness always bothers me. He's not very nice and goes out of his way to antagonize Ron, which is totally unlike Harry's canon character. I guess the case could be made that Harry acts mean because he has (in my opinion) mean friends but his character just always feels off to me in this story. There is also lots of unnecessary Ron-bashing.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
