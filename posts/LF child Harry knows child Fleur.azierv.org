  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

***** Yup. Even Harry himself wasn't likable, imo. I was hanging on, hoping that we'd be introduced to better characters soon. It's tagged as HarryxFleur, so maybe the Delacours were going to appear or something.

I decided I'd read until he actually got to Beauxbatons, because we'd have to meet the other primary characters. His friend group was no real improvement.
