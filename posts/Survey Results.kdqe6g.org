Yesterday's survey got about 100 responses and a fair amount of critique on question design. The original link as well as [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1JSM3ZnqUJOvshfhRS4ewGwPjYVFSb98wDyh9uVOjj1SHlg/viewanalytics][this]] one link to the results for those who are interested and would like to view or discuss them.


** Life pro tip: never let a wizard get the drop on you.

Lmao at "can it be written well? Yes. Is it written well? Hell no."

I found the nearly 50/50 split on whether Hagrid and Arthur were representative of how much wizards know about muggles to be pretty interesting.

To be fair, that's probably true of any type of fanfiction.

** I found it really interesting how much weight is given to the element of surprise.

*** I think it makes complete sense. A gun and a wand can both easily take out an unsuspecting target before they have a chance to react.

** I think something thats important about the fighting discussions is what are they (muggles and wizards) prepared to do. Wizards willing to kill/use unforgivables? Wizard win (unless large scale). Muggles have a gun and willing to use it? Dependent on who shoots first/faster. Muggles have a knife? Wizard win. Like, for the long range ones, I answered that the muggles would win because I imagined snipers. But someone could think that range doesn't really matter and that wizards would win. There's too many variables to really condense it into one survey.

But yeah. Interesting premise. I look forward to taking and seeing the results of any other future surveys.

** I found the question for biology really interesting. I chose the Muggle side to be more knowledgeable because I think Wizards have no incentive to really "know" every bit of information about a body. If they want it to hurt, cure it, etc. they just use magic. Muggles on the other hand have to take every part into consideration to affect a body.
