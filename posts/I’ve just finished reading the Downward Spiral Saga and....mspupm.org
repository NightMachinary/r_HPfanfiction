....please hit me with your fluffiest, diabetes-inducing Hinny (or Haphne for that matter) that you know.

My soul needs some healing after this for it is more splitted and shattered that Voldy's!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** I know right? I just find myself remembering some of the scenes and just stare at the blank wall and become increasingly sad and disturbed. But it is not the gruesome scenes that traumatised me the most, but the abuse and grooming underline of a child and of course all the “right” (wrong!!) circumstances that gradually transforms Harry into what he is by the end of the last book.

**** For me it was mostly the fucked up torture and utter lack of empathy. Whenever I read Hinny now I think of what happens to her

** I don't think I've read that one, I have read and enjoyed a fic where Harry got turned into an incubus? And voldy is his mate, he tortures and mutilates his way through the very corrupt and morally bankrupt "light". Don't recall the name of it, but it used to be on HPfandom, it's on ao3 now, I have it saved somewhere...
