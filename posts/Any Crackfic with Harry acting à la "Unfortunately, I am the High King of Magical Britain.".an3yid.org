****** In later chapters the Weasleys kidnap his children and keep them hostage, his wife loses a child because of the stress and they are abused by Molly during their captivity while Hermione was all for the plan, which she plotted with Percy and the original Order. Also Dumbledore was paying Ron and Hermione to report about Harry's activity (they refused the money after a few years because they were genuinely his friends at that point if I remember) and more besides.

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

** For some reason I'm reminded of a Skyrim mod I saw once, one where you could be the 'High King of Skyrim' or something like that, and have anybody you didn't like executed, or sent to the gladiatorial arena, or have strong people you do like serve as your bodyguard.

It'd be really funny to have a High King Harry who could affect the plot just by ordering people to do things.\\
"You, Voldemort! As the High King of Magical Britain, I order you to stop being evil!"\\
"I...what? You know what, fine, but just to spite you, /Your Majesty/, I'm going to about-face and sponsor a movement for egalitarian democracy! So there!"

  AU. A 1000 years ago, a plague extinguished 3/4 of Britain's magical population, including 3 of the 4 founders; Godric Gryffindor remained and founded a new world, with a monarchy that would last for years to come. Now, Ginny Weasley is the Holyhead Harpies' star Chaser and a simple commoner, but Harry James Potter of Evans and Gryffindor, Prince of Wales, has his eye on her.
