Tom Riddle doesn't like his name because he spent years waiting for his father, Tom, to come looking for him and take him home.

When Dumbledore asks why Tom doesn't like his name, Tom says that "there are a lot of Tom's." Dumbledore puts this down to Tom wanting to be special, believing he's special (and he was).

Taking more than 30 seconds to look at things from Tom's point of view should have led Dumbledore to a very very different conclusion.

Tom's an orphan, a boy who grew up asking Mrs. Cole about his mother, his father. Searching desperately for any scrap of information that was available. He knew his mother was dead, but his father- he was still alive. His father named Tom.

Imagine all the families coming to the orphanage, every man, again and again named Tom. All of the children lining up and being introduced to perspective parents. Then with each one, watching the father's eyes pass right over Tom like he wasn't there at all.

*I wonder how many times Tom thought his father came back for him, came looking for him. And how many years had to go by before he gave up hope.*

"Young love is as beautiful and powerful as magic. It fills you up, sending you soaring ever higher, Gellert taught me many things books never did. We went on many adventures together without ever leaving my room."

Albus adjusted his spectacles gently, blue eyes reflected dimly.

"Young love is also mysterious, dangerous- like an older man- such loves are fleeting, only within grasp for a few short moments of bliss, then gone again in the morning."

“Little spots, sir? We've all got plenty of those, don't they stop when we get older?”

The Professor seemed alarmed, eyes growing wide beneath bushy brows. One hand paused on his beard and twitched towards his pocket.

“Oh?”

“The older ones have them. They're all bumpy and sometimes they have pus faces.”

The old man relaxed.

Tom had his answer, Dumbledore was no doctor here to take him to the sanitarium. This old man was some kind of nutter.

**** First, that Tom means "twin" seems ironic to me because it is the only name that appears three times in three people who are hardly related by blood (except for Tom Sr). Because the others (James, Fred ...) are usually repeated by a dead relative or etcetera.

Second, haha, I love it because it's easier to imagine, theorize, and combine Canon elements with an idea. For example, in Canon it is also emphasized that the name of Tom is common, when the names of others can also be repeated in other people, only that in the world of HP it seems that no, that each name seems to be unique (Neville, Draco. ..) ... The question that arises is what would happen if there were also three Nevilles, or three Draco? Maybe Tom would not be so affected by having a trait in common with others when it seems that everyone also has the same name as someone? And here come the fanfics that try to answer. And it's so fun.

** Even within canon...

Tom Riddle Jr. was born of Tom Riddle, Snr, who was apparently (according to Pottermore) born of a /Thomas/ Riddle.

Then there's the proprietor of the Leaky Cauldron, also called Tom - of whom we don't know an age, so he might have been around for Tom Riddle Junior's time at Hogwarts (Da Wiki lists his date-of-birth as "1920 or earlier").

... Now I kinda want an AU where all Voldemort really wants is to not be Yet Another Tom, so his entire plan comes careening to a halt when someone points out he can legally have his name changed.

*** Okay, but. My /dude/. As someone that's just one of many generations of the same name in a family that, while not exact, does similar repetitions, you've described that feeling so freaking well. There's legitimately an ongoing joke in my family that if we're ever given so much as an /opportunity/ to time travel, we have to fight tooth and nail for it, just so one of us can go back in time and throw a baby name book at one of our ancestors.

There'd still be the same old pattern of recycling names, I think, since it's become a bit of a tradition to drive each other insane, but. There would be some /variety/. Less Richards or Katherines. Some /peace/.

**** Same here. My mom's side of the family is full of James' and Johns, and my dad's side repeates the name Edward. Sometimes entire generations on my mom's side can only be distinguished by their middle names (which frustrates my mother since she's really into genealogical research). Nearly every female in both sides of my family commonly have the middle name Jean. I'm just lucky to be born female or I'd have been James Edward. Funnily enough I do have a great grandmother named Catherine, but me being named after her was accidental on my parents part. Skipped being a -something- Jean, thankfully, my cousin got that.

...your family's naming habits are actually hilarious, by the way. You just got to think about the common nicknames that commonly spawn off of Richard and Katherine, and associated words.

So there being multiple people named Tom coming to adopt a baby in 10+ years seems very likely. When you include the variations like Thomas who get called Tom, that number probably shoots up a lot since Tom would be hearing the many potential mothers to be saying things to the man using Tom as the name.
