If you haven't read [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/][Worm]] go read it now. As a brief synopsis, it is a superhero world in the vein of DC or Marvel comics, but with a lot more attention to realism. If Doomsday blows up a city... that's a lot of dead people. The setting is very grimdark, but the story itself follows a new superhero trying to make her way in the world and it is gripping to the point of insanity; it's about three times as long as the Lord of the Rings, and if you start reading you will not be able to stop until you are done.

If you /have/ read worm... do you know any good crossovers with Harry Potter?

For your consideration:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/riding-acromantulas-and-understanding-magical-biology-harry-potter-worm.315253/][Riding Acromantulas and understanding Magical Biology]] - Taylor Hebert and Amy Dallon are reincarnated into the HP universe. High jinks ensue. Yeah, tbh this one never really grabbed me, but I'm sure people would recommend it if I didn't put it out here.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/silly-villainy-worm-harry-potter.494224/][Silly Villany]] - Voldemort, in an effort to ensure horcrux integrity, banishes Harry to Brockton Bay. The boy Hero then proceeds to get on the wrong foot with the evil 'gang' currently living in their doom fortress in the middle of the bay. Though they call it the Protectorate HQ.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12472116/1/Taylor-Hebert-and-the-Army-of-Acromantula][Taylor Hebert and the Army of Acromantula]] - As the name suggests, Taylor is a few years ahead of Harry and just as insanely driven as always. Very short oneshot, but fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537837/1/Path-to-Victory-A-Severus-Snape-Story][Path to Victory]] - Snape triggers with PtV, the most insanely broken power in the history of fiction. Things start looking up for him, until he asks how many steps it would be to get Lily to love him like he loves her.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/salve-worm-hp.353642/][Salve]]- Bonesaw is summoned by Deatheaters. Exploring the magical world, she eventually gets the job as Hogwarts new DADA professor, beating out Quirrel. Cut crushingly short.

Anybody else got some recs? Preferably complete, of decent length, etc.


** Honestly? The highest quality one I've ever seen is the WIP linkffn(The Simurgh's Son by Darth Marrs), and isn't that just a little sad?

#+begin_quote
  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

****** Eh, I don't truly classify the Firebird trilogy as a harem trilogy, mostly (entirely) because it is about inverting the fanfiction view of harems as great things.

I honestly think he's done with the harem thing. Might still be down with writing new polyamorous relationships because of The Stars Alone, but since that was a sequel to an older fic of his, I'm not confident in that.

** In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][/Yer a Witch Taylor/, by Kevin Vacit]], Taylor triggers with a power of a Potterverse witch. Unfortunately, there is no Hogwarts for her to attend, so she has to figure it out herself. Probably abandoned, but what's written is very amusing.

I've also been thinking that the following could be a coherent prophecy, issued in the 1930s:

#+begin_quote
  Three legions come, seeking eternity, two to pass, one to stay: one a bride who slept through her wedding night, one a man seeking godhood, and one a god become man. Two shall gift power to those least fit to wield it, one to those most fit to take it. Two shall mark their bodies, one their mind. One shall take for themself, one shall give of themself, and one shall be sacrificed for the good of man. Three legions come, seeking eternity.
#+end_quote

Voldemort is a "legion" due to his split soul, who abandons his humanity, seeking to transcend it by living forever (on Earth); empowers Death Eaters, marking their bodies with the Dark Mark; all to take power for himself. Zion is a "legion" of semiautonomous shards, just passing through to gather information; a god (for all practical purposes) appearing as man, who empowers the least sane people through trigger events by distributing pieces of himself; and who alters the minds of parahumans to seek conflict. Eden is like Zion, but failed to initiate the cycle ("slept through her wedding night"); empowers Cauldron by being killed for the sake of humanity, shards distributed to empower heroes (mostly); with those heroes often left with physical deformities.

More generally, am I the only one who thinks that Taylor Hebert is a smart-girl sidekick archetype like Hermione and Sakura (from /Naruto/), but forced by circumstances to be the protagonist of her own story?

You know, I would agree with that. She isn't a very powerful main character, but she's different and I like that. I like the deviation from the normal "Boy who was nothing becomes the savior" trope.
