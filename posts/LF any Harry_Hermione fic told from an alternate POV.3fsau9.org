For example, through Ron or Ginny or an outsider's POV? I've always found those sorts of fics interesting. No length requirement.

**** Parker Gray is one of the best writers of H/Hr on livejournal. She has also written this same story from Harry's point of view but I can't seem to find it for the life of me. She did also write another Harry/Hermione story from Ron's point of view, second person. [[http://www.livejournal.com/users/parkergray/101620.html]]

Edit: Found it, [[http://parkergray.livejournal.com/251982.html#cutid1][Blue Spanish Sky]], which itself is a sequel to perhaps her magnum opus, [[http://parkergray.livejournal.com/216230.html][Heart-Shaped World]]

****** LiveJournal is kind of a mess with formatting, and it's not a site designed to let you find stories easily. In fact, most of its journals' entries are disabled from Google searches. That said, there are some [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=crack_broom][collections]] of stories compiled by users that you could check out. To navigate a specific journal like Parker's, there are tags on the side. If you're looking for stories, usually there'll be a tag along the lines of 'fic: potter' or something similar.

** Does it have to be Harry\Hermione, or just trio adventures will suffice?

--------------

edit:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]] (W: 190,399; Complete) --- The story's told from Greengrass' POV, who is Harry's girlfriend. It may need some re-writing for quality improvement though.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] (W: 194,707; Complete) --- the trio's adventures still happen, but the story's narrative is not focused on them. The POV follows the BWL's brother, whose reactions to the trio vary from unconcerned to hostile because of his background story and overall character interactions.
