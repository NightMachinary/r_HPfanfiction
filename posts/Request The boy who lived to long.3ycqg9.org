Does anyone have any suggestions that have to do with Harry not being able to die/age. But it doesn't have to be because he has all of the hollows.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** The think I tried reading the wizard from earth before but I couldn't get into it. The second one could be in treating but I'm not usually a fan of a female Harry. But I think I'll check it out. Thanks.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** In fanfics, immortal Harry is generally a result of soul bonds, instead of the Hallows.

In *The Accidental Bond* and *The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5604382; 5435295), Harry and his bond mates were basically immortal.

  Jaune only had a ghost of a chance of surviving Initiation. Thus, he didn't. A little dying is no reason to give up his life's dream of becoming a Hunter, right? Even if 'life' is now a bit late... (Warning: morbid comedy. Literally.)
