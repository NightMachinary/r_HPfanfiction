** The first time I saw this concept was in Lightning on the Wave's 7 part series. I have yet to find a series or fanfiction that goes as far in depth as they did for their Harry/Connor Potter series. The depth of Light and Dark Lords, and the frequent inadvertently mentioned differences between good and evil in J.K. Rowling's canon, and associating evil with dark magic, makes sense that there is such a thing as light magic and Lords as well.

** I think because he opposed Voldemort, who is a Dark Lord. People often confuse the two terms "not agreed with" and "go against".

To me he like a protector of the stability. He tried to make change in canon but make sure that those change would not knock down the precious peace he got.

** Because bad writers tend to use lazy simplifications. Same with making Dark Lord oft used descriptor when it was Voldemort's title.

** I don't know the first fic that did it, but it doesn't really seem like an idea that would have a specific progenitor. It's roots are probably traced back to other works of fiction. I've seen it attributed to Star Wars before, but I don't know the validity of that.

It's one of my least favorite tropes. Like, Voldemort is only a Dark Lord because that's why he styled himself as. Grindelwald was referred to as the Dark Wizard Grindelwald. Dark magic isn't even a branch of magic like Charms or Transfiguration, it's just a label.
