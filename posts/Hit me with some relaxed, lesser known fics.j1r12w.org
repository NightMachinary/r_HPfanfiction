Just looking for something enjoyable and new to read. Prefer something longer than 10k, but if it's good enough I'll read shorter stuff. Bonus points to bro-fics.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pranking of the Multiverse) - I recently read this and it's absolutely hilarious. And I'd recommend the writer's other fics too; you probably already know Albus and Harry's World Trip.

linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) - I know the writer is very well-known but I don't see this particular fic recced that often.

linkffn(Force Interrupt) - a oneshot collection with some really interesting ideas. The writer also has a lot of funny and/or thought-provoking short standalones that I would recommend.

  Harry Potter has achieved immense power, a large bit of craziness, and a desire to seek amusement where he can. This will be a series of stories of him traversing the multiverse solving problems through ways that amuse him. Various crossovers planned.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  In which canon scenes are interrupted, and matters progress... in an alternate manner. In this chapter: Sirius and Remus do a better job of making sure Pettigrew isn't going anywhere in a hurry.
