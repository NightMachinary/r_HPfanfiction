Well recently, I created a story that I like to think is unique. I have an outline that is large, and covers two years of school. I already started posting, and I have around 50k words. I honestly want feedback, that isn't just "This is great story bro." But at the same time, tell me something I did right please. That way I can keep elements I am successful with and move forward.

Here is the link. linkffn(12666080) Hope you all enjoy!


** I read the first 2 chapters. The Hermione-bashing killed it dead for me. Best of luck.

** Dumbledore actually helping Sirius was good, and your version of Karkaroff is actually likable, and reminds me a bit of his depiction in Lone Traveler: Cockups and Snorkacks.

*** Its actually a mixed idea. I got the idea of donning a mask from bleach, but I didn't like that it was basically a free powerup, and how it worked in the Bleach manga. So I made it a double edged sword.
