I don't know what flair to use, so bear with me. This fic is a crossover between Naruto and HP, and I don't remember much. I just got this link, and it doesn't work. I want to see if the Author has anything else interesting.

Here's the link, but be warned that it shows "Fic not Found".

*** Funny guy, that author - he used to be so active on a fanfic's Discord server that they kicked him eventually.

Ozzie is very talkative, so OP could message him if he wanted to.
