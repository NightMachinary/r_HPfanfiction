So, yeah. I read this a very long time ago but I remembered the basic premise of it. Harry was in a Master of Death situation and would be revived any time he died. Because of this and the bores of being immortal, he kept killing himself to scare a muggle neighbor. The neighbor thinks he's dead, but eventually sees Harry alive again. Harry does this enough to convince the man that he's not a child and eventually a weird friendship forms. Dunno what else, but if anyone knows about it, that'd be great!


** He kills himself enough that /they become friends???/ Naturally.

  Harry's lived a long life. A good life. He's ready to go, but like all bureaucracies, Death's a little behind on their paperwork. He'll be fine in a temporary storage track, right? AU Epilogue-compliant WARNINGS: ineffective suicide(s), light gore, swearing, off-kilter humor, sort of dark!Harry, sort of time travel

*** Thank you, it looks slightly different from usual stories, I haven't read completely but looks like a good read. It is a alternate world, though Harry didn't know it at first. As the death or whoever put it ' we put temporarily on a nearby track'
