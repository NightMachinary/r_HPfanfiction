Help me find a fanfiction please! The plot is about Harry trying to gain allies to a third side of the war so he recruits Luna, Neville, Blaise, and Draco through a deal. He then gives them each a muggle weapon except for neville who gets the sword of Gryffindor. He also gives them each a familiar while having one himself. He gets Blaise a dagger and Luna a short sword. They also have to fight death eaters and Harry uses Wingardium Leviosa as an attack spell to smash death eaters into a roof. Hope this is enough information! Thanks for the effort!

UPDATE!!! I have found the story! It's called Fallen by lessthanlucid. It's a great story and I suggest it to you all. (Note: there is slash.)


** Alright, I can't help you, but
