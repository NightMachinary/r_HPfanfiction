Think about it. Magic is what makes the Harry Potter universe unique and interesting, remove it and you're left with... What exactly? The characters aren't /that/ interesting to keep a fic together, and besides magic plays a *heavy* role in their character development, just picture Dumbledore for example, take away his magic and what are you left with? Just an eccentric, wise old man, that's not that interesting.


** You're left with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles][the LORD]], obviously.

*** That author to me seems like a massive troll with the way they're going about that summary and intro. I can't actually take their words seriously.

They also get a /lot/ of hate in the reviews though... And I mean serious hate.

**** Yeah, the way it's written, it doesn't seem entirely serious.

Even if it was, that would just make it funnier.

** It sounds like a matter of personal taste. I think Harry Potter /is/ much more than its magic, and its characters /are/ that interesting without magic. Magic is the world-building, the detail; it doesn't drive the themes or characterization. When I think of Dumbledore, I don't think of magic at all but a man shaped by his role in his sister's death and his infatuation with a supremacist. And that man becomes a strange, shrewd mentor.

The series has plenty to play with concerning racism, classism, corruption, traditionalism, fame, propaganda, and growing up during war.

** Because people like the characters, or the potential the characters have (take the basics of their personality then develop them more than they were in canon). They want to take the struggles they face (war, torn up families, murder, or just teen drama), and use them in a non magical fiction story.

A lot of the non magic AUs I've seen are rather short, and follow just a couple of characters. Those are just "I like this pairing but let's stick them in a coffee shop for giggles."

A few others I've seen, magic does exist, but not in the plot. The witch or wizard has to live in the Muggle world for some reason, or abandons/gives up magic, and they can be interesting. Especially if it's a character who has never had to live without magic, or has no experience in the Muggle world.

Someone like Dumbledore in a non magic AU may have been an influential politician whose political ties led to family tragedy, leading him to resign from his position and instead work something more local but still influential.

This story still features magic IMHO. They acknowledge that the character is a witch/wizard, they acknowledge that magic exists and the story features element of struggling with a loss of said magic.

Magic is still central to the plot.

**** I do agree, but I've seen them labeled by the author as non magic or partly non magic, so I thought it was worth mentioning.

** The only non-magic AU I follow is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]], where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training spies, handlers, interrogators, hackers, and other operatives for Britains tumultuous Intelligence Community. Old families, like the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", send their children there; but some common children get an invitation if they do something sufficiently interesting and vicious at a sufficiently young age. (Hermione gets in for solving the murder of her friend, then gaslighting the murderer into suicide, and almost getting away with it; Colin Creevy gets in for taking some pictures that he shouldn't have and certainly shouldn't have been able to...) Magic is replaced with skill and science, and, occasionally, with James Bond style superscience.

Watching the author come up with almost-feasible technological analogues to plot-critical magic is part of the fun.

** I think along with what the others have said, it saves writers a ton of world and character building by starting off in someone else's story, even if they get rid of the magic.

** While I personally do not like the concept, I can see why someone would. They have a better grasp on the real non-magic world then on the intricate and poorly defined magical Harry Potter world. Removing magic allows them to feel more comfortable with the subject matter and therefore the story comes out more organic.

** There was only one fic I liked like this and it was something to do with (I think) a parallel universe where magical Harry was sent and all his friends and family were non-magical. But magic was slowly returning or something? I can't remember the name of the story and I think it was abandoned, but it was alright for what it was.

** Sometimes, it's just a plot device to get 2 people together. For example, in Dramione stories, it is common for Draco/Hermione to be wiped of their memories and put in the muggle world, with Draco/Hermione watching them, and then they form romance...etc.

** Different people have different opinions. Other people might find the characters perfectly interesting on their own without magic.

Part of the reason I like reading fanfiction is that it's easy to get into. I like seeing characters I'm familiar with in new situations. This can include non-magical ones.
