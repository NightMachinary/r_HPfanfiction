Okay, back in high school I really loved this novel-length fic that takes place after the second wizarding war. Hermione goes back to the boat house after the battle of Hogwarts, and it turns out Snape isn't dead. Jump to Hermione as Snape's potions apprentice. Is this ringing any bells? I'm soooo curious to go back and see what I think of it now.

This would have been around '08/'09/'10 I think? I tended to read from mugglenet and fanfiction. Thanks!!!

*** I'm trying, but it was so long ago. It's possible she's eventually pregnant, though I might be confusing stories. I also think for some reason that they have an apothecary, rather than working at the school? Hermione is probably in her 20s when the fic takes place if I remember. I wish I had more details to give!

** I don't recall any boathouses. Do you mean the shrieking shack?

Does Snape lying in the hospital wing for a while in the beginning ring any bells? Was Neville an important character? Anything about weird dreams?

*** oh, you're right! I just re-watched the movie where Snape is attacked at the boathouse instead of the shrieking shack. I remember that Hermione goes back (perhaps to recover his body?) and then finds a pulse. I can't remember the hospital wing or dreams or Neville (though I'd be interested in reading those! I always love Neville!)

** If you could come up with more details, that would really help.

What you've given us is really generic and a very common premise for this pairing.
