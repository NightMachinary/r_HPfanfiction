Title


** I mean, I'm not going to call my own work 'good', but I'm currently working on a fic with an OC as its MC - linkffn(12327848) - I'm currently updating it at a chapter a week until the end of the year (that's the goal, anyway!) if it strikes your interest. Not sure why it places the last update in April - I updated it last week.

Beyond that, I really enjoyed linkffn(11280068) - a fiction which replaces Hermione Granger with an equally brilliant, but rather more morally flexible muggleborn. It's pretty excellent, as is its sequel.

#+begin_quote
  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

#+begin_quote
  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), of course! And some AUs arguably make "Harry Potter" into a completely different character, so if that goes (and it definitely should in some cases) then something like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) ought to qualify.
