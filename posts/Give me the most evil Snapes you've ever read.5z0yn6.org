***** It is a one time thing. I don't learn how to do it for 5 points, it's done to me for 5 points. I'd need to expend 30 points to learn how to obliviate.

Oh, shit. I have 69 points left now. Going to expend 17 points to remove the reference from my point history.

***** Huh. I'm not in Gryffindor.

Pottermore sorted me into Slytherin. Then again, the quiz is a heap of crap about your solar light preferences that doesn't actually try to quiz you on your personality.

** Linkffn(The Girl Who Loved) is over the top evil Snapr and Dumbledore. I think most of the evil Snape stuff might happen in the sequel, but Snape is basically conning Dumbledore into turning Harry into Lily and marrying them so Snape can spend the rest of his life raping Harry as teenage Lily.

*** That Dumbledore scene near the end of the first chapter has gotta be the funniest shit I've ever read.

#+begin_quote
  "He doesn't hate you Harry. Far from it in fact. I dare say that he sees some of your mother in you."

  'I dare say you are mentally handicapped.' Harry knelt forward and stared at the ground. He didn't want to open himself up to legilimency... if that is indeed what had clouded his mind just a minute before.

  "You see, Harry, I have taken it upon myself as your Magical Guardian to prepare a betrothal contract. It will be through marriage that you learn to love and finally bring Voldemort to heel."

  "Married! You picked my wife for me?" Through his shock, Harry briefly wondered which witch had been chosen by the Headmaster for this sacrifice. If it were Ginny or even Hermione then maybe this could work. Or Susan... even Luna... but wasn't dating and courtship and free will supposed to be part of marriage? This contract better not be for Pansy Parkinson.

  "Not quite, Harry. I believe Tom has been intimate with Mrs. Lestrange, perhaps with the wives of a few of his more loyal followers as well." The old man paused and scratched at his beard for a moment. "As the prophesy states, Harry, we are to employ the power he knows not meaning that love between a man and a woman may not qualify. You, Harry, are to bond with Severus. You shall take his name as the subordinate member of the union. We have been brewing a rare and rather remarkable potion which will allow you to bear an heir to the Snape line. Yes, I'm quite sure that Tom has done nothing remotely like this."

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

** linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chemprof) - one of a cornucopia of Harry Radcliffe/Hermione Watson true love fics, this one distinguishes itself by setting up the premise for why Hermione is explaining everything that happened to her and Harry during their school years. The true Snape-you-fucking-bastard moment comes almost at the end, so you can jump to read the last three or four chapters once you get the gist of it.
