I'm looking for longer stories where Snape dies or something (In/before prologue/chapt1) and transmigrates back to the past. I don't want him being worthless, no, give me badass powerful LORD SEVERUS SNAPE turned back to his start in Hogwarts (or turned back to Harry's start but the story is told from Snapes view, but thats not as good)...

Also willing to GLADLY accept other RE concepts such as Snape dying and then moving to an OC's body and then joining the trio, or past, with bonus points if original Snape is still a character and he has to debate himself (HAHA). OR Snape getting Reincarnated/Transmigrated to another world/story (I'm sure Snape in Naruto would be fun).

Extra Bonus Points if the story has LitRPG Game Elements.

PS: It's okay if Snapes not badass, but he shouldn't be weak, I mean he is strong, ya know!?

PSS: No NTR (poor Snape.)

PSSS: NO SLASH!!!!!!!


** This is a remarkably common le/ss plot. The only fic I know of without a le/ss endgame is linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds).

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

*** Common yes, which is why I ask. Simply too many to sort through and tell the good from the bad. But thank you for the rec.

**** If you don't mind SS re-do with focus on the LE/SS pairing, my personal favorite fic of that sort is linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). It also created my headcanon of alchemy.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** You may like Half-blood emperor, I can't say if it's abandoned or in hiatus. I liked it but kinda lost interest seeing he still liked Lilly and he would probably end up with her, to me that's creepy since he was like 50? maybe more before he wakes up in the past, I like the trope but I can't get into the whole ''I may be old af but I'm a kid now so it's fine if I like underage girls!''

*** Unless you are referring to something entirely different, the Half Blood Emperor fic I know of is a SS self-insertion, not a re-do.

**** you're right, I must have mixed them up with the whole ''half blood'' part, no idea what's the name of the one I was thinking of then.
