Flipping the cliche


** /NSFW./ and a little dark.

.....

In the darkness, her voice was a hymn.

Ron followed it, blindly. His hands had been tied, but the rope didn't chafe. It wouldn't have mattered if it did, though. Ron would do anything for her, anything she asked. Anything for his Hermione.

She was so kind, he thought with a goofy smile.

“Just a little bit further,” she giggled from up ahead. He sped up, trying to catch her, but tripped over the uneven stones on the ground, cursing under his breath.

“Shhh, language,” she whispered, suddenly near, her scent driving him mad. She steadied him with her hands. Her touch made him shiver; shiver and burn. “Careful. We've made it. You've done so good, Ron. So good. Now lie down.”

Lost in the dream of her presence, Ron did as he was told and felt cold hard stone prickle his skin. What was he doing here?

That thought quickly vanished when he felt someone's fingers pry up his blindfold. He blinked several times, his eyes adjusting to the light. When they did, he observed a small circular room, lit by copper braziers. The smoke from them hung low to the ground, fires casting shadows that cloaked the three people around him.

“Lu---Luna?” he asked the first one, confused.

“Hi, Ron,” she replied sweetly. But something in her tone made him shiver. It was...off. There was no whimsy, he realized. No dreamlike inflection. Without it, Luna seemed so different; an impostor. When he looked into her eyes, she stared back with a cruel and feverish hunger, like an addict who wanted her fix. Her smile was crooked. Unhinged.

And full of anticipation.

“You had to bind him?” he heard a voice from his right. He turned his head and blinked, becoming even more confused. Parkinson. What was she doing here?

“We all know what happened with the last potion you brewed,” Hermione shot back, and just like that, all his troubles went away. Ron melted into her voice like sugar into hot chocolate. She was here, with him. When she circled around, he saw that she had shrugged off her robes. Her skin glistened in flamelight, her hair a wild mess down her back. His gaze, however, was glued to the patch of curls between her thighs. He gulped, growing hard, hearing his heart pound in his ears. Hermione observed his reaction with a smirk that seemed so unlike the swotty know-it-all he'd befriended years ago in Hogwarts.

“Sweet, sweet, Ron,” she murmured lowly, trailing a finger up his thigh. Something silver glistened in her other hand, but Ron couldn't make out what it was. “You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you?” She didn't even bother masking the arrogance in her tone, but Ron didn't mind. He knew she was good.

In his peripheral vision, he saw Luna and Pansy disrobing as well, tossing their cloaks to the ground. He didn't glance at them, though. Why, when Hermione was here?

“Yes,” he rasped.

“Then kiss me,” she whispered into his ear.

Ron tried to lift his head, but couldn't. He had to wait, burning with desire, until she leaned down. She tasted like sunlight. She tasted so sweet...

She tasted like blood when her blade struck at his heart.

***** It's hard to defend Merope, but it's easy to point out that she was probably not a particularly sane human being, not just genetically. In our terms, she might be criminally incapable or, at the very least, a bleeding nutjob.

** "You bitch," Ron screamed, betrayed. "I actually liked you and then you had the gall to control me and for what? Because I didn't want to work in the ministry!"

Hermione started speaking, but Ron interrupted her.

"We are through. I felt used when Romilda did it, but with you... I'll make sure you get charged."

Ron left, his relationship shattered.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
