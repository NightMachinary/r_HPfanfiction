Harry is an Animagus and decides to live with other animals within the same species like [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=527&chapter=1][Dragon Child by Kirkmenistan]]

Should be a major plot. Please no Mentor!Snape and no Slash. does not have to be a dragon

** There is a Hinny story called Different Lives by moonstone88. AU, Lily, Sirius is alive. Harry can 'shift' and become a black panther, a form of Animagus. He and Lily have been in hiding while the Order finds the Horcruxes. He learns Ginny is a shifter too, a snow leopard. She is his mate and they bring down Voldemort. There is an incomplete sequel where they live in a type of compound with other shifters.
