** It's called 'Unspeakable Beauty'. Unfortunately, it was deleted from FFNet awhile back and there aren't many places to still find a copy - the best I've got is a 13 chapter thing from web archive. If you copy that FFNet URL thing from the link, it might be worth trying to put it through FF2Ebook.
