Recently, someone approached me with an idea for a story that they simply did not have time to write themselves. The idea isn't bad but could use a little work. My main sticking point was that they wanted Harry to be a girl. Personally, I am kind of on the edge of agreeing to write it since it is not entirely my own fic and I would not be in control, essentially. I think I will only agree if I feel very strongly about the perks of Harry being a girl. What do you think? Good, bad or otherwise, I would like to hear your opinions!


** I've read a couple girl!Harry fics, and I think that if done right it can be an interesting take. The thing to focus on, for me, would be what things would be different if that one thing were changed? People treat girls differently than they do boys, that's just a fact. And when people are treated differently, often times they behave differently. Also, while I don't think that gender makes a big difference in who you are, in intelligence or courage or skill or power or whatever, I do think that there are some biological differences between men and women that could make things interesting.

You could also treat it as a completely different character, instead of Harry-but-with-girl-bits. She could look different, have different motivations and character traits. As long as she doesn't veer to far in the extremes of Mary-Sue-dom or insufferable-twit-dom, it could be a great deal of fun to take canon events and see how a different character would have handled things, and what changes that would have in the story.

I also like the idea of Hermione being the closest friend, rather than Ron (I love Ron, but Hermione is way more awesome in my opinion). It's hard to find good Harry/Hermione FRIENDSHIP fics when you don't really like H/Hr shippiness, and having a girl Harry would make that a bit easier to develop, I think.

When it comes to fanfic, I'll read almost any pairing, any plot device, any cliche or trope or motif, as long as it's well-written, and some thought has gone into it. If you do decide to write it, be sure to post it here!

**** I just read the summary, and I can already tell you that I am definitely going to read this. Right up my alley. I love fics that develop a relationship between Snape and Harry, and I love fics wherein someone finds out about the Dursleys and actually reacts the way an adult is supposed to react when they see a child being abused.

**** Here are two girl!Harry fics that are pretty decent. Neither is complete, but I don't think they're abandoned, since both were updated in December.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War]] by astridfire. "Who says you can't fight evil and be pretty? A Girl!Harry AU, starting with Rose Potter's first year at Hogwarts." This is pretty good, but sometimes Rose got on my nerves. It's still worth checking out.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn. "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet." This is probably my favorite girl!Harry fic. Don't let the pairing squick you if that's not your thing -- nearly 400k words in, and they're still not together! I don't think the author is planning on that until well after Harriet is of age.

Are you telling me that "Harry being a girl" isn't actually the main focus at all, but just a throw-away? Because swapping the gender would be a pretty big deal if you ask me.

I think "What if Harry was a girl" (And for Merlin's sake, do give her an original name if you go that way) is already an enormous change with many repercussions.

- How did the Dursleys treat a female Harry? She can't have gotten Dudleys old clothes nor would he be able to hit a girl and get away with it like he did with Harry.

- Will she still be a Gryffindor? Or perhaps lean more towards Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw?

- Who will be her friends in the female dorm? Parvati? Lavender? Padma? Susan? Hannah? I highly doubt a girl would immediately be friends with Ron.

- How will Snape treat her if she doesn't look like James? What if she looked a lot like Lily instead?

- Will Draco bother picking on a girl like he did with Harry? Will she have another rival from Slytherin like Pansy or Daphne instead?

- Will she have the same talent for quidditch?

- Who will be her love-interest? (If you even dare suggest she might go with Draco, I will hunt you down and kill you)

- ...

This could be a very big and interesting fic all by itself. I don't think that adding more twists would help the story at all.

personally I suggest either doing a straightforward genderswap fic (which will be work enough) or to do the other idea without the genderswap. In my opinion if a story has too many wild deviations at the same time things get muddled up and confusing.

*** Wow, I hadn't even considered half of those points! What they proposed was that Sirius Black never lost his temper on Pettigrew and went to Azkaban. He was free and Harry(Isis, as a girl) lived with him and Remus. Then, Sirius would die and that is where the story would start, or at least from the details I have gathered from their messages in broken english (they speak spanish). I agree with you about having one or the other though, especially since this would be starting in the thick of things and I wouldn't be developing girl-Harry from first year.

I can tell you right now that chapter 2 would be titled "The Dursleys" if you kill of Sirius in chapter 1. There is no way in hell that Remus (especially as a werewolf) would be allowed to keep custody of Harry. With no other guardians Harry will go to his only family. The only twist here (depending on Harry's age) is that he's already aware of the magical world and who his parents were before Petunia can spread all those lies.

** Changing the main character of the Potter story into a girl? I have entirely too much to say about this to say anything about this succinctly.

That isn't your question, though. You want to know if writing this adopted/shared story as a Girl-Who-Lived story would make it better or worse for you. /It will make it more complicated./ The question left to answer is 'does making Harry a girl drive the plot?' If the main points of the story revolve around the hero's relationships in such a way that a boy wouldn't make the choices that move it forward, or a boy wouldn't elicit the right reactions, then the girl is good to go.

If the story concept doesn't really require the cultural baggage that girls get from being the fairer/weaker/matures-earlier sex and capable of procreating, why bother?

** I really haven't thought about Harry as a female.

The Harry/Snape dynamic would change. The instant hate was because Harry was a James clone, that won't happen with a girl. Not saying Snape will be nice (because he isn't, really), but it would be different. Perhaps totally ignoring Harry? Perhaps an earlier respect for the fact that Harry is not exactly like James?

Also, the Draco/Harry dynamic would possibly take different overtones. Aristocracy (as the Malfoys fancy themselves) have to keep some decorum when dealing with the ladies, after all. Perhaps Pansy and her minions would replace Draco/Crabbe/Goyle as the main schoolyard enemies, with Draco and his friends more in the background (though still jerks)?

I can't wrap my head around the concept entirely. The slight differences from canon would generally add up. There would be subtle differences everywhere - because every interaction would be at the very least subtly different (let's be honest: everyone treats a person differently according to their gender - we cannot help it).

** You're looking at it the wrong way. There are no "perks".

Having forced myself to read every fic in the Miss Potter C2 above 30k words, I fancy myself to be a connoisseur of fem!harry. I can safely say that the fics that employ fem!harry to achieve a specific end (pairing, plot bunny, whatever) are, as a rule with few exceptions, utter tripe.

The best fem!harry fics aren't good because they feature a fem!harry, they're good because they employ novel plots, interesting characters, and intriguing worlds.

No different from any other fic, really.
