So, the title sounds way more 'groovy baby' than I thought it would, but I read a fic recently called The Prisoner's Cipher (link at the bottom) that dealt with the concept of soul in a really fascinating way. I don't really wanna say too much to spoil for those who haven't read it, so the main body of this request will be in spoiler tags for those who want to go read the fic first. And I highly recommend it if you haven't, it's a fascinating look at the 'Evil!Mad!Harry' trope.

So, the main idea of the Prisoner's Cipher fic is that Harry tore a piece of his soul in half and, due to the dualistic nature of souls, went entirely chaotic and unbalanced - unable to control himself. It's a bit more extensive than that, but that's the general idea and the whole concept of fiddling about with your soul fucking with your mind and personality on a subtle, but all-consuming level really interested me. Essentially, I'm looking for more fics like that. Fics that deal with the soul and how playing with it can have personal consequences. I don't really mind if that consequence is just turning you into a monster a la canon Voldemort or something more complex. Either way could be fun. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D)

** linkffn(10629488) Blood Crest has an interesting theory of how souls and horcruxes work, but it's not a major part of the story. Most of it is in chapter 7.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Its not exactly what you're looking for, but A Second Chance at Life has a bit of soul magic in it, as well as some cool blood-magic and other types of magic systems.

I really love this fic and its sequel, but I understand why its not everyone's cup of tea.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

**** Its basically a 'Harry goes to another school to train' fic that gets a little out of control.

He finds a school which will teach him what he needs to know and trains in a whole bunch of magic that Hogwarts doesn't have, with a whole bunch of people/creatures that aren't in Hogwarts. Ie Vampires, fae, were-wolves, Demons, and a whole bunch more.

Its a pretty wide ranging story, but I really liked it.

If you read up until Harry gets to the school plus one or two chapters you will know by then whether you like it or not.

** This is one of mine that fits your brief - linkffn(11031294)

It's Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials where everyone has a daemon (an animal that is their soul). Tom Riddle appears as Harry's daemon.

Major spoilers below.

Dementors are people who have lost their own daemon and then devour another persons daemon. Harry ends up becoming half demented (ie he's monstrous/half decayed/wants to devour everyone souls) because Voldemort related plot. Also more soul interactions/effects along the way because of damage to ones soul.

Hope you enjoy.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
