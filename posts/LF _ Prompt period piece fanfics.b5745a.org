I was wondering if there are any pics where we see characters, OCs or canon, at significant events through time. I'm fine with oneshots or a forrest-gump like fic. I've already read Basilisk-born and A long journey home. Maybe some along the lines of purebloods sneaking into rock concerts, someone at the signing of the treaty of Versailles or someone working in Da Vinci's lab during the Renaissance.


** If you're ok with AU stuff/some somewhat NSFW content, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8628578/1/The-Lover][this one]] features 1890s Paris quite heavily
