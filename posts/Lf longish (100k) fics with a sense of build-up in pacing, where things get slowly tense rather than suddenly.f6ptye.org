** What I like about linkffn(13381792) is that Tom's 'becoming' into Voldemort is done very gradually, as a first/second year kid you can still very much see the (albeit sociopathic) still curious and somewhat naive boy in him

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** 300k+ it's a very dark and grim dimension hopping story, but the pacing is slow, with a lot of world and character building as Canon!Harry discovers why Mirror!Harry became evil and helps him. Things begin to speed up after chapter 33.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** linkffn(A Serpent's Gaze). I think it's also on ao3 if that's what you prefer. The story does a good job of raising the stakes as Harry gets older.

  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, assorted ships. Heavy violence. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no bashing - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, no manipulative!Dumbledore, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted to Ao3. POV between HP and SS.
