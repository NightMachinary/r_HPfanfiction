  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** linkffn(Blood Crest) is a very good fic generally with in-depth magical mechanics, including divination (though it's not a main focus, it is a major plot point later on in the fic) Still actively updated.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** I mean, in canon Divination is totally a thing, almost all the things that get predicted come true one way or another. It's just that it's insanely hard to correctly predict something useful.

In my headcanon here's how it works: A seer uses some kind of random pattern generator (crystal ball, tea leaves, tarot cards, ...) while also subconsciously casting a spell that probes the future and returns the information by dumping the data into the random pattern. Then the seer consciously reads the pattern and makes an educated guess on what the future looks like. Becoming better at Divination consists of two disciplines, controlling the subconscious magic better to direct it at the part of the future that you are interested in and becoming better at reading the resulting pattern and turning it into actually useful information. Since subconscious magic requires intent, if you don't believe that Divination is real you probably won't succeed in getting anything but a random mess.

*** This is misleading. Even in story, that is only accomplished by making tons of highly vague predictions, which McGonagall notes Trelawney does often. Outside of prophecying and maybe the borderline useless stuff the centaurs do, it appears to be bunk. Trelawney believes divination to work and yet she does the above all the time.

** Half remember a fic where Harry ventured into a dusty part of a library and found that divination was different than what trelawney taught them. Apparently, fortune telling was a small part of divination. In the AU, divination could

- Allow you to search for someone's presence, and find locations

- Allow you to see something going on somewhere else (Clairvoyance)

-Fortune telling and the future

-Dream interpretations

-Evesdropping

etc.

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.

** I don't know of any but it does seem kind of strange that one of the few classes that canon Hogwarts offers is considered a useless magical discipline by a majority of the staff. In a world where true prophecy exists even if it isn't foolproof, you'd expect that casting runes or bones, scrying, or any of the other long held forms of divination would actually be useful. It doesn't have to be like everything is set in stone prediction of the future either, most historical claims of divination didn't fall into that either, divining the present or the past should be part of the course as well, in addition to divining possibilities in the future.
