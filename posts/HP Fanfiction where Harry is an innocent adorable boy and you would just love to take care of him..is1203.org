To be honest, ive read world enough and time which is a victor/harry slash but i dont mind if its not even slash. I just wanna read harry being taken care off but not losing that he's harry potter/prophecies child/gryffindor, ect.

I just wanna see him cherished and all.

Harry is transported to Middle Earth as an elfling. Its funny and cute and heartwarming. There's some action and no romance. Updates take a while but is so worth it.

Definitely this one, the plot is that Harry sees Lucius's abusive behavior (the summer before 2nd year) towards Draco and does something about it, because he knows that "father's aren't supposed to act this way,". Super sweet, is drarry, and meets all of your requirements. Harry is for sure cherished in this one. It is also a series (incomplete) with 334,207 words and 5 works.

*** The same authors also have two more series. In the first, Pomfrey and Mcgonagall are a couple and adopt Harry after checking on him at the Dursley's. In the second, Harry went deaf from an ear infection and was sorted into Slytherin with Ton and Hermione.

** If you're looking for Happy!Harry, you can't go wrong with this one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] may sound like a tired premise (Snape mentors Harry), but the author's refusal to downplay characters' negative attributes make this interesting and fun to read. Also, it's complete!

This is less happy, but definitely falls under the "Harry is an innocent and adorable boy you just want to take care of" part. It's also complete and my absolute favorite series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]]. It's sad, sweet, and Harry grows up undeniably cherished. Definitely a must-read.

*** I kinda started reading it but i kinda stopped after reading the part where dumbledore took Harry's money for the order downplaying that most of Harry's possessions where gone because they needed it. I know its not a major part but thieving Dumbledore just doesn't sound right to me. He's headmaster for years with all thos awards and i doubt he even have the need to get Harry's money.

**** That's fair. As with all recommendations, your mileage may vary. I think the author had a pretty good explanation for that point.

1. I also wanted to write something different than the many super-rich Harry stories. While the books don't really answer the questions that Harry's assets or lack of them raise, I felt an explanation might be possible. My Dumbledore is not an evil person: however, his eye is always on the big picture, and he is so old that everyone else seems like a child to him, which is why he never tells people anything more than he thinks their tiny minds can handle.

2. the Dumbledore in this story is not a thief and sincerely believes (though he may be wrong) that the things he does are necessary to secure the greatest good for the greatest number. My greatest reservation about him is that he appears to believe that the ends justify the means. I think the historical record indicates that tainted means pretty much always produce a tainted result. However, it would be difficult to argue that the wizarding world has much regard for history, if the presentation of the subject at Hogwarts is any indication. I don't want to write an essay on how Dumbledore let the wizarding world down. I could, but we've heard it all before. Many of you were also pretty appalled at James and Lily's bad money management. Be careful about taking Snape's thoughts about them for gospel: he is not capable of putting any but the worst construction on anything James Potter ever did. To be completely fair, I believe that 1) they were rightly convinced that defeating Voldemort was the most important thing they could do. 2) There was no reason to be cheap, because if Voldemort won, it was the end of the British wizarding world. Better for Harry to be poor than a slave-or worse. 3) Once James had committed himself to supporting the war effort financially, it was impossible for him, young, proud, and under Dumbledore's influence as he was, to draw the line when the money started running low. 4) James, like many young people who grow up in wealth, had no idea what it would really mean to be poor. 5) Lily might have grasped the idea that they really could die. James, however, had not, and believed that after they defeated Voldemort they would be able to recoup their losses, either through work or making a deal with Celestina Warbeck to get the estate back.

Did you try the second story?
