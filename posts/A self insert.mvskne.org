I remember the person went to sleep and woke up as harry, ended up calling out hagrids name before he told him and lied that he was a seer, he gets this one special wand, changed the traps on the stone and added a few riddles, one was about Rowena Ravenclaw and I think another was about a horkrux, he showed hermione. Anyone recognise it?
