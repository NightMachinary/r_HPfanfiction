** The first one that comes to mind is linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig). It's interesting to start off with, but it migrates into some weird territory later on - and I'm not strictly talking about solar systems there.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

** linkffn(7395979) was the first thing that popped into mind, great longish oneshot.

Then there's linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) though that's not really about reaching the stars with magic, but does involve magic in space travel.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

** You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]]. Basically it's this plot where Ahsoka Tano is sent to Earth (in the Unknown Regions) by a plot device and spends the story raising Harry and introducing the world to higher technology.

Between the 'Jedi are better than wizards' stuff and some rambling in the plot, there's neat bits about employing magic to create neat stuff like teleportation doors, hovercraft, and the last part of the story involves the wizards piloting starfighters to stop an epic scheme by Lucius Malfoy, and the epilogue has them encountering the rest of the Star Wars universe.

It's not Harry Potter, but you might also be fascinated by, of all things, Dungeon Keeper Ami, currently stored on the Sufficient Velocity forums.

It's a story where Ami Mizuno from Sailor Moon ends up in the world of the Dungeon Keeper games, and ends up using the creative abilities of a Dungeon Heart with her own scientific knowledge to hold her own against the hordes of good and evil. It's very worldbuild-y and likes to have Ami come up with novel solutions for things, even if the first few chapters are...bleh.

The Clone Wars are fought by the Republic (the 'good guys') using clones, and the Separatists ('bad guys') using droids; at the end, the Republic is victorious by capturing or killing all of the Separatist leaders, but Darth Sidious then broadcasts a coded order that forces the clone troopers to exterminate the Jedi, clearing the way for Sidious to become Emperor of the galaxy.

***** Awesome, thanks. I know about the Star Wars universe, but not the animated series. I just didn't know if there was much in the series that was required knowledge to follow along. I've started reading it now, and I'm a few chapters in so far. Liking it so far. Thanks!
