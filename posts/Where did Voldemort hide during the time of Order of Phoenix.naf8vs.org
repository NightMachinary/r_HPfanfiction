I was writing a fic during the time of the Order of the Phoenix and I realized that I don't remember where Voldemort's hideout was. In Goblet of Fire, he was revived near the Riddle house, but it is more likely that he would have moved after Harry had escaped.

So my guess is that he just went to Malfoy Manor. And thinking about it, the ten fugitive death eaters wouldn't have much of a choice either, would they? But it must not have been too strange for Bellatrix since it is her sister's home. And although it's a crossover / parody, my idea is that there's a Room of Requirement (I mean, it's unclear if only Hogwarts has it) at Malfoy Manor to help hide them.

But what about the canon? Does anyone have any idea where Voldemort and the other Death Eaters might have been hiding?


** "You don't need my rent," Tom said, waving the stick in front of Benjamin's face.

"Look, Tom, I know times are tight, but I'm giving you an incredible deal on the unit. I can't keep having you push off the rent. It's due on the first. I need it," Benjamin said, moving the stick out of his face.

"No, you don't," Tom said, jabbing the stick at his adversary.

"I really do, Tom. I had to take a paycut at work and Betsy is still recovering from the surgery. And the doctors think that the cancer might come back and---" Benjamin sighed mid sentence and shook his head. "Look, I'm sorry. You're a good tenant. You don't need anything, you don't complain, you're quiet, no parties or anything. But I need the rent on time. I'm struggling to get food on the table. I might have to sell the place at this rate." Benjamin said. A twinge of something spread through Tom's stomach. Odd, he thought, he must have been hungry. He lowered his arm and frowned.

"I don't have it," Tom admitted, the words coming oddly slowly from his mouth. The other man sighed. He closed his eyes and took a long, shaky breath and nodded, a tear forming in his eye. But before he could speak, Tom interrupted.

"I'll have it to you first thing tomorrow morning," Tom said. The words burst from him with an odd sort of excitement. A primal truth in them that surprised even himself.

"Really?" Benjamin said, his eyes glistening, shock evident at the outburst.

"Yes," Tom said. He heard Betsy calling from downstairs, a cough interrupting her mid sentence. Benjamin pressed his lips together. He nodded his trust at Tom and turned and moved down the staircase toward the first floor apartment.

Tom closed and locked the door and stalked over toward the fire place. He threw some ash into it and it roared immediately to life. A confused face appearing in it.

"I need five hundred thousand galleons converted into muggle currency immediately," Tom spat.

"But my Lord," the man started.

"Now, Lucius," Tom spat and waved away the connection. Tom paced the apartment for ten minutes before he suddenly to one of the walls. He stared at it for a moment before disappearing. The cases reappeared first, three of them landing with a loud thunk.

Tom followed hours later, after the sun rose on the new day. He opened one of the cases and took out six of the crisp notes. After a moment he paused and added six more. He moved to the door of the apartment and down the stairs.

Minutes later Benjamin emerged on his way to work. He seemed surprised to see Tom but he greeted him with a smile. One that grew brighter when when the notes were exchanged.

"This is too much Tom," Benjamin said as he counted it out.

"I would rather not lose my hide---home. if you can get double. Double seems fair," Tom said. Benjamin stared at him for a moment and then hugged him. Tom froze. The gesture could have only lasted a second or two, but it was far too long. in moments, though, he was out the door and on his way to work.

Tom stood in the entryway for thirty seconds, unmoving, preparing his defenses in cases of another surprise assault. When none came he moved back up the stairs and took one of the cases. A wave of the stick caused it to be coated in plain brown paper. Another wave forged a note. A simple congratulations on winning the raffle for the C Survivors organization. Twine affixed the note to the briefcase as the name 'Elizabeth' appeared on the paper and Tom stalked downstairs.

He left the case at the door and turned to enter the hellscape that was Muggle London. He had two missions that day. First he'd have to deal with the boy. Another traitor in the Order of the Phoenix had revealed the location. He smiled at the thought. His magical bomb was ready, he could obliterate the headquarters and end any thought of opposition to his domination of the world.

After that was done he could figure out exactly who this Cancer was. And he could explore why it so relentlessly pursued little mousy Betsy who didn't have a mean bone in her body. Who'd made Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin cookies for the new tenant because she wasn't sure which he'd like more. And then muffins the next morning in case he hadn't liked the cookies, both blueberry and lemon poppyseed. The woman who insisted he have a drink with them on nights when he felt dour. The woman who always had a smile and a kind word, even if it was just teasing about how their hairstyle matched at the time.

He would stop whatever was stalking her. He knew that much. It would be brought to heel under his power. Perhaps he could convert it to his side and use it's relentlessness for his own gain.

No, he thought, that felt wrong. It didn't deserve to be associated with him. He would destroy it. He would use it as an example of what happened when anything crossed him. He would be so ruthless that in a thousand years they would still be afraid to speak of what he'd done to it. There would be no possible doubt of his aboslute victory.

His jaw set tight as he imagined destroying the mysterious foe. It excited him. It excited him more than anything had in recent memory. He approached the street he would need to turn down to kill the boy and paused.

After a few moments he continued on his way. After all, the Boy could wait.

** They probably had family of their own, the ministry was useless so even if they were hiding in plain sight they wouldn't be caught.

Bellatrix married a Lestrange so maybe she was with Rodolphus and Rabastan in another estate ? I don't remember the name of all the death eaterd but most of them came from pureblood families so they must have had a house or galleons to hide.

As for Voldemort, he for sure wasn't in the riddle house because Dumbledore managed to locate and get the gaunt ring and I think the Gaunt shack was like close ? Malfoy must have invited him to get in his good graces, he was leading the attack in the DoM, that means Voldemort trusted him at the time. And Lucius is too arrogant to let the common death eaters live in the Manor. So I just assumed that Voldemort took over the manor and transformed it to headquarters after the Dom fiasco.

Yes, they probably didn't even bother to check. And maybe I'm confused by something, but doesn't that apply to Grimmauld Place?\\
I mean, the Ministry threw a bunch of dementors on a school grounds while hunting for Sirius Black (he wasn't a death eater, but the Ministry didn't know that), but can't they constantly check Grimmauld Place? Or maybe this is how Kingsley justifies spending time there since he is responsible for going after Sirius?

Well, it is easy to imagine that Bellatrix could have stayed at the Malfoys' house for some time, but it is true that the Lestrange exist. In fact, Randolph and his brother receive so little attention that it's strange to think that they could have their own hiding place or something.

Yes Kingsley was in charge of looking for Sirius so he made up a lie or something, and in 5th book Grimmauld Place was under the fidelitus so they wouldn't know to look there anyway. Plus it was implied that the Black family used really strong magic to hide the house, I wouldn't be surprised if even the ministry didn't know where it was located or that it existed.

** Apart from the riddle house, a hideout was never named for voldemort. He could be holing up literally anywhere

** As another comment says, Dumbledore was poking around Little Hangleton in book 5, so he couldn't have been there. I feel it is also unlikely that he was at Malfoy manor, because I always imagined the Malfoys as social heavyweights, which would probably have involved various people visiting their home and probably hosting full on functions, and having a house full of escaped fugitives may have made that difficult. Given how small a lot of supposedly 'great' wizarding families are, there are probably a whole bunch of abandoned magical properties lying around whose occupiers died off (like Bellatrix's parents house, or the houses of their various victims)
