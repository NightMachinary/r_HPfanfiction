There are plenty of stories where we see Harry get into a situation, and end up in a new universe where he procedes to cause all sorts of chaos, and save all the damsels.

I'm looking for a story where severus snape gets into a situation where he ends up in a different universe and does his usal snape thing, solving the issues with his cruel remarks and twisted spy mind.

linkffn(happiness is a broken wand by embracing madness) was pretty good, we didn't see much of snapes cutting humour, but we got plenty of his crafty spy mind doing crafty spy things. Unfortunately, this fic is dead, and I can't get over the part where nobody thought that a snape going to other places could be a really interesting read, regardless. Snape as itachi? Snape out thinking Alexandria in worm? Snape going back in time and thinking things through and stopping voldemort before he can do more than graduate?

Mostly, i want to see snape being mean and out thinking people and fixing stuff, rather than harry being nice and running into each new problem and fixing stuff.


** There is a Naruto crossover where Snape is reincarnated as Sasuke. Unfortunately dead though.

  Itachi played the villain and traitor to both his clan and village. But what would happen if he met someone who had walked a similar path? And what would happen to his plans if his brother didn't want to kill him? Drabble-fic. Sasuke discovers he is the reincarnation of Snape.

** Only crossover I can remember reading with Snape is Worm. He gets Path to Victory. A power that shows you how to get what you want, no matter the obstacles, and is so so very overpowered.

  Severus Snape just wants a new, peaceful life in Middle Earth, but with a vicious war arising and a new Dark Lord gunning for him, he'll have to fight to get that wish. Magic and battles, familiars and friends. Slytherinesque cunning shall always prevail.
