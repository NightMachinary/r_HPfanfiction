Basic searches have failed to turn up any easy list of in-universe resources for teachers and students attending Hogwarts, though I imagine there must be a database hiding out there on the internet somewhere. I simply have been unable to locate it.

Failing that, any individual textbooks (or just books in general) that are available for general fic-writing use would be appreciated. I've come up with a few of my own, but it's not as easy as I'd have guessed. :)

EDIT: Though I do appreciate the list of canon books, I'm specifically looking for books made up by fellow fanfiction authors (sorry for any confusion)

** If you dig online (or if you have the books at hand) through the first few chapters of each book you should be able to find most books. This should be fairly easy. Digging through book 1's scene for when Hermione figures out Flamel gives you another book. Scenes where they are in the library should help, especially if they are rummaging through the restricted section if you want books for more dark or high level courses.

** I trust the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/list/books/][HP Lexicon]].

I've only added a few in my own stories, like Underground Potions Quarterly, Craft of the Medicis, Why Witches Should Wait by Elfrida Tillinger, Parsing Parseltongue by John Gaunt, & an unnamed journal about memory and mind magic by Perenelle Flamel which also happens to be a portable Pensieve... if you know how to rearrange the tiles on the front.

**** Oh, I should mention: Underground Potions Quarterly is published once every twenty-five years (quarter of a century, you see), and up until recently the managing editor was Nicholas Flamel. The Wolvesbane potion was the highlight of the 1975 edition.

** Are you looking for one of titles and authors? Or books that are more filled out?

Off the top of my head I can't think of any specific books from fics I've read, though there must have been quite a few occlumency manuals I've seen.

Personally, I haven't found much difficulty tossing out random titles and eccentric author names (a healthy mix of alliteration and names that have significance to the subject does well to replicate Rowling as long as you don't go overboard.) Cayleb Carroway, Ariadne Ackleton, etc.

**** In that case i have a couple of throwaway titles I've used-

Draughts and Drafts to Dull the Senses" by Korryn Klairmont

"Everyday Potions for the Hassled Housewitch" by Ariadne Ackleton

"A History of Potioneering Volume 1: An Art and a Science" by Cayleb Carroway

This is one that actually plays a role in the fic I'm writing-

"Essential Skills and Strategies for the Beginning Potioneer"

And then I'm in the process of writing two faux scholarly articles/essays about the History of The Magical Methodologies of the World and Greco-Roman wizarding history. Neither of which are close to being ready to post though.
