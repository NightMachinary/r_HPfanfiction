** Why don't you just edit the question one more time or provide a link to the thread you made? I mean, come on... if you want our help don't make us search for the bloody thing. Thats just abysmal internet etiquette.

But anyway... If you need a reason to join the Separatists then I can only think of two things.

The first reason I could think of is simply that the Separatists wanted an out from the excessive taxation for, and corruption of the Galactic Senate and the Chancellor. Since the unfair and smothering treatment of some systems by the Senate was a fact, Harry may be sympathetic to their cause. Furthermore, if he took control of the Separatists then he would be in a prime position to end the control of the Sith over the Confederacy by exposing Count Dooku and his agents.

The second reason I could think of is that he would support the Separatists as a Sith - much like Count Dooku. Deaths reasoning here could be along the lines of "establishing balance" by destroying the bloated Jedi-Temple and their influence over the galaxy. But this is a point of discussion anyway. Are the Jedis Balance incarnate, or are they the "light" side and therefore destroying balance by eliminating the dark side? But I leave the in-universe philosophy to you.

Also, just as a sidenote, I'd be kind of disappointed if this doesn't become a Harry x Asajj Ventress
