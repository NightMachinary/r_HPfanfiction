I am looking for Harry- or Hermione-centric stories where Cho plays a larger role, preferably as the love interest, but I take anything from adoptive sister up to time-travelling mother substitute or wingman in a Vegas Casino.

When it comes to fanfiction, there are just 1500 stories with Cho (over 1k words) and only 150 completed ones over 5k words length. Less than 80 have both her and Harry. If you discount smut and porn with a thin plot, there is not a whole lot to choose from. So are there any hidden gems, stories without character tags, stuff like that? I'd even take harem stories if the characters are somewhat believable and not just arm candy/sex toys.

So far the only decent Cho story I have found is "Headman's Hostage", a 5th year summer holiday AU (and a Vegas Wedding oneshot, but that one falls under erotic comedy and does not really have a lot of plot). But there has to be more, right? Right...?

** Would you settle for a character study of sorts? It's not very long, but this is the best Cho story I've read - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1854957][Overemotional: In Defense of Cho Chang]]

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.

Pretty "Vegas trope-y" but entertaining nonetheless. Just don't expect a grand romance.

** [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] is my go-to Cho story. It's post-GoF, framed!Harry that goes to Azkaban story with no bashing. There's also a completed sequel. Very good action scenes.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/][Horst Pollman]] also has a long H/Cho series (2 million+ words) on schnoogle. The plot is completely original after GoF and the writing style is a bit strange - some love it, some hate it. I personally love it.

**** Gar auto correct. Sorry it was 'Harry as a house-husband'. Just looked it up. Was a year ago. Got a ton of upvotes but only two recs. One was a short oneshot reced by you and the other was the Harry/Cho monster linked above.

Sorry about delay, sent that off and got on an airplane :)

***** Well, I remember the house husband thing. IIRC my rec was short and sweet but had an author-opinion-insert in the last paragraph where they ranted about men wanting sex while she is on the period (and that Harry was a good husband for not doing so).

I was just confused if I had forgotten about some house sitting agreement where I was supposed to go to next.

** A classic C.C. biofic, mostly canon compliant, as I recall (it's been years since I read it). The original story takes her to her fifth year (Harry's 4th, i.e., GoF). There are sequels for her years 6 and 7.

... and if I may be so bold as to pimp my own: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/jacynthe/TSS.html][The Silver Swan]]

(not the only fic by that title, sadly). Femslash Cho/Ginny but most definitely not porn.
