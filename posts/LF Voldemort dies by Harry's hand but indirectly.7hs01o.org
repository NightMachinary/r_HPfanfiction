Looking for fics where Harry kills Voldemort indirectly. Something like Harry opens a door and it knocks over a death eater who falls over a railing and hits voldemort who then pitches into a vat of acid or something like that. Anything where Harry starts the chain of events that kills Voldemort. Bonus points if its by accident.


** Canon? Harry only reflected his own killing curse back to him.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** There was this one where Harry duels Voldemort, completely fails and Voldemort just lets him throw spells at him because Harry's just so terrible, but then Harry's spell accidentally hits a large rock up the hill, which rolls down and crushes Voldemort.

I can't find it.
