I'm currently reading a story that features Harry annoying a lot of ministry workers and I've recently read a story with a competent ministry. I'm looking for any other interesting ministry stories. They can feature the ideas from above but don't have to.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Manipulative Harry uses Daphne to advance his career and agenda

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492): Political struggle continues after Voldemort's defeat, and Neville doesn't like what he's seeing

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): Lots of scenes about Head Auror Harry Potter's work and his team

*** To add to Strangers, The author has written lots of smaller stories in that universe, that show Harry, and his team's work more directly. Though I love Strangers.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** My link below. While it is primarily a Snarity fic, it started as an exploration into what would happen if Hogwarts were audited against an International Standards Committee called The International Standard for Wizarding & Magical Excellence, which is based on my personal experience from doing something similar in my work. I've done a lot of work for government, so I get bureaucracy. It doesn't paint the MoM as particularly good or evil, but as an agency with a job to do. Set in 1993 so under Cornelius Fudge.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13210806/1/The-Uneven-Orbit]]

Its 1993, SS and Charity Burbage are unlikely collaborators on a project to defend Hogwarts from the prying eyes of the MoM. Try as they might to keep cool heads, Snape and Muggle-born Charity fall in love but their fate is doomed by her past and his future. In a desperate effort to save them, Snape takes drastic action. - Set against PoA, SS POV, Canon respectful, complete.
