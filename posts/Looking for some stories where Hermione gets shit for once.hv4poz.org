Seriously it's almost always Ginny or Ron that are the bad ones in fanfiction it would be nice to read some stories where Hemione is the bad one for a change,I mean she's not perfect. I know a lot of people like her and that's cool everyone is different. But she's always annoyed me a bit in the books and a lot in fanfiction because in fanfiction it seems like she's always written like she can do no wrong.

â€‹

Thanks for your help.


** /Cracks Knuckles/

You've come to the right place! (Disclaimer: Some are Ron-centric and some might not be favourable to Harry either.)

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) one-sided job interview. A bit unrealistic but then again so are most bash fics. ðŸ¤·

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Ginny bashing.

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

+linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/]])+ has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. Should be linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to Hermione about her long essays and tells her to cut them down. Hermione ignores her.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack. Borders on bashing at times. Alternating POVs.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry at times).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be. One-shot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) Hermione un-Obliviates her parents. They only pretend to take it well.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not.

"In Loco Parentis" by Dolores_Crane linkao3(109558) isn't really critical but it does something interesting with a Hermione POV and gives her some character growth.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** It depends on what you're looking for... Say, Indy!Harry fics tend to be an even split between Hermione becoming Harry's arm candy and Hermione turning out to have been Dumbledore's spy and getting her just desserts. Are you looking for something like the latter (inept villainy followed by humiliation) or something like the former (submissiveness and loss of personality)?

Non-Harmonian Smart!Harry fics (particularly Fem!Harry fics) tend to go out of their way to show off how much smarter and more creative (and better in every other way) their lead is than Hermione; I can't think of any titles off the top of my head, but it suggests some keywords to search for.

Off the top of my head, that fic, /They Shook Hands/ by Diethryl (or something like that), where Harry follows Draco into Slytherin treats Hermione like crap: Draco and Harry bully her for a while, then she gets killed by the Basilisk.

I personally haven't read it, since I don't like that, but I've got the author mentally pegged as "Hermione basher; do not read".

That said the premises of the stories seem decently interesting and I didn't have issues with the small amount of the stories I read.
