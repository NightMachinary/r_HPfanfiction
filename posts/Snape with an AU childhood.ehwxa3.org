Looking for fics that have Snape raised by someone else or is somehow removed from his bad childhood. The only one I know of is ffnlink (The Point of No Return by Whydoyouneedtoknow) and it is not the main point of the fic. Are there any out there?

Thanks!


** Oh! I love this one by [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/601664][Paganaidd]], about Snape being reincarnated and raised by Harry and Ginny. It is beautiful.

perhaps it's not really what you're seeking but it's a timetravel story and Snape eventually moves in with the Evanses.
