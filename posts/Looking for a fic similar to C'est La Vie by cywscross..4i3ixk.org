I'm looking for something with a similar premise to C'est La Vie. So ideally it would be a 'redo' were Harry doesn't have to face Voldemort because he's no longer the boy who lived, though he might choose too. Harry is considered a prodigy and generally just does what he wants. He makes friends with people from all houses and generally shakes things up. I want to avoid Arsehole!Harry or Evil!Dumbledore too.


** These are in order of what fits the best, and some the fic descriptions I might have reused from a previous request.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn) It's on Hiatus, but the two people who wrote it says they will return. But still a good alternative, heavily inspired by C'est la Vie, but still has some really unique and interesting premises.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived by SilverAegis) isn't really that impressive or long, also abandoned. But it sparked a following of fanfictions to his fanfiction, severeal that will be on this list.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet) Is the complete spinoff of the previously mentioned original fanfiction. I think it's the only finished on this entire list... If you are going to read a SilverAegis spinoff, read this one.

linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) is one you'll either hate or tolorate, reverse SilverAegis. I found it somewhat acceptable, even though I cared little for the slash in the later chapters, ongoing.

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel by Private Jenkins) is really short and abandoned, but is was still worth the read in my opinion.

And these are honourable mentions, but don't quite fit your request on all points.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The New Life by smaster28) is another SilverAegis spinoff. Though the original it was based off was erased from SilverAegis's account. (I think he erased it willingly)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the New Lives by Steve2) Is a worse ripoff of SilverAegis's erased story, though the first several chapers is 90% copy paste of the orginal, so if you want the original that Silver abandoned, just read this until the writing quality takes a deep dive.

linkffn(New Life and New Battles by krytos) is yet another SilverAegis spinoff, I can't really remember so much about it, they all tend to mix with each other at this point.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
