Hey y'all, I'm looking for one specific fanfic on ff.net. I believe it was based off the challenge that inspired Tempest of the Fae.

In this fic, Harry, Hermione, and Luna are all time travelers and are in a relationship together. They go on many weird trips, and I believe Alice from Wonderland somehow meets with Queen Elizabeth. It's very much a crack based fic.

Other important details: Dumbledore is completely evil and made 13 horcruxes. At one point in the story, there were 3 Dumbles running around trying to stir up trouble.

There were a group of dryads/nymphs that somehow went back in time and put a golden acorn on NASA missions, along with saving Harry's parents. I remember simulacrums being part of it somehow.

I think the main trio were either all Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. Can't remember which.

Hannah and Susan played pretty big roles in the story too. Can't remember if they were paired with Harry or Neville though.

The fae were actually a big part of the story. Harry and the others actually became Faeries in it. Somehow this led to Harry having multiple personalities based off the belief aspect because he is the BWL. I remember there being a scene where all the girls put him back together from flowers in Wonderland.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
