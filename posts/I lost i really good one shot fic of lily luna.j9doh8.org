So i remember that it was about the relationship of lily luna and ron, lily is like a genius child so all the adults try to come up with stuff so she can concentrate (bcs she talks a lot) and chess ends up being what she likes so ron and her are always playing throughout her life


** I believe this is /Pawn to C3./

Delightfully sweet.

And virtually everything this author does is superb.

  Teaching Lily chess started as a way to keep her occupied and out of everyone's hair. It grew into much more than that.
