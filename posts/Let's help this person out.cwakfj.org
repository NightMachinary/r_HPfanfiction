** I'm currently reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6237706][The Brightest Black]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Enigmaticrose4/pseuds/Enigmaticrose4][Enigmaticrose4]] on AO3. At one point Hermione takes the diary from Ginny and Tom requests that she give it back to Ginny, because he is under the impression she (Hermione) is a good pure blood witch. Malfoy is surprised when he finds out she dealt with it but he doesn't want her to die. In fact, the fic pairing is Draco/Hermione. It's not a perfect fit but it might be it.
