Been sitting on a fic for ~5 years, finally feeling ready to polish and publish it... but all my knowledge of the HPFF community feels super outdated, and I want to be wise in my approach.

So! Looking for some help deciding; 1. Best website to publish? (Do people still cross-publish to multiple websites?) 2. Is tumblr still the best place to host an authors page? I've seen a lot more curiouscat author pages but I'm not a huge fan of that site in general. 3. Anything else I'm missing?

Some context that may or may not prove important in your responses: I'm a professional writer and have previously published ff under different fandoms. It took this long to develop because the plot revolves around (TW!) PTSD in a post-war setting --- a subject I have yet to see fully realized for my pairing

Thanks in advance for your kind help!

In the HP fandom, it appears that the /majority/ of writers cross-publish onto exactly two sites: fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org. Realistically, I think that these two sites are the only two that you need to cultivate a decent readership.

I'm not entirely sure as I don't use tumblr, but it appears that a lot of authors to have tumblrs linked into their FFN/AO3 bios. However, it isn't /necessary/ to have an authors page by any means -- plenty of established authors merely go by their FFN/AO3 profiles.

I don't think so, but here are two points (which you may already be well aware of) which I'd like to mention to your benefit. Firstly, it is important that you actually tag the characters involved in your fic -- a surprising amount of stories on FFN neglect to tag their characters, and consequently, they fall short on gaining a readership. Secondly, you should serially release your chapters with a semi-consistent upload schedule.

** The majority of Harry Potter fanfiction resides on either AO3 or FFnet, with especially older gems being only found on FFnet.

I recently started posting my own ongoing HP fanfic on AO3 only.

I often see authors list either (or both) their Tumblr or Twitter. The author for Prince of Slytherin uses a Discord server, but I haven't seen anyone else do that. I don't use any sort of author page myself, though. I only really use Reddit and AO3.

If you choose to post on AO3, since it sounds you've already completed your fic(?), it'd be a good idea to set how many chapters it's going to be, so you'd get chapter 1/20 for example. That generally communicates to people to expect regular updates.

*** Can I ask how you're using reddit to promote or community build around your fic? This is so helpful

**** Well, the broader [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub have fic showcases for self promotion. It also never hurts to get a bit of a name going for yourself in discussions and such, I suppose. :) And I've occasionally seen people suggest their own fics on this sub when it matches a request for recommendations within a certain criteria.

I have yet to muster up the courage to participate in those self promotional threads myself, but from a reader's perspective they're also a great way to discover new fics. For example, I rely purely on this sub to find HP fics that are exclusively on FFnet. But sometimes something on AO3 pops up that sounds interesting to me as well.

Another aspect would be reading people's thoughts and ideas in the threads. Those can make me really want to read what they've written. It could be that they showed excerpts as an example to help someone else, or that they debate on a less common viewpoint and how they enjoy exploring that in their own fanfic. It can really get me hooked and excited to see what they do with it.

Lastly, I listed my Reddit on my AO3 profile just in case anyone wanted to contact me via other means than the comment system. Just in case, you know? It hasn't happened yet, so I guess it's not really important, though. I guess I just liked to list an alternative in the light of all those other social media accounts, heh.

** I would advocate for publishing to ao3 and ff.net. One of the best (and most controversial) parts of ao3 is its tagging system. It's more robust than that of ffn.net, and I prefer when authors use its functionality to tag the general themes of their stories. Going overboard with tags can be obnoxious for some people (i.e. no sentences as tags), but simple things like the main pairing, warnings of major character death, and genre are helpful. So, for yours, if it's a post-war fic, then that would probably be a good tag, as would PTSD.

** Tumblr isn't that great any more. I mostly follow by FFN/AO3 profiles. I'd recommend doing both AO3 and FFN. AO3 lets you put in images which is nice.

** I cross publish to FFN and AO3 like most other people have said here. It doesn't take any different formatting, provided you upload to FFN first then do AO3. I don't have a Tumblr page for my author page. I personally think AO3 is the better site for reading, but I FFN is the better fic mostly for writing, AO3 has a better tagging and search system though which makes it better overall IMO.\\
I love reading fics about as much as I love writing them, so for me, I'm not too focused on getting other people to see my fics. They'll find it if they're looking for that type of fic. Sometimes if a person asks for a recommendation on Reddit I'll throw mine in with a couple of others if it fits their requirements otherwise I don't do much promotion.
