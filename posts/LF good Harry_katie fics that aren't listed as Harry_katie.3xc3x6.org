*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7241901/1/Partners-In-Crime][Partners in crime]] is one of my favorites with this pairing but i'm a big fan of katie and think is a shame that there are so few harry/griffindor chaser pairings and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045149/1/Hells-Bells][hells bells]] was quite good if i remember correctly

#+begin_quote
  Katie and Harry make a professional Quidditch team, but after having bad relationships, decide to avoid it all together by putting on a show and making everyone think they're together. But will stay a show? Rated T, might change later.
