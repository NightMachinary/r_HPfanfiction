After reading the plot for Cursed Child, I had this original character in mind that I wanted to write a fic about, but I wasn't sure if I even should since I'm not sure people care for OCs. It is fan fiction after all and readers seem to prefer reading about already established characters. What do you guys think?


** Honestly, I'm more interested in a good, well written story. If an OC is part of the story, or even the main character, I'm fine as long as it meets the above criteria.

Also, as a side note, write whatever you want to read and/or what's enjoyable for you to write. If other people are also into it, bonus.

*** That's an interesting point you made. I planned this character to be the other child of Voldemort, who unlike Delphini is trying their best to resist their evil heritage. Since the character's parents are extremely powerful it would be easy to make that mistake you mentioned, so I would have to make sure to write the character with enough flaws that they seem realistic.

** I'll say original characters have a higher bar for people to like it. You'll get tons of fans of even a low-effort Harry In Name Only, but with OCs, people will likely either be mean or not read it if the story is bad. That said, if the story is at least decent, the response should be fine, and I've read plenty of excellent stories with good OCs, including what I'd consider the absolute best fanfics. (Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Grow Young With Me, and others)

** frombluetored's Its TeaTime series has some great OC's that i have come to love; they are the Potter kids friends at Hogwarts and in the 3rd story in the series, Harry's kids are married with kids of their own. Also Annerb's The Changeling series has some great OC's too, and a shout out to jenorama's Potterverse, particularly Ginny's gay best friend, Ben. All great, well written stories, loving these OC's are a bonus!

** The problem with OCs is that they are hard to write. It is not easy to imagine a character out of nothing while also making it fit with the rest of the pre-established world. So, many people fail at that task, creating OCs that don't feel like actual humans, they feel forced and inserted into a story for the sake of it.

I saw in a comment of yours that you want to create a different child of Voldemort, one that "unlike Delphini is trying their best to resist their evil heritage". Now, I don't care much for the Cursed Child (and to be honest, I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist) but if you intend for your fic to take place during CC, I'll have to warn you that, like me, a lot of people don't like the Cursed Child and will stay away off any fanfiction with it.

Also, keep in mind that Delphini is nothing but the product of her upbringing. It doesn't matter that she is the daughter of Tom Riddle, she only did what she though was best for herself. You need to think hard about how exactly you are going to have an opposite to her. I would give a few suggestions but I don't want to dictate your story, it is your vision.

(Though try to not overdo it with the weaknesses. If you want a powerful character, aim for weaknesses that relate more to phycological effects, eg: large ego, arogance, overdependence on self, emotionally unstable. Have those mental weaknesses aswell as lack of training hold him/her back on the fighting end. Don't give the OC random battle weaknesses [without the mental ones at least], IMO that's a cheap way of balancing power)

I would like you to keep in mind, that a realistic character is never pure evil, is never evil from birth and will always think that they are doing the right thing. No one truly thinks of themselves as the bad guy.

*** Very helpful points. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write this, and I'd be open to more suggestions of course. It does seem that many people hate CC and I kind of do too because of how it leaves so many questions unanswered as to how the wizarding world has been since Voldemort was defeated. I've given it some thought and think that maybe if the OC wasn't another child of Voldemort, but one of the many children of still loyal death eaters who have been raised to be evil (sort of like home-grown and raised terrorists). That way there could be like a cabal of children raised to be weapons against the Ministry, and one would break away and try to be good.

** I don't mind OCs as long as they play a proper role and have good characterisation, as long as they are interesting. In one of my fics I even have 3 OCs who are a constant presence and play a major part in my MC's life. I am not saying I am a professional when it comes to the characterisation of OCs, but so far there was no complaint, some even outright stated they like the relationship my MC has with them. So, I assume that generally scepticism towards OCs exists but for the most part, if they are interesting enough and are more than the writer's fantasy fulfilment, people won't mind reading about them.

** Not really. After all, most mildly divergent stories employ named characters from HP that are functionally OCs with how little is actually known.

Whats really a problem is when people create /pointless/ OCs, which is just a function of a larger problem endemic to fanfiction as a whole. They often serve very obvious purposes that could be filled more easily by existing characters, or are so 1-dimensional you couldn't draw a point small enough with a pencil.

Basically, OCs are only a problem if the writing/story is lower-quality, in which case I wouldn't be reading anyway. Case-in-point, the Alexandra Quick series is more or less entirely OCs and is still entertaining because its fairly well written and different.

** Some people do, some people don't - really, the extra jump you need to make for an OC is to have a reason for having them (in most peoples mind).

For instance, if you wrote out Harry and instead had an OC named John who was the Boy-Who-Lived, functionally there's no reason to have that OC - he just fills the role of Harry, and people would wonder why you don't just have it be Harry.

For other wizards, most people find it easier (and more accepted) to wrap their OC in the cloak of one of the myriad of basically faceless background characters. For instance, if you're writing a story with an OC Good Slytherin love interest for Harry, it's much easier to just slide in Daphne Greengrass or Tracey Davis into that role, most of the time. It's the exact same effect in essentially being an OC - just with a veneer of canon over the top of it.

I would imagine an OC works best if you pick a time period we don't know as much about. For instance, setting it during the main series makes it harder to justify an OC over changing an existing character - but if you do it before/after, there are fewer ones you can snag and so you're more free to slide in an OC more seemlessly.

With that in mind, what's the OC you've got in mind, and what's the high level idea?

*** Well I wouldn't say it's a high level idea, but after reading Cursed Child I was just wondering you know there are probably a lot more children raised just like Delphi who would have been fanatical about Voldemort. Children of escaped, surviving or hiding death eaters for one, and I just thought you know, we'll what if amongst all these terribly fanatical children there was one who tried to be good? I don't know, I just thought it would've been nice to see someone who was raised to be bad and has a base lineage try so hard to be good and possibly fail.

**** Certainly a good idea to explore if you're interested in it! I think it'd make sense to use a canon family for it - eg, picking a death eater to have that child would fit better than a full OC I think, and you've got a lot of plot freedom since most in the fandom don't like Cursed Child.
