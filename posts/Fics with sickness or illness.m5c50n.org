I was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Would very much appreciate any fics that deal with illness. Physical or physiological. I don't care if it ends tragically or with everyone happy. To be frank I think I'd prefer something more tragic maybe. Just want to read some shit that has more problems than I do. Give me a better look on life lol.

Complete. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Trio-centric.
