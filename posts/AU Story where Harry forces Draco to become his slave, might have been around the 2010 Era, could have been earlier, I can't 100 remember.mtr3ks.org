Harry becomes dark after the war, I think Voldemort or Death Eaters had placed Harry under a curse.

Harry forces Draco to become his slave.

Harry takes Draco to Grimmauld Place, trains him, and leave him in a room.

I believe it's Hermione (but might be Madam Pomfrey, as well) Who frees Harry from his curse.

Harry returns to Grimmauld Place, finds Draco, and realizes what he's done. I think Draco has called him Master? Upon seeing him.

I might be thinking of another story here? (Perhaps), But I think Severus Snape was alive in this, and Draco flees to Severus when he is better.

That's all that I remember. I might have combined a few stories in this, I don't remember.

It might have gotten purged years ago, I'm not sure.

I also have no idea what site it was on. It might have been on fanfiction.net, Archiveofourown, or another site entirely.

Even if the story is no longer around, I would be so appreciative of anyone finding the story.
