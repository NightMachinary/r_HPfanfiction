*** I can't take this story seriously enough to even begin reading it, to be honest.

The characters would have to be so AU to make this work, and in that case, why even stick with those chosen?

I'm expected to believe that Hermione "or worse, expelled!" Granger and Ron "there's no good Slytherin" Weasley are doing gangster mob/dark lord shit with Harry "just Harry" Potter as the Boss.... All over something to do with the son of a man that was his parents' best mate, but left Harry alone for 13 years?

Nah, I don't swallow that.

**** Teddy is more than that to Harry, Lupin literally made Harry his godfather. Harry would take that responsibility seriously.

**** I would honestly say it's one of the best post Hogwarts story out thier, if not the best. Quite honestly it kinda acted as some catharsis for some frustrations I had from the main series. The fact that harry fought and died for a society that in the end didnt change from it's terrible ways much was kinda frustrating lol.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Much to his displeasure, Harry is thrown back through time into his six year old body. As a result, Harry decides to contort the timeline, purely for his own amusement.
