I am looking for stories where Harry is paired with somebody unexpected. Something like Harry/millicent. I am just looking for something not the normal two or three pairings we always see. I would prefer if slash was not the main pairing. If other characters (not Harry) are gay that's fine.

Edit: please no tentacle porn. Yes it was different, but maybe a little too different. I was thinking more along the lines of non-standard pairings.


** Odd pairings? I've got some /very/ odd pairings for you.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10452052/1/One-Night-With-the-Squid][One Night With the Squid]] It's got Tonks in it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8062589/1/Or-How-Lockhart-Learned-to-Love-the-Tentacle][Or, How Lockhart Learned to Love the Tentacle]].

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7466409/1/A-Dumbledore-Love-Story][A Dumbledore Love Story]]. Very short. Very odd.

Edit: Oh, you wanted pairings with Harry in them. Shit. Oh well. These are better.

*** I would prefer if Harry is in them yes. I realized just now that my word choice was not the best.

This is why you should not reddit half asleep.

*** Well I am up for really any odd pairings. One of the best fics I have read was a hermione fem! Slash. Yes it is slash, but generally I think of guys when I think of slash. In it she was with a Luna and it was amazing. For the life of me I can't remember the name. It was on some random fanfic site that a friend linked me . (not ff or one of the big ones)

Side note for anybody who wants to hate on the fact I don't want to read fics with gay guys. I do like gay ships, but I have read so many they feel like the same fic over and over. Many slash fics I have read almost completely rely on the fact that there is a gay cuple and nothing else. This fic is what I wish more slash au was like. Harry just happens to be gay, but otherwise what is important is the rest of the plot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2816397/1/Bloody-Skies]]
