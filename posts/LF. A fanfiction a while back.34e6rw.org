It was a Harry/Daphne fanfic, Post-War. Draco finds Harry drunk in a gutter and takes him to Malfoy Manor, it's the lead up to Draco and Astoria's wedding. Harry is recovering from his alcoholism and dealing with the fact that after the war all his friends wanted to sort of start their lives right away where as he wanted to calm down for a bit. Daphne has liked Harry for a while and at first they clash a lot and Teddy and Andromeda turn up for a bit to reconnect with Narcissa.

Thanks for your help.
