Is there anything about this out there? Either how Arthur and Lucius became nemesises or any explorations regarding whether the feud goes back to Septimus Weasley and Abraxas Malfoy (Arthur and Lucius' fathers, respectively) or even further.


** In "Reunion", it's explained that the Weasleys were successful bankers, but ruined when a Malfoy, who owed them money, negotiated the treaty with the goblins that granted Gringotts the banking monopoly.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

I forget if it goes into the origin of the feud, but it definitely explores the mechanics of it and how it is magically perpetuated.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Maybe someone will remember more, but there was a story where it was due to a land dispute. I think Nagas lived on the property surrounding the burrow and destroyed the soil and nothing could be done with it, this was also the beginning of the Weasleys money problems.
