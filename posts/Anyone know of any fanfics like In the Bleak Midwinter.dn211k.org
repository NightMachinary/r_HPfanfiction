Anything with timetravel that is well written, I think the use of history and the aristocracy in the fic anything like Birds of a feather would also work as well.


** No idea, but I just read In the Bleak Midwinter linkao3(15430560) based on your suggestion and damn that stuff is hella good.

*** Have you read the other one? linkao3(15996890)

It's set in a different time period (1935-1945) and has some of the most immersive historical detail that I've ever read outside of published novels.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
