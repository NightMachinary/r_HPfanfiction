Oftentimes, I see this field of magic very underrated in fics. In canon not so much, but even what JKR wrote involving it I felt lacked vision.

The most basic transfiguration we see in the novels is a simple matchstick -> needle. It's never explained which metal the needle is made of, or what kind of needle it is, but as the most common metal for a needle is made of is High Carbon Steel (fancy iron), and the most similar in size and mass to a matchstick is the common sewing needle, I'm going to reasonably guess that that is what it was transfigured into. Presumably this area includes how to transfigure a solid into a liquid or a gas, and how to transfigure material.

However, we do know that canonically, transfiguration is permanent until reversed, /and/ that transfiguring something back is /not/ another transfiguration, but rather a seperate spell. This, alongside things like Polyjuice and the Animagus transformation very readily suggests that things have a base shape which they will always be. However, when transfigured, these objects will fully and entirely become their new shape, with no desire or ability to shift back. They retain an imprint, but no agency, magical or otherwise, to restore this imprint.

We also know that it is impossible to transfigure food, as well as money. However, I believe the money rule only applies to wizarding coinage, or at least requires a magical to detect. I will furthermore assume that this detection process involves the imprint of the original object. Any magical worth their salt will know a spell to detect the original shape of a transfigured object, and would thus discover the true form of their money. This, coupled with the magics upon goblin coins makes them impossible to transfigure.

The food rule is more difficult. There is little reason why you wouldn't be able to perfectly replicate a loaf of bread, after all. It's just chemical energy. If this were true, then you couldn't transfigure animals either, and also no fuel, both of which are possible. I assume this has to do with the symbolism attached to food. It nourishes us, makes us part of the circles of nature. To seperate yourself from this means to set yourself apart from life itself, which results in your starvation as you wither and die.

The next step of transfiguration is animate objects, that is, objects with life, to inanimate objects. Life to death. It is the natural direction of the cosmos, life to death, order to chaos, structure to entropy. This is still quite natural. By this point, they've branched out into different things. They can reasonably create whatever they want from whatever they have, and now their base material includes living things as well.

The third step is to animate objects, to bring them to life. This is against the natural order, but overruled by their status as humans. Life has the ability to create life, and this process leverages that. It is implied that transfigured life is worth less than natural life, which is very strange as transfigured life should by all accounts be the exact same thing. However, I propose that the mind of a transfigured entity are limited by the caster's imagination. To truly create a realistic pig, you would have to know exactly how a pig's mind works. Included in this step is animate to animate.

The next step is Vanishing. It exists as part of Transfiguration, but it isn't transfiguration - it is the manipulation of matter. Specifically, the manipulation of matter into nothing. A vanished object is dissolved in the cosmos, it goes in the natural direction of the universe. Structure to chaos. Existence to Entropy.

Conjuration is the final discipline we know exists in canon. It is the crowning achievement of canonical transfiguration, the leveraging of nothing into something. You violate the natural order of the cosmos to reverse entropy in such a way that it "re"constitutes whatever you want. (fanon of course, but I like this best)

And now, we get to the meat of the issue. What if you could see deeper? To manipulate things to a deeper level, to a degree unforseen?

The logical next step would be to transfigure energy. To turn one kind of energy into another kind of energy - to stop a moving object by transfiguring the kinetic energy into heat, for example. To transfigure a volcano's thermal energy into electricity. The more overt forms would be first, of course - heat and electricity foremost. These are real, physical properties. The next, more abstract area would be kinetic energy - first to untransfigure it, and then to transfigure it. Turning heat into motion. The last are even more abstract - turning potential energy into real energy. How would this work? Fuck me I don't know. Maybe you vanish only the object, and not its energy.

The crowning achievement of this would of course be the free manipulation of energy, which is equal to matter. A transfigurer on this level would see no distinction between the two, and could freely turn things into pure energy. They would be a weapon of mass destruction. Matter itself contains a LOT of energy.

Beyond this, things get vaguer. The most logical step from here would be to transfigure the base of the universe, which is space itself. Change its shape, its arrangement. You could put it in a knot, if you wanted to. Early exercises in this would lengthen and contract space, later ones would impact dimensionality. We know this is actually possible in canon, but only to a very limited degree. With this, it could become a weapon. I could never describe the things you could do with this. The crowning achievement of this area would be to combine all the previous, and then add space into the mix. You could lengthen a battlefield while simultaneously conjuring more ground between the atoms you are stretching. You could transfigure the space around your opponent into a Calabi-Yau manifold.

From here, I only see one further step. To transfigure the building blocks of reality, the things that make it tick. First, you would alter fundamental constants. The speed of light. The strength of gravity. The weak atomic force. All these could cause unimaginable destruction. Then, you would learn how to vanish them. Suspend their existence and watch as your target descends into untenability. Then, you would begin to /conjure/ them. To create new rules for reality to abide by. Obviously, this would require great knowledge to avoid causing disasters like a vacuum collapse, or a personal erasure from time. Time, too, would become yours to control.

The sad part is, this can never truly be canon. The magic system is too illogical for something like this to truly be compliant, even though many aspects of it have actually been done.

However, this is fanfiction. If you ever find yourself stumped as to what a wizard like Dumbledore can do beyond animating statues, please keep my post in mind.


** I'm on board with 90% of what you say about canon transfiguration. It's a reasonable summary, though I don't agree with all of it (e.g. it's not canonical that you can't transfigure money, just gold).

There seems to be a jarring shift in the second part of your post, however. When discussing canon transfiguration, you say things like:

#+end_quote

This is the correct way to approach canonical HP magic, in my opinion: talking about the meaning of objects, their relationship to human existence and society, what they symbolise. It is a way of looking at matter and substance which is completely contrary to the scientific description of the universe.

Which is why I am baffled that you go on to discuss entropy, transfiguration of energy, space etc. These are concepts which do not belong in the same discussion as "food nourishes us, to separate yourself from it is to separate yourself from life itself".

I would expect the world as described by transfiguration theory to be a very different world to the world described by physics and chemistry.

** I really love the Transfiguration subjects and it is true, a good writter should do justice to it, btw loved your post!
