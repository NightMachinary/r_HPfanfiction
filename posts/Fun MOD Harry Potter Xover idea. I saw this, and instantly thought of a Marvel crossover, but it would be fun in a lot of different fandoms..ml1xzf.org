#+TITLE: Fun MOD Harry Potter Xover idea. I saw this, and instantly thought of a Marvel crossover, but it would be fun in a lot of different fandoms.

** ...You know, I think this'd be great for a DC crossover.

A lot of characters have trauma: hell, despite the bright sunshine and rainbows, DC can actually be pretty grimdark beneath the veneer.

Kara? He was her friend, and his dying because of something she supposedly did pulled her out of her self-destructive spiral and into a hero.

Constantine? He thinks he damned Harry, partly due to his unique "condition" interacting with mojo, so he stopped being such a... well, cunt.

Hell, if he provided a cure for Viktor Freeze's wife but thought he died during the procedure? He turns over a "new leaf" with her as a tribute to his friend's "sacrifice".

Constant misunderstandings could also grow and evolve, much like how third parties thought Harry was something different in R Blot's Make a Wish, as people begin to piece things together by happenstance...

Diana: "He could be one of the Primordials who has developed a benevolent streak?"

Hippolyta: "That could explain why Ladies Athena and Artemis have avoided him, and why they did nothing when he accidentally wandered ashore for a few minutes. He held no ill-intent towards us, if he even knew we were there, and left when he realized he was on the wrong island."

Zatanna: "Rogue archangel?"

Constantine: "He was too nice for that: he wasn't a condescending arsehole. Demon?"

Zatanna: "'He was too nice for that.'"

J'onn: "An alien?"

Bruce: "Possible, but what little we know matches nothing in the League's database." /Or mine/.

Shiara: "We have legends about such eccentric beings far above us wandering Thanagar during our early history. He vaguely matches the criteria, but they're so vague and lacking detail..."

Viktor: "He saved my beloved and granted us a second chance. I say we leave him be, no matter who, or what, he is."
