I love Harry Potter fics and Time travel stories. I think I've read most of the good ones with Harry/Tom so I'm looking for other pairings (unless you have a rec that I should check). I want long stories hopefully finished or at least currently being worked on. ummm I don't mind character bashing, dark stories, or good Voldemort.


** Kairos Amid the Ruins (Orion/Harry) Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived. Notes: This is going to be a long story, focusing on Harry mentoring Severus as the Boy-Who-Lived, with flashbacks to an alternate World War II. The Harry-Severus mentorship will remain gen. However, the romantic pairings are a prominent part of the story. The word “Kairos” comes from the Greek, meaning a lucky moment, or the right moment, to act.

2) To Kill You With a Kiss by Paimpont Tom/Harry finished Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Beautiful and whimsical writing highly recommend it!
