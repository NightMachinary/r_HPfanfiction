I see a lot of stories where Harry dies and is put into a female version's body. It seem probable to me that he would end up identifying as a male still, and transition into a male body/experience gender dysphoria, unless he experienced general dysphoria in his past life. A soul/mind with years of memories that identify them as male would likely not feel at home at all in a female body. It would also be probable that a Harry like that would transition to being a male, and identify as such, or they could also be gender fluid as well.

Also you imagine it wouldn't change his sexual orientation either, so he would prefer women or he's pansexual/bi-sexual/homosexual in his past life. (Which some stories have him end up with women, and some have him end up with men)

Basically what I'm saying a lot of the stories where this happens don't seem to understand the potential ramifications.


** It used to be that whenever I saw F!Harry, it was because the author wanted to ship him with another male, but didn't want to write a gay couple.

That said, one story that stands out for me in terms of Harry not being trans, but waking up female. Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool has Harry wake up female, and Harry is all "... Well, this is a thing. I've faced worse. Guess I'm a woman, now."

**** Exactly.

Generally, F!Harry is only decent (to me) if they either properly make a trans Harry becoming female (or vice versa); suddenly female trying to go back to male; just rolling with it and not really caring; or always female, with a different personality (and name) than canon, as well as different circumstances related to growing up (and not a fucking WBWL story - seriously, the Black Princess (or whatever it's name was) can die in several fires, and has tainted all other WBWL stories by association).

Yeah, between the annual murder plot, the prophecy and the deathtrap Hogwarts is, being gender-swapped wouldn't even make the "top 10 weirdest things". There is the potential to make it an issue of course, but not more than any other of the horrible things which have happened to Harry.

** I think a lot of authors just don't dig that deep. Either they're not entirely aware of issues trans people face or just don't want to deal with such a complex topic for their simple story.

Not every story requires Sanderson-level worldbuilding and not every character requires an extensive psychological profile. I sometimes read 3000 word oneshots that diverge from canon so much that it would take 100k words just to set them up. You can do that if you want to, or you can skip all the details and get to the story you wish to write.

One writer I noticed who writes these stories is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1890123/Racke][Racke]]. It's not complex character analysis, but he does explore the topic of gender identity a bit.

** Those Harry's are usually trans, just not explicitly in the text. Because of several reasons that include:

1.People on the internet are shit and even fanfiction has a lot of bigots so saying the MC is trans is a good way to get a lot of hate

2.The author supposes that harry has never heard the term and as such cannot actually recognize and put a word to the fact that they feel fine or better in a female body than a Male one

3.The author simply not caring/not knowing what gender dysphoria is, this was much more common around 2006-2013 when trans issues had yet to be pushed to the forefront of political and social discourse and at such during those fanfiction years a lot of people were simply unaware that trans people even existed, much less gender dysphoria and how it affects someone

4.Some people are obsessed with canon compliance so when they are trying to write a story that the only change they want to do to the setting is a female harry, then they use this trope to put harry in a female body, that way it's canon harry. And since they don't want to deal with the whole gender and sex issue they simply ignore it and act like gender dysphoria doesn't exist

*** I'm sorry I have to disagree. You are trans if you identify as trans. There is not more to it and not less. You don't need to meet some other qualifiers or have gender dysphoria.

I look forward to reading new material that involves trans people. What I did notice in my 15 years of fic reading is that there has been more LGB representation (and in one instance even T) outside of strict sexual fics but rather in secondary or tertiary characters.

I think it basically boils down to time travel stories (non-hp ones) that explicitly say please ignore the mechanics behind it, just enjoy the story

What does it mean for T representation? I feel like transgender issues deserve explicit representation. Explicit mentions. Not us going back and saying oh wow this is obviously trans.

Edit because the downvotes are coming in: This is the article that most beautifully encapsulates this issue, at least for me:

[[https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2019/1/18/do-you-need-gender-dysphoria-be-trans]]

#+begin_quote
  As I stated before, this very concept seems insulting to so many transgender people who do suffer dysphoria because they haven't gone through the “rite of passage” that is the anguish that many suffer when learning one is transgender. To many, being transgender has brought them nothing but pain. Dysphoria is the only way they to relate to being transgender.

  Yet, we cannot let dysphoria be the only path, the price of entry, into our community. It frames being transgender as something painful, shameful, and to be resented. It defines transgender not as something to be proud of, but to be fought against, or hide.
#+end_quote

you dont need gender dysphoria, you dont need to be at war with your own body, you dont need to feel anguish over being trans or being in the wrong body. To be trans is to identify as trans.

**** Turning "transgender" into a tautology undermines the justifications for the activism. The only reason any of it ever caught on was because there was a supposed physiological root to trans people's distress. The argument was "you must use the pronouns and treat them like their identified gender because their wires are crossed and it's the only way they can live in relative peace." If those wires aren't crossed, then it's just something you decided to do one day and you've turned the whole thing into a society-scale Karen Talking to the Manager.

It also happens to make a terrible foundation for storytelling.

To the extent that it matters, anyways. "You don't need dysphoria to be trans" may be a mildly controversial position among the peasants (you're -1 under a 130 comment, not exactly a pariah), but a clear, affirmative statement of the only logical conclusion it brings would get me booted from the sub so fast it'd leave skid marks on the servers.

As for fridge horror, I would argue that if we can entirely ignore the fact that we have a virulently racist society that

1. /Actively mind-rapes the rest of humanity into ignoring its existence/ while doing whatever it pleases,
2. Covers up the fact that some of its members use their ability to warp reality to torment regular people with no means of fighting back,

In favor of actually telling literally any other story imaginable, I think it's safe to say that "somebody out there can point towards some sort of fridge horror with this premise" is not inherently a deal-breaker.

  we don't see for the most part people who polyjuice having issues.
#+end_quote

We see exactly two people 'cross dress' with polyjuice. One of whom is more bothered by Harry's eyesight, and the other of whom is /seriously/ bothered by it to the extent of demanding her fiancé not look at her. That's a fifty-fifty on a sample size of two. Tonks assumes the same form in the same scene, but either body dysmorphia just ain't an issue for metamorphs - which seems likely - or all she did was change face and build and still has all her woman kit in place under the clothes.#

Thing is, we don't have any real-world data on what the psychological effects of an imposed gender change are. It might very well be that a lot of people /can/ just roll with it, or it might be that cross-sleeving with polyjuice really is gender dysphoria in a bottle. Each writer is going to have to make their own storytelling choice on this one, and they're /all/ correct choices.

It depends on what you want to achieve. Do you want to investigate transformation of a man to a woman (or however you call it)? Something like linkffn(12507814)? Yes, then skipping the whole point of your story would be a disaster. Do you want to investigate misogynistic patriarchal magical world (something like linkao3(4876630))? Then why in the world should Harry be your main character and not for example Hermione or Ginny? Anyway, yes if you persuade yourself that fem!Harry is your only way how to do it, you may just skip the transformation anxiety part, and just deal with what you want to deal with.

That said, in the bodyswap fic I'm writing, there is a little bit of dysphoria, but that's more because I'm interested in such things than because I think it's inevitable.

Most depressingly, Ginny is referred to as "beautiful" just once in the entire series, and never as "pretty."

***** The more fundamental point is that the narrator of the HP series is not Harry and does not speak with Harry's voice. The word choice used by the narrator is clearly not Harry's vocabulary - it's far too articulate - and the things the narrator chooses to focus on do not necessarily reflect Harry's own focus. They are the things the reader needs to be told to picture what is happening, not the things that Harry is focusing on.

Perfect example: if you asked Harry to describe the atrium of the Ministry, you can be sure he wouldn't say this:

#+begin_quote
  They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh. On the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart
#+end_quote

Would Harry ever describe something as "peacock blue"? Absolutely not. Would Harry ever use the adjective "splendid"? Again, never. These are words you might hear from Dumbledore's mouth, but not Harry's.

In short, Harry Potter is not a first person narrative, it's third person limited, which means the narrator is like an invisible demon sitting on Harry's shoulder, seeing what he sees and listening to his thoughts. But the demon is /not Harry/. Which means that you cannot infer anything about Harry from the demon's choices of what to describe and how to describe it.

** For the sexual identity, my theory is the writer of those stories are either trans, non-binary, or an egg (someone who didn't realize it yet). The same goes for sexual orientation, so the fem!Harry we get isn't canon cis-male Harry mind inside a female body, could be an SI, or just the writer honestly not realizing what would someone else feel if they woke up in a different body.

** Gender dysphoria, yes. Sexual orientation is a different matter.

It all depends on how far you're willing to go with the idea of the soul. The way I see it is: Sexual attraction is a biological process, so if the female body he's placed into is inclined towards men, that's all there is to it. Though of course, if he does experience gender dysphoria, that's going to cause a lot of conflict with those biological reactions.

** I would like to point out that much of our behaviour is governed by the chemistry of the body.

While a male Harry waking up in a female body would likely identify as a male still, there would probably be a realistic chance of him starting to have at least slight feminine psychological traits because of that alone (since our hormones and such are different enough to be noticeable).

How much of a factor that would actually be I couldn't say. I am guessing looking into psychological and behavioural changes caused by taking hormones for the opposite gender and operations that change your physiology could give some idea, though at a smaller scale.

**** To be fair, there is the medical fact that hormone imbalances, such as those caused by certain endocrine conditions/injuries or taking unnecessary medication, can cause psychological symptoms, the most obvious of which would be mood swings or depression (or aggression for too-high testosterone), in anyone, no matter what their brain is.

Admittedly this didn't take any other possible changes such a body swap could cause into account, as magic could legit change his neurobiology as well, but still even just swapping out the hormones of an average person could cause some degree of issues.

That's the key phrase, here. Mood swings, depression, etc. happen, as you say, without discrimination. Just having someone's body morph out might cause any of the above, but they wouldn't change someone's core identity such as gender or sexual preferences, and we have the (extremely unethical) studies to prove this.

Now, as for changing their very brain---yes, that's possible, but if you as an author make this a thing, you /need/ to handle the implications within the narrative itself instead of just glossing over them. Well, you don't physically need to, but I personally will come to your house and shake my head disappointingly at you if you don't.

**** You are confusing studies done on real life people and magical realism. In real life there is a bidirectional mind-body influence. So a trans person will undergo neurological changes over the course of their lifetimes as their mentation influences brain chemistry, which will in turn influence brain structure.

In the case of suddenly female!Harry, they (in this example) suddenly become female. They are, in essence, a cis gendered woman...but with a male mind. So initially the brain chemistry/hormones will be what you would expect to find in a cis gendered woman. The writer could go in a lot of interesting directions from this point. Harry adapting to the body, the body adapting to Harry, issues of identity, disphoria, etc. Being changed back to a male after having their mind adapt to the female body and lingering effects of differing mentation.

**** I am talking about the physical differences, there is a difference in hormones and such, those differences does change your behaviour if you change their balance, so it is logical to conclude that it could alter someone's behaviour.

​

You are correct in that I know nothing about trans people, nor do I pretend to, my comment did not insinuate I knew much about that matter, only that physical changes would affect him.\\
It would change him in the same manner taking a drug would.\\
I specifically stated that I did not know the magnitude of the effect that would have, and guessed that looking at real-life examples of physical changes would give some idea of what changes could occur. That is not acting as if wild speculation is fact, it is looking at reality, and considering what the implications of a situation would be.

** Not read many female Harry stories where he goes from male to female... but I have seen a few female Draco stories and in them, for some reason, the author writes it so that Draco is confused at first and still thinks he is a guy... but then living in a body filled with female hormones begins to change his thought process and he begins to mentally shift to she and pretty much old Draco fades away.

I'd guess something similar would happen to Harry.

** It might be that he simply never had much of a concept of "gender identity". Nor were there many events where his gender had any impact, most of them could have happened to a girl under pretty similar circumstances. The biggest difference would probably have been that Dudley would not have gotten away with tormenting him as much due to social expectations. It isn't until the Yule Ball where you have a plot that would have gone differently (Harry being expected to ask someone out), and even that would not have made much of a difference.

The social aspect would have been different, but not even that is written in stone (other than the time spent together in the dormitories).

The only thing I can say is that they make their female Harry a girl at birth so it's not a trans Harry story.

If you took a fully formed brain with decades of memories and stuck it into a different body with different hormones the gender identity and sexual attraction wouldn't just flip around.

And in the cases where an older Harry Potter gets placed in the body of an 11 year old version of himself (or herself in a genderbend), is it an 11 year old brain or the brain of whatever age he was?

And then we have to get into the question of souls - we know they exist in Harry Potter, so are they the driving force behind identity in that universe, or is the brain?
