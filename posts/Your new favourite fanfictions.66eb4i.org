By this, I mean fics posted in these first months of the year. They don't have to be long, completed or even have /plot/. Just share those stories you've found and made you stare at the screen for +minutes+ an instant.

My own contributions are linkffn(12450356) and linkffn(12401754) (this one is LV/HP).


** This one is the first that came to mind.

*** Do people really like this fic? It has a lot of follows and favorites, but the writing seems pretty weak to be honest. It's diffcult to put into the right words, but every character except Harry feels like an NPC in an RPG.

*** This fic is ruined by Harry's sorting into Slytherin. The plot device of his repeating resurrections is destroyed by putting him in the house of Death Eaters in an AU where everyone knows the prophecy and everyone expects Voldemort to return.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly looses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
