** Eh, it's something only told about in stories, that very few believe to exist. What you'd call it would heavily depend on the stories you're most familiar with. The deathstick would be a common choice to refer to it in various urban legends about dark wizards wielding it.

Coming from someone with proper knowledge of its history and origin, it would be a bit much, but if that character is a dark and edgy fourteen year old who believes the world is out to get them and the only solution is dark magic, well, it really does fit the character

** What's wrong with deathstick? It certainly seems more intimidating than the finger of death. Finger of death seems like someone cut off death's finger or death cut off their own finger. Either way, there's my respect for death gone.
