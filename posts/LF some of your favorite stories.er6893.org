With no character bashing: How I define bashing: Stuff like Dumbledore going "for the greater good" stuff where Weasleys and whoever else are just using Harry for his fame and money are a huge no go.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on ANY site.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated if possible, but if not, that's fine.

Can be from ANY Era.

Anyone can be the main character; Harry doesn't have to be, but can.

It can be dark or not.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy, et cetra.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] on ao3 is so good, independent one shots of what-if scenarios (like good dursley's, or no bwl).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][marauders plan]] Where sirius comes back for harry at the end of 3rd year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][turn]] A drarry fanfic where harry gets a glimpse of a universe where Malfoy turned to their side (I'm not doing the story justice, it's amazing)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][the arithmancer]] In which Hermione is a math genius, and starts on arithmancy and spell learning early on. A wonderful fic with a brilliant, yet still human, Hermione.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/][Things in Common]] Where Ginny is sorted into slytherin, but doesn't remain the gryffindor type girl she does in other fics with this trope. It's similar to the Changeling that was recommended earlier, but her outlook on her family is much different.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] Where Harry becomes a dark lord to fight discrimination that would harm Teddy, but without the bashing and super Harry

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/][To Shape and Change]] In which Snape goes back in time to prepare Harry for what is coming next. It's a bit canon divergent, but very easy to follow and very heartfelt with a good strong plot

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][The Pureblood Pretense]] A female Harry goes to Hogwarts in disguise in order to achieve her dream of being a potions mistress. I'm not doing the story justice, the work is wonderfully done.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12783124/1/][Rewriting Destiny]] Hermione and Draco go back in time, but not as theirselves. Instead, they're reborn as siblings to those in the Marauders Generation as a way to bring about change. I'm probably explaining it more confusing than it is, the summary probably does a better job. But it's wonderful and well written.

I have so many more, so if you enjoy the ones I recommended, feel free to message me for more!!!

** All these stories are complete and to the best of my knowledge they're most of my favorites.

linkffn(11500936) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen][Long Live the Queen]] Where Harry takes his underage magic court case and Sirius' wrongful conviction to....you guessed it. The Queen of England. And it riles the fuck out of the whole pureblooded wizarding world. Light and Dark side.

linkffn(12511998) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] One is my top 5 time travel stories. At least the first 3/4 of it. Harry gets thrown into the past against his will and chooses to just go his own way until things happen and he decides to fuck shit up.

linkffn(12952598) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12952598/1/What-We-Lost][What we Lost]] post war ewe Harry coaxes andromeda out of the grief of losing her family and helps raise Teddy. The wizarding world doing some fucky things. Harry to the rescue. Extremely uncomfortable family dinners with Andy, Harry, and the Malfoy's. Harry/Andy romance

linkffn(10503844) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10503844/1/The-Favour][The Favour]] Post war ewe Draco talks Harry into doing him a favour of taking his mom out to the theatre because he wants to spend time with Astoria. Harry and Narcissa get on Better than Draco could've thought and they start a romance.

Trust me.

linkffn(6943436) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/19/][The Pureblood Princess]] ok, don't read any of the story except the first epilogue unless you want. It's just a mediocre fix that you've likely already read in others dozens of times. Instead focus on the Epilogue. It could've been it's own longish one shot by itself and been better for it. Anyways Daphne/Harry post war ewe

linkffn(6257522) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] post war ewe guilty pleasure of mine. It's Malfoy redemptionish but with Harry still roasting them through the whole way to that point. Otherwise Draco is rehabbing Harry in the Malfoy manor after he finds Harry pissed and learns his friends aren't going to be of any help. Harry/Daphne rom

link(12317784) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]] Harry is thrust back into his parents schooldays by the Unspeakables because they hate him for destroying their time turners....oh and also to prevent the killing of bloodlines leading to fewer and fewer wizards by Voldemort.

Harry and a group of his drug addicted, mentally ill battle scarred friends get tossed into another dimension where Sirius and Snape are friends along with Lily and Remus. The fuck shit up in this new universe while trying to find a way to get back to their own.

linkffn(11959184) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11959184/1/Hadrian-Lannister-Lion-of-the-Rock][Hadrian Lannister and the Lion of the Rock]] Harry, after living a long life in his world, finds himself born into the GOT world as the elder brother of Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion. He proceeds to fuck shit up while being a key member of the Targaryen loyalists. Allowing many many events to play out differently than the tv show.

** Welp. Here we go again!

My Top HP 10 Fics: a copypasta.

Most of these are either Hinny, Peggy Sues or both.

1.  Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.

2.  Ongoing: Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index/][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index/]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

3.  Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.

4.  Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.

5.  Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the style of canon with mysteries. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to canon. It's just an overall good quality fic.

6.  Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

7.  Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

8.  Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

9.  Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

10. Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?

** I have to suggest "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is"

The stories follows Harry who had previously defeated voldemort, who travelled back in time, depositing himself as a baby, upon which he is found and adopted by the black family, later becoming the older brother to both Sirius and Regeleus, what follows is a story about his relations with his younger brothers, while having to manage the ideals and biases of his adopted parents, while desperately trying to destroy voldemort, while keeping his family together, and away from voldemort clutches.

Upon looking back, it really isn't that short.

** I'll recommend: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][]]

I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

linkao3(329404)

My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

linkao3(601542)

I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

linkffn(13052940)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/][Finding Himself]] is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written.

Two in a series, by BrailleErin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]].
