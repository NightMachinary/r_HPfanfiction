:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for two fics.

1) Harry is the master of death. He time travels back, joins with Voldemort to save wizard kind. He is given hints from Death about a way to another world. He found a caldera, at the bottom is a world well hidden. There are these books called linking books, something about ages?, they give goblins their own book. Each book is controlled by the master book. Maybe the individual manors are transported wholesale, but that could be another fic.

2) Harry finds this device in Hogwarts, I believe, that holds manors, property, etc in glass balls. He may be the last wizard alive, stealing, or just moving people.


** Found the first one. It's FeS2 by Shivani. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865/chapters/749908][FeS2]]
