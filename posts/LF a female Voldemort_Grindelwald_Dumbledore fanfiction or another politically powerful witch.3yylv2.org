I'd like to read a fic that puts a woman on the same magical power/societal influence pedestal that Grindelwald, Voldemort, and Dumbledore were placed on in canon. I'd like to find genderswap of one of the above characters, but I'd also like OCs or AUs that discuss a woman in the current era who is one of the most important power players in magical Europe with a solid power base.


** Hmm. Try linkffn(Madam Minister by GreenWood Elf). The fic is about Britain's first female Minister of Magic and her rise to power.

  At the end of the 18th century, Artemisia Lufkin became the first female Minister of Magic. She was a political genius, an Auror and a disciple of the Enlightenment. But behind closed doors, she was also a hedonist, an adulteress and guilty of treason.
