** Justin Finch-Fletchley was bored.

He HATED his fathers fancy dinners and meeting with pompous brats who thought that because they both came from money that they would both think the same way or have the same interests. Ignoring magic, which really would be enough on its own, Justin's mother was a commoner and raised him with humility and grace that his father found bemusing, if nothing else. These rich tits never seemed to understand that he would rather rough it for a week in the woods or walk through the city on a clear night than eat fancy food, in fancy buildings, wearing fancy clothing, with other fancy people.

Lucky his father more often than not let him wander as he would. There was always a bit of fun to be had, some new shop to explore, or someone new to meet.

Tonight though he was stuck in Surrey, with NOTHING to do but walk and look around. Off to one side he could hear the raucous laughter of others, young sounding too, along with the sound of breaking glass.

With nothing else to do he followed the noise.

It was a bunch of teens, his age or a little older or younger. He could see cans and bottles in hands and the one in the middle currently chugging, one arm around a young girl with boyish short hair. The group was chanting as he drank... And then he pulled the empty bottle down and Justin saw a VERY familiar sight: Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived.

Not only was Harry one of Justin's classmates, but also another wizard.

Also currently throwing his empty bottle into the windshield of a nearby car to loud cheers.

Then he heard it, the sound of the police, saw the flashing lights.

To Justin's bemusements Harry got the others to run, gave the girl one last kiss, and sat on the hood of the car, lighting a cigarette as he waited. With no more than thirty seconds he called out, "Harry!" and the boy froze as his head turned, lit cig between his lips.

The green eyed boy just stared, a smile beginning to crawl across his face, but saying nothing. He tried again, "What are you doing? Run! I can take you to hide with my father." Whether or not said father would turn Harry right over to the fuzz was a different story, but worth a chance.

The boy just started laughing, pulling free a small flask and offering a cheer to Justin before taking a swig and throwing the flash as hard and far as he could towards the oncoming car with flashing lights. Even as he ran the boy could hear the 'tink' as the metal bounced off the police car.

From the distance, barely able to see as a female officer slammed Potter into the hood of the car whose window he had smashed, all Justine Finch-Fletchley could hear was jovial laugher.

It was another six month before he got to ask Harry, whom had on returning to Hogwarts been the same trouble magnet he ever was (though oddly NOT a trouble maker, as much as Snape and Justin's own memories would say otherwise), why he had stayed and get picked up by the officer.

The boy had gotten the same grin on his face he had seen that August night, "How could I let my mates get caught? I bought them enough time to get away AND I got to embarrass my family, that's a win-win!"

Justin just stared, trying to comprehend...

** So I had a go at it and it became so big that I thought to actually post it to Ao3. It's not quite finished yet, but after I'm done I'll update the post with a link. Here's what I have so far, maybe consider it an introduction?

It wasn't so much teenage rebellion as it was him just doing what was expected of him. All his life Harry had been the one that was pushed and toppled, the one who got the short end of the stick, miserable while alone but thankful for being alone because he knew that as soon as Dudley showed up he was in for pain. His aunt and uncle had called him a violent degenerate, and he had cringed because it only made the high and mighty middle aged tossers who lived in Privet Drive turn their nose at him with disapproval. When he was small he had hoped and wished and cried for someone to come in and take him away, he had hoped that a Teacher would see the bruises that Dudley left or a kind stranger would notice that his clothes were 3 times his size and someone would call help. Smart as he was, raising himself and becomming self sufficient it wasn't until he was in Hogwarts that he realised just how things were.

He had had the most wonderful year of his life where he actually felt himself liked and where people didn't scoff whenever he opened his mouth and returning that Summer had been the hardest thing he had ever done. He had minimised things in his letters, not wanting his friends to see him in pain, painting it as funny little annoyances rather than the misery that it was. Not that it had mattered anyway, Dobby might have had good intentions but he made his letters wasted ink and pen...or parchment and quill.

​

People in Little Whinging didn't care about him and in fact they took the Dursleys as saints for doing the bare basic of providing him food and shelter. No, most of them did not care for anything but themselves and when they cared for him it was to shake their heads and tell him what filth his parents were and that he should be thankful to be raised by respectful people. Respectful...that was something that he was not in his scruffy clothes which served to his neighbours as proof that there wasn't something quite right with the Potter boy. Nevermind the fact that his baggy clothes were the result of the Dursleys, did they think he wanted to look like that?

​

Harry could get into trouble at Hogwarts but he was generally thought of as a good boy. He had his spats with Malfoy and wandered the halls at night sure, but it balanced out and he at least tried to do the right thing. He was a good person, intent on living up to the image his mum and father would have wanted him to be. He assumed at least, he saw Hermione's parents fill her with praise whenever she got a good grade rather than being chidded for embarassing Dudley by doing better and he knew Mrs Weasley. That was how normal parents acted right? With love?

Maybe it was the hormones that made his blood boil or made him want to shout, maybe it was just that he had had enough but Harry found himself not caring. Why should he worry that he stepped on the flowers of their pretty little lawns or that he loitered? He had been called all but a thief by them for daring to need to be supported as a child by the Dursleys so what was different when he stole something?

​

It was never things that he actually wanted or cared about because Super Nintendo games didn't much matter to him and jewellery was something that to him was given to girls, and at 13 he didn't see the point but in a way he found it satisfying. It wasn't about the objects he took, not really, it was about making others feel bad for being....well bad didn't quite seem to cover it, and neither did gits. They were something else entirely.

​

It was very easy too, for whatever reason that Harry couldn't quite fathom he had gotten no more letters from the ministry, even as his magic reacted to his wants and opened doors, to him it almost felt like encouragement, like they somehow approved.

What use did he have for being polite and just taking the abuse? Harry was done with that...

  Harry Potter interstitial stories. All the way from Book1 to Book 8, but only a few minutes a year, where Harry can relax, unwind, have a cigarette and be Just Harry. Harry's a bad boy and a worse adult, who (spoilers) ends up breaking up with his wife and 'dating' his best Hermione who's married to Ron. Ever wonder just how unreliable a narrator he was? Substance abuse. Swearing.

*** Oh, and there is also Linkffn(Prodigal Delinquent) which goes more or less on the same thread with the differences that this Harry is extra op and rather oblivious, there was also another one which I can't remember the name where he started stealing before Hogwarts and got himself semi-adopted by the Flamels after getting caught stealing from them (plus a /lot/ of other stuff of the same degree of ridiculousness such as accidentally getting the Hogwarts' staff stoned) though on this Dumbledore is portrayed as being manipulative it is played more as a running gag rather than an important part of the plot and he never really got half as bad as other manipulative!Dumbledores, even letting Harry move out without any fight whatsoever upon finding out about the cupboard. There was also another like that which I've been tried to find again for ages in which Harry learns small bits of wandless magic alone (small stuff only, the one I remember the most accurately is that he could turn a pencil in metal with lots of effort), goes to Ravenclaw (Not Noodlehammer's “for the love of magic”) and travels Europe after his first year, eventually going to the Caribbean (Bahamas I think) and doing a ritual where he killed a dragon, if anyone knows it I would love I link haven't been able to find it in years.

  AU. Little Harry Potter knew from the moment he defied the laws of gravity and made a pebble accelerate at a freefall of 8.9 m/s 2, that he was going to have fun learning about the rules of all the known universe... and breaking every single one of them. WARNING: Sporadic Updates.

** Thank you for the idea;)......

Justin Finch-Fletchley griined as he shimmed down the drain pipe behind his older cousin Dylan who was 15 and finally said Justin was old enough to go with him to "the Dairy"... It didn't sound very exciting or nefarious but it was legendary in Surrey. Even Justin who when to bloody hogwarts and could to do honest to merlin magic was envious of the older kids who went there.

Dylan also made him go home when ever he tried to follow him in uears pervious, Justin stayed with his mother sister Dolores for a few weeks every summer when his parents went to Bali to have another Mini honeymoon they seemed to do that in the middle of summer every year like clockwork since he was 3 but he didn't mind he got to spend time with Dylan And that was precisely why he was now wandering the back streets of Surrey at 11:00 p.m. on a Wednesday dodging dogs, Curious foxes and even a few coppers who were rolling slowly down the suburban streets of little winching.

It was July and the heat from the 95ﾟ day was still emanating from the pavement he could feel it through a snickers as he jogged along behind his older cousin who dragged him behind yet another decorative topiary shaped like Margaret Thatcher S faFavorite docson Stewie.

TheThey had another block to go crawling behind a tool shed to not activate the floodlights and mrs o'learys back garden and climbing over a few more chainLink or picket fences That glowed faintly in the moonlight that way only a newly painted utterly white wooden sense can glowGloomily under street lights as if it was by a luminescent deep in the Atlantic without a spark of sunlight rather than dividing property lines on a suburban street in Southern England.

Justin got his jeans caught on the tip of one of the particularly more pointy pieces swearing as it tore into his pocket after checking he wouldn't have a splinter he tore off the rest of the fabric just in time for his cousin to pull him behind a parked car on the corner as another copper rolled by and then they saw it Susan his cousin Dylan's girlfriend a year older that had a brother with a license they were sitting on theBonnet of a decrepid old pick up truck that looked like it was more at home in the Yorkshire countryside rather than in Surrey but Susan's older brother Derek had bought it 3rd hand from a friend that went to Cambridge so it was kind of grandfathered in acceptable because the residents of Surrey had been seeing it since sometime in the early seventies. So like mrs figg's tall shed the by laws allowed for it even though it sparked a bit of grumbling from the neighbors periodically.

Dylan started walking across the street with Justin behind him introductions were made curtly before Justin was scrambling into the back seat and Dylan was telling him not to embarrass him before he started attempting and failing to engage in cannibalism while devouring his girlfriend's face the tongue work was quite impressive and made Justin turn a similar shade to freshly picked rhubarb and glance out the window to avoid seeing it.

They drove for what seemed like an hour but was really most likely 10 minutes before they came to an old stone building one of the few fields still standing around new constructions there was a cemetery on 1 side a churchyard on another and a decrepid old farmhouse with stone buildings behind it Susan's older brother Derek told him helpfully when he looked at it a bit too long that that was the old dairy it had been converted sometime in the 1800s when the church was still in use and they started walking quickly even though Justin tried to walk across the field Dillon grabbed him by the back of his coat and dragged him towards what looked like a metal door in the middle of a field.

When Justin looked at him questioningly his brother just said dad's army used to use it as if that was sufficient explanation for his cousin who had stopped attending mugh Mughal school when he was 11 they didn't get to that bit of history just yet World War II was typically covered lightly in 2nd grade and then avoided until students were about 12 or so and could understand it more thoroughly.

So Dylan Derek Susan started prying up the rusty door before conscripting Justin into the effort he took the bottom right hand corner and pulled they managed to get it hoisted open just enough for each one of them to slip in Derek waiting for the last of them with Dylan pulling just in behind him they climb down the shaft and Derek slammed the lid behind him plunging them into darkness making just and panic for a moment before Dylan pulled out a torch and well they started walking he could feel the vibrations from the music already.

It was barely a minute before he sSaw the flashing strobe lights and hood heard cheering.

Before he knew it they were in the thick of it teenagers everywhere bottles of wine beer and soda Coca-Cola precisely because it was dark enough to cover stolen rum and not get stopped by the coppers littered the area green silver and gold cans littered the ground some crushed under boots and others taken over by small insects or other critters living in the corners but that didn't matter because there was a live band playing calling themselves doctor fluffy and the moobs, And old school British punk scene it seemed and Dylan was dragging him towards one of the camping coolers in the center of the Room fishing out a couple beers and handing 1 to his cousin who grinned it was the 1st 1 anyone besides his dad when he asked for a taste when he was about 7 had willingly given him . The Justin's parents had spent most of their formative years in America so they had a much more reserved approach to alcohol than most of the British population when it came to teenagers it was bloody annoying when he asked for a glass of wine with dinner and he was told not until you're 15 like your cousin.

Quickly Justin cracked it open before dealing could change his mind and down a few sips before making a disgusted face and looking around them as if he couldn't believe they were willingly drinking the foul tasting liquor and it made his cousin her brother and his cousin the girlfriend laugh at him making Justin impersonate rhubarb once again and well walk away from them for a moment. At the time he turned back they were gone disappearing into the crowd and he had been absorbed into a dancing group one of the girls most likely 17 grabbed him by the shoulder her pupils dilated to the size of saucers and screamed she loved this band before dragging him with her into the crowd Justin half panicked half shocked stumbled after her and ended up jumping to the beat in a sardine can formation with about 20 others for almost a quarter of an hour before the band took a break and then he saw it on a busted table that was still standing with only 3 legs someone iIndustrious had sawed off the good leg and duck taped it to the center of the opposite end so it was mostly balanced like a tripod they were playing beer pong on it until the boy that had climbed up shouted for attention his black hair was damp with sweat he wore torn jeans and a bit too big T-shirt dirty trainers but it seemed everyone knew him and he was shouting for their attention people grew quiet waiting in anticipation for what was next it seemed with this circus the boy might be the ringmaster.

And then it registered when he got a good look at him green eyes sparkling under the flashing multicolored laser lights, Harry fucken Potter was a dressing a crowd of partying teenagers in Surrey in an underground bunker, He was holding what appeared to be a rotisserie chicken in one hand and a beer in the other before declaring loudly, With a slightly drunken slur" Let's give it up for the paltry effort of our entertainers Simon I got you dinner."

Making everyone laugh and the rather large fellow who was the lead singer of doctor fluffy stepped from his smoking area to collect the chicken and the beer that was offer before grinning as if that was his payment for performing for the evening maybe they had some kind of arrangement where the band would play for everyone's entertainment and someone would feed them in exchange for it it wasn't unheard of even Justin knew about that kind of thing from watching the news and hearing about the early days of The Beatles and The Sex Pistols.

With that Harry laughed and then promptly jumped off the table before those standing around him in close proximity caught him and he started making his way under not his own power but various hands pulling him forward on the crowd towards were just in withstanding making people laugh and bellowing" kings Potter"

To Justin's write another table was set up and someone was pulling out beers and a stack of cards willing participants were meandering forward more laughter and then justin was pulled in another direction by the 17 year old girl that seem to remember he still existed saying something about her sister pilfering a bottle of champagne for the occasion justin didn't know what champagne was his knowledge of liquor consisted of small beers and his mother's wine coolers he hadn't really been paying attention to the different classification but nonetheless grinned when the girl popped the cork on the bottle and they were both drenched in the Amber explosive liquid it reminded him of hogwarts when Dean Thomas had accidentally blown up his pumpkin juice In 2nd year.

*** Out of morbid curiosity after having a few swigs he took a turn of pulling the 17 year old girl with him through the crowd towards where Harry Potter was playing a game of kings with what looked like 2 bikers or guys who wore way to much itEyeliner and 3 girls who could probably either be classified as delinquents or aAngels who, And if depending on which of their mothers you asked Only if it was on Sunday Only if it was during Sunday dinner.

Harry was laughing talking to one of the guys before leaning forward and kissing 1 of the girls on the shoulder she giggled and kissed him on the cheek afterward Potter had clearly done the dare before the boy that had spoken to him earlier took a swig and said something making a few boos and Cries of coward echo through the underground chamber they were currently in habiting.

As Justin made his way towards the table maybe 5' from Potter his drunken schoolmate caught a glimpse of him and Harry turned to give him his full attention for a moment grinning and shouted his name Justin before turning back to the people at the table and informing them happily enough apotHarry Potter appeared to be a happy drunk which was useful information just in filed away for later before Harry informed rather loudly the entirety of the table he was sitting at that Justin from hogwarts was here and he wanted a few people to verify he wasn't a wHallucination brought on from a bit too much from the bottle... Justin couldn't help it His inner huffle puff demanded retribution, So just for that moment Justin told the 17 year old girl he was with whose name he still hadn't gotten he should probably ask for that he added as a mental note before telling her to walk like an Egyptian just as the collective eyes of Harry's companions focused on them just in with a completely solemn face as if he was at a funeral at Saint mark's started doing the traditional dance of the in Intoxicated sorority girl approaching Potter at an upbeat pace with the girl he was with behind him mirroring his motions and from the crowd after a beat they heard a chorus of walk like an Egyptian and a few of the drunker members of the crowd of the party started following suit they got a laugh and a rather worried look from Harry before he is drunken brain caught up with the circumstances and he laughed. Telling Justin he'dOffer him a chair but they bolted the 6 the 1 to the ceiling and hadn't gotten it down yet Justin looked up to see a solemn oak chair with a red cushion hanging rather securely from the roof over the tunnel chamber thing they were in and laughed.

With that Justin was dealt in and he found out the 17 year old girl he was with was named Mary and went to miss Alicia school for gifted young ladies in North hamptonshire she was visiting her sister for the summer.

They spent a good hour alternating between playing kings dancing when the band decided they had recuperated enough until Dylan came to collect him the only question he got after his cousin approached him was the words how the hell do you know Potter as if Dylan was jealous of him for a moment.

Justin just told his until that moment cooler more sophisticated older cousin who just in was now realizing was just another teenager like him a simple one word answer school.

And then laughing in a slightly drunken stupor before climbing backup the tunnel and Derek in front of him pushing open the rusty hatch that opened up into a field there were a few mostly sober other teenagers milling about and Derek paid one of them to drive them home so nothing that would happen.

That was the evening the1st of many that summer in Surrey where Justin hung out with Harry Potter made Dylan jealous and learned a bit more about life outside of mughal London.

He Went back the next night with Dylan this time actually making conversation with Derek who was an alright bloke once you got to know him and you looked past the grumpy exterior marry the girl he had been with the night before sought him out the moment he arrived and kissed him about 10 minutes into the evening he had a stupid grin on his face the rest of the night while talking to Potter and one of his overly eyeliner friends named Drake who worked at a kebab shop in London on the weekends
