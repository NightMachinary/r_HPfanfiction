#+begin_quote
  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him. Blind!Harry POV. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.

** Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool linkffn(8175132) Time/dimension traveler Harry remembers that Sally-Anne Perks left Hogwarts after a year. An investigation into alt!Sally-Anne reveals her prosthetic leg and a speech impairment that prevents her from pronouncing spells properly. Harry promptly starts enchanting the prosthetic and holding workshops to get around her speech impediment, and she ends up staying at Hogwarts in this timeline.

Of a Linear Circle linkao3(11284494) disability is not a major part of the story but it's woven in throughout. The MC scolds Trelawney for using a rope ladder to access her classroom, as it's hard for some students to climb. The enchantment that makes Dumbledore's stairs move like an escalator was originally intended for disabled students. A student is hit with a nasty curse, but survives because it hit her prosthetic instead of flesh. So on and so forth.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129228][For Love of Family]] is exactly this. It's on SIYE, so there's no bot, but the short version is that Head Auror Harry suffers a spinal injury on the job. There's a lot in it about his grieving process, rehabilitation, himself and his family coming to terms with his new capabilities (both physically and emotionally), and supporting others in comparable situations. And meanwhile, Ron is leading Harry's team to track down the monster(s) who deliberately did that to him.

It's complete, and the characters are quite well written.

** Session Transcripts features a Harry that is disabled (brain damaged) due to horrific child abuse. It's incomplete but features an interesting narrative structure and overall pretty good writing.
