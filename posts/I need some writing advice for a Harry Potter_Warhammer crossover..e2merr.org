So, awhile back I read a Warhammer crossover entitle 'Harry Potter and the God-Emperor of Mankind.' It's basically where the 40k universe ends, and the Emperor is thrown back to the beginning of his life, as Harry. I intend to rewrite this story, since it has been abandoned by the author. But I need some advice for how to write the scenes where Harry Potter characters( both light and dark) are interacting with the Emperor!Harry. Any advice?


** It's not any of those mind you,

Essentially the synopsis of the the story the OP said is that Harry is teleported forwards in time, becomes a space marine, then becomes a Inquisitor after many years of training as a psycher. After a few more years pass in HP world, Harry is thrown back, roughly in 3rd year. And antics ensue

** He's probably find the cumulative horrors of the first and second wars with Voldemort to be “quaint” - barely equivalent of minor skirmishes. This is a mind that has seen wars with the death toll in the billions, and the atrocities that can only be brought about by the influence of the Warp. Voldemort doesn't come close.
