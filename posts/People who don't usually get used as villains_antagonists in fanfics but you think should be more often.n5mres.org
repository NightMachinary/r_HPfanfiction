People I've seen used relatively often ( though depends on type of fic ) are Voldemort + Death Eaters, Umbridge, Dumbledore, All the Marauders, All Weaselys except the Twins,

So not those people since they seem to be used relatively often but anyone else is fair game. The less you have been seen used in a bad guy role the better.

My pick is Barty Crouch Sr

** Sibyll Trelawney.

There are so many fanfics that have Dumbledore made up the prophecy - why not have her made it up?

Like: she really has powerful seer powers and saw something that she decided it would be best that Harry and Voldemort kill each other and take Dumbledore with them. Her whole crazy spin is something to threw people of the idea that she is actually a manipulative mastermind.

** Snape. By feats he's the fourth most powerful wizard in the series. Dude was also seriously competent. He lacks the charisma to be a leader imo, but there's an easy solution: Lily. Dark!Snily with Dark Lady Lily as the charismatic leader of the movement would be amazing, the Augustus to Snape's Agrippa. It isn't even that hard to set up imo. As a concept, have Lily stumble across Snape during one of her prefect patrols, who tells her about what Sirius told him. She decides to go with him because she thinks he's being silly. Result? Werewolf Lily. Dumbledore would silence her and Snape to protect Remus, and that would be the push to turn Lily dark, furthered along by Dark Magic, which she starts using now that she doesn't trust Gryffindors as much, and is much more willing to listen to her best friend. Her motivation could be anything, from revenge to reforming society. Lily is basically a non character in canon anyway, so it's basically impossible for her to be OOC.

**** Isn't it? There's also the fact that there's an easy way to set them up as an independent power and gain soldiers pretty quickly, without resorting to cheap cop-outs that go against the spirit of Harry Potter as a series like using guns: Potions. Snape and Lily are both established in canon to be Potions geniuses, with Snape being the most talented Potion's student Slughorn has ever taught. Being afflicted could be the motivation for them to invent Wolfsbane earlier than it was in canon, and they could use that to lure the werewolves to their side. Add an original potion, whose effect would be that it would allow someone to turn into a werewolf outside of full moons, and you've got yourself a powerful army of magically resistant super soldiers, without having to spend years setting it up.
