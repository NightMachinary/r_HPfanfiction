I have been a long time fanfiction reader and recently have had a story idea that has been bouncing around in my head for a few months now. I have hand written most of it and I am in the process of typing it out...I am excited to post my first piece but I would really feel a bit more comfortable putting it out there if I had an experienced Beta reader to take a look at it. It is Post-War and ignoring the Canon slightly/some characters deaths (mainly Snape) and will be a triad between Hermoine/Lucius/Snape. I think so far it is fairly decent but I would so love if I could have another fan fiction fan look it over with constructive criticism!


** I would be happy to help! Having a beta is always super helpful, it always makes me feel more confident in my writing overall

*** Thank you so much! I can't tell you how much I appreciate it! I have the first few chapters typed up and am close to finishing writing the whole thing out by hand (I figured once I started writing by hand I might as well finish the whole thing in the same creative process that I started it in...) and the more I write and the more I re-read as I type it up gets me excited so I can't wait to hear your thoughts!
