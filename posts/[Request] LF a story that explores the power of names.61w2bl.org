Hey gang! A concept has been bouncing around my head for the last few days and I thought I would run it by you guys!

I've studied a handful of religions and looked loosely over some paranormal studies, etc. One of the big themes that continually comes up is the power found in a name, or the power of naming something. Now, that obviously has a huge presence in HP with Voldemort.

I was curious if there was a fic that actually leant true gravity to the reason why Voldemort should not be named, or if there is some deep magic behind being given a name. Something along the lines of a Robert Langdon story mystery/thriller.

Anyways, thanks for your time!


** In linkffn(Trials of the Stone) whenever Voldemort is spoken, everyone present feels a heavy, dark feeling of /wrongness/. Not the best fic, incomplete (though the last two chapters are fairly recent) and the first several are basically canon rehash. Has magical cores. I'm /fairly/ certain Harry, Ron, Hermione and Daphne are reincarnations of the Founders in some way. Honestly kinda entertaining. It wants to take place from each of their POV's in their different houses.

  (Book 1 of The Founders' Legacy) Harry Potter is no stranger to extraordinary events, so when a giant of a man arrives to tell him he's a wizard, it only confirms what he had already guessed: he is different. However, it isn't until he boards the Hogwarts Express and leaves his old world far behind that he discovers just how different he truly is.

** In linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the lands below) a folklore-based nickname that was given to protagonist Alex begins to change her fate, because the more that name is used, the more it becomes her destiny. Unfortunately the explanation of the naming is at the beginning of the fifth book, which the author is still working on.
