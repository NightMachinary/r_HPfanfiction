I'm re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/13/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries]] (again) and I was wondering if there were any other fics like it (inspired by D&D, or other books or tv series, etc. Building the world in a different direction than canon, basically). Please share your recommendations below.

A brief summary/take on the story - In the story thus far, the worlds used are from D&D, the 9 Realms from Norse Mythology and HP (An AU version of it, though.) Harry and Albus wind up in one of the 9 realms, that is also the Underdark (A la Drizzt, yes.) The story deals with how they got there, whether it was a deliberate choice, where they're going and how to get there and some interesting takes on both magic and weaponry, as well as a lovely twist on Canon Lore to be so much more ... impressive. It really is a good read, though I would keep an open mind for the sake of some poor formatting, and minor grammar issues.
