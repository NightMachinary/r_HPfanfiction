Title is pretty self-explanatory. I'd love to find a good crossover between the two but haven't been able to find any. Preferably It would have Harry in it as opposed to any other characters. Thanks

*** Thanks for the link! Only taken a quick look so far, but this seems really well done, exactly the kind of fic I'm looking for, though I still hope I can get another few good recommendations.

** Oh hell yes my brotha let me give you my list that I just got done with and enjoyed(Note:The child/elfling stories are not in my list, they bore me/confuse me/ arent realistic.Also on mobile so can't link)

- *Not quite a Maia*- No Pairings, Stars Neville(if you're feeling a bit uneasy about it, I was too at the start. Just go with it for a few chapters and you'll be hooked) Quite Funny too.

- *The wizard in the Shadows* - Harry goes to ME for R&R. Yea that doesn't happen. You're gonna want to read this

- *The next great adventure* by Tuare- Short but worth it

- *Boromir's Return*- This isn't a crossover but I wanted to include because it is one of the best LOTR Fan fiction I have come across

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838629/1/Not-Quite-A-Maia][Here]] is the link to Not Quite a Maia, which really is a great story. It does a wonderful job of balancing the humorous and the serious.

** If we're talking specifically LotR /setting/ rather than story then two unmentioned ones are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]]: A fairly vanilla, but well done, Harry-joins-Thorin's-company fic. Pity it's probably gone as far as it will ever go.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]]: Off the wall rec here. Barely a HP crossover really and has basically every Hobbit cliché known to man but it's really nicely written and the characters are great. Also very respectful to Tolkien's mythos.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]]: Just noticed this wasn't recced. It's a crying shame it never really got going.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King][Forging a King]]: Wobbly rec as it goes a bit strange and isn't brilliant but it's a nice idea and it's complete which is pretty much hens teeth in HP/LotR

I also have another HP/LotR fic in planning (I did The Power He Knows Not) but it's a big one and probably a long time away yet.

Incidentally, as someone who generally avoids crossovers (not because of any intrinsic merit of crossovers, but accumulated experience), could you take a moment to explain its appeal to you?

I'm not saying crossovers are bad at all, just curious why one would prefer them over single universe stories.

*** Thanks for the link it looks pretty good at a first glance. I don't necessarily prefer them per-se. I just really enjoy those two universes and would like to read a story which ties them together in an interesting way. I still love single universe stories and generally read them most of the time, just like a change of pace every now and again.

I don't dislike hp X lotr but hp magic breaks lotr all the way. Obviously it depends on the plotline , but the sauron&ring thing is just silly. HP magic is completly out-of-the-world overpowered in the lotr setting. I mean like

- /omg a balorg/
- wait , *avada kedavra*
- /ha/

*** I love how at the end it says many fics don't consider how HP magic works. They do consider it, that's why they use canon harry, who sucks at mind magic and can't travel impossibly long distances with one apparition jump. I also saw one with Harry being good at it but countering it with Sauruman using anti apparation knowledge gained from a tortured captured Sirius as a plausible explanation. But most of the time, he just has never seen the place before therefore he can't apparate anywhere. There are plausible ways to do things without horribly nerfing the characters

Also would a killing curse work on an immortal being?

**** Since the basis of the killing curse is separating the soul from the body it should. It shouldn't work on golems or otherwise controlled but not conscious being. Of course it's implied in canon that harry is not capable to casting it , so yeah bummer .

Still the oneshot i posted was just for the crack , it's short it's fun and it gives a prospective. There are many ways for an author to "disable" the ability [on the top of my head : midle heart has less ambient magic therefore apparition doesn't work , boom done] Otherwise apparition could be still abused even only going line-of-sight.

***** LotR has a distinction between soul 'fëa' and body 'hröa' and that suggests that the Killing Curse would not work on a Balrog as Ainur (angelic beings) don't have either. Ainur have no requirement for a body and instead are one element, ëalar or being.

Thus it's entirely reasonable to assume that the Killing Curse would not work as they don't have a true 'body' to be separated from. Their body is just a manifestation of their soul.

The assumption that HP magic flattens LotR is simply based off a shallow understanding of Tolkien's Legendarium. The only thing that could really break LotR is Apparition as even the Valar have to walk places to get there (though they can do it extremely quickly ). Of course unlimited fanon Apparition breaks pretty much any setting so that's hardly unexpected.

Ah yes. Thank you. I got confused between how to train a dragon and the inheritance cycle books.

I had trouble with this story. The writing style didnt work for me, but thanks for the rec anyways.
