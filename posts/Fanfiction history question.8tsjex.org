Anyone know which fic popularized Tomarry and Harrymort pairings? Particularly with the horcrux connection making them soulmates and drawn to each other, rather than the complete opposite that occurs in canon. Or which was the first for the trope that harry gets sent back to Riddle's time and falls in love.


** I don't know the answer to your question, but maybe exploring the communities and info [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry/Voldemort][here]] could help (in case you haven't checked it out already).
