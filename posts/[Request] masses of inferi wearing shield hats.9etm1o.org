  If you're sticking to canon abilities an army of Inferi wearing shield hats would be enough for the mass killing after teleporting wizards assassinate the leaders.

I like this idea random dude that commented this


** Pa and I never thought we'd see the end of the world. Thought for sure that day the sun would rise and fall just like every one before it. But that was when things were normal. That was before /they/ came.

We were sippin' our morning vodkas (judge your own life choices) when we saw some strange figure come over the horizon. From a distance, it was no big deal. I seent a homeless man walking around with a trashcan around his lower body like a wannabe Grover once. This guy has the strangest hat on. Ugly thing, even from far away. It looked like a hat a taxidermist-turned-designer would've made, a bona fide stuffed vulture cap.

As they got closer, ambling towards our house in slow, erratic steps, its body hobbled as if they had a bad back, we gasped as we clearly saw it was a goddamned zombie heading for our house.

"Don' worry, Marge. I always keep muh shotgun no more than ten feet away at all time. Fer situations like this of course," Pa said to me, grinning as he grabbed the twelve gauge from beneath the table between us on the patio.

Pa lazily waited for the zombie to slowly get closer. Once it was within fifteen feet, he said, "I been waitin' decades fer this."

Gruesome though it was to be, a morbid curiosity kept me looking at the zombie clad in that horrid hat. Pa took aim and fired, causing me to flinch away, eyes shut.

"Uhg..." I heard, followed by a sickening gurgling sound. I opened my eyes to see Pa on the ground, clutching his wounded chest, blood gushing out.

"Goddamn ricochet. Always knew them liberal scientists would make sumthin to attack the Second Amendment." Those were his last words.

I screamed, begging him to stay with me. The zombie was watching us oddly, as if curious about people.

"How could you kill my husband you zombie?" I screamed at the decayed, ugly thing.

"Inferi," it groaned.

Shocked it could talk, I asked, "What?"

"You call us zombies. Don't mislabel us smoothskin. We are corpses animated by dark magic, zombies are just magical beings," it said almost casually.

"What's the difference?"

It groaned again, causing part of its mouth to break off its body.

"It's shit like that which brought us to this. With these hats, we will overthrow the the tyranny of the Smooth Ones. Your guns and your spells are no match for us," the Inferi said with certainty. Looking down at my now dead husband, his bullets having been rebounded upon himself, I couldn't help but shiver in agreement. The existence of magic was practically accepted without issue, I was talking to the undead.

"Wait, 'us'?" I asked, knowing the answer from the god that is television but hoping desperately that I was wrong.

The Inferi laughed wickedly and gestured behind it. From beyond the horizon came multitudes of similarly ugly, nearly identical Inferi (oops, racism) all wearing the magical hats.

"Yes, Us," it said with an expression of ecstasy.

It was then that I despaired, wishing that I had been kinder in my hasty assumptions about Inferi being Zombies...

** I assume it was from the age old muggles vs wizards debate, which I really can't be bothered with right now, but alright.

Just this point.

Granted, inferi would be horrifyingly effective as psychological warfare (assassinating world leaders, popular entertainers/musicians/idols etc or someone's family and sending them as inferi), but after the initial losses, it's very easy to counter them especially if they're let loose without wizarding help. Even assuming very good shield hats that shield from fire too, a high wall or a pit definitely does it.

If it's a high death count you want, there are much easier ways of going about it, the most effective of which would probably be setting a few dementors unchecked in a lot of cities. Invisible, soul sucking creatures allowed to freely feed and breed? Game over. Fiendfyre in a few capital cities would also be enough, as it'd be impossible to stop and would grow the more it consumed.
