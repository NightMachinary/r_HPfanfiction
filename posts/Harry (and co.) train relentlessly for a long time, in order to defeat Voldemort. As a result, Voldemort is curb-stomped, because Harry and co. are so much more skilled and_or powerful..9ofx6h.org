Bonus: a new, contrasting antagonist rises to replace Voldemort, who is such a non-threat at this point, that the main characters realise how much shit they are in.


** I actually remember a story like this I read a very long time ago. Harry and co travel into a painting at Hogwarts to train with the Founders and break their collective dicks off in Voldemort at the end pretty much effortlessly.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE

**** It could be! It's been years since I read it, it actually only stands out because I'm pretty sure it's one of the first fan fictions I ever read.

*** I think it's meant to be handled more as crack than anything? A parody to the countless super-powered Harry fics out there...

***** Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that crack was just a really stupid idea the characters pretended to play straight. I mean, I guess /Seventh Horcrux/ wasn't predicated on a horrible idea but the characters /did/ pretend to play it straight. Then again, I suppose there is crack that is more the author trying to communicate their amusement to the audience. That generally ends up with them almost sounding - or feeling, perhaps - like they are talking with or at least at the audience.

I guess the most important part is that it's funny, anyways.
