I just think Harry with Superman's powers would be cool. Has anyone done it?

â€‹

Thanks for your help.


** Man, I certainly never expected to recommend Megamatt fricking 09...

(and by recommend I mean I can't link to anything they've written cause rule 8, but you can google it!)

there are also a few other HP/Justice League crossovers, but its been so long since I read them, I can't remember which is which.

*** Honestly unless you get your rocks off to poorly developed relationships and a lot of lemons that are near identical then its not worth anyone's time checking him out.

*** Nope, he actually has some that are linkable. Including one with no sex scenes at all. Which bizarrely was actually entertaining and funny. But Harry wasn't Kryptonian in that one.

Kind of sucks that you basically can't use Supergirl as a romantic pairing for crossovers anymore because of him.

***** More that due to being slightly obsessed he's basically cornered the pairing. Seriously, I think he accounts for ~90% of the instances of the pairing on AO3.

Readers that don't like him avoid the couple; I'm sure I'm not the only one that has a hard time realizing it isn't one of his when I read the tag.

**** The thing about him that his quality has a very very strong downwards trend. His early works like Ascension and Emerald Flight where quite good despite the less stellar smut scenes but later... let's say works, if u can call it that, are... I don't know what to call it they r so bad it's not even funny.

***** I completely agree with you on that. My theory is that he's bored with writing smut, but needs the page views and Patreon subscribers too much to risk trying something else.

But I may be giving him more credit than is deserved.

****** Maybe.

Don't know if I should admit it but he was the who got me over my hp-xover adversion.

I think he /has/ the potential for way better stories but I think the whole patreon number has screwed up his motivation and inspiration. It transformed a writer with, at very least, a medium of talent and good ideas in a clickbaiter...

*** Oh, him? Good lord.

I tried to read the superboy one and I just... couldn't. The first lemony scene was so. much. cringe. Is the author a virgin? Or twelve? Because the smut scenes didn't even have the decency to be /funny/ to go along with the horrible.

**** If you're talking about the Young Justice one, then the sex scenes actually really drop off in quality about 6 scenes in. Except for the Miss Martian ones. Those were at least somewhat entertaining.

Shame. The setup he had was neat. Some of the non-sex scenes are actually good. It could even have been a good harem if he'd limited it to the Superwoman family and Fairchild.

But it's a pokeharem with terrible sex scenes instead.

  Lord Voldemort sneered at the thought of a mere child being the cause of his downfall once again. No wizard could defeat him, for he was immortal; he was a god! Unfortunately for him, Harry Potter was not a wizard. He was an alien, a son of Krypton, and if one of them was a god, it was him. Voldemort was right about one thing though: a mortal stood no chance against a god. ONESHOT.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32735/Datatroll+Four+people+with+horrible+luck+Vegas+WTF.htm][4 People With Horrible Luck + Vegas = WTF]] is one of the few completed ones, and is entertaining. It's a Bloody Brandy so marriages and power shares abound.
