It hurts to read Luna like that. Write her as a sweet, innocent child who believes in these tales due to a slightly insane father who she adores.

** Depending on the fic, Amelia Bones is who pops into my head. 8 times out of 10 if she has a positive role in the story she gets Harry away from the Dursleys and the obviously Manipulative!Dumbledore, sets him up with Susan to have a friend and/or love interest who actually cares about him, gets him his Lordships, etc etc. Usually in record time too. Meanwhile she's also perfectly fair, incorruptible, always appreciates Tonks because we have to have that, and in general is usually a plot engine with tits and a monocle more than a character, but what character is there is usually a Mary Sue.

Not to say that it's all bad, when done well I like an Amelia who's portrayed as the supposed incorruptible figure of justice, but if everything just works out perfectly it's boring. That kind of Amelia should have obstacles that require compromises or sacrifices, rather than her steamrolling the Wizengamot and others every time.

God, I hate the Susan characterisation in those fics. Because 9/10, she is just a pretty pair of tits who acts as a connector between Harry and Amelia Bones, who sorts out the plot while Harry gets to grope her niece. Very rarely she gets a characterisation which goes beyond what she and Harry are doing (eg the DA). I am really tired of that combination of tropes.

I feel like the story could be vastly improved by having it take place over the course of a couple of years, remove the more obnoxious tropes (goblin friend, Harry yelling at everything and everyone and using death threats against his allies/boss, Harry suddenly becoming OP), expand on Harry/Tonks's relationship and give it more developement, and goddamn have Harry call her something other than Nymph, at least outside of the bedroom. Give Harry more of a drive to learn like with the Patronus in PoA, either post GoF or OotP, and have him learn more powerful spells over the course of a couple of years.

- The female version of the insufferably annoying "Ron the Death Eater" trope.
- A convenient MacGuffin that just happens to talk.
- Just as bad a Mary Sue as Hermione can be in fanfics, if not worse.

Lily tends to be the same way, but to a far more extreme extent especially in terms of Mary-Sue-like depictrions

Also, basically every "unused canon character name" that gets turned into basically an OC. Daphne Greengrass is by a very, */very/* long way the most common, usually in bad Slytherin!Harry, Dark!Harry, or similar fics, but on the very, very rare occasion that other such examples crop up, such as Tracy Davis(I can actually count the number of times I've seen fics featuring her on the fingers of one hand), half the time they get the Mary Sue treatment as well.

Snape joined the magical Nazis out of his own free will. He insulted Lily and he lost her due to that. This could have been his wake-up call when he realises what path he is walking down. But no, he joins Voldemort right away.

I honestly don't care what his motivations were, what he did was unquestionably wrong and he had other paths open to him, paths which he knowingly didn't take. With his Potions abilities, he could have made a fortune. But he chose violence and to follow a man whose agenda consisted of genocide and terrorism.

In canon he chooses to continue on the path of being a Nazi, but seeing an alternate path where he reforms before ever joining the Death Eaters could be a decent story. He was just a teenager, after all. People can change, I used to be homophobic as a preteen/early teenager, then I became more accepting, and as I explored my sexuality I found that I'm bi. My politics have changed since I was a teenager as well.

Once he grows up and joins the Death Eaters, especially when he knowingly condemns a baby to death, would be where I'd draw the line on his redemption.

**** I always found bashing of James and Severus for romance reason especially silly since both of them show legitimately dubious traits that you can use to reason why they make a bad love interest. No need to portray the "wrong" choice as a horrible one-dimensional person with no redeemable qualities whatsoever. Also, FWIW, I've always preferred fics that highlight good traits of someone instead of fics that highlight bad traits of everyone that is competition, but even if you don't do this, there's no need for /bashing/.

I've seen a couple of SS/not-LE Marauder-era fics. Most of them doesn't actually bash Lily but shows the fallout as being a result of circumstances and stupid behaviour by Severus, and -- to a much lesser extent, generally -- Lily. Fic authors seem to deem her as utterly forbidden to bash in any way, for some reason (I /have/ seen it, but it's far rarer than most other characters). Even showing her as flawed is rare, but not quite as unheard of.

******* I check SS time travel sometimes but I don't really continue reading the ones where she's bashed so I drop them, so I don't remembr the name. Wrong boy who lived stories bash her as well

But what do you mean by 'perfection'? Can you elaborate more

******** I don't read WBWL, but yeah, I figure those are the most likely stories to bash her. The few I read made her have little to no presence and focused on bashing James, but still.

With perfection, I simply meant the fact that she could do no wrong in people's eyes. Now, since this is SS time travel, we mostly see SS' point of view, and his views on her are obviously biased. But I very rarely see people call her out on being in the wrong about something.

********* I think it's because she doesn't do nothing wrong in canon to begin with. She also has all these positive traits dumped onto her by Rowling and people think that the only things she are are these and decide to increase the traits tenfold (if she's smart make 10 times smart, pretty make 10 times prettier etc).

***** u/Madeline_Basset:

  but in most fics she is the ideal to adhere to who can do no wrong.
#+end_quote

Isn't that her in canon? At least as she's portrayed to Harry second-hand through the recollections of others. Unlike James, whatever flaws she had never get mentioned.

****** Yes, Lily's saint-like status is actually a thing in canon as well. Doesn't mean it doesn't crop up in fanfictions, even those where she's still alive (and thus has the ability to dash people's expectations of perfection by showing actual character flaws).

Treatment of dead people is different -- nobody wants to speak ill of the dead, and considering her status as mother of the Boy who Lived and the catalyst for the love protection raises her status further. Hell, even James got this treatment in canon (aside from Snape) and we know for a fact that he has less than flattering traits as well (SS' memories) that didn't exactly endear him to people he stood against.
