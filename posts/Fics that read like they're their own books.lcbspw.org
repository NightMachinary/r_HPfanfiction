Mind you, I don't mean simply high-quality fics. I've read plenty of those that still rely way too heavily on the reader already knowing the lore/characters/action of Harry Potter series in order to have any clue about what's going on.

I'm curious what fics are there that could be read without having much if any clue about what Harry Potter is about. Only two that come to my mind are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version][They Shook Hands]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle) is the first thing that comes to mind. It's set years after a different wizarding war and is very original.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
