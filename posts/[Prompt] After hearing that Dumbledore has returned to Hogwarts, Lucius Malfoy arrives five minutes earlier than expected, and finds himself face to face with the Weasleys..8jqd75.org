This entered my head a few hours ago, and has yet to leave.

Requirements:

- As long as is necessary, so long as there's a confrontation

- Dobby helping out in some fashion

Bonus:

- Arthur and Malfoy getting into a sword fight instead of a wizard's duel

- The portraits encouraging the fight

- Lockhart deciding to do something courageous for the first time in ever and shepherding the children away from the angry grown-ups


** Dobby Apparated the Weasleys and Malfoy into the kitchens.

"Looking heres! Sirs be cage fighting with butter knives!"

As the elves swarmed around them, piddly little plastic sporks appeared in Lucius' and Arthur's hands.

"Fight! Fight! Fight!" screamed the elves.

"Yes, fight! This is the best thing that's happened down here in years!" cried Helga Hufflepuff's portrait, who by some deus ex machina had arrived in her frame at that very moment.

Arthur, being more experienced with Muggle items, quickly beat Malfoy into submission with the spork, and was carried out of the kitchens on the shoulders of the Hogwarts elves.

"Wait. Where are the children?"

/cut to the Quidditch pitch/

"Lockhart! Get us down this instant!"

"Nonsense, children! You'll be safe up there in those hoops, safe from your angry parents! Well, my job here is done. Toodle-oo."

He then proceeded to run straight into the Forbidden Forest, where he began a 6-year affair with Ronan which ended in an amicable divorce.

**** I'd have put more effort in, but I was busy avoiding doing differentiation at the time. I don't know if you know how hard it is to hide a phone under an open bottomed desk, but Jesus Christ is it excruciating.

Also, any other specific comments? I'm trying to improve my writing skills and would really appreciate constructive feedback.

Actually, the passage might be too short for you to make an accurate decision, but feel free to stroke my ego anyways.

***** Well, I definitely don't want you to get in trouble at work, so I'd avoid that at all costs.

Let's see here....

The narration, though brief, is fluid, and is fairly close to the psudeo-Snicket style of Rowling.

The dialogue of the House Elves is good, though I notice they say "butter knife" and yet the wizards fight with sporks.

The commentary from Helga Hufflepuff was unexpected, but welcome. Though I may suggest someone like Phineas Nigleus, or whatever his name was, may be a more appropriate choice, given his proficiency in biting retorts.

As amusing as the image is--how the heck did Lockhart manage to get the children up in the hoops? He doesn't have his wand and doesn't even know he's a wizard. That said, ironically, the kids may be in more danger if they fall out of the hoops--which fits the humor of the Potter-verse in that any plan ever devised will inevitably go pear-shaped.

So for the most part, this feels like Harry Potter.

The only thing I have real issue with is Lockhat's affair with Ronan. I can't imagine any centaur mating with any wizard.

Oh, and where's Molly during this?

****** First of all, thank you for replying!

Second of all, I'm at school, not at work, but thanks for the concern.

I made the elves give them the wrong utensils as a form of humor, though now I think about it it seems to show that the elves are incompetent, which wasn't what I intended.

Helga was inspired by a fic I read where her portrait actually lived in the kitchens but no one knew because she was always drunk. If I can find it, I'll link it.

I hoped to have a bit of surreal humor in that Lockhart, despite being incompetent and borderline retarded, can still somehow manage to fuck things up for the kids.

I say 'affair', I mean 'involuntary horse dick mpreg ^{^{because}} ^{^{some}} ^{^{sickos}} ^{^{actually}} ^{^{like}} ^{^{that}} ^{^{shit'}}

Nah, that part really wasn't that well planned out. I'll try and do better next time.

I forgot about Molly. Whoops.

** Urgh. I'd like to do a thing where Malfoy draws his sword cane and Harry passes Arthur the Sword of Gryffindor and things escalate into a fight of epic proportions (a pie fight of epic proportions, if the house-elves get involved), but I just can't manage it today...

Sowwy.

*** That's quite alright.

I personally imagine that although Arthur attempts to sword-fight Malfoy, Molly intervenes.

Molly transfigures Lucius into a ferret. And then she transfigures the ferret into a water goblet. And then she smashes the water goblet with a hammer!
