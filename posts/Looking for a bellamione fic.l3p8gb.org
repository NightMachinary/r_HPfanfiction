:END:
I am looking for a bellamione fic I read on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] a few years ago.

The general idea of the fic is that Bellatrix kidnapped Hermione and took her on quest to look for some old type of magic to help Voldemort win the war. The specifics I remember are that they stopped in some sort of Inn, where they were attacked by some sort of plant, and that they also stopped in some pureblood town where Hermione had to blend in. Basically they went through all these tasks to find whatever old magic and fell in love on the way. If anyone has any more information I would love to hear it.
