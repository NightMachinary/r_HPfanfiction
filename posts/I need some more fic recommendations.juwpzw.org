Any Smarter!Harry or Powerful!Harry fanfictions? An OP Harry fic is fine too. If you could recommend me some Fleur/Harry fluff or full on fanfic would be nice as well. Thank you!


** Anytime someone asks for an OP!Harry fic, i have to recommend mine.

Slow-burn powerup, creative combat, action-heavy, and believable. International travel, to places and settings almost never used in fanfics, canon is thrown out the window after First Year.

Just updated it, only 1 more chapter til it's complete. If you read one action story this year, make it linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

**** Its a harem with Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, and Harry/Natalia. The last is an original character. Don't let the fact that its a harem put you off though. I'm not a fan of harem fanfics, and almost missed this story due to that. It isn't like most harem fanfics, where Harry is having a threesome every chapter. There are actually reasons why Harry gets with three women. The worldbuilding is also pretty great. Not to mention Natalia might be one of the best written oc's in any HP fanfic I've ever read.
