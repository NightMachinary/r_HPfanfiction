Because according to her,‚Äù it wasn't nice to make family feel left out.‚Äù So Dudley had the brilliant idea, Of taking the freak with him the next time he went round to Pierre's place and the Bookworm was there.Dudley‚Äòs nine year old was astonished to actually have found a use for harry , Beside Harry hunting.

His cousin made a good distraction so that Pierce and he could play video games without his friends annoying cousin Hermion .


** I can not see Piers Polkiss as Hermione Granger's cousin but I can see another of Dudley's gang as her cousin. Malcolm (no last name given in the books or movies). But like Hermione, Malcolm is a name out of the works of Shakespeare.

**** That sounds more than a little contrived. Early-canon Hermione is socially inept, but she isn't malicious. She would probably end up being the first person in Harry's memory to treat him as a human being, even if she might sometimes be annoying to be around and they would have absolutely nothing in common.

If anything, I'd expect Dudley to be nicer to Harry when she is around, because she can and will tattle to Mrs Polkiss and to her parents, and then Vernon and Petunia might find themselves socially obligated to do at least make a show of punishing Dudley.

I don't expect them to become close friends, but them becoming enemies is a stretch.

***** I'm a bit divided about how Harry would feel about a Hermione he met pre-Hogwarts.

All the points you made are valid, but early Hermione is also someone who is pretty . . . "trusting" about authority figures. I can as easily imagine her annoying Harry to death because "/I heard you climbed you school wall while playing with . . . (Malcom?) and his friends, you should not do that you could have been hurt, or expelled/."

Worse, when they both go to Hogwarts, she could tries to stuck with him because she at least knows him, or talks about subjects Harry does not want to talk about like his family.

So I feel like, if they met before Hogwarts, their relation could really go both ways. Either a bit better because Harry has some fond memory of her and his willing to bear with her or help her make friend, or worse because he 3 several more years worth of memory of her being annoying compared to the rest of the school.

****** I can see that happening, though it'd probably have to come from Polkiss's/Malcolm's mum warning her about Harry based on what she had heard from the Dursleys.

I can see this going in one of two ways, then: either she ends up having an unpleasant exchange with Harry and they spend their time together reading separately, or she sees through the ruse and goes an a crusade to help Harry, possibly without telling him (at least if we want to maximise adversity and conflict).

OK, this could be an interesting sequence of events:

1. Dudley, indeed, does not bully Harry in front of Hermione.
2. But, after Hermione sees through the lie, she tells her parents that Harry is being bullied by his peers and possibly abused by the adults in his life.
3. The Grangers talk to the Dursleys, who deny everything, Dudley's friend's parents take the Dursleys' side (since they are committed to the Harry-as-miscreant narrative), and the whole thing culminates in Hermione no longer being invited to the Dudley's friend's house.
4. The Dursleys take the stress of the situation out on Harry.
5. Two years later, Hermione runs into Harry on the Hogwarts Express, having lived under the assumption that she had fixed the problem by telling her parents, and she tells Harry as much. Harry thus learns that she is the cause of his additional misery two years prior, and tells her as much. Hermione is too proud to apologise.

[[/u/CommanderL3]], I stand corrected: your idea could work, and work well.

Regarding Hermione fan, I have a well-known pro-Hermione bias, and I think that she is a much more interesting character than Harry (but only if you don't forget her flaws). However, for me, at least, all that is independent of her relationship with Harry. Most of my favourite fics (such as /Applied Cultural Anthropology/) have them be friendly acquaintances at best, and I prefer the canon pairing to Harmony.

** I don't get the obsession people have with introducing Hermione to Harry before Hogwarts... usually through some contrived scenario, or really odd flukes. The idea has been a thousand times to death, and the particulars of HOW Hermione happens to be introduced early is, for the most part, irrelevant.

Even if they did run into each other earlier, I doubt they would "become the bestest of friends 4 evar". I seem to recall that even meeting her on the train, she was pretty much just that bossy, annoying know-it-all that was pretty much ignored up until the whole troll thing happened.

Sure people cry "But they are both magical, and would recognize that!". Well... no. If accidental magic was that common, that obvious, then magic would not be much of a secret what with all the muggleborns changing peoples hair, teleporting to roofs, regrowing hair overnight, etc. Harry is likely an outlier in accidental magic frequency and visibility due to his home life, and/or child of prophecy, and/or horcrux. I expect most accidental magic boils down to easily explained accidents and freak chance. Easy to miss, but obviously magic in hindsight once you know magic is real.

So I expect that even if they did meet before Hogwarts, Harry would be uninterested as he was in cannon, and neither would realize they are both magical.

*** I disagree. I see no reason they wouldn't become good friends.

By the introduction to Hermione on the train Harry is at least somewhat aware of his fame and is well on the way of making a good friend (Ron). Hermione is an over achiever who is aware she is an outsider from the get go and already trying to prove her worth. If they met before Hogwarts Hermione whole probably still a book worm know it all would probably not immediately be trying to prove that she belongs. Harry is shown as a pretty friendly kid who is lonely and without friends. Two kids who are picked on and outcasts becoming friends isn't really a stretch of imagination.

I like the trope because I think a Harry/ Hermione friendship early on would be beneficial to both. Hermione would give Harry the dash of real normalcy and a friendship outside of the fame / the world of magic. Harry's friendship with Hermione younger would probably help with the self worth issues and her social skills.

**** I disagree. Hermione, as much as she grew on me, was who she was. She changed a bit throughout the books, but not a lot. She bossed Harry and Ron all the way through and was unerringly annoyed by their lack of certain knowledge. She was 100% Hermione when she first showed up on the Hogwarts Express, and I don't see her being any less bossy and know-it-all(ish) in the few years preceding her introduction to Hogwarts. Besides, how do you explain Harry and Hermione not recognizing each other when they met on the train?

***** I'm not arguing that it's cannon or would fit in without changing cannon, but that it fits their characterization as pre hogwarts children.

I also think your vastly oversimplifying Harry and Hermione as characters. They change and grow over the series which is of course going to happen because they grow up but also as friends they begin to shape one another. I think they could have some growth and give each other much needed perspective from the beginning without drastically altering their characterization. I think Hermione knowing Harry before hand gives him the ability to start with more information. So he goes into the wizarding world more aware of people's pre conceived notions and how he/ his family fits into it. Sure it's information through books but he'd be less clueless, have opinions, and have the ability to emotionally process some of this information before hand. A more grounded Harry Potter, even if still a bad student and clueless would be nice. Especially because I think it makes more sense, Harry is shown throughout the series as being emotionally reactionary but he just takes in being famous and rich and everyone knowing (fake) stuff about him with barely a comment which I always felt was strange. As for Hermione a major complaint for her earlier characterization is she completely lacks perspective (seriously death or worse expelled ) and tends to be over reliant on books, which is something she grows out of somewhat. She could still be a know it all swot but at least she might be slightly more inclined to question information given her. You've got to think books are her only information on this brand new world. Of course she trusts what they say, it's literally her only source. But if she knows Harry Potter, sees how clueless he is from the start and how poorly his family treats him? But then she reads history books with fake characterizations of him or implying he is off being rich and heroic and she knows he's her friend with a bad home life ? Yeah that isn't a child whose going to just accept information from wizarding books without some more fact checking. A Hermione who gets to the point of using books for knowledge but asking questions and seeking others sources from the get go is a character that's fun to think about.

I think where a lot of fanfic that's pre hogwarts fails is that it doesn't explore subtle changes of characterization and how it might change cannon so much as people try to use it as either a way to start a romance or as an attempt at a fix it fix. It gets boring and repetitive because people forget that the characters are freaking 11. Of course Hermione still going to be bossy and Harry will probably be be reckless and both will make dumb mistakes. But I think the idea of them making different dumb mistakes is fun to look at, or things that turn out the same for different reasons.
