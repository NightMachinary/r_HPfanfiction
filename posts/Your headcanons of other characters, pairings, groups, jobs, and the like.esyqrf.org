As it says, it can be headcanons that you came up with, read about and really liked or whatever.

It doesn't have to be canon compliant.


** Does it have to be canon compliant? I pretend the epilogue doesn't exist. That's my headcanon. I rewote the ending mentally.

Non canon compliant ones - * Harry helps tie up loose ends with the remaining death eaters post war then after a nice long vacation becomes a pro quidditch player * Ron takes over the joke shop after Fred's death, he doesn't become an auror * Hermione becomes the youngest minister of magic after working to makes the wizarding world more integrated against other species idk which dept(s) she works for before becoming M.O.M. * Lucius Malfoy and the other death eaters get life in azkaban, Draco gets a short time because he was a kid * New prison system is established separate from azkaban where new criminals go to. Once the last death eater dies azkaban is shut down * Non death eater supporters like Narcissa have to pay fines and lose most of their wealth * Changes are made at Hogwarts where students interact with people from other houses more to prevent bigotry (not sorting till end of 1st year maybe?) * Krum and Hermione get together a few years after the war? Not sure on this one I just don't like the main six dating each other, especially the trio

Canon compliant ones - * werewolves don't suffer and aren't as sickly as Lupin he is an outlier because of his self-loathing * magic is not dark or not dark, intent matters as does performance i.e. Voldemort's body spell/potion is dark not because it calls for items like dead dad's bones and Harry's blood but because they were taken by force * Wizarding world begans to interact with the muggle world

That's all I got right now.

Edit: posted too soon, added some things

** I know it's not entirely supported by canon, but my opinion of Dumbledore is that he's just an idiot Gryff with some political knowledge (from his years of experience after the world threw titles at him for beating his ex-lover in a duel one time) who is massively in over his head and just pretending he's got it all figured out while inwardly having no idea what he's doing.

His legends say he's like Machiavelli and Merlin and that he's all these grand, superior adjectives, but internally he's just winging the heck out of life and hoping for the best because he thinks that what he's doing has to be done for everyone's sake and he doesn't know who else to trust. Garnish all that with a guilt-complex bigger than Harry's from his family in general and his sister and Grindelwald specifically and boom. Albus etc etc Dumbledore.

Also that the Veela are chaste as fuck, because I like the irony of a massively fetishised race of sex-kittens being Romeo-and-Juliet level hopeless romantic isolationists.

I kinda think this, part of overchoice, they have too many people throw themselves at them and either can't decide or are bored by the whole thing and would prefer a more mutual chase/back and forth.

(I also like your interpretation of Dumbledore)

** I'm reluctant to answer this question because of how hard I stan certain things (think i've written more than I ever did in college on this stuff haha).

but outside of my ride-or-die faves that I write about, let's see:

-there isn't a psychedelic drug out there that luna hasn't done

-hufflepuff has a lot of theatre kids

-audrey weasley is a stand-up comedian/writer and no one understands how her marriage to percy is so successful (except for the two of them of course)

-muggle studies sucks as a class because they don't teach useful things like how to use the tube or anything fun like pop culture

  Ted and Andromeda, newly married, have fled to Verona to seek cover within the chaos of Carnevale and avoid a doomed fate in war-torn wizarding Britain. But some consequence still hangs in the stars. Winner of DLP's 2019 Q4.1 competition.
