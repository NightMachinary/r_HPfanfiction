I've read a lot of fanfics at this point, but I feel like I haven't exactly run into this concept yet. Which is a shame because it has the potential to have a huge amount of room for character development. I mean, many times Death Eaters claim that muggles aren't even humans or are no better than animals. Why not place them in the situation where they have no choice but to /be/ a muggle?

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 47 posted.

** I'm currently writing a scene where Harry, Sirius, and Bellatrix are hiding out in a hotel. Anything in particular you'd like to see in such a scene besides amazement at the television ('cause I've already included that)?

**** I can definitely do room service, or at the very least pizza delivery. I have been writing it as kind of a dumpy hotel because they're very desperate at the time, but I might reexamine that :)

*** That definitely sounds like an interesting premise! Is this a stand-alone scene or part of a fic? And weell I definitely like reading wizard reactions to the Internet, too! I think I would like to read what you have when you finish. :)

**** It's part of a longer fic I'm working on for NaNoWriMo ... unfortunately it's set in 1992 so I can't include the internet :( I am sorry.

** I vaguely recall one where several DEs were sharing a house and the most competent one was grumbling about he people not doing the dishes or flushing the toilet, and also transporting them around in a Morris Mini. It might have been something from Bobmin IDK
