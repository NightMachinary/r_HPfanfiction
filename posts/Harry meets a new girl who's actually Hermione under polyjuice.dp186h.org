:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all,

I'm trying to recall the name of a fic that was written about Harry meeting and starting to have feeling for a new girl.

One of the later chapters has the girl and Hermione in the same scene which confuses the girl (Hermione in disguise) and once Hermione corners Harry to beg him not to invest too much into the girl, Harry dismisses her. Turns out that Hermione used a time tuner to go back in time that made that scene possible.

Appreciate if anyone can link me back to that story!

** I could get into a story where she uses a time turner to be this new person and ends up with harry. god that would be all sorts of fucked up if they tried to be together but then he realized she wasnt real or hurt him and then hermione tried to make him feel better. ugh no angst pls

Time stuff happens and hermione ends up back with hermione and harry around 5th year. without giving a lot away the plot of old hermione dealing with new hermione and their relationship with harry is pretty good imo.

Hear me out.

If a dude polyjuices into another man and has sex with that man's wife, rape by deception. If a woman polyjuices into a man's wife and has sex with him, again rape by deception.

But if they don't know each other then how is it different from a woman wearing elaborate makeup, a wig and a push up bra?

It's like going to s party and having sex with a girl in a costume, only to find out after it was a friend of yours; only in this case even worse, because it's not one night, it was a long, drawn out relationship during which time she masqueraded as another person and went to extensive lengths to deceive.

  Harry Potter hated the attention his fame produced but when a worthy muggle charity can benefit from that fame, he reluctantly agrees to enter a bachelor's auction. Little did he suspect that Hermione has had her sights set on him for quite some time
#+end_quote

This is the story's summary. I haven't read the story, so here's what my imagination cooked up:

1. Hermione has been attracted to Harry for a while. He's oblivious because Harry.
2. Instead of just being honest, forthright, etc., and asking him out on a date, she cooked up a scheme:

Hermione: Hey, Harry, thought about benefiting this muggle charity in their bachelor auction?

Harry: Sure, why not. Why are you brewing so much polyjuice?

Hermione: Oh, no reason /smirk/.

1. Hermione buys Harry while under polyjuice. Harry and fakedate hit it off, meet up multiple times. Harry starts to become invested in the relationship. Hermione is a deceitful ho.

2. Instead of her deceit destroying both their romantic relationship and their friendship, Harry probably forgives her because Harry.

Questions: Why is Harry Muggle-famous? Why is Hermione a sociopath?

Agreed, which indicates that you may have missed my point. Pretending to be someone else to convince someone who wouldn't normally have sex/a relationship with you to do so is very different from dressing or looking different than your usual.

********** Ah I understand your assuming that they wouldn't normally have sex with you.

In the original example that started this, Hermione polyjuices herself to look different. It is never stated that she looks like Cho or anyone we know, so it could be assumed she took a hair from a random muggle as Harry did to attend Bill's wedding.

I also think it's plausible Harry would have sex with Hermione as herself. IMO It's only Hermione's hang ups that stop her from that, possibility thinking she isn't good enough for the chosen one.

Therefore in my assumed scenario, Hermione eventually comes clean and we get the sappy romantic comedy ending where Harry says, I always knew it was you Hermione and I figured you would tell me when you were ready...

*********** It does seem that we were looking at this from completely different perspectives, which is probably silly since neither of us have read the fic in question. I'm seeing it as, "here's Hermione, someone Harry sees like a sister, going to great lengths to pretend to be someone else for the purpose of having a relationship with Harry." It's a huge breach of trust, massively deceptive, and - assuming it's a sexual relationship - rape by fraud. If one of my friends did something similar (assuming they could, lacking magic and all), I would feel violated - devastated, even.

It absolutely could be a rom-com trope, though, if Harry figured it out before they became intimate and went along willingly.

******** First of all, don't assume everyone gets your movie/book/whatever reference. I don't know what Revenge of the Nerds is or if what some Lewis did was or wasn't ok. From what I can guess, it probably wasn't.

Which leads to my second point. Do you feel that killing someone is rape? Is stealing something rape? I would say no, but your post pretty much equates "doing something wrong" with "rape". Don't be stupid.

Now, if you feel that this post is a touch biting, it might - just might - have something to do with the fact that you implied that I condone scummy behavior, up to and including rape. Just a thought.

So, to give you an answer, even though I don't believe you actually want one, no, I haf not heard of "rape by fraud" before. I just looked it up and found it to be an interesting but definitely complicated and delicate topic.

If you are naked and blindfolded on a bed and someone comes in that acts like they are your spouse, then yes, that could be seen as rape. If you are at a masquerade and sleep with someone that you believe to be your spouse without any sort of communication, however, it is not. That is you being an idiot.

Now, in this case, magic gets thrown into the mix, which makes everything more complicated. But, without having read, I would say it's the typical thing where the person you sleep with is not who they said they are. The thing where a character suddenly finds out that their love interests isn't actually rich but dirt poor or that they used to be a different gender or that they used to know them and but simply didn't recognize them. As such, I'd say it isn't rape.

Consent based on deception is called /fraud/. Consensual sex based on deception is - gasp - /rape by fraud/. Consent given under false pretenses isn't consent.

************ The issue you are having in this conversation is people other than you are separating the issues while you are combining them. The sex can be entirely consensual while the situation around it is hurtful. If I consented to have sex and it was with someone I wouldn't normally want sex with in a disguise, I wouldn't call the sex rape, but would call it deeply hurtful.

Getting sex by pretending to be a person the target is in a sexual relationship with would be rape by fraud, but sex I consented to with some random person who turns out to be someone I know isn't rape in my opinion, just hurtful in other ways.

Pretending to be an entirely different person, possibly - depending on circumstance. I'm not going to get into the intricacies of what circumstances would and wouldn't count, as they're literally endless.

Pretending to be an entirely different person to someone you know, who wouldn't normally have sex with you, and convincing them into a sexual relationship predicated on their belief that you're somebody other than who you are - yes. That would constitute rape-by-fraud.

If Harry meets “Susan” and decides to sleep with her, Hermione didn't commit rape imo. I'm not sure if that happened in the real world you could make a compelling argument that would get someone convicted.

Rape by deception imo is only possible when you trick the person into having sex with someone they would already normally sleep with like a spouse or partner.
