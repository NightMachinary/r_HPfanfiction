I love reading Hermione-centric fic but really don't like her with Ron and I'm bored of her with Draco. What is the best Hermione-centric fanfiction without Ron/Hermione or Draco/Hermione you read or the strangest ship you read her in? I'm really curious.


** One nice thing about [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse by White_Squirrel]] is that it is Hermione/George. Among many other things.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  One person can make a difference: sometimes large, sometimes small. This is the story of a young witch who died under mysterious circumstances and woke up in a completely different world - a world she would change just by existing. Follow the journey of Hermione Granger as she walks the path to becoming Hermione Thranduiliel, the Elvenqueen.

** Both of these stories pair Hermione with Tom Riddle. I'm not fond of this ship myself, but these are the exception to the rule. The writing and characterization are so on point that I feel obliged to recommend them both.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
