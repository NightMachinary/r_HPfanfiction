So, there's a conversation a few posts back that discusses the dual interpretations of Dumbledore as good, failing, and moustache-twirlingly evil. I weighed in with my interpretation and now I'm curious for fics of it.

I prefer the guilt-ridden guy in way over his head interpretation of canon. He's just a teacher (and an 'idiot Gryff') who defeated his old crush/friend in a fight once and got massive political power out of it. He still feels guilt from his family history and Grindelwald getting out of hand with a dash of 'all these students look too damn young' responsibility-feelings, so he tries, but he's just a magically powerful and well-studied transfiguration teacher, not Machiavelli or the 'second coming of Merlin' that his Legend has been built up to display him as. Kind of like a nicer version of Ciaphas Cain from Warhammer 40K, if you know that reference. I really like the idea that he's picked up hiding his emotions and being enigmatic from being in politics for so long, but inside he's basically winging it and hoping nobody notices because he sees the things he's doing as too important to trust to anyone but the people who he knows definitely aren't with Voldemort (Himself, Snape, and possibly Hagrid and McG).

So, does anyone have any fics of well-meaning and tired, guilt-ridden old man Dumbledore who isn't Machiavelli or the Second Merlin but he tries anyway? I can only recall one time travel one where it pops up briefly after Harry considers mentioning Ariana during a moralising debate with Dumbledore, but rejects doing so because Dumbledore is a nice old man who's trying to make up for the worst moment of his life - I think this is also the fic where Pub Dumbledore (I can't recall his name atm) tells Harry that it was Albus who killed his sister, just in case he needs to use that information to stop him from getting too manipulative and involved. Also can't recall the name of the fic either.


** Pub Dumbledore = Aberforth Dumbledore.

I'm trying to write this Dumbledore into my fic, though struggling with it, so, mostly, have him acting off-stage. He has confided in Nicolas Flamel maybe a little too much in my fic and now that is going to come back in unexpected ways.

****** Thanks! It is long... 139 chapters, 400k+ words and counting. Dumbledore plays a very minor role... he appears in the first couple of chapters and then is off stage with brief mentions here and there. Flamel appears first in chapter 138.

Some of my readers have assumed that I'm going to head into Dumbledore bashing, but that is not my intention. I do struggle with some of the facts of canon - leaving a baby on a doorstep and not checking on Harry until he arrived at Hogwarts. Writing this fic is helping me process a lot of my questions.

** That's actually exactly how I'm trying to write Dumbledore in my fic, Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting. At his heart, he's an eccentric old man who likes to fuck with people. He doesn't trust himself with power due to his ex-friendship with Grindelwald, which is why he doesn't perform any major power plays in the political arena. He wants to stop Voldemort only because he feels deeply personally responsible for the person that Tom Riddle became and is trying very hard not to repeat his past mistakes in the current era.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** My headcannon is that the entire wizarding Britain has the politics of a small town. You know the one town seems to always be squabbling over if they should expand the horse-trails and whose water board always seems to be under threat of takeover by the state due to incompetence and the fact part time political operatives really can't run that kind of infrastructure.

And Dumbledore is the one guy who has the potential to leave his local political circle and progress on to become a state senator or congressman. Not "He is so amazing he could lead the nation" or anything like that, just that he would be good enough to play at that level, if that level exists.

And he is surrounded by people who certainly are not good enough to play at that level.

​

He isn't an Olympic athlete out of his element, he is simply the guy who played small time ball who now runs the local ball club and looks amazing next to all the high schoolers he is trying to teach.

*** I kind of understand what you're getting at with Dumbledore, but I don't think most of that scenario really translates too well to British Culture - I had no idea any of that was even a thing in the US outside of Hollywood, like Solo Cups and Shithead Fraternity Shenanigans.

Though our local governance system is obnoxiously complicated due to having being modified, made-up, and blatantly stolen from various sources over the centuries, we don't really have 'town councils' like you do. I can give you the full rundown if you're interested, but suffice to say that our modern local governance is done on a county and district basis (meaning it looks after multiple towns, villages, and areas across a larger region) and older local governance was usually more centralised too - Vestry committees, Manorial courts, and Hundred Courts, each of which simply did as the Landowner, Elected/Rate-payer citizen or Church Authority told them, which in turn mostly did as the higher ups told them. A lot less decentralised decision-making here, with more governance and management tasks than Operations or Legislative powers. Though, that all does vary. Like I said, obnoxiously complicated.

**** I wasn't trying to do a british comparison (thus the ballgame reference), although it might be interesting to put it in British terms. "He governs only 4000 people? I'm the prime minister, I'm not supposed to decide what to do with a fucking mayor"

​

​

The US is also very complicated, due to the fact that the primary authority is the states (and there are 50 of them), and each has its own definition of what powers it devolves to local governances. Here in California, we have counties that are defined by the state that cover all land, managed by an elected body, who are in charge of things unless another local body has authority (governor of last resort basically). Then you have cities (Charter & General Law, which are different), School Boards, Water Boards, Air Boards or other institutions generally defined by state law. Oh and the transit authorities. They are supposed to be in charge of trains, but it is usually a slow moving train wreck. The US hasn't quite figured out the public transit thing yet.

​

Generally though, your local authority is your city, unless you don't live in a city, then it is your county. Yay?

​

It is complicated everywhere.

***** Indeed you weren't, that was my point. I was trying to say that, as a British person, I didn't really have any experience of the kind of thing your scenario showed as it isn't a thing here and I've never seen it outside movies. Same with my comment on British Local Governance complexity. I wasn't trying to imply any superiority or undue intricacy to the English system specifically, it was just an example of how British system differs (no town council and what we have instead) and a mildly tangential ramble about how we got there (our system being complicated from evolving through history).

I'm not terribly good at reading tone into text, but I'm worried I might have offended or insulted and I apologise profusely if my phrasing came across as such - it wasn't my intention, but I've been known to be a tad indelicate at times.

Thank you for covering US Government forms though, that was really interesting. I know about things like the State Legislature from John Oliver skits, but I had no idea about the various Boards and such.

****** No you were fine, it is interesting to put it in the British context, because that is the comparision the characters would make should they draw this.

I'll be honest, I think it would be more interesting to resolve the muggle/magical fighting debate with 'the magicals might be more powerful but the muggles are just so much more competent'. I mean, even if you take the 'spells wins over guns' position, it's clear that that JK's world operates at... well a childrens book level.

The complexities of managing hundreds of millions of people just requires a certain level of competence in the government, even if you think it is doing poorly. I mean, just look at what 'managing the press' counts as in HP.

Or even something like corruption, taking bribes in the HP universe is basically out in the open.

I think that it would be more intersting than just saying 'guns vs magic, guns win'

******* All very true. Though honestly my main argument for Muggles winning would be sheer numbers. Quantity has a quality of all its own and all that. If you've gotta yell 'Avada Kedavra' every time you want to kill someone, a sufficiently determined force with decent dodging instincts would eventually get you so long as they outnumbered you significantly enough. 'We can administrate you to death' sounds fun, though. Totes a fic that'd bring Percy to the Mundane side of things. Just wait 'til he hears about the paperless office. :D

That kind of simplicity you talk about does seem to be built in to the kind of magic system Rowling used. A lot of our societal complexity (in Britain, anyway) came from the rapid centralisation of society during the Industrial Revolution. We very suddenly went from cottage industry hamlets to massive sprawling cities and that adjustment caused massive upheavals in pretty much everything here. That would never happen with magic - primarily because mass production would never be needed, but also because one dude with a decent transfiguration grade can make pretty much everything they'd need. Like a computer shop industry, I suppose. Though that would also be an interesting fic. What would a magical Industrial Revolution look like in the Harry Potter world and what effects would it have?

It's what I got from his lines, anyway. :) As always, YMMV.

Winking or preening or some such afterward would change the tone of the line.

This might actually be motivation for me to go back and reread the books! I'd check the movies, but.., uh, the calmly yelled GOBLET OF FYAH moment kind of makes them not terribly... optimal in that regard.

******* My impression across the board in canon has always been that he is perfectly aware that he's a genius. He doesn't need to put on airs to stroke his ego about it like Lockhart does, though. It's just... a part of who he is. He has an epic beard, and he also so happens to have an epic mind. He knows he's too smart for his own good on occasion, and that no matter how brilliant one is mistakes will still happen and omniscience is unattainable, so he doesn't put all of his identity and trust in his own genius. He's humble, legitimately humble. He doesn't put himself down, pretending he's not intelligent, he just knows his own strengths and limitations.

I actually learned a lot from him as a character in my own maturation, which is why I noticed it. I am myself more intelligent than most, and I've struggled with it. Dumbledore gave me a good, honest example of someone who literally is always smarter than everyone around him, but is also humble about it, without being excessively and disingenuously self-deprecating.

** This makes much more sense than many of the other versions of Dumbledore I've seen.

Though Ciaphas Cain was based on George McDonald Frasier's character, Harry Flashman. in both cases the stories worked because they were written in the first-person as the "autobiographical" memoirs, "truthfuly confessing" the reality behind the pretend-hero. That's the only way they can work, as from any other PoV you're only seeing the heroic facade.

Perhaps it can be done with Dumbledore if you have a story set decades after the book canon. In which a historical researcher interviews his portrait, and gets to hear a story very different to the one they were expecting to hear.
