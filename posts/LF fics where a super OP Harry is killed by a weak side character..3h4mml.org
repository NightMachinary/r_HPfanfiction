Like for example godlike Harry is insanely powerful, then Colin Creevey just comes from behind and stabs him in the throat. Possibly as a sudden story end instead of abandoning.


** I don't know of any such stories, but are there any stories where Harry /becomes/ the next generation's Voldemort, and the story is about defeating and destroying him?

*** I can't remember the name, but there was a fic where Harry gets pulled into an alternate dimension where the generations are a bit wonky, and that universes Harry is a dark Lord with a pro muggleborn agenda, and Tom Riddle is his boy-who-lived. Title was something about Campione, I think?

** I read one where Harry got run over by an ice cream truck... It's more of a parody.

** I don't think any of the writers of OP Harry have any endings in mind like that... Nor do I think there's been any written, I could be wrong though.
