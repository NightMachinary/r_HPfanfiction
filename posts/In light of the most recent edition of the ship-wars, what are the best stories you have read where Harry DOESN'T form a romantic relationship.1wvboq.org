Alternatively, you could also post your recommendations for stories where although Harry does form a romantic relationship, it's more of a "by-the-way" sort of thing, rather than an integral part of the story. Kind of like the original books


** A very quick run through of my favorites list, here are a few I found.

** I always liked Make a Wish and it's sequel Back in Black. Can't remember the author, but I remember it was a very long story, quite odd but good. Basically Harry, thinking he's going to die at Voldemorts hands, decides to live first. And then there is hilarious timing, coincidences and shenanigans.

Also, if i remember correctly Trinity (I think it's called) by Katling (hope that's spelled right) was a fantastic read with no romance. It's one of the first fics I ever read, actually, and remains a favourite.

*** Youre thinking of Rorshach's Blot ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot]]) for the MaW and BiB. I really like those two.

** I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] which I really enjoyed - it's a 'what if Snape had retrieved Harry from the Dursleys' instead of Hagrid' story, really well written and thought out (she brings up a lot of problems with the magical world, then solves them!) and there's a sequel :)

** I think a relatively unknown story that fits this category is *Timely Errors by Worfe.* This is a Harry going back to the Marauders-era fic that is amazingly well written with an unique concept that draws the attention of the reader rapidly. Well worth a read!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/][The Basement]] by Marz1. Third Year AU; has an unfortunately abandoned sequel. (For some reason, having just looked at it for the first time in a while, it's appears to all be in bold font. Don't know why, don't recall it being so the last time I looked, but thought I'd mention it. Regardless of this formatting issue, it's a good fic.)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/][A Different Fate]] by lordhellbore: "JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Avada Kedavra cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou. My favourite fic that shows the strength of the trio's friendship, but it's far from fluffy. Warnings for drug abuse.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/][Harry the Hufflepuff]] by BajaB: "Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story."

[[http://web.archive.org/web/20050215071817/http://www.schnoogle.com/authors/lostgrl/SS01.html][The Smallest Stars]] by lostgrl: "On the infamous night of the Voldemort's fall, the presence of a magical creature greatly changes the future of the wizarding world. Several years later, a strange child appears in Draco Malfoy's nursery. This new playmate calls himself Harry, and has control of a magic Draco has never seen before. Eventually, despite Harry's attempts to stop it, Draco begins to grow up, and Harry is forced to follow, if kicking and screaming all the way."

And I second [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]], as mentioned by[[/u/AGrainOfDust]].
