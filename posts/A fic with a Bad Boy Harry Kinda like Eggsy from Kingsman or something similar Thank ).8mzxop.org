** Eh, arguable but Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) has something of a Bad Boy Harry, if you haven't read / aren't reading it (the sequel is still ongoing). More it's a Super Harry but the Bad Boy aspects are there as well, or at least so I think. Maybe I misunderstand.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** none of these really fit but theirs been 0 links yet so:

runic animagus: linkffn(5087671) for if you want a sterotypical cool/thug/druggy harry who smokes weed cuz its liberating and totes has sex with his girlfriend at end of like every chapter post chaptere 20 but has no smut scenes just fade to black cuz sex is bad but drugs r cool

circular reasoning: linkffn(2680093) if you want an actual bad boy who doesn't hestitate to torture young kids of deatheaters in front of parents to get information, who cuts the face off a muggle to wear as a hannibal lecture skin mask to infiltrate a compound, who is going/ is actually crazy and hates himself for it. ends up working for secret speical OPS in minsitry after time travel shangigangs and lost war vs voldemort but goes off rez, has the addictive dark magic trope, has best writing quality of these fics but very grim dark angst

Denarian Renegade series linkffn(3473224) haven't we all read this one yet? is good, has indy harry who takes shit from no one has Lash in his head. harry character basically has no growth over the series but its entertaining probs the most famous hp/dresdean X-over

deprived linkffn(7402590) abandoned (fic and MC lol) but badass harrypotter bodyguard of fluer in triwizard torunement fic, was decent(?) cant remember many details read it a long time ago
