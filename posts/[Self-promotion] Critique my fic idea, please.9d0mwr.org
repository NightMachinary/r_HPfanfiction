** It looks like what you have here is mostly a character study that one would do in preparation for writing (and isn't a bad one). But you are lacking a plot, an actual storyline. What will she actually do? What happens to create drama? Once you've plotted all that out, then you have yourself a story.

*** That is a really good point. I'll make a mainline comment with what I got in a bit.

Edit: Thanks for getting my gears cranking

** You've got my interest. Do you have a fanfiction.net account? If so, what's your username so I can get a notification when you post the first chapter?

I agree with one of the other commenters, that this is mainly a character study (a really interesting, well-developed one), so you should start thinking about and outlining your plot now. I'll be pretty interested to read this character no matter what situation she finds herself in --- there just has to be a situation she finds herself in.

*** aaaah no, on the whole account thing. I'll need to look into that. I will also definitely need a workable username, since this one is terrible. That subsequent account will need an email and a reddit face.

I will most likely post to reddit once I get two or three chapters going. I can't wait for my first negative review :DD maybe I'll even get called a fag

I'm so friggin' pumped right now

**** Lol. Godspeed! Well, you should reply to my comment with your first chapter when you do post it, in case I miss it on Reddit in a few weeks/months.

** Some plot ideas, since my post didn't actually contain much in that direction:

- Beatrice (working name, roll with it) gets entangled in the Quirrelmort drinking unicorn blood scene, which can go sideways in all kinds of ways.

- Beatrice gets in the way of Harry's rivalry with Draco by antagonizing him /even/ more. She would likely take interest in protecting Neville (who I love dearly, can't get enough neville) due to a combination of Hufflepuff tendencies and anger management issues.

- A werewolf on the school grounds leads to an early discovery of Peter Pettigrew, though I'm not sure if I want him captured or escaping. It depends mostly on whether I need an escaped or exonerated Sirius Black.

- Third year's plot is replaced with an even more werewolf centric story. Remus Lupin features in a strange reverse mentor relationship, as Beatrice teaches /him/ about getting in tune with his primal side. The werewolf that infected Beatrice is on the hunt for her, amongst an unprecedented upswing in werewolf attacks. Is it lazy to use Fenrir Greyback as a central villain?

It is kind of a shame to leave Remus Lupin for third year, being the centric canon werewolf. The only question is how early I want to introduce him. I'm 80% sure Remus and Beatrice would get on /horribly/ at first. He might be revolted to see her eat raw meat in large quantities in a transformed state. She would see a flagellant whose flail is just making the curse worse for himself. There's lots of strong emotions and potential for conflicts and growth. I also kind of want things to work out for Remus.

- A serial killer werewolf (pack) that gains power through ritualistic cannibalism. They target not just humans, but will deliberately infect someone to use the /deeper/ taboo of cannibalizing another werewolf. This is mostly just playing to my strengths, since I ran a "horrors of war" campaign last year and I've been told it was definitely my best work of my 10 years of running RPG's. It might get a little gory, but i'm hopeful I can handle POA's role as the transition in to the darker, more serious stories without /completely/ brutalizing and infecting my cast.
