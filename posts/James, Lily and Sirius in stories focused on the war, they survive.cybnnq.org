I think that my biggest issue with Marauder age fics is the focus on teenage drama instead of the civil war going on and the fact that James and Lily rarely survive. So are there any fics which focus less on the romance and more on the war? Obviously not completely disregarding the interpersonal relationships, but I'd rather not suffer through 200k words on "on-off" relationships and misunderstandings.

James/Lily and Lily/Sirius are fine, but preferably no triads. The less Remus and Snape play a role, the better.


** Quick question, does it have to be during Marauder's Era (73~81) ? Or can it be later, with a longer war where Voldemort didn't die in 81, and the three of them are still alive? Which would be a big AU.

*** I wouldn't mind that either as long as they are in the narrative focus.

** I'll recommend "The hell where youth and laughter go", which is very close to complete but at the moment is left at a cliffhanger.

It follows a lot of characters and there's canon divergence which so far has changed who dies in the war. Stylewise it's a mystery, quite funny and with some horror and thriller elements thrown in. The first chapters were more focused on leaving school and growing up, but it very quickly becomes action packed. The chapters are quite short.

The 'young people at war' elements are done very well. All characters react and suffer from it differently, some barely at all, some go a bit insane and some are suffering with their mental health. There's some violence and fighting but it's not the main part of the story and when it's there it's well-written.

There is an established James/Lily relationship and some of the other characters have relationships that figure in the background of the story. Sirius sleeps around a lot with both women and men in this, I'm mentioning that because I know some people have issues with slash (it's bordering on explicit but only for a sentence here and there in the story).

Snape plays a tiny role but Remus is definitely in the story. Peter Pettigrew is fantastically written in this and there are several others who are only names in canon that work really well here.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
