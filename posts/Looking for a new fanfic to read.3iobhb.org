I'm looking for a new fic, preferably completed. I'm in the mood for one with Dumbledore bashing, but no Weasley bashing.


** Maybe Sympathetic Properties. I wouldn't say it's bashing, but we have the good old trope of Dumbledore stealing from Harry, and Molly Weasley was not too pleased about it.\\

#+begin_quote
  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby comes with his warning, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, and his life, forever. A long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** In my experience nothing good comes from Dumbledore bashing, in fact the best fics are the ones with a really good Dumbledore.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]] has Dumbledore-bashing, but not Weasley-bashing. And it's a *fantastic* read. However, it's a bit old, and it's either dead or dormant...

** I'm reading linkffn(Saving Connor) right now, despite having been extremely skeptical, after I had seen it recommended multiple times. Definitely would recommend.

Dumbledore bashing, and the Weasleys just don't feature prominently.

** Thanks for the suggestion DeeMI5I0. Probobly should have mentioned that I'm not in the mood for slash, and want the Weasleys to be featured prominently. I will bookmark it to read latter, thank you again.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution]]

Not really a marriage law fic, more of a war fic, triggered by a marriage law. Dumbledor bashing at the beginning, but against his portrait, so not really a focus.

** "Bashing" is a subjective term. Dumbledore in canon has done way to many stupid or even evil actions (usually all so some shitty twist or plot could be done, like keeping Harry a poor abused orphan, even if it totally went against his concept as a wise, beenvolent and powerful wizard), the justifications brought up for his (in)actions are rather weak.

These days I usually tend to either selectively ignore what Dumbledore did before my story starts, or change his canon actions to what I think a good, poweful and competent Dumbledore would do. Letting Draco poison and enslave students, for example, is not something he'd do, in my opinion.

My first story though played all his canon stupidity straight. Why would he let Draco poison Ron and Slughorn, imperius and almost kill Katie? Was saving Draco so much more important than saving students not working for the Dark Lord? Why would he let Snape abuse innocent children? Why would he keep Harry in the dark about just about everything? Etc. etc.

It doesn't paint a pretty picture.
