Are there any fics in which the Weasley twins are both romantically involved with the same person? I don't mind if things get particularly kinky and the twins are involved with each other too, but I feel like I haven't seen much of this kind of thing.

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...
