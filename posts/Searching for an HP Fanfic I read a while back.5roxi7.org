A couple of months ago, I read a great HP fanfic a couple of months ago, and am trying to find it again. The plot was something like this: Harry is tired of Ginny telling people that they're together, and he hates her. He brews a potion that forces him to tell his true opinion on something every time someone talks to him. Can you help me find it?


** Is it linkffn(courage by potions by janara)? That's almost exactly how I remember it.

  AU, sixth year story; do not follow the last two books! Sick and tired of the way everyone is trying to force him to become Ginny's boyfriend, our hero is seeking for a way to tell everyone what he thinks of them. Alas, things do not turn out the way he thought they would. No pairings.
