So a long time ago I first found the fic by The Santi, and loved it. One time while googling it as I was about finished I found it on a Russian site called [[https://fanfics.me][fanfics.me]], where the fic was up to 23 chapters I believe. Might have been 32, not sure. Either way, on [[https://fanfiction.com][fanfiction.com]] it only goes up to 12 chapters so I was fairly pleased. Unfortunately, when I recently went back to try and reread it, the page only has a link to the fic. on [[https://fanfiction.com][fanfiction.com]].

Anyone have any clue if the full version that goes up to 20+ chapters can be found anywhere? Although I at first assumed that the version on the Russian site was also posted by the Santi, now I'm considering that maybe that was someone else who decided to continue the fic themselves and it got taken down when someone called them out on it.

Either way, I'm really disappointed that I can't find the long version, and any help would be greatly appreciated. The fanfics.me page says that it was added to one person's private collection, but doesn't say who it was.


** As far as I am aware, the largest number of chapters available is on darklordpotter. You need an account to view it. Iirc it doesn't go up to 20.
