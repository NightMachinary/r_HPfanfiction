Like the title says, are there any fics like these I've linked below? They all feature an older Harry being sad after the war and meeting someone who understands/he can be calm around?

And that one where a near-nameless secondary character falls for Harry when she goes to collect his taxes or something? It's called 'Name falls in love' or something similar. The name has a kind of Wait-ley sort of sound to it. Hadley, maybe?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Took a bit of searching, but I think I've found the story OP mentioned, just in case anyone else is interested

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
