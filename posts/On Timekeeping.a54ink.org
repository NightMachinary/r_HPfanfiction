After reading a lot of fics, it stands out a lot more to me how little we see the subject of exact timekeeping in canon. We know classes start at specified times (as evidenced by Snape's admonishment of Harry's lateness on multiple occasions), but the canon mechanisms behind how everyone actually knows how to get to class on time are more unknown.

Several fanfics invent a bell which rings to signal the beginning and end of classes, like a traditional high school, which makes a lot of sense to me. We do see adult wizards looking at pocket watches, and Harry has his (admittedly very Muggle) wristwatch. And then fanon of course has the /Tempus/ spell.

So what are your views on timekeeping in the Wizarding World? Did a certain fanfic have a unique premise you enjoyed? How in your opinion does the /Tempus/ spell actually work; does it output floating digital numbers, or is it a bit more abstract? Would Draco wear a wristwatch, or is that too modern for a proper Pureblood?

I'm very interested to hear what the community thinks!


** There is a bell in the books, come on!

*** Yeah, it's been bugging me for a week or so now, so I was curious as to see what you guys thought. I'm fairly certain Slughorn's hourglass is a movie invention, though it could always be a throwaway line in HBP I'm forgetting. I don't think we ever see how any of the tasks are from the audience's viewpoint; there have been a few fics which add in viewing screens for the second and third tasks to make things a bit more interesting, I know. A giant hourglass or something certainly doesn't seem out of the question though!

** The movie added a clock tower to Hogwarts so I imagine there's that with an attached bell, like a physical tolling bell, for classes, since students seem to know without asking that lunch is over or classes are about to start. Plus the idea of time/clocks being important is a fairly recent invention, so either wizards just plain old don't adhere to set times and rock up at eeeeh close enough o'clock, or they use the apparently customary pocket-watch all wizards get on their 17th birthday.

** Clocks arent necessarily muggle, certainly not the Weasley clock, so i think we could assume they have wristwatches. Maybe ones that would need winding but dont actually need winding cos magic?

** I might be mis-remembering, but I'm pretty sure there was an instance at some point in the canon, I think /Half-Blood Prince,/ where a bell rings and Harry notes they have to get to class.

** Well, when Harry gets the wristwatch from the Weasleys (in book six i think), Mrs Weasley tells him it's tradition for a wizard to get a watch on their seventeenth birthday. It /might/ be a Weasley family tradition, and i haven't read that scene in an eternity, but i got the impression it was more of a wizarding tradition in general. Especially since the watch belonged to one of Molly's brothers

*** Harry has a wristwatch from the Dursleys. Molly gave him a pocket watch.

**** It actually doesn't seem to be specified. The only thing it notes in DH is that it's "much like Ron's" (the one he got for his 17th, not the wristwatch he had earlier in the series), and Ron's is only described as a "watch" in HBP. I would take this to imply wristwatch, as it seems that's what most readers would assume rather than pocket watch.

** I also totally imaginrd floating digital numbers with Tempus. I actually reference it in a fic i wrote where the character casts it and flicks his wand to turn it around for someone else to see. Maybe its different for each person and how they imagine the time?

*** It would add some wizardly quirkiness if the spell instead told you things like "running late for class" or "entirely too early to be up".

*** For a wizard who had never seen a digital clockface, it would probably appear as analog with the clock hands in the proper position. But then it's redundant, why not just get a clock? Or a watch? It's the tale with the witch who forgot how to tie her shoelaces, again, kind of.

*** I'd think if anything it should be a floating ethereal analog clock. Wizards don't have digital clocks so it makes little sense (in my mind) to have their spell mimic one.

*** I like the "different for each person" idea. Falls in line with how different the physical watches/clocks are in canon: Dumbledore's was twelve-handed, with stars. Mrs. Weasley's clock (not the family tracker) just had expressions like "time for tea." My favorite has to be the one that yelled when the guard was picking up the Dursleys in DH.

** I somehow now imagine everyone walking around with tiny sundials strapped to their wrists. The TRUE ANALOG TIMEKEEPING. NO NEED FOR MUGGLE HERESY!

(I'm just cracking up, of course)

** Pocket watches with enchantments. Old nobles in victorian era like Sherlock Holmes feature them.

As a wizarding novelty, I'd figure, The portraits inform time to those who ask for it.

** Not actually canon, but a very common fanon spell is Tempus. a simple spell that displays current time. Sometimes also includes date/month/year (usually when the fic involves time travel, to let the traveler know where he/she is).
