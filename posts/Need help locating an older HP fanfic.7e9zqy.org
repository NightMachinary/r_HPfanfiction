I read this one years ago, cant remember the name, been searching and can not find. I believe it came out post book 5?

Anyway, its one where Harry and hermione become very powerful, and get into using dark magic to fight dark magic, they all become animangi, I think they actually build a new wizard prison at some point. They also learn alchemy, and learn to create their own elixor of life.

If someone can help me, that would be awesome.

I also might be crossing streams and thinking of a different one, but I think maybe Ron becomes a Seer, and ginny an empath? That might be a different one though.


** Post-OOTP, Ron's a seer, Hermione's a necromancer, and Harry's exceptionally powerful in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lost Demon by Angry Hermione), a story with several (though not all) elements common to what you're describing.

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.

** If you aren't confusing two fics together, we'd have a very rare case of a Dark!OP!Harmony!Harry story /without/ Weasley bashing. Interesting!
