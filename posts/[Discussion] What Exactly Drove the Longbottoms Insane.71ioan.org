There appear to be two different concepts in the fandom of how exactly the Longbottoms went insane from Bellatrix's Cruciatus. My understanding (and many others') was always that they went mad from the constant pain, plain and simple --- a purely /psychological/ consequence. On the other hand, I have recently found several fics and threads where people argued that the Cruciatus Curse works by /physically/ overstimulating the nervous system, and the Longbottoms went crazy because the prolonged coursing of magic through their nervous system ended up causing brain damage. Which one do you prefer?


** the second one, because rowling confirms that the reason why the longbottoms cant be healed is because the damage was caused by magic.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

that seems to mean that if something mundane like pain caused insanity, it could be healed by magic

**** You could either argue that intent is truly the basis of magic or that how spells affect things is a matter of plot convenience.

It's also possible that the effects of magic are just not well understood with regard to biology, and even less so to psychology.

In the case of Lockhart vanishing Harry's arm bones, it could easily be the case that his intent was actually to repair them. The results were thus reversible because regrowing them would not conflict with the original intent.

With regards to memory charms, the three relevant examples I can think of are: Lockhart's backfiring charm, Crouch Sr.'s charm on Bertha Jorkins, and Hermione's charm on her parents.

Lockhart's backfire was presumably intended to be permanent, thus making it resistant to being reversed.

In the case of Bertha Jorkins, the charm was powerful enough to also affect her memory generally, and the intent was clearly permanent removal of the relevant memory. However, Voldemort was able to either reverse the charm's effects or else extract the memory, suggesting that the charm operates by locking away memories rather than erasing them. As a result, a powerful legilimens can break through the magical barriers and access the memory, at the extreme detriment of the victim (it's also possible that this could be done less destructively over time, but that is speculation on my part).

The memory charm on Hermione's parents is the only case I'm aware of in which the charm was successfully removed with no ill effects. Bear in mind that the canonical basis for this is an interview with JKR, so the actuality of it depends on your definition of canon. Regardless, it's not hard to believe that Hermione wanted the effects to be reversible if Voldemort were successfully defeated. You could also make the argument that the caster of the memory charm always has the ability to remove it, and the vast majority of the time, they simply choose not to do so.

Also, this kind of ended up being a more general reply than I initially intended, sorry.

******* I think it would be more accurate to say he just used the wrong spell. It would be like if someone heard of a spell that disarmed people, but they thought it was cast with the word Stupefy. So they tried casting it and it wound up knocking the person out, not disarming them. Likewise, what Lockhart cast was not a healing spell as he thought, but rather it vanished the bones (I suppose that would be a healing spell, in cases where the bones are completely shattered, but I digress). As such, it was not backfiring magic, but rather magic that did exactly what it was meant to.

  In the film the spell was given as "Brachiam emmendo", which is Canis Latinicus for "mend wrist". As often happens with magic, it possibly involved the caster imagining exactly what he's trying to achieve, in this case a wrist with all bones intact. Lockhart likely had no knowledge of human anatomy, thus he imagined literally nothing and that's what he turned Harry's bones into.

******* • Many fans (including the Wiki folk and my humble self) accept as "loose canon" the information given in the films that doesn't /contradict/ the books, especially when it comes to spells. Indeed, on her old website's FAQ, Rowling stated that some (though not all) of the movie-only spells were taken by the filmmakers from her own notes, so there's always the possibility that particular spell is canon after all.

• The "imagining" thing is never outright stated, but it's one of the most likely pieces of fanon to be true in canon, at least of the most powerful spells. It's an easy extrapolation from how you have to /mean/ to cause harm to use Dark curses, is the most sensible way to make sense of Harry's "there's a lot more to magic than waving a wand and saying a few funny words" comment in /Philosopher's Stone/, etc. And besides all of this, the magic system in canon is so vague that any discussion of it /has/ to take /some/ theories into account or else make up its own, or else you just have... /holes/ in the system.

*** TBH, this is a pretty shitty explanation by JKR, but that's not really surprising. It's far too broad, and far too vague. I can buy the idea of dark magic being harder to heal and long-lasting, whatever, but the general binary differentiation between magical/nonmagical leads to a whole bunch of problems with actual story telling and I feel like it would leads to dozens of plotholes where the only answer is "magic". Like, I've seen people write that Lily and James literally could not die from a car crash, since cars are muggle things, so therefore it doesn't matter how fast they are going, they would live. It's a bit too literal.

I mean, I get why she says things like that. It's fantasy, it's /magic/, and in our own fantasy, heroes don't die to cancer, don't get bedridden from old age, don't die while on the toilet.

Also see the Fantastic Beasts movie where Newt says that his muggle buddy is susceptible to physically blunt trauma (suggesting that he is not). It would also explain Hogwarts being so lax about student safety.

****** Or there's a threshold of some sort. Depending on the type of damage, progress of healing magic, time left untreated, and the mechanics of the soul and body, certain mundane damage might be untreatable. I think the soul thing is the most important point, as they might be able to reconstruct the body, but who knows what happened to the soul in the meantime. However, short of death I think any type of mundane disease/injury/illness should be far more easily dealt with. Also, I don't understand what you mean by gimmicky. Throughout the series, it is shown how easily magic can fix things and that most things that are fatal or untreatable to wizards are generally magical in nature, like Dragon pox. I think this entry into Pottermore was one of the best, as it adds something useful that makes the world make more sense, though many people had already figured this out from the books.

*** Hm. Perhaps. After giving the matter some thought I'd argue for a third explanation to add to the two I put in my main post --- that the curse damaged /their soul/, not their brain physically. This could fit in nicely with the other two Unforgivable Curses, with all three being magic that directly affects the soul --- the Killing Curse by forcefully severing it from the body and sending it into the Afterlife, and the Imperius Curse being obviously mind magic.

***** It's a bit up-in-the-air but I'm convinced some soul magic is involved. I'd say the Killing Curse brutally /rips/ the soul from the body (without trying to contain it afterwards), the instant trauma of which kills the body --- or perhaps that is a separate effect of the spell --- as opposed to the Dementor's Kiss sucking out the soul and destroying it. My motivation for holding this view is to explain how the /Priori Incantatem/ effect could bring souls back from the Beyond: my theory is that through what is essentially a magical "glitch", the connection causes the wands to run their previous spells in reverse. The result in the Killing Curse's case being sucking the souls back out into the mortal world because the original pushed them away.

******* I'm pretty sure it's the actual souls though. The James and Lily called forth by Priori Incantatem recognized Harry instantly and Lily told him "you've been very brave, sweetheart", implying they'd watched over his previous ordeals. This doesn't square with them being imprints of James and Lily at the time of their deaths.

Well, Priori Incantatem is itself a rare, hard-to-replicate effect, and will /only/ show the shade of the last few people who died by a Killing Curse from the particular wand being used. And the shades can "only linger for a moment". By contrast, the Resurrection Stone (as long as you've actually /got/ it) can bring back anyone you call forth regardless of the length since they died or how they died, and the ghosts can stay on the mortal plane for as long as they want (though judging from Cadmus's fiancée, /that/'s not usually very long).

** I like the idea that the Cruciatus overloads the nerves, making them go haywire and thus the worst possible pain /ever./ Due to the nature of the curse, the nerves can't shut down to protect you. They were held under the curse so long that it fried their nerves, much like plugging a 110v appliance into a 220v outlet.

But also there's the difference between a curse and a jinx (or charm, for that matter) in that curses make fundamental changes, jinx's make physical changes. That's why Moody can't regrow his leg -- the curse that took it removed the fundamental legness of his body, rather than a "light" cutting spell that would merely physically remove it. There's nothing to regrow. You'd have to re-add the fundamental legness back in (a specialized counter-curse) before you could heal it.

To carry that line of thought into what happened to the Longbottoms, the curse damaged their nervous system at a level more fundamental than physical. It can't be fixed, not unless you can find the right way to counter-curse the damage.

The real question here is: If you managed to pull a Voldemort on one of the Longbottoms and rebirth them, would the damage carry over? I suspect not, given that polyjuice also carries over the physical tells of cursed damage. So in my headcanon, curses affect things at a more fundamental level than physical, but /not/ the soul.

Mine is quite different (I think it's thematically more pleasing for the Cruciatus to be soul magic rather than just affecting the physical nerves, and dark curses are hard to reverse because they usually have "failsafes" against common healing spells built into them by the spellcrafters), but bravo all the same.

** Constant pain can also cause brain damage. I always assumed their body simply shut down because it couldn't handle the pain, similar to how you will fall unconscious when you lose too much blood, or drowning. So while they were indeed alive they couldn't interact or communicate as a regular human being could, as if they were in a life time coma. Our body's have limits and counter measures to deal with those, when the brain is receiving all that pain in one moment I find likely it will simply shut down to deal with the backlash.
