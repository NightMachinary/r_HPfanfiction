Harry's mind in Voldemort's ghostly form, and Voldemort's mind in Harry's body. Harry possesses a golem or a boggart or something and spends his time travelling the world or otherwise laughing as Voldie incurs suspicion from literally everyone and completely fails at getting anything done as an 11-year-old.


** I could also see this going as "Harry knows Tom is in his body, is constantly trying to kill him in order to prevent him from having a second crack at taking over the wizarding world, everyone just interprets this as Voldemort trying to murder Harry." There could be some really interesting role reversal. What Harry does with inherited death eaters and how he treats them. How Tom navigates being one of the "good guys" and what he can accomplish from that position while still trying to ensure his immortality and take over the world. I would be pretty interested in a "two perspectives" story like this.

  What he hated most about his perfect plan going wrong, is how much his nemesis enjoyed being brought along for the ride.

** That would be really interesting to read. It would they have their own body/spirit wraith form, or would they be in the others body? The former sounds more interesting than the latter.

** Well, it'd be pretty funny indeed if Harry got Voldie's knowledge of magic. Otherwise, though, being stuck as a ghostly with only knowledge of wanded magic doesn't sound very fun.

** That'd be interesting with the Horcrux in play. Since it's inside Harry, would it know it's really Riddle's soul, and do something then with it?

Even ignoring the Horcrux. Just trying to imagine, if anyone finding out: i; e Snape, Dumbledore or such, what would happen, and the like.
