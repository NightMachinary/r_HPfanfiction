I am looking for a Mentor Minerva Fic that does not has a good Snape or her in a weird relationship with Dumbledore. Dumbledore should not be in a good light because after all the books clearly say that he condemned Harry to sixteen years of abuse, where he was nearly killed a couple times.

Ron bashing is preferable. No Slash or Hermione/Ron please.


** You just described basically every H/Hr fic written in the past 10 years. :/

*** I have yet to read any competent Minerva story besides the "Yule Ball Panic" series.But while good that one features Fem!Harry/Hermione and discrimination of homosexuals.

Not one where she's just nice or useful in three paragraphs but one where she's actually fiercely protective and a main character of the story.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
