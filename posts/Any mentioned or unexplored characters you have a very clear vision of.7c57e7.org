For example, do you have a very detailed backstory for Blaise Zabini in your head, or a very specific physical description for Daphne Greengrass? Maybe you have a lot of in-depth headcanons for Gladys Gudgeon or Mafalda Hopkirk, or for Rosmerta?

Do you ever get put-off when a fic presents a completely different version of a character you've fleshed out, or do you like to seek out different presentations of them? Any very rare pairs you have for background characters?


** I picture Daphne Greengrass like this pretty much always:

Except the hair is less frizzy.

Depends. Is Hermione suddenly an idiot? If so, yes. Is Daphne not an Ice Queen? Idgaf, I'll keep reading. Actually, I prefer her not to be. I want the main canon characters to stay close to canon, I don't care about the rest and their personalities/looks.

The only exception is Harry. If we were restricted to canon Harry's personality, I'd have quit reading fanfiction long ago.

** Theo Nott. He gets mentioned, like, once in book 3 but I have such a clear view of his character. He has a hard time reconciling the loving father he had with the monster Nott Sr was to the world. He loves his Slytherin housemates, especially after seventh year, when no Slytherins, not even the first years, were invited into the RoR to escape the Carrows, and either he willfully took the Mark about as much as Draco did, or if he didn't, it was because he was too young or other reason, and not because he didn't want to prove himself like Draco did. As a main pairing, I'm a sucker for a good Hermione/Theo, but if we're just including background or minor characters, if Theo is gay always Percy/Theo, if straight Luna/Theo.

I can totally get sucked into different characterizations, but there needs to be given context and reason. Also the more wild the AU, like Voldie Wins!AUs, there's a lot more wiggle room. I really just love fanon Theo Nott.

*** This is some good shit, let me tell you. I literally agree 100%. I've actually explored his father as well in one of the stories I'm currently working on, I can't wait to write the sequel to that story where I get to include Theo Nott.

*** I have a really defined view of Theodore Nott as well!

Tall, broad-shouldered but quite delicate despite his size, always walking about with his head in a book, and tends to be quite private. Doesn't involve himself in situations that are not his own, and tends to be quite detached from situations when he is trying to resolve them. I tend to write him as being quite protective of his fellow Slytherins, especially the younger ones, as I imagine him as having several younger siblings.

I did something a wee bit different with his canon, though, and made the Death Eater Nott Snr an uncle - Canton Nott - rather than his father, 'cause I've been trying to explore more of the separations down family lines, you know?

I'm actually thinking I'll write some Theo/Hermione into my current fic, so I'm really glad to see someone say they're interested in the pairing!

** I had a complete head cannon for Kingsley Shacklebolt before DH ever came out and I have a very difficult time with characterizations away from that.

** Honestly? Kevin's Entwhistle. During my rabid hunt for names, places and more throughout every avenue I found I came across the "Original 40" students of Harry's year as penned by Rowling.

That was 3 years ago and since I've constructed an entire fleshed out character even though he'll likely never appear in my major fics.

** I invented backstories for Mulciber and Sturgis Podmore for my fic. I could be flexible on Sturgis, but Mulciber is firmly locked as headcanon. If I wrote a completely crazy AU, Mulciber would still be what he is in my current fic. The unwanted son of a nasty pureblood, who murdered his father and half-brother and took his father's place among the Death Eaters. Fled Britain after Voldemort's fall and became a wand-for-hire.

** Not a minor character, but in writing some pre-hogwarts Harry I decided that at some point he'd definitely memorized every synonym for "fat" in the thesaurus so he could accurately describe the Dursleys. Also so his insults to Dudley would have the double whammy of calling him fat and implicitly calling him stupid for not knowing what "corpulent" means.
