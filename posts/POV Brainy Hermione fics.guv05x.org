I've been scouting (and failing) to find any more good POV Hermione fics. Please recommend! *I'll give you meager upvotes.*

Like:

1. School Hermione. Ideally, she's involved in some sort of research or academic component.

Don't Like:

1. Veela fics or Alpha omega bonds. Or intensely weird codependent pairings, with gratuitous physical description of characters. (Like, "I looked deeply into his cobalt blues as he peered back into my soul, smirking. He was like the hottest man I ever met, only hotter, and his gaze was smoldering." Yikes.)

But het or femslash pairings are fine in general for me! As long as they're a component to a larger story, which is focused on her character growth or academia.
