Would you happen to know of any finished novel length fanfiction about family magic and/or Harry being The heir of somebody important?


** Well, the grandaddy of them has to be Lightning on the Wave's Arc of Sacrifices epic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood]] is humour centred around family magic. Feature H/Hr and Ron/Harem.

A lot of the 'Heir of Hogwarts/Gryffindor/Merlin/Peverell/Black/etc' stories feature super!Harry and often Harry/Harem as well...

** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]] - unfinished but actively updated, 600k+ words at this point. Lots of family magic in this one.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2287647/1/Reign-of-Power][Reign of Power]] should interest you. Its the very definition of a classic IMO. While some things like 'Harry trying to break free from Manipulative Dumbledore' have become stale due to overuse, Fayr Warning's skill in writing made sure that the fic aged pretty well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living With Danger]] is an obvious one. 5 books, probably a million words at this point and scheduled to be finished in October.

Harry is kidnapped/raised by Remus and Sirius and their wives (OCs) and raised with Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy and an OC. Very heavy on the family magic and heir magic.
