  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

**** Oh, trust me, there will be no annoying tropes here. FloreatCastellum is a fanfic author I can recommend with my eyes closed.

Every single fanfic they have written that has entered into some contest has won an award.

***** Thanks, then i look forward to read all of this author's stories. It's such a great feeling to find a good fanfic author, especially when they have written a lot. And i love that this isn't just a creative rehash of the same story of year 1 to 7 of Hogwarts, it's fresh and new. And the characters stay believable and true to how we got to know them. I can believe that these characters are the grown up versions of the characters we got to know in the books.

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
