I'm mostly looking for fics outside of fanfiction.net (Since, I've already read most)

Other conditions: (snarry, obviously)

-Has to be complete (if it is ongoing, then the uploads must be constant)

-Believable (Or really good) plot, relationship development (No fucking on the first chapter . _ .)

-that Snape and Harry are on character, as much as possible

-A fic in which Snape isn't a model (Severus is perfect but he isn't an adonis, and I like him that way xD)

-It HAS to have smut (Unless it is a must read)

This would be highly appreciated :)


** Since I'm not into slash, I've got a weird kind of recommendation for you. It's a girlHarry story, but it's well developed, long and it's consistently updated. Trust me, for it to drag me in, it needed to be good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]]

Even if it's not your normal thing, give it a shot. The author also has an excellent complete Snape/Lily story that manages to do something new with the genre.

*** I have read gender bender before, it isn't my thing XD. I might give these to a friend though (She loves Lily/Snape)

And thanks :)

** Hmmm - perhaps [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1td3go/looking_for_awesome_snarry_fiction_help_me_out/][an older thread]] can provide.

** I made a list of some of the more recent additions to the Snarry catalog [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1mn5si/ive_been_out_of_the_fanfic_scene_for_about_5/ccb7lr4][here]] a couple of months ago. There is also a very active Snape_Potter comm on LJ and its associated journaling siblings, and they have several fests a year. I'm providing a link to their [[http://snape-potter.dreamwidth.org/tag/*fest+masterlist][Masterlist of Masterlists]] that gives a summary of every fic entered in the last dozen or so fests and links to the story itself. Also, if it's smut you want (and it's rare to find a slasher who doesn't), please check out [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/][Walking the Plank]], which is the only site I'm aware of that's dedicated to Snarry. Two other searchable archives are [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/][HPFandom]] and [[http://www.ao3.org][AO3]]. There are loads of Snarry stories archived there, though quite a few are cross-posted.

I hope you find something to enjoy!

** Definitely [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/43893][Tea]] on AO3. It literally checks every one of your boxes. Amazing, long plot. Tension build up like you wouldn't believe. Snape is taken as he is, gross to everyone else except Harry who realizes his good qualities. But the best thing? This is my #1 or #2 top ff for smut scenes. When you finally get to them, they are god-tier. Let me know if you like it.
