:END:
So when harry is in the train station between returning to life and dieing. I think harry sees tom/voldomort baby and insted of being digusted by it he picks him up and comforts him refusing to abandon the baby. And dumbledor gets all angry and i think harry and tom get some sort of second chance or something


** idr the 'Dumbledore gets angry' bit, but the rest sounds a lot like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1358209]]

** Could it be this Tomarry fic? Ending with a twist. Basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  There are stories with snakes that bite and say {you knew what I was when you picked me up} but this isn't one of them. This is the kind of story where the abandoned child walks in the jungle beneath the branches full of hissing things and tells them {we be of one blood ye and I}. Harriet Potter is eleven and she chooses. (genderswap/Slytherin Harry au)

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

** That kinda happens in one of the fics in series I've read(fic 1 is named something about ninjas) the series stars with Harry periodically dreaming from the pov of a Naruto character who is in school and stuff, which teaches him the basics of Naruto stuff, some seals, chakra, basic ninjutsu and genjutsu, etc and also lets him experience a parents love. In the second part it introduces him to the wizarding world and shows how this Harry is different from cannon Harry for example he makes friends from all the houses and is a better student. Part three has him deal with horcruxes by painting the aspects of different horcruxes including teen tom from the diary(he originally uses the diary to paint the picture), kiddy tom from the scarcrux, and voldemo from the diadem. He eventually cleanses the Horcruxes after seeing the painting ones act out the murder that made them and using the scarcrux to feal remorse on toms behalf. The scarcrux is the last to go and during it's removal he cleans it up and is nice to it as his parents are there calling him stupid for being nice to it(thats the bit that relates to what you wanted). After that he builds a machine that lets him travel to other universes and goes to the avatar universe right when Aang first wakes up. I enjoyed all the fics up to that point and the one that happens in the avatar universe but thats where the series starts turning sour for me personally bc it suddenly turns into a tomarry fic and I don't normally read slash at all. I tried to bear through it but never ended up finishing the series. If you don't mind slash though then I do recommend it, again don't remember the name but its a hard series to miss honestly, its on Ao3.
