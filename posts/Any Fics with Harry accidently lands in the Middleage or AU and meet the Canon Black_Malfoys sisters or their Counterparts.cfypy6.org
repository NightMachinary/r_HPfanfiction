Harry intents to make a time or dimensiontravel. Maybe it works or not, but he would land in the Middleage or an AU version of it. There he gets to meet either the Ancestors of Narcissa and Bellatrix or their AU Counterparts of themselfs. It doesnt have to be them, but they can share visual similarities. When they meet him and he needs to introduce himself, they are attracted to him (or just one of them) and...depending one the name he choose, wants to have a Baby with him to gain more reputation.

​

Yeah, thats it. Whether he do them this Favor and gets them pregnant or has Sex but without pregnancy (if it is the Canon Middleage, i think it would distort the timeline....if "keep the timeline correct" is a thing in that Fic at all). Well, if Harry gets to return he might meet Narcissa or Bellatrix (not evil), who "suddenly" might remember, that their Grand-grand-grand Mothers were telling about a certain Boy, who looked very similar to him. Whether this leads to a better Behavior from the Black/Malfoy side or an unintended Attraction or Affection of Narcissa....i leave to the Fic.

​

The Core Point is that Harry somehow is in a Middle age or AU setting and the Noble Woman there (atleast one, i dont intent to have a Harem....although i think it could be funny) find him attractive and would like to have an Heir. If the Fic doesnt contain Sex, it should have teasing and moments of sexual tension.
