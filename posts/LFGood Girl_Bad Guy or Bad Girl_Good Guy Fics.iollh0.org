Prefer longer fics, harry or hermoine or OC/self-insert centric, “bad” in this context means actually evil (at least starting out). I also would like to ask for no power wanks and the romance to be slow burn, or at least the couple doesn't immediately get together. Some sort of conflict.

Thanks in advance!!
