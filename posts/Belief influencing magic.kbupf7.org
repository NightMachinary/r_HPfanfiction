I've seen a few fics where belief influences magic. My particular fav for this idea is linkao3(Harry Potter: God of Luck).

Idea 1 - So we have Dumbledore, who everyone believes can do no wrong and is Lord of Light after his defeat of Grindlewald. He literally can't do anything â€˜wrong' because everyone believes it. Even Dark oriented magicals have difficulty not believing, though it is slightly easier to fight off due to them being dark. It was the reason Tom Riddle became the Dark Lord, so he could think clearly and not have to fight the influence of the idea after his attempts at the political route failed. Only by revealing Dumbledore's past with proof to back it up breaks the belief in some people. With Dumbledore so used to being able to get away with anything, his blunders cause more people to lose their belief until only the die hards are left. Even with the fanatics, there aren't enough people believing any longer and Dumbledore falls to his own failures.

Idea 2 - The Harry Potter Adventure book series have children believe he is a hero who tames dragons, saves princesses, etc. The Dursley's literally can't stop him from doing heroic things, even at a young age. Due to this his muggle neighbors love him and the Dursley's have to treat him well or bring the wrath of the neighborhood down on them. When he finally goes to Hogwarts, Dumbledore realizes that despite his plans of making Harry a beloved hero, this wasn't what he wanted. He proceeds to try and make Harry less of a hero. His attempts only end up making Harry's heroing more successful. Voldemort becomes the punching bag villain who never wins.


** Also, racing brooms are routinely painted red, because doing so makes them fly faster - even if no one has yet figured out why.

  If someone believed enough, it would come true.Magic needed belief to come true, and what was prayer, what was faith but belief? Of course Harry Woke Up.
