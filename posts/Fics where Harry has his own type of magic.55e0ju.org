I rather like fics where Harry uses his own brand of magic, and has to constantly experiment and experiment to find out different things about his power.

Over 70k+ words please!


** Two: Blindness (or something with a similar name) and a one where Harry can touch something and understand how to use it, what it is, etc.

+Sorry I can't dig up names, but I'm sure they are on [[/r/hpffn][r/hpffn]] somewhere.+

/e:/ look's like they did it for me!

*** To be honest, Blindness is kind of crap. Well written, but at some point it just goes into power fantasy, and hard.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Magic is everywhere. It is the energy that makes up all life and controls the very elements themselves. Magic is alive, a creature untamed, a savage beast. Well, we know what they say about beasts and music.

**** I'd reconsider, I just gave this one a go and it is surprisingly fresh. It's original enough to expand the fandom, and there is enough to it to get a feel and understand how the story would fully play out had there been more. It ends just after the reintroduction of Hogwarts, which prevents it from becoming dull by following the majority of other fanfictions and hopping onto the canon rails.

****** Yeah, I understand. It annoyed me for a long while as well, but there are tons of good fics out there that aren't complete but have good ideas and interesting new perspectives. That combined with the fact that there are only so many different ways an HP like story can end, I found enjoying the journey becoming more important than the reaching the destination.
