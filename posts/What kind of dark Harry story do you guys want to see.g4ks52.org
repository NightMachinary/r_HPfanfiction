Hey guys I want to write a dark Harry story but I'm currently stuck on the plot. So in order to get some ideas I want to ask you guys if you have any plot ideas or request that you would like to see made?


** No character bashing. Or Harem. Give Harry a specific reason for delving into the Dark Arts. Have there be repercussions and costs I personally prefer when he goes dark and then has a redemption arc and ends up in greyer space.

** My advice on how to create an interesting story with a dark protagonist:

1. Make his fall to the dark side slow and plausible. He could start as an idealistic, naive, and good-hearted person, but then he faces obstacles and disappointments. I'd like to see him at his lowest point before he decides that he should update his view of the world. The darkness grows within him step by step, sometimes taking a step back.

2. Dark is not the same as evil. He should consider himself good. He does have moral constraints, and he feels empathy towards other people. But he could justify his actions with the Greater Good: the old, rotten system must be destroyed before a new one can be built. There will be collateral damage, that's sad but unavoidable. Remember: we judge ourselves by our intentions, but others by their actions.

3. He should be insecure behind his charismatic facade. Every now and then he is filled with doubt as he wonders whether or not he made the right choices. This is his constant companion, and only at the the end of the story he finds true confidence. Also, he has some kind of idol. That's only natural, and most power-hungry emperors in real history liked to think they were following on the footsteps of their predecessors. Perhaps Tom Riddle's diary could be his mentor at some point.

4. He should have some other ambition besides gaining power. If you stick with Harry being a Quidditch-enthusiast, he could wish to be able to just fly all the time. However, he feels he has a duty to fulfill his dark plans, and that's why he puts his personal enjoyment aside.

5. He has weaknesses. How about a Harry who is not more magically talented than the canon one? He is just super manipulative and creative. As he can't do everything alone, he forms a group of minions who all pledge their individual strengths to Harry's use. Hermione could be the one with magical prominence, Draco the one with knowledge of the workings of the wizarding world, some socially talented person the one who knows how to handle the PR, etc. Harry is just the brains of this conspiracy, and few people even know that he (and not Draco, for example) is the mastermind.

6. Make his opposition worthy. Nothing is more boring than a main character who just trumps through all adversities like a superhero.

** My preferred dark!Harry:

1. Dark Harry doesn't have to use dark magic. Dark magic is a mean he might choose to gain tactical advantages, such as Avada Kedavra bypassing the shield charm. But there are other times when its use could mean strategic disadvantages, such as negative PR and loss of public support. I want to see dark Harry weighing his options and be smart about it.
2. Dark Harry should have a worthwhile goal, a goal readers can sympathize with. Dark Harry having a kick murdering people around is just another glorified serial killer and stupid. Dark Harry imitating or joining Voldemort is boring and uncreative. There are quite a few characters in our history who butchered millions, but are still respected and revered by people today, among them Genghis Khan, Caesar and Augustus, and Napoleon. You might want to know what they did right. Also, Chairman Mao had an uncanny ability to turn the general populace into his willing henchmen.
3. Killing is all but mandatory for dark Harry. In fact, war is about killing people, as general George Patton so 'wisely' put it: "The objective of war is not to die for your country (cause), but make the other bastards die for their country (cause)!" Don't go into overly complicated moral justifications for killing people, unless it's an in-story plot to convince formerly moralistic person like Hermione. "I want to win this war, because failure is not an option!" is enough.
4. It's expected that a dark Harry would resort to torture to extract intelligence, to carry out revenge, and/or to satisfy his sadistic urges. In canon, Voldemort often used Cruciatus to soften up his victims before hitting them with Legilimency or Imperius. That was exactly the same approach Harry did in “The Sum of Their Parts” after Veritaserum proved ineffective against the Lestrange brothers. Or he doesn't even need to get his own hands dirty, but lets his subordinates to run organizations that are engaged in systemic torture, murder, kidnapping, extortion, and sabotage, as in “Emperor”.
5. Dark Harry doesn't mean he should act arrogant, rude, and a total jerk to others. Too many fics seem to be written by edgy people who fail to understand that politeness and subtlety will get someone a lot farther.
6. Dark Harry should be charismatic, hardworking, intelligent, and powerful, but not invincible and always right. I want to see him being able to delegate, to enable, and to motivate. He doesn't have to do everything by himself, and instead builds a strong team to achieve his goals.
7. Dark Harry needs to be challenged. However, I hate fics that must dumb down main characters so that they get challenged by their poorly written and stupid enemies. No, Harry's enemies must be competent. A back and forth chess move between them can be very entertaining.

** Powerful, but not unstoppable. Actual obstacles so he doesn't always succeed. When he fails it should be meaningful, and when he wins it should be awesome. And he should have reasons for what he does. Dark-trending antihero, more than villain.

Honestly, I kinda love the twisty charismatic bring people along to his side type rather than the just reject everyone and go it alone. So I'd probably want him to bring along at least some of his friends/allies to join him, though gradually/naturally and not with them just abruptly changing their minds for no reason.

There is a lot of stuff that should upset Harry. How much more should he sacrifice? He's literally died to stop Voldemort but the world is still screwed. How much more will it take of him to set things right? Does he have any right to decided what 'right' even is anymore?

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** I'd still like to see a believable, non harem Harry, who becomes Lord Slytherin, who ends up taking out moldy-shorts with extreme prejudice and then decides to remake wizarding society into something that tears down the SoS in his terms...

Reading the Stealing witches and skipping prison is cool, but when all of the harem can do wandless magic and have perfect occulmancy gets to the non believable point fast...

** Well, what I always find frustrating when reading dark!Harry stories is that he behaves like a spoiled, edgy brat. Not like Malfoy, but more like these kids who need to show everyone how superior they are.It's like this; Harry wants to keep his powers a secret, but he displays a great skill of magic at the first opportunity he gets. Then he taunts every seven and sixth year he can, acts all smug about it, and duels then into oblivion. People get all pissy because nobody wants to be defeated by a small brat. However, Harry sees it in a different way and thinks that they are all immature, so he keeps acting like he is superior to all and so on.

There is also the fact that he always talks about how useless some people are because they are weaklings, but he goes and helps Neville at every opportunity. Honestly, Neville is behaving like a prime target for bullying in the first two years or so. He shows no skill or talent, he is clumsy, and forgets important stuff such as the password to his dorm. Harry still sees him as a rare specimen of a wizard and decides to help him in potions etc.

That being said, I think most authors of the stories I read forced too many character traits to Harry which just conflict with the way he /really/ acts.If you want a dark harry, that is nice, but don't make him act like an adult who knows everything better at the age of 11. Let him explore... let him be curious... maybe use the invisibility cloak to sneak into the forbidden section of the library to learn dark magic...He can even be magically powerful, just raw power, and you can make him struggle with spells because he overpowers a wingardium liviosa and burns the feather or so.

Make Harry explore magic, if you start from the first year. Its more interesting to see him struggle with situations, learn magic to overcome these situations, and then add this piece of magic to his arsenal.

** Something like the Joker (2019). Pretty much all dark Harry fics have him either a Death Eater, a ruthless conqueror, or actually good guy except he uses dark spell.

The kid has more reason than anyone in the Potterverse to just snap. I'd want to see a fic of him descending into a broken, mad murderer. No politics, no grand plan, no romance.

** Morally questionable/grey Harry in it for himself. I want to see Agent 47-esque Harry or Harry like Victor the Assassin. Not a complete psychopath but self serving and priority one is looking out for themselves. A Harry with no attachments to a cause can have plenty of enemies after him as well.

** I have read fics where Harry is influenced by the horcrux in his scar since he's a kid. Howecer, those fics I've read are just poorly done. Slow development is the key. The ones I saw has Harry performing Unforgivables already at the age of 5. #rolleyes

** Harry is laidback who doesn't have any moral dilemma. He uses dark spell because it's best instrument in current situation. He isn't influenced by dark magic and isn't hatefull. He is either amused or doesn't care. The only struggle for him should be voldemort and/or Dumbledore. Other characters such as moody, snape or Bellatrix should be laughable easy for him. The should be one piece of magic such as mind arts or some elemental spells in which he excels voldemort. But he isn't concentrated just on this piece of magic.

*** the problem with dark magic is that most of the spells require negative emotions such as hate or the will to torture (crucio) in order to function. In a way like the patronus spell which requires a positive memory that invokes a lot of emotion. You can use Avada Kedavra on anyone without killed anybody if you don't want to kill - its practically useless. Well, my point is: too much dark magic should make people hateful, evil people because its the nature of such magic.
