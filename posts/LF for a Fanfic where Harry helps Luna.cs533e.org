I'm looking for a fanfic where I don't honestly remember whether time travel was involved or not but I recall Harry helping Luna where he goes to her common room and later accio's Luna's Essay and belongings and her essay comes zooming out of Micheal Corner's book and various belongings also comes back to her and later Luna is so angry that she sits with Harry at Gryffindor table .

Any help is appreciated in advance.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.

*** Thank you very much for this. I expected a bit of time before I got the answer. I got hooked on HP fanfiction and it's various genres and especially time-travelling Harry so I must have perused over 500 fics in last 2 months and was unable to find the above mentioned fic after reading it and was going stir-crazy about it. Again Thank You Very Much

** I've always just scrolled past this fic because I didn't like the summary, but I'm now 12 chapters in and I am loving it. Thanks for motivating me to give it a chance ‚úåüèª

*** I too had read some chapters in ff until I got to the part of Luna's bullying and how Harry dealt with it and that probably stuck with me and after reading ch 15 I had written it off but that part about How Harry dealt with Luna's trouble kept hammering in my subconscious until I had sought it out yesterday night. So, welcome mate but a big cheer goes to Tenebris-Umbra for responding so quickly. Happy Reading üìñ
