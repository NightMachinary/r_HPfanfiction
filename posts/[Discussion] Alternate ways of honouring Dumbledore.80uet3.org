I know most people seem to pretty much agree Albus Severus is a terrible name to inflict on a child, especially when the siblings have normal names - James and Lily.

However, in my opinion, although he'd be touched, I don't think Dumbledore would necessarily agree with it either. It's an uncommon name, and a horrible one. Literally any one of his other names would have been better - even Percival.

An alternate for me would be Ariana for a girl. I truly believe Dumbledore would have appreciated this so much more - given how much of his entire life was spent in regret and sorrow around her. He literally ended up dying because he was so wrapped up in the hope of seeing her. He didn't think much of himself, but watching another little Ariana grow up, with both parents, two loving brothers, and no trauma - that would be priceless, even from the afterlife.

Of course, that leaves actual Albus Severus without a name, but there's always the other, still living, father figure in his life, Arthur. I don't think any of his kids used it.


** Of course, "Albus Severus" was the compromise after Harry initially wanted to call him "Mistake".

*** See, I disagree. Albus is a terrible name. There's a reason no one uses it....but combined with a name like Severus makes it definitely worse.

As a name, Severus is ok. As for who it's after - I mean, it's not that I hate Snape, but to name a child after him? It's an honour he'd hate, and debatedly didn't earn. I definitely feel Arthur earned the honour over Snape. Hell, Kingsley and Moody probably contributed directly to Harry's life as much as Snape did.

**** Why do you think Albus is such a bad name? It's not cumbersome or oddly-spelled, and it has a nice enough meaning etymologically. It only /seems/ weird to us Muggles, but names like Septima, Albus or Rubeus are common in the wizarding world, so it's just a bit of a cultural difference.

***** I agree, I personally like Albus' name. Now Severus name on the other hand is very strange/different/unusual. Not to say I hate Severus, he's actually one of my favorite characters in the series despite his flaws that he has. (Or maybe because of them). I'm just saying his name is much more different/unusual compared to say Albus.

****** Now that's quite interesting. See, to me, Severus isn't that odd, because there were so many Emperors and Saints named it, plus Jane Austen used it, plus European variations seems to be common, according to wiki. Whereas Albus seems to be a rare surname, and basically unused as a first name.

******* Always neat when two people can have similar but different thoughts to something. I don't know, maybe because to me Severus seems like a very difficult name to pronounce, while Albus seems easier. Plus I like the sound of Albus' name compared to Severus.

I suppose it's merely preference in the name.

***** Albus isn't common though. You'd think, with him being such an icon, there'd be at least one other Albus. There isn't.

Albus, for me, is like Bilius, or Pomona - they don't sound right, or flow easily. Rubeus and Septima do

****** Probably because other people (unlike Harry) realized that would be putting an unnecessary weight on their son's shoulders by always being compared to Dumbledore.

I've always wondered if Al was the kid who was born early so they didn't have a name prepared:

"Harry, we forgot to think of names before he was born! Quick, think of something!"

"Um -- um..." Harry looks at the Chocolate Frog cards he has in his hands. "Albus Severus!"

The nurse writes it down before they can actually think about it.

"...You don't think that'll put him in Slytherin, do you?" Ginny asks with great trepidation.

His shoulders slump. "I don't know," Harry says mournfully. "But he'll definitely hate us."

** That's why I don't really agree with the names that Rowling gave the Next Gen, or the ones that are named after dead loved ones. I understand it's to honor them, but using one name as a middle name and another name that isn't connected to anyone that they know or loved that died as a first name in my opinion would be better. (At least in my opinion).

I mean James Sirius, Albus Severus, Lily Luna. Just seems to be way too much. And people are just going to see them as mini Albus Dumbledore's, mini James Potter, mini Lily Evans because of the first name.

Percy even named one of his daughter's after his still living mother. I get that he loves and respects her, but in my opinion even that is too much.

George named his son after his dead twin brother, again it's a sweet idea but when you really think how messed up the kid will probably be because of it, that's just too much. (IMO).

I've gotten used to the names, but if Rowling had thought of other names I would have been much happier.

**** Technically speaking he called his son Bartemius. Although /we/ refer to him as Barty Junior, we don't know what he chose to be called by friends.

I mean, family names are a thing. My mother's first name is Margaret, the same as several older relatives. She chooses to go by her middle name, other relatives went by diminutives of Margaret or their middle names or just nicknames.

***** Well, to me, naming one's son after oneself is actually /weirder/. I mean, think of the confusion this would (and does!) cause. At least with the Potter children, the names might be /weird/ to the people who knew James, Dumbledore & Co., but there's no risk of /actual/ confusion.

Either way, I meant the Barty situation to parallel that with Molly and Percy's daughter, not James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna.

*** I'm not overly fond of Albus Severus but at least you can tell the difference between Albus Dumbledore and Albus Potter.

But the fact we now have to differentiate between James & Lily Potter the married couple and James & Lily Potter the siblings still kind of icks me out.

And for Percy and George's kids, the problems are compounded because there aren't exactly many nicknames for Molly or Fred. Molly and Fred are themselves diminutive versions.

*** Yeah, I agree. It's a theme even with the original generation tho; James named his son after his grandfather, and himself. Draco was named after Lucius, Bill after Arthur, Percy and Ron after uncles, Ginny after her mum, and let's not mention all the Sirius's in the Blacks, or a certain TM Riddle.

It some ways, it almost looks like lazy naming on Jo's part.

**** Well Rowling was incredibly creative with names, naming the Black family after stars, naming the Evan's after flowers, naming characters after gods or Shakespearean people ect extra, so I suppose doing the same name twice or more than that would be understandable in that case.

****** I really do have to admire how much thought she came up with for the names.

For instance, for Dolores Umbridge.

Umbrage which is where the name comes from: Offense, annoyance, displeasure. Which describes her well.

Rita Skeeter: Skeeter is a slang term for a mosquito, which is likely in reference to her Animagus form an insect.

Voldemort: Flight of Death, which is very fitting for Voldemort since he feared death.

And many other names that she thought of to go with the characters. So while I might have some issues with some of the Next Gen names, I do have to admire the ones that she did think of to put meaning behind the character.

*** Naming traditions are very common in the real world and HP too. Ginny and Harry naming their children like that does not come out of nowhere-it follows what we've seen in canon. Just look at the Weasleys. There's Ginevra Molly and William Arthur with middle names from their parents. There's the twins who have the same F/G naming convention as Mrs. Weasley's brothers, Fabian and Gideon. Or Percy's middle name, Ignatius, which is probably after Ignatius Prewett. We see other naming traditions such as the Blacks, who pull from astronomy, or the Evans, who used flowers.
