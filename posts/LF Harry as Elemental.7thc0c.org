Hello,\\
I search for this Fic where Harry is an Elemental (all four I think) and it materialises in glowing Orbs (Red - Fire, Green - Earth, etc.) he uses the green Orbs to first heal and better himself and then he goes to a hospital and heals a few Children. Within the Children is one of the princesses ill with Leukemia, he heals her too.

Thanks Mac_cy
