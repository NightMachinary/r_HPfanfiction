I've been rereading The Walking Dead and it got me wondering. Does anyone know of HP stories inspired by The Walking Dead, but taking place in England and more of a standalone in world vs bringing characters from the US?

I'm more interested in how the Magical World would respond to the outbreak.

I've scrolled through Fanfiction.net, but haven't found anything thus far.

Thanks!


** I haven't read any of these yet, but I discovered the World War Z crossover list.
