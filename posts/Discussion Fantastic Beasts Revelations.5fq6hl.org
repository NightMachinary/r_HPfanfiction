So, a few things came up in that movie.

1. Wandless magic. Apparently only usable by the dedicated, I mean that's the only reason I can come up with for Queenie and Grindelwald both being able to use it. But then again, it's always being used as something akin to telekinesis, so, not that good when it comes down to it.

All throughout the movie.

1. Suitcase worlds = canon. It never really bothered me as I just saw it as a charm that could be used on any object with a definable in and out. So, yeah.

Quite often throughout the movie.

1. Magical power as a measurable thing, at least if Grindelwald is to be believed it is. Not really sure where to take this as I've just thought it made sense. It was noted a few times that the only way Credence could have survived for so long was because he was so powerful.

When Credence and Grindelwald are talking(Forgot the name of the guy), pretty sure it's every conversation but at least it was the last few before the end of movie battle.

1. Magicals are not as squishy as non-magicals. Again, makes sense. But I have to wonder. Why would harry falling a hundred feet be so damaging then? Or is it something magical that happens ones he's a legal adult?

When Newt and Jacob are in the zoo.

Anyway, that's all I have to open with.

Let's remember that in movie-canon wandless magic is slightly less impressive. The first movie (or was it the third?) had the famous spoon guy.

From what I've found on the internet, a fall of 20ft is going to have some pretty serious injuries, and this is assuming you don't land on your head.

55ft and you're just fucked.

[[http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8106/how-far-would-you-need-to-fall-for-it-to-be-fatal][All this comes from here]]

So, even if magicals are literally /twice/ as durable as a normal human, a 100ft fall is still a life threatening thing. Three times as durable, and a 100ft fall is still a big deal. Four times, and a 100ft fall is less of an issue, but still possible fatal if you land head first. Even if you don't land head first you're not walking away after.

Though like I said, I don't have full context here and may very well be wrong.

*** WoW, You went trough the trouble at looking up all of that? That's dedication. Anyhow, I was guestimating there based on the armour that Newt gave Jacob. While we never heard what it was made of and what it was enchanted with, I'd believe it would make Jacob's protected regions at least 4 times as durable. Don't ask me why 4 times, it's just a number that sort of make sense to me.

*** You forget the friction mate. If you fall from 2 times as high, you're not gonna fall 2 times as fast.

In fact, there's a hard limit to the speed you can attain when freefalling in the athmosphere.

Yet, it seems that the wizards are more durable than the muggles, but not enough to shrug a fall from too high.

**** Yeah I'm aware of friction, I know about the "hard limit to the speed you can attain when freefalling in atmosphere."

I think the term you're wanting is "terminal velocity".

But terminal velocity of a person is /way/ more than needed to kill them on impact.

I'm not entirely sure how friction is relevant here, but okay.

I said 100ft. 100ft is 30m.

500m is 1,640ft.

Not even close to relevant.

** I'm not sure about the "powerful" bit. There are wizards and witches out there who seem to have a knack for magic and can wield it to baffling effects. But they all worked for it, very hard. Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort were all scholars and experts in the various fields of magic.

Maybe, and of course I'm only speculating, it's less about "magic power level" but the resilience and power, if you want, of the soul. Credence developing an Obscurus speaks for a horrible life. Maybe the simple fact that he could stomach that life, persevere through it without the Obscurus devouring him, is the power Grindelwald seeks.

** It's always been the case that some wizards are described (and seen to be) as more powerful than others. The essential issue of dispute in the fantom has always been the factors that determine that power level, and the extent to which it can change in response to experiences. Essentially nature vs. nurture. I don't think FB has changed anything on that front.

Also notable is that once again we had no sign of wizards running out of magic or getting tired out from its heavy use.

*** The whole "not getting tired" thing is once again debateable. As most of the spells we saw in the movie, had to have been used multiple times by the people using them. Newt used Summoning Charms, an Unlocking Charm, etc... it is likely that he has always had to use those spells. Grindelwald is a Dark Lord, so obviously, the extensive use of magic for a normal wizard, would be nothing to him. In fact, he was the only one throwing around cars in the movie. We did see, that magic can overwhelm the body however, as Credence became unstable, and was essentially being ripped apart at the seems.

** The wandless magic is explained in the American magic lore. Wands were an invention of the magical community in Europe. The American schools teach magic mostly wandlessly.

I believe the information is from here: [[https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en]]

#+begin_quote
  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.
#+end_quote

The wandless vs wand magic has nothing to do with movie vs book, thankfully, it is just a cultural difference.

** You can apparate in mid-air, as shown when Newt jumped off the building and apparating mid-air. I believe that Graves (Grindelves?) also did this at some point.

We also saw that electricity can be conjured with magic, as well as channeled back through your wand multiple times. This was a very interesting revelation, as I was always under the impression that it never appeared in canon because Electricity and Magic don't mix well.
