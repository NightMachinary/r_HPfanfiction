  Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack

** I think I know what you're talking about... I definitely read it on ffn, and I don't think it was a time travel fic. Maybe the horcrux gained sentience? It involves Dumbledore continually obliviating the police and putting Harry back with the Dursley's.
