Hi all,

Has there been any new, recent Harry/Katie fics that don't involve pointless harems/"one-handed writing" or is a Cadmean Victory: Remastered?

I've always liked the pairing because, aside from a few canonical bits of info about her, she's a blank character.

I've been keeping an eye out for stuff in 2021, but I'm wondering/hoping something slipped through my net.

Cheers!

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.

** So, I'm actually in the process of writing a Harry/Katie fic. It will end up featuring both a Dark Harry and a Dark Katie. The first chapter has been up on FFN/AO3 for about a month now. I'm still in the process of writing the second chapter for a multitude of reasons. I hope to have it completed and published soon, though.

**** I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it! I know exactly the feeling you're describing --- I couldn't tell you how many times I've come across fics and been like “Please tell me this is new.”

I'm in the process of writing a Flowerpot one-shot that's for what was the Flowerpot discord server's Emily Collection. Things have gotten... complicated with the Collection in the last 24 hours, but I'm still going to finish the story.

After that, it's back to DiD and my Percy Jackson fic.

** I was always intrigued by the little noticed fact that in the moment slightly green Harry waited on his first Quidditch match there was another player of similar colour waiting for her first game.

*** Yeah. :) I always thought that could be a good launching point for at least a friendship between the two, bonding over a similar issue they both had.

Heck, Harry and Katie trying to get each other pep-talks before Harry's first match (and her nervousness) could be a nice little fic.

*** IIRC the original had some initial Harry/Katie where she fucks it up through the typical foibles of being a teenage girl, so I presume the remaster has the same thing, too.

I remember reading the original and I might give the remastered version a go in the future, but at the moment it's a bit of a "been there, done that" thing for me.

***** One thing I enjoyed about it was the love-triangle aspect: Even though she knew she had no chance with him after she realized she'd put a proverbial 9mm into his feelings for her, she still pined for him throughout the fic.

Part of me was actually rooting for Harry/Katie because, while I do enjoy Harry/Fleur, the ultimate pairing is pretty over-done in comparison.

Katie actually acted like a teenage girl doing dumb things around her crush, which was realistic (trust me on that -- most of my friend group growing up was female, so it's how they act, lol).

You couldn't fight darkness with your fists, and no matter how strong your will-power, it could be beaten down by the constant monotony of nothingness. Nobody needed John.
