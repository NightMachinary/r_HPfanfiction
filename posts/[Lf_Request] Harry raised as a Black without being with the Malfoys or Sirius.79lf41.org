*** This fic caused quite a stir a few months ago. Apparently the author described gay sex in more details and someone complained to FFN's admin. Shayalonnie was absolutely furious and threatened to delete all her fics on this site and migrate over to AO3. She reversed her position a few days later however and put in AN that she would tone down some smut scenes in the future.

I think FFN couldn't really afford to lose such a high profile author to its competition and made a deal with her in exchange for some public compromise on her side.

I also think FFN doesn't dare to go after really popular stories. As long as that fic with Harry and Hermione having oral sex at age 11 is not taken down, it basically means it only pays lip service to its policies and will only go after small fishes for show.

Critics United has tried twice against megamatt09's smut fics, without success.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

This is the first real fanfic I ever read, and it's still a bit of a favorite. Malfoy is around and Sirius shows up later, but mostly Harry interacts with and is raised by the Blacks.
