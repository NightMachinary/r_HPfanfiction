It's so hard to find a story with positive Ron Weasley in it, too many of them have bashing him as a character. Either keep his role minor, don't write him in the story at all or have him grow in the story.

It's fanfiction, you can do things differently than in canon. Yet many people bash certain characters (not just Ron), instead of trying to write them in different ways. Like I understand if you watched the movies instead of reading the books (as crazy to me as it seems, I'm sure there are people out there like that). Or maybe you watch the movies more than you read the books, so the personalities of the characters will be different and such.

But to me, bashing on characters is just poor writing. It is fanfiction, you can write things differently. Don't like how Dumbledore acted in canon? Change it to where he's a more positive role model and tries to help Harry out with different things. It might be OOC, but in all honesty a lot of characters that I read about tend to be OOC in stories and people don't seem to realize that, because it's been a long time since they read the books or what have you.

And sometimes there's no warning that a character will be bashed, no warning in the summary or in the chapter with an A/N as though the person writing doesn't realize it's bashing and is just writing the character however, because they see other writers write the character in that way.

What are your thoughts on it? Why do people go straight to bashing instead of either keeping that character's role minor, having that character grow, or not be in the story at all?

Any ideas of what we can do about it and such?

Edit: Having negative characters is perfectly fine, bashing the characters is not. And note I was just mentioning Ron and Dumbledore but I was meaning ANY of the characters like Severus, Draco, McGonagall, or whoever else.


** I also hate bashing and think it's the mark of an immature writer who can't craft a storyline without crutches, but people really gotta stop putting the sole blame on the movies for people not liking Ron. The movie version of Ron was indeed a travesty, but there were people who didn't like him before the movies started coming out.

Yes, I'm old.

** Bashing, yes. But making a character have a negative role in your story isn't poor writing. Having the ability to write a flawed character or even a villain is great writing.

And really, if we're going to talk about character bashing, how many people just bash on Severus Snape, both in this sub and in fanfiction? I would argue that if you're going to say no bashing Ron/Dumbledore or anyone else, no bashing Severus. He can be redeemed just the same if you don't like how he was canon.

Having negative characters is okay.

*** I feel like there's a difference between Ron & Dumbledore having a negative role and Snape or Draco having one though. If you portray Draco or Snape in a lazy antagonistic role, that somewhat goes with how they react to Harry in canon, even if it lacks their canon depth. If Ron, or another "light" character, does the same thing /without explanation/, it's OOC because it's a /major/ jump from their canon protrayal, at least from the perspective we're given (Harry's).

Rather than negative or positive portrayals, I think the complaints about bashing are more about whether their behaviour is justified within the fic universe compared to their behaviour in canon. And character POV matters, obviously.

** I read a story where the main character belittled and insulted Ron from the first meeting. He didn't do this to other characters, just Ron. Keep in mind that this was while Ron was 12 or 13. There was some time travel shenanigans but still. It was cruel and vindictive and put me so strongly in Ron's camp that I can't recover.

there is precedent for this behavior though. Snape is a bonefide gryfindore basher. And Potter basher at that. In fact, throughout most of the story snape seems to delight in being deliberatly cruel and unfair to the majority of the books main characters.

but I wouldn't want to bash Snape.

** My main issue with bashing is that it's /lazy/ writing. For instance, Ron - he's a great character, but a bunch of people want to start halfway through canon and sideline him. So instead of coming up with a believable way of doing so, they caricature him.

I don't mind a negative portrayal of any character - or a positive one. However, it needs to be done in a good/believable way - and bashing almost entirely fails that. That's doubly true when someone is following canon at the start.

The problem with a competent Dumbledore is that would resolve the plot in 5 minutes, at least for books 1-5. You have to keep him incompetent, otherwise you'll end up writing "Harry Potter does nothing while Dumbledore fixes shit".

#+end_quote

Speaking from personal experience, sometimes, there's no good way to resolve a character if you aren't invested into them. I usually avoid writing Ron in important roles because I feel absolutely nothing for his character. Some falling out and then he and Harry are acquaintances rather than best friends.

On the other hand, what should I do with Malfoy? I don't see him changing for the better based on the changes I made in a 4th-year fic. And I don't see him leaving Harry alone either since that would be OOC. So he is stuck in the "toothless antagonist role".

*** There's a difference between writing a character that's negative like Snape and Malfoy, and downright bashing a character like Ron or Dumbledore.

You don't have to change Snape and Malfoy's personality, they're already asshats, so you can write them that way. But, if you write Ron into a asshat character, that just feels like you're bashing him. Unless you do it when Ron thinks Harry put his name in the Goblet, or something realistic like that in canon.

And you don't have to make Dumbledore completely competent, you can do it as necessary to fit the plot, but if all you do is write him in a bashing way, you might as well use him as little as possible.

**** I really struggle to write Dumbledore because finding the right balance with him is really hard. Some of his canon lines fit into any bashing fic, like the one where he tells Harry that what he has been through at the Dursleys was alright because he didn't turn out a spoiled brat. Or him doing nothing for Sirius at the end of PoA. Scenes like those are the reason I can't get behind a positive depiction of him. At the same time, I'm not buying the "steal form Harry, trap him in a marriage contract" fanon either.

I think that the best way is a manipulative, well-meaning version of him who is pretty flexible with his plans and cares about results. Rather than the generic "OMG, Harry got his Gringotts key, better confront him ASAP", I prefer a "well, that's an inconsequential change since it doesn't affect my plan to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Let Harry have some fun".

****** Which makes no sense whatsoever. Dumbledore is already super famous and there's reason to suspect that he was the one who leaked information about Harry in the immediate aftermath. Dumbledore was already prominent enough to get various positions thrown after him, why would he be threatened by another whose legend he at least helped to start?

** Y'all, I'm sorry Ron gets treated like this so often. I'm terrible at writing him so I use Ron as sparingly as possible. I stan my Slytherins hard but I try to make that clear in the tags. I avoid bashing because I understand why others love those characters so much. I really, really hope I've followed through on that.

** I prefer not to bash them but instead have characters act like mature people that everyone loves to portray them as and just ignore the offending characters. All the time Harry is a big mature lord so far above everyone else but he still whines like a bitch because Ron is only attracted to his fame and is jealous now. If he was so mature then he would simply stop being friends with Ron, no need for a big fight or argument to draw attention to it.

** Well, bashing can be good, but only if the author really knows what he is doing and only if stuff stays realistic. Most are exaggerating so hard that it just becomes plain silly.

For me, character bashing, is an art. It has to be subtle to truly work, and if it's done well, it can be great. But yeah, most stories that go for character bashing as just plain stupid. The main victims of bashing are mostly Dumbles/Ron and they are always so badly done that it's just too unrealistic to enjoy.\\
Dumbles becomes an evil schemer who gets away with everything he does, no consequences, and people still think of him as the holy leader of light even after he admits what 'evil' he has done in the name of the 'Greater Good!'\\
Ron starts to become a parody of a Griffidor Draco Malfoy. He antagonizes everyone, he becomes violent, he starts to plot his revenge for people ignoring him, etc. etc. the typical stuff.

Anyway, I like bashing if it's done well since the author can criticize the character in a slightly comedic way. However, I hate bashing when the author decides to go crazy because trying too hard to be funny.

** I disagree.

Bashing, at its core is rewriting the character in a different way. The bashing author is emphasizing perceived negative traits the characters in an exaggerated manner. Sure, you might disagree with the authors interpretation of the original characters, but that does not mean that it's bad writing.

On the contrary, if you take a step back and consider the fanfiction as it's own work of literature, you'll see that the bashing serves as a very legitimate literary purpose. In many of the bashing works I've seen, the author is trying to portray Harry (or whoever the protagonist is) as having the opposite trait. They use the bashed character as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_%28literature%29?wprov=sfla1][foil]] to emphasize this trait. Telemachus' cowardice highlights Odysseus' bravery. The lazy Ron highlights Harry's diligent work ethic. The greater good Dumbledore highlights Harry's care for the individual. The fangirl Ginny highlights Hermione's dedication and usefulness to Harry.

*** Rewriting the character in a different manner is fine. Bashing is going further.

For instance, let's take Ron. We have a canon version of Ron that we can all look at to compare - now, let's imagine someone writing a fanfic involving a change to his character.

Fanfic A starts at the start of 5th year, with the previous 4 years being unchanged in the backstory. Ron gets disposed of in 3 chapters, by having him be a complete lazy slob who is just hanging around Harry to try to get his grubby hands on his gold. Then he's only brought up later to get laughed at. That's bashing.

Fanfic B also decides that it wants Harry to have another best friend. Instead of just making Ron into a full on caricature out of the blue, it starts an earlier divergence - say, Harry sitting next to and befriending Neville on the train and not running into Malfoy. Without the strong desire to stay away from that, Harry gets sorted into Slytherin - and Ron dislikes him due to that. That's not bashing.

Even very negative changes from canon can be done without bashing - a well written evil, scheming Dumbledore one would be a lot of fun to read for instance. But bashing is when it crosses over into being lazy and not making sense, and it just hurts the quality of a fic.

In determining whether or not something in a fanfic is bad writing, you need to take a step back and /pretend that canon does not exist./ You must evaluate the work as its own independent work of literature.

Consider for an example Fanfic C where the author is trying to write a more studious Harry. Throughout the book, Ron is single-mindedly focused on chess is quidditch. He repeatedly tries to convince Harry to procrastinate on his studies by playing a game of chess or quidditch with him, and Harry always declines, choosing to instead work on more important stuff.

Many would consider this to be Ron bashing, and the author might even label it as such. However, when evaluated as its own independent work, it is by no means bad writing. On the contrary, Ron in this story is a textbook example of a foil, his laziness serving to highlight Harry's studiousness. Maybe it's because I tend to stick to the M rated fics, but it seems to me like the fics bashing Ron are more like Fic C.

***** You cannot step back and pretend that canon does not exist /when the premise for the fic is that it starts/ *after* /some part of canon/.

In your Fanfic C, if we see Ron's introduction to Harry from the start, and his characterization is consistent from that point onwards, that's one thing. If instead it starts after a supposedly canon first 3 years, it's another. In addition, for bashing purposes, it does depend on how Ron is presented (IE, if he's a normal student level of laziness like in the books, vs the laziest guy ever.)

Most Ron bashing goes way further than what you seem to be implying. For instance, there's a fic I read recently that had good writing, a fairly unique premise that I was enjoying - and then threw in Ron suddenly saying that he was only hooking up with Hermione because there was no other option until the younger girls 'filled out proper-like', that she was a nightmare, and generally agreeing with someone calling her super ugly - and all, of course, to have Harry end up with Hermione. That's fairly typical for Ron-bashing in my experience.

*** *Foil (literature)*

In fiction, a foil is a character who contrasts with another character, usually the protagonist, to highlight qualities of the other character. In some cases, a subplot can be used as a foil to the main plot. This is especially true in the case of metafiction and the "story within a story" motif. The word foil comes from the old practice of backing gems with foil to make them shine more brightly.A foil usually either differs dramatically or is an extreme comparison that is made to contrast a difference between two things.
