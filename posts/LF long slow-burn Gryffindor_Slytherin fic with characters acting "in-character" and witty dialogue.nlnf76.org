Lately I have been reading a lot of Drarry and Dramione fics, most of which have been.. rather disappointing. I am hoping to find one that fits as many of my criteria as possible, but I know I'm asking for a lot xD so, can you please recommend a fic (ideally Drarry, Dramione or some Marauders era Gryffindor/Slytherin pairing) that: - has over 50k words and is well written/good grammar - is NOT AU (as much as possible considering the pairings I'm looking at ha) - has characters acting as IC as possible - has smart/witty dialogue - contains a slow-burn romance, where the protagonists actually get to know each other and fall in love, as opposed to a secret unrequited love that one of them had for the other all this time - has minimal OCs, or at least any OCs are not protagonists - if possible, is not cringy üòÇ

Thanks in advance!!


** Linkao3(Survival is a Talent) Drarry, is a soulmate AU but it has,like, zero focus on soulmates.They are not in love bc they are soulmates it's just the reason their friendship starts, heck in the begining they aren't even actual friends but slowly get better over time. It has some OCs but I think they're well written and all of them are side characters. (It also starts in 2nd year)

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~‚ÄúAre you trying to get killed, Potter?‚Äù Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. ‚ÄúThis is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.‚Äù Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, ‚ÄúPotter, what the hell--‚Äù~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** My favourite Drarry slow burn fic is linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare). Harry and Draco are put together as Auror partners and at first they can't stand it but their relationship gradually progresses into friendship and then romance.

You might also want to post this at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. There was a very recent post asking for Drarry recs and a lot of them sound like they would fit your request.
