I thought parts of Hermiones' canon character arc were kind of glossed over, specifically, her relationship with her parents and her home culture. Rowling offers us small hints of what she's going through as a muggle born, but Harry's perspective is only going to show us so much.

What would drive a kid to do that to their parents? Why didn't Hermione trust her parents to understand the danger to their own lives? Did she include them in the desicion making process? Did she warn them or anything? It would have been less weird if it was a parent doing this to a teenaged child, but for a teenaged child to do that to her perfectly functional, perfectly stable, perfectly capable parents? What sort of screwy bigoted bollocks was Hermione internalizing, without a second thought, about her own parents?

What the typical muggle born goes through would no doubt do a number on their developing psyches. They are in many ways expected to dump their home culture and adopt wizarding culture, and their circle of family and friends is suddenly under the huge strain of not being able to tell their dear aunt or school chum where they're going for secondary school.

I would like to read a story that explores the kind of mental pressures that muggleborns endure, as they are largely removed from their home culture, and must now exist in a culture that looks down on their own.


** I think what happened to Hermione's parents was needed solely so that the plot can progress with Harry, Ron and Her going off alone. Hermione loves her parents, and they're probably good people and love her back. So, rationally, if their 16-17 year old daughter went home and told them, "you need to go into hiding, but I need to stay on the frontlines to fight" they would have told her if the danger's that big, they all ought to go into hiding together. Sorry about that, darling, but we love you, and your safety is the most important. I'm sure your friends will be fine, and aren't adults fighting this war already?

​

Seeing as Harry has no parental figures to hold him back (as he tries to go off alone in the night), and Mrs Weasley is rather ineffective in trying to stop them from plotting (maybe because she knows more background info on the situation and is more understanding, or maybe because the plot needs her to be a less effective mother hen), Hermione's parents are the real, but easily taken out danger to the brains of the trio going along.

​

No doubt Hermione is in turmoil about this, because she surely didn't tell them word for word what happened over the years, as I imagine they'd have been more concerned for her safety already (like when she was petrified and probably didn't write home for that duration). So maybe, rather than pile it on for them in one go and strong-arm them into letting her go, she did the thing that was faster and didn't require immediate confrontation. She probably thought: shit just got real, I'll deal with consequences later. Seeing as she's still a teenager at the time, this is kind of realistic behavior in a crisis, tho?

​

Although, you really do raise a lot of questions and themes in your post that I would love to also read about.

*** Oh duh, of course her parents would want to take their underage kid with a bright future to safety with them. And good point about Hermione being a teen in crisis. Now I kind of want to read a fic about Mr. and Mrs. Granger taking a more pro-active role in the wizarding world. Maybe they look into pressing charges against Hogwarts after the basilisk, in a legal battle that threatens the Statute of Secrecy? Maybe they send desperate letters to Education Scotland? Maybe that's a topic for a new post.

But back to my original theme, maybe a story focusing on Hermione wouldn't be the purist example of what I'm looking for. What about Dean Thomas as a focus character? That must have been a shock, walking into a school where even the nice purebloods dismissed the entire concept of football.

**** Sadly, in the fics I've read so far, it's either been lazy writing or intentional, but muggles barely have any means to bring wizards to justice.

It would really be great to read something where they have to answer for the mayhem. Like in HBP, the first chapter, the poor Prime Minister is rightfully flabbergasted and angry, but the Miniser of Magic just tells him, well pal, that's the way things are gonna be, we're trying our best too, make your peace with it. And the muggle minister just had to take it. Would have been nice if he could take action. Or even join in with the fight, or something.

** linkao3(Culture Shock by thirty2flavors) may be of interest to you. It's about Lily, not Hermione, but it definitely explores the fish-out-of-water experience muggleborns must have, both at Hogwarts and back in the muggle world. (I know it's marked as incomplete, but the first chapter works just fine as a standalone.)

  She first hears the word “Mudblood” bellowed at top volume out of a red envelope she will later learn is called a Howler.   Five times Lily Evans hated being Muggle-born.

** Eleven Up explores some of this, through the varying ways that different muggleborns react to the wizarding world and their evolving relationships with the muggle world as they grow up. linkao3(5147618)

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.
