Has anyone else thought of this?


** Have fun spending two weeks going through another two weeks of your life to find the 10 minutes that were wiped from your mind. That's assuming you had the time that day to spent half an hour pulling a day's worth of memories out your mind before it got obliviated.

Actually, the worst case is probably not getting obliviated. Then you spent two weeks going through your memories for nothing.

In short, there are better ways of protecting your mind.

Edit: In reply to OP's now-deleted comment regarding a filing system to better organize one's memories within a pensive:

#+begin_quote
  I mean, it seems from canon that you can call up specific memories at will. The organization isn't really an issue. The issue is that, by nature of having your memory wiped, you're not going to know you have been obliviated. It gets even worse if your obliviator uses the false memory charm as well. You'd be spending incredible amounts of time going through your memories out of the low chance you've been obliviated. You might as well just keep a detailed journal, it'd be more concise that way.

  Pensieve memories are exact. You'd literally have to look carefully through every second to make sure everything is consistent. Imagine if you're Fudge's assistant and he wipes the memory of seeing a sensitive file on his desk the next day, replacing it with a memory of a different file. You've spent 10 hours going through your memories of that day. Do you really think you're going to notice the discrepancy of a secret file on his desk?

*** Maybe someone could build a Pensieve/Computer hybrid with encryption and a checksum feature. Any change changes the checksum which is easy to compare. Modifying a memory without changing the checksum would require reverse engineering the memory hashing algorithm. Modern cryptography has a lot of neat techniques for preventing people from messing with important data.

**** The issue with this (and I'm no computer engineer) beyond the doubts I have that computing can be made compatible with HP magic, as that seems not only contraindicated from canon and thematically inconsistent, but that memories are modified all the time. Every time you reconsolidate (when you retrieve a memory and then re-encode it) a memory, you unintentionally modify it. The extent depends on a variety of factors.

Also a quick google search seems to indicate that checksums are used to prevent accidental data modification but are not very useful indicators of data authenticity. It seems many memories would fail the checksum because of reconsolidation. And any intentional changes made by others may not even be detected by such algorithms. And that assumes compatibility.

I think the take-away message is that any attempts to consolidate technology and magic is doomed to failure. Magic can recognize what a secret is; souls exist; and you can create matter with a flick of a wand. This method of protecting one's memories is simply inferior, short any advances or superior methods in the HP world.

** Why not get a Time Turner and go through every day twice, the first time defending the second time through.

That way, if 2nd-You is not around, you'll know something's up, and you'll always know what's going to happen, when you're living the life that people actually see.

Sure, it means you'll die younger, only making it to an average of 75 instead of 150, but so it is for all muggles, so it's not like that's a bad deal.

**** No. I'd half my lifespan to totally screw over a Dark Lord or two, who most definitely wouldn't expect weaponized use of a Time Turner, given that â€˜terrible things' happen to a wizard that messes with time. And given that older-me is the public one, I'd be testing that theory extensively; safeguarded by magical oaths of course.

I'm not really losing anything, after all. I'm a Muggle now, so I can accept a normal Muggle lifespan, I've not giving anything up, just not gaining anything either, there.

** Seems to be easier said than done. We all say we'll backup our hard drives in case shit happens but most of us don't do it regularly. It's much easier to just get a good anti virus protector.

So in essence, just learn Occlumency instead. I'm not sure though how good you have to be in that for it to be a passive skill.

** I don't remember if this is fannon or headcannon or actual cannon but I believe in cannon that their was a line about how if memory was removed too many times it would cause issues in Goblet of Fire on that muggle. I think that they also said something similar in Half Blood Prince for wizards volentarily removing memorys for recolection if done enough times, though we don't ever get a hard number but the danger is there. So I probably wouldn't do it regularly, maybe Yearly or every other year? I mean its degrading on your memories and adding onto that the actual degradation that comes from time and I would assume a wizard who meant well and did so ended up as a horror story in Mungos. Still in general a backup could be useful as it would prevent lock-heart situations.

TLDR; While somewhat useful when up against a novice or uncaring Obliviator up against a master it would be a lot more harm then good and while its something that should be done, it needs to be done sparingly.
