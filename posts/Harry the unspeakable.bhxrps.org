** I know of one where he pairs up with Tonks.

His first assignment is to break into the office that detects underage magic to sabotage his own detection device. It was ridiculous. There was the cliché training room where he could impress everyone with his amazing power and abilities. I think they had badges that showed their magical prowess according to colours or something. To get 100% on one of the badges he needed to master all the unforgivables. It's got all the shiny new clichés that we later learned to hate.

Yup, I found it. It's linkffn(Harry Potter And The Summer Of Change by lorddwar) and it helps being drunk when you read it.

  "Your mission for the day, Harry, is a multipart mission. Since you are a minor according to the Ministry you are to infiltrate the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. More specifically, the Improper Use of Magic Office. Once there, you will locate the sensory device that has been attuned to you or your current location. You must disable the device without it being obvious.

  Harry Potter arrives to the wizarding world as an unusually intelligent and talented young boy. He soon discovers that initial impressions may be deceiving, and that there is a lot more to the wizarding world than meets the eye. How far will he go to unravel the secrets of this world and of magic, and will the pursuit consume him in the end?

** Well I don't know any. It would really interest me reading one of that. But I have one where the unspeakables are interested in Harry Potter because he is just like one and making Chaos through the newspaper articles he writes.
