It makes sense that Harry refused to work with Scrimgeour, because the Man was a preening idiot that only hindered him, and didn't fire/arrest Umbridge. Are there any fics where Harry, Dumbledore, or someone tricks the Ministry into being useful. Crack fic, most likely.

"Mininster, I've heard Sirius Black intends to break out his fellow Death Eaters. Perhaps we should move them" "Nonsense, give them all the Kiss, we can't have Bellatrix Lestrange out on the streets on my watch"

Using Sirius as a scapegoat, as he's hidden under Fidelius, to impede Voldemort. "Minister, my contacts say that now the Prisoners are gone, Sirius Black intends revenge and has found an old family spell that can steal Control of the Dementors" Fudge then proceeds to do something about the Dementors. That sort of thing.

"Minister, Sirius Black intends to Imperius all of Voldemort's old victims. Perhaps you should make sure they see Mind Healers and learn Occlumency, and have them tested for resistance to the curse" so that no one gets away with the Imperius defense post war.

Umbridge at Hogwarts? Use her irrational racism to either make her into a good teacher, or have her hire one. Harry not being an idiot "HOW ABOUT VOLDEMORT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME" nonsense but instead something about Werewolves, Dark Creatures and Half breeds. "Mudbloods?" have them be useful, trained properly so they can have jobs like Hitwizard and creature disposal (like MacNair does) so that Proper Purebloods don't get put at risk from the dangerous Dark Creatures.

Actively using the Ministry's stupidity and bigotry to make them hilariously cracky level competent.


** Not exactly the same, but linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) has Hermione gain Fudge's ear and start leading him around like a little lost lamb.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
