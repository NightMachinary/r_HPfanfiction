One area of fan fiction that intrigues me, but I haven't found much of, is Luna Lovegood interacting with Rubeus Hagrid. The one time Luna references Hagrid directly is when she rather bluntly criticizes his teaching skills.

However, I find the idea of Hagrid and Luna bonding over their love of animals, perhaps Thestrals, to be interesting.

So, are there any stories out there where this sort of interaction is at least a subplot? I'd prefer not to read shipping.

Sounds like an interesting way to bond, and a unique concept.

Stories that involve Hagrid and sexual situations usually traumatize people, at least when I made a Fic Search thread.
