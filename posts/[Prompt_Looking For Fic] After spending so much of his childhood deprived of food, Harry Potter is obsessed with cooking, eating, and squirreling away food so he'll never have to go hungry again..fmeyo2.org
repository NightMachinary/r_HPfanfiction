Bonus points if he ends up eating way more than Ron but still keeping rail thin because his lifestyle is way too active.


** I can just picture Harry using the invisibility cloak to hide his extra food from everyone else. Because using a deathly hallow to store snacks is freaking amazing.

*** There's a fic where Harry goes "missing" or goes into slytherin or something, so Dumbledore resorts to the backup plan AKA Neville. Neville gets the cloak for christmas and only uses it to sneak to the kitchens.

And I can't find it. I really need to sort my bookmarks...

***** It's still in character for him. There's the fact it is a Hallow, and Harry was missing, presumed dead. Once Dumbledore sets his mind or opinion on something, he won't change it no matter what. Even in the face of evidence that disproves him. He flat out ignores it. Year 6, Malfoy. Year 5, Occlumency lessons. Snape in general. There's more.

This isn't bashing. It's one of his character flaws.

******* Well, if Harry was dead, then there are no more potters. by law, it would go to the closest living relative. This relative would be Draco, wouldn't it?

******** Harry wasn't dead anyway. And closest relative would be Petunia.

Closest magical relative? I don't know, possibly.

** I don't think there is ever enough fic dealing with the reality of the aftermath of Harry's abuse. There are so many things that would be affected by what he went through, and I really connect with stories that address this.

*** It's a bit depressing, but I really do think addressing the aftermath of the abuse in a realistic manner congruent to how abused children react is a part of the fandom needs to explore more, with sensitivity and without sensationalizing the trauma.
