Or; Magorian is never having a drunken bet with Firenze again.\\
Or; as a precursor to handling hippogriffs, Hagrid negotiates to bring a creature to class that's more intelligent, even prouder, and less likely to murder the students.\\
Or; interested in expanding their knowledge, the Forbidden Forest centaurs attend a Care of Magical Beings class.\\
Or; Hagrid is campaigning for equal treatment of various magical beings, and plans to use his COMC class to enlighten his students about the culture of centaurs, merfolk, veela, house-elves, goblins, giants...\\

** "We are not toys or attractions for the amusement of your children. You trespass in our forest and have the gall to parade us in front of you like your prize stallion? Shall we mate for you next? This is the gravest insult you could possibly have given. Know that you and yours are not welcome in this forest any longer. The children shall not be harmed, as we are not savages like you so clearly believe, however any adult who enters the forest shall be met with extreme hostility. Now begone Hagrid. And do not deign to step foot in this place again."

*** Y'know, that reminds me of those fics where Harry goes 'your not speaking to me for three weeks was an unforgivable betrayal and we are no longer friends' to Ron after the First Task.

***** Well, yes, but this is a prompt to write a silly idea. So how much the centaurs go along with the silliness is entirely up to the author.

...But now I'm wondering about the possibility of 'a xenophobic centaur and a supremacist pureblood are locked in a room together'.

***** Firenze didn't just help Dumbledore, he taught the Centaurs own magic to outsiders, that like Ollivander teaching Goblins how to make wands.

Otherwise I agree, we saw how they reacted to Umbridge insulting their intelligence.

** I would love it in like 5th year, Harry and them show up and Hagrid introduces them to the Centaur herd one of the few Creatures with Human Intelligence. They are being kind and nice and Harry and Bane begin to snipe at each other off to the side... Then suddenly their throwing punches and spells and Arrows and everyone is like "OMG Harry is a Centaur-Racist"
