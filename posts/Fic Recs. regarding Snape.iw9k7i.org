Hey,

I was wondering if you guys could recommend me few fics while my immune system irons out some certain hard and unavoidable differences with the illegal immigrants called Corona viruses that are in my system. There're few qualities I'd like these fics to have and these are;

​

I'd rather this fics focus on Professor Snape as the main or one of the main supporting PoVs if it's a OFC/Snape romance that focuses more on the OFCs PoV,

I'd rather avoid first person narrative, never been a fan of it,

I'd rather avoid omniscient OCs and SI,

I'd rather avoid childish reasonings and black and white world views. If possible I'd like Sirius' words to be true about it's not about bad vs good etc.

And if possible, I'd rather like to read from an Author that is writing because of his/her genuine excitement and passion rather than his/her need to mentally masturbate about his/her ideals or revenge fantasies.

I'd rather avoid character bashings,

And since I'd rather avoid character bashings, I'd rather avoid fics with James Potter in them tbh as he has 3 scenes in the books and 1 in Pottermore and all of them are pretty much James Potter bashing. Not saying he's deserving of said bashing or not but my opinion on canon Potter Sr. is a bit low. But I'd be delighted to be proven wrong by a talented author who's able to turn that non-character into a character tbh.

I'm fine with any era or timeline.

Oh and here're some of the fics I've read and loved in my immune system fight corona virus' stubborn refuasl to deport itself out of my body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2499965/1/The-Pawn]] One of the best short stories I've read and the fact that author predicted Albus' and Severus' characters and their relationships so precisely before the DH's publishment is a tastement to his/her (I believe her but not sure) talent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]] Probably most of you guys have read this already but for people who didn't have the time or the opp. read it. One of the best, if not the best Severus/Lily fics out there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12864182/1/Bad-Oracle]] From the same author as Puzzle, a good crack fic. It was both humorous and touching.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041666/1/Honour-Among-Death-Eaters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]] These two are written by the same author and are quite good as well regarding stroy progression and character developments etc. There are some cliches in Long Road Home such as an distraction occouring just as two main love interests are about to kiss but nothing is perfect right?

​

Edit: Oh and thanks in advance for your time and have a good day!


** Blood Magic by GatewayGirl

It is a Severitus story, ie Snape is Harry's biological dad. It is a sixth year AU and the story focuses on their growing and complicated relationship after they found out.

I find it really well-written with Harry acknowledging that people aren't perfect and that nothing is black and white, that you can do the right thing for the wrong reasons and vice versa. Essentially Harry growing up and getting a more nuanced view of James and Severus.

The story was written before HBP came out so the backstory to Snape is different, he is a pureblood with non-European ancestry. And bisexual and attracted to Lupin, so lots of emotional stuff to unpack.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

Another story that I like is the Darkness and Light triology by R.J. Anderson starting with "The Potions Master's Apprentice". Also written before HBP came out and giving Snape a slightly different backstory, but really good. IMO it has stood the test of time. Snape with a female OC who is not a Mary Sue.

*** Thanks for the reply and the recs! I'm not sure if I'll check the first one since it changes Harry's father and racebends Snape but second one seems like an interesting one, specially considering that it doesn't have the HBP and DH canons, will def. check it out now. Thanks again and take care!

**** I think you are doing the fic a disservice to dismiss it. There are few authors in the HP fandom who are as good as Gateway Girl and she shines when she writes an ambiguous Snape.

The racebend is not intentional, at the time the story was written so little was known about Snape that it was a believeable explanation for his dark hair. It provides something for Harry and Snape to bond over and it comes up a few times. For example Draco Malfoy uses a spell to test for non-European ancestry on Harry and that raises all sorts of uncomfortable questions.

Changing Harry's biodad - I am not going to argue about that, bc that is sort-of the whole plot-point. But many of my fav stories are Severitus/Sevitus and I cannot fathom dismissing them just bc of that. I find the conflict that this provides for Severus just so interesting.

***** Oh I'm sure she's a good writer since all of her stories have very above avarage comments and kudos. It can be easily seen that what she writes is enjoyable for great number of people. But the plot points are just not for me tbh and I've no interest in reading a male/male homosexual relationship, no offence to anyone but that whole concept is not something I can stomach. Just my sexual preference.

And the concept of a spell being able to identify ancestry is alright and fine but that spell should not be able to be performed by an although clever and resourceful, still a very much of a child. Since I'm guessing that spell identifies the ancestry through checking genetic make up, I'd guess/expect that it needs to be done in a very sophisticated labrotary and the results needs to be compared to other regional genetic samples. And to perform magic to precise enough to discern genetical degree one has to be very very experienced and talented.

And dark hair having something to do with non-European ancestry is just screaming not knowing anything about ethnic Europeans. Sub category of Indo European people, although fair (fairer compared to other regional ethnicities atleast) skin seems to be a unifying factor Europeans whether it be Germanic, Slavic and Latins etc have all varying degrees of fair hair/eyes and brown/black hair/eyes. I myself come from a non-Indo European people as I am Georgian myself but nearly my whole family have mix of people with from blondes with brown/hazel eyes to black hair and blue eyes. I kinda blame US racial understanding for not understanding the fact that race is more than just a hair or eye colour. Things like skull structure, bone structure, melanin, blood types etc all play part in that area. I could understand if the story was in for example a Nordic country where Populations have 80%+ and sometimes 90%+ fair eyes etc but it passes in England where even before the huge migration of non-European peoples traits such as brown eyes and black hair were not that uncommon.

Anyway, talking about genetical differences or similaritie of varying European peoples is not a place of Hpfanfiction subreddit I guess so I'll shut up. I guess I've too much time on my hand sitting at home doing nothing. :D Yea, I'm kind of a perfectionist and a very hang up on the details on stuff like this so that's why I said I'll pass on this story.

****** Okay, so. I have a couple problems with your statements: changing Snape's race was, from what I've read in the summary, a stylistic choice in order to use it as a plot point. It does not mean that the author didn't think that dark hair, dark eyes and fair skin could not be European. (It is, and you can find that on the British Isles. [[https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS-VuGxDmpiGuxOemwqVykTUKmDgnMFmnzPYA&usqp=CAU][This dude]] is Welsh, and ticks all those boxes for example.) I, personally, have dark hair, hazel eyes and olive skin, and I am of 100% "standard" European extraction (and most of it is IRISH).

Next: Ethnic Europeans are not a subcategory of Indo-Europeans as IE is a /language group/. There is no known relation between Kartvelian (which includes Georgian) and Indo-European, just like Uralic languages are also separate (Finnish, Hungarian, etc). IE includes the language groups you mentioned (Italic, Germanic, Slavic), but also Greek, Armenian, Persian, Punjabi, Hindustani, Albanian, and a whole host of others.

*We do not know where the Proto-Indo-Europeans came from, /and/ we do not know what they looked like.*

Finally... The way you're using the term ethnic European is /nonsense./ The people from the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean are all equally "ethnic" Europeans as a random dude from Norway.

******* Well, we know that people who spoke proto Indo-European became the dominant culture/language in these areas and when it comes to Uralic languaages, their speakers have more than few thousand years of inter-breeding with European ethnic groups. Language is a bad idea to classify people based on their genetic lineage I know but it's better than nothing.

You forgot Greece again.

Kartvelian speakers /also/ have a few thousand years of inter-marriage with IE ethnic groups, by the way.

Don't forget that it's likely that everyone from India to Iceland has some PIE-descended ancestors in there /somewhere/ so using that particular language group to classify people by appearance is less than useless.

Oh ofcourse, I'm not forgetting that but we are bit more of a ''mutt'' than Western Uralics as interbreeding of Kartvelian Speakers includes Turkics and Middle Eastern peoples to little degree as well.

#+end_quote

Oh yea I forgot didn't I. I've lived in Turkey's Georgian border town until university so my brain never classified them as Europeans and still don't for the most part. I've always considered Greece and Anatolia to be their own little thing in on self rather than being part of Europe and Middle East respectively.

********** And yet Greece and Anatolia are both home to Indo-Europeans - the older languages of Anatolia might be extinct in favour of Turkic ones, but historically? They're related. (Hittite is the one I can remember off the top of my head as it's the 'famous' one, but Anatolian was its own sub-family just like Germanic and Indo-Iranian).

Which is why it's so silly to use a language group, /especially/ that particular one, to classify people. Remember: Sanskrit and Latin are cousins, and PIE ancestors are scattered throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa too.

** First of all, thank you for including some fics! I was really searching something to read, and maybe I've missed one or two.

And I bring to your attention my favorite series of Snape's fan fictions: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/981534]]

They are admittedly a bit weird, but I love them. It's a "Snape survives" series.

Since I'm from smartphone I have a bit of an hard time putting links and searching stories, but I was also reading a very good Snape/Lily in the past months. I'll see if I can find it later!

Get well soon and take care!

*** Hmm, the Pawn doesn't have any romantic relationships. It focuses on young Severus and Albus Dumbledore in the midst of the first war.

Puzzle weird in a good way. I've always hated self-destructive behaviour, self-harming, self-denial etc. Like, you can't get me to hate you if you curse at me all day and bother me, I'll just ignore you but if you're someone I care about and you're behaving in a self-destructive way then I'll hate you more than anything I've ever hated and that fic is that. I love it and hate it so much that it's weird. That's the only thing I'm gonna say about that fic.

Honour Among the Death Eaters is it's own thing, about the relationship between young Severus with his friends from Death Eaters, Dumbledore and Lily.

In Long Road home, it's a slow process of understanding, emphaty, re-discovering each other and coming to terms with each others choices whether they were a mistake or not.

And about the incredulity part, I am not saying all people are like that or Lily was like that either since Lily is more of a plot device then a rounded up character in the story but people are able to forgive, move past and ignore a lot from people they care about. For example, I wouldn't love my brother or my father or my mother or any of my oldest friends any less if were racist, hell I wouldn't care if they were Hitler himself. I might be disappointed, I might be angry or dissappointed but my relationship with them is based on how much they care for me and how much I care for them. So yea, people can forgive a lot when it's the people who love them that needs the forgiving. Hence the reason Lily was fine with having a relationship with someone who she hated for 6 straight years because ultimately, it doesn't matter if he was a relentless school yard bully who traumatize more than few people, in the end all that mattered was the fact that he kept the bullying out of her field of vision last year and gave her his undivided attention and care.

** Linkao3(A Dealer not a Death Eater by Jaxon)

This is an awesome fic with an exciting plot. It really gets into the nitty-gritty nuance of cultural oppression (re: the First Wizarding War), love and the dynamics in abusive families (re: Snape's past), and has lots of other social themes.

The Marauders exist, but aren't a huge focus (though the though Lily-James dynamic is really interesting in this AU). Also: the story is quite dark, but /very/ complex, morally.

If you're more in the mood for an adventure with a more positive spin (ie, featuring more of the resilience and comraderie we knew and loved in canon), then I recommend the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1315952][Different Path]]" series by Dtill35 and Moonybird on AO3. (The summary does not even remotely do this work justice.)

It's a really fun genfic with lots of unique storyline and some of my favorite OC's ever. It also features one of my favorite tropes: Snape is a Marauder.

The Marauders are a huge part of this, but they all have really significant character growth--so if you're interested in seeing Sirius come to terms with his family situation and make peace with Regulus, this fic has that. It also has an arc for Remus standing his ground, and another for his "furry problem". James' growth is based around maturity and the responsibility of leadership. And Peter's is beyond a sentence or two of explanation; it's terrific.

The author's (Moonybird) first language is not English, but Dtill35 does a good job editing. And the few awkward words that make it through are well worth the fantastic story.

Edit: editor is Dtill359; I forgot a # .

#+begin_quote
  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.
