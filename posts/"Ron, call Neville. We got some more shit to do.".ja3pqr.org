I find myself wanting to read da story in which the DA(or a few of them, perhaps just the ministry six) fill the role of the Expendables, the titular mercenaries who are, really, more moral than they want to let on. I'm not as sure as I could be as to the why, but this particular idea won't leave me and I really don't want to inflict my writing on the world just to see it. Please point me to something of the like.

*** "ahhh shit, harry. What? What is it?"

Harry hesitated.

"Well, have uh. You heard of the muggle supergroup 'abba?' They're in serious trouble! Hey, come back!"

Not what I was looking for but still funny

** I don't think there was much morality involved in the whole DA. Most people were there to hear Harry's story or they were Weasleys. Same happened with Ministry Six. Harry went to save Sirius, Hermione and Ron went cause they were fiercely loyal to Harry, Ginny went cause she had a crush on Harry, Neville went cause he had a crush on Ginny and Luna went cause she had no friends and, thus, nothing better to do that evening.

Edit: fucked up my spelling and needed to correct it.

*** I was referring to the Expendables with that remark, who are "bastard mercs" who also happen to save damsels and such

***** Now I'm picturing something hilarious. Luna finally finds a Crumple Horned Snorkack who she befriends. But then a wizard kills it. Now you see Luna go on a John Wick style rampage. As Luna takes out more and more people, she finds more creatures who flock to her dark, yet whimsical nature. She has an army of nargles that hide in mistletoe and attack the naughty. She commands Wackspurts who infect wizard brains more effectively than an “Imperio” and are completely untraceable. Soon the entire Wizarding World is reformed with Luna as their leader. Hogwarts is renamed Snorkack Academy and becomes a haven for all magical creatures.
