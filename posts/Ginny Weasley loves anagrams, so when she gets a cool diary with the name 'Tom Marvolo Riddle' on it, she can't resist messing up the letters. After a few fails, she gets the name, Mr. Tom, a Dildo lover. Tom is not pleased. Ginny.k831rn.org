** Of course the teenage dark lord isn't pleased. Would any teenage boy, even a deranged one, be comfortable explaining the birds and the bees to a prepubescent?? Methinks that would be most displeasing lol. I can imagine it going something like this

/Riddle pacing back and forth, quite anxious for Potter to get there, consciously ignoring a befuddled Ginny who keeps vying for a decent answer/

*** Why would Harry know what a Dildo is? He's got an abusive family, and we don't know if Hogwarts has Sex Ed. And if they did, we don't know WHEN or how...comprehensive it is. Harry has less of a chance knowing what one is than Ginny, who has a loving family that would actually teach her.

He'll be stuck with two very confused preteens (both a boy and a girl, at that) asking what a Dildo is!

** From linkao3(54503938)

‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù Riddle looked at him, still pointing Ginny's wand, but now smiling. ‚ÄúYou know, when I first heard of how you defeated Voldemort, I thought I'd lure you down here and kill you. Now seeing you face to face, I understand.‚Äù

Harry looked down at Ginny, keenly aware that with each passing minute, she crept closer and closer to death. But what could he do? I've got to keep him talking, wait for an opening.

‚ÄúWhy would you care? Voldemort was after your time?‚Äù

Tom laughed at this, ‚ÄúYou don't get it? It's an anagram.‚Äù

Harry looked down at the map where letters were now rearranging, ‚ÄúOvert Mold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, No, LORD Voldemort. Is that parchment a magical anagram solver?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that. Odd Mover Troll? Mr. Old Dot Lover?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No. Ok, fine maybe it doesn't work so well in that direction. It's ‚ÄòI am Lord Voldemort'. It's an anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I don't suppose Tom is short for Thomas?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes. Why?‚Äù

/Lord volt's airhead mom, Admiral Voldemort's Ho,/ ‚ÄúNo reason.‚Äù

    He nodded. "It's called Malicious Compliance and I am the master of it. If I'm willing to compromise my own health and well-being just to destroy a terrible teacher's life out of revenge for her terrible treatment of me, I will literally do anything to get back at people being unfair to me. Remember this, sir. We can have a nice seven years between us or it can get so much more embarrassing for you. I have exactly no shame or the ability to feel it apparently."
