I don't remember what fic this was, and despite enjoying the story for the most part, this really weirded me out. Harry got into a relationship with his opposite gender alternate universe self.

I had a pahse years ago where I intentionally sought out the worst stories and pairings I could as a sort of strength-building exercise. To put it into context, I read 50 Shades of Grey /before/ it became a book, and a thousand worse stories, haha.

I think my contribution to this thread however will be a Albus/Hermione fic where old Dumbles went on a rapey pillage of the entire Order of the Phoenix in Book 5 and Hermione ends up pregnant. I think that one was the only fic I've ever read where I had to stop and close the tab.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around.

  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.

** the fans are craaaazy.

I think I've read one with giant squid, but with Draco or Harry, or both and I think they were also still children in it. then there was one with Hagrid and Snape (arguably not a weird ship, although it was heavily focused on Hagrid's ... size, so it was pretty cringy)

I think craziest are generally those that ship Harry with his children (I don't even click those), or other parent/child. though I wouldn't mind like time traveling Harry, cause they would be in the same age. and there could be a fic where he fathers himself, futurama anyone?

then fics that have sexual relationships with or between 11 year olds. I saw one where Draco in first year, rapes Harry... Ron was also there (all are 11), I don't really remember if Ron helped Draco or he was also the victim. I stopped reading pretty quickly.

and then Tommary where Voldy is his canon noseless self. and it's a relationship, not just torture.

I suppose I don't stumble on the really weird ones, the squid one is really the only truly weird.

They ban certain spells for safety reasons but Dark!James is (a) playing a Death Eater and (b) has created several very nasty spells and (c) they're encouraged to behave as their teams really would have.

** To smart for her own good

I thought it was an adorable harryxhermione fic but when I read it I had to go to my first account that I made(james351) and go through my selections of Harry x hermione just to get it out of my mind. The premise of the story is that hermione wants to be taken more seriously and so she and Harry make a potion that will do just that and they also have an antidote and when she takes it she gets stronger and her skin becomes impenetrable meaning the needle with the cure won't work show she has to drink it but sadly she throws it up and then proceeded to turn Into a giant not a giantess but a male giant and I will hate that fic for the rest of my life

If you want to read my first ever fic cursed caramels by the Greek wizard please give it a read ( I know I am a sellout)

** Plenty of the weirdest have been mentioned but the incest ones are not only weird but also very popular, which makes it weirder. At least Squid/Hogwarts isn't taken seriously.

But Harry/Lily or Harry/fem!Harry is unironically loved by many. Like, imagine telling someone in real life that your fav ship is a mother/son one, or brother/sister, or self-incest.

Not a big deal, and I wouldn't be disgusted with someone who was into it, but it's still weird af.
