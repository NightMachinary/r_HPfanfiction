FanFiction has fleshed out so many different classes but what are some of your favourites or ones you thought could have contributed more to the story?


** Rowling originally intended to have NEWT level students studying alchemy, but I guess it got ditched in the name of streamlining. So yeah, I think alchemy would have been a cool addition, either as an OWL elective or as a NEWT.

*** Rowling actually intended for it to be a first year class in addition to divination and a class about beasts.

#+begin_quote
  A slightly different list of school subjects appears in my earliest notes. Herbology is called ‘Herbalism', Divination is compulsory from the first year, as are Alchemy and a subject called simply ‘Beasts', whereas Transfiguration is called ‘Transfiguration/Metamorphosis'.
#+end_quote

She also mentioned that Alchemy is occasionally taught at Hogwarts as a NEWT elective, but only if sufficient demand is met.

#+begin_quote
  Very specialised subjects such as Alchemy are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand.
#+end_quote

She wrote about this in a [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-school-subjects][Wizarding World article]].

She also mentioned in [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/alchemy][a different article]] that there are books about Alchemy the Library meant for sixth and seventh years.

#+begin_quote
  Although there are books on alchemy in the library at Hogwarts, and I always imagined that it would be studied by very clever students in their sixth and seven years, Hermione most uncharacteristically ignores the opportunity. Perhaps she feels (as Harry and Ron certainly do) that, far from wishing to make another Philosopher's Stone, they would be happy never to see another one in their lives.

*** Good to see you on here too!

I always liked the idea of an enchanting class myself. Warding was another one I always thought would have made sense.

** Alchemy like Taure said and one of the Flamels.

A healing class taught by a retired Ted Tonks or Fleur cuz my headcanon has both great at that.

** I'd like it if Rowlings original intention of adding a beast and alchemy class was followed through.

Alchemy because its a nice contrast to Astronomy, and actually relies on it, its also a good way to show how they still learn about science of the world from a magical point of view. I think Lockhart would be a fitting teacher, since [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][his Pottermore article]] actually mention how he actually had the ambition of creating the Philosopher's Stone, and since it also mentions that was a good student with good marks(before they became very rusty after school), I could buy him having skill in Alchemy. Mostly though because he is the kind of person whose character makes him fit right in with the atmosphere at Hogwarts.

Beasts, because it would be a nice contrast to Herbology, so you not only start learning about magical plant, but creatures as well, it would also make DADA a more magic focused class, since magical creatures would be covered in Beats. I think Lupin would be a fitting teacher for this since that seemed to have been his specialty when he taught DADA, and I could see Dumbledore giving him this Job. Also hes a pretty skilled teacher, and like Lockhart he fits right in as a Hogwarts teacher.

*** How is Beasts different from the canon Care of Magical Creatures class? It really seem the same class, with a better name only as an elective.

**** One seems to be more on how to personally handle the creatures, the other would probably concentrate more about studying the creatures in class.

** A class that I feel have potential would be on rituals. In no moment are we told that rituals are banned or restricted. Could be used for self-improvement for example, supernatural intelligence and strength for example.

Not really a new class but would have been cool if Divination was treated a little more serious as a class instead of a plot-device to explain Harry's connection with Voldemort and a joke from time to time. Things like giving a duelist the ability to see the spell his/her adversary is going to use a little before, or being used to see how is going to be the weather in the next day or if someone is in danger, would be cool if it was how the Weasley's watch works.

To be fair, we also aren't told that rituals even exist in Harry Potter, the closest thing would be protection of a sacrifice like Harry and Lily used, but you cant really do much with it in a classroom.

**** Good point, we also have Voldemort's ritual at fourth year, but to be fair, as far as we know it may just be some potion.

** I like it when in post-war fics they add some kind of a ‘wizarding culture' class to help Muggle-raised children adapt to a new world they're thrown in.

** - Alchemy
- Dueling
- Healing
- Enchanting
- Occulmancy
- Wizarding World Etiquette
- Wizarding World Politics
- Wizarding World Economics

The last three, I see Dumbledore removing them. I headcanon Dumbledore as a guy who scoffs at tradition. It most likely pisses off the traditionalists, and kneecaps the muggle raised/born.

** Dark Arts taught by Professor Belatrix Lestrange would sadly be out of question because of Dumbledore annoying tendency of ignoring the possible hilarious situations possible in favor of giving the students actual morally sound classes. Would definitely want to see it in a crack story thought, or even with Grindewald as professor, they could be forced to teach as a type of community service.

It would be awesome seeing Gellert and Dumbledore behaving like a old divorced couple, even more if Harry somehow ended up in the position of the child with divorced parents. I can totally see Dumbledore and Grindewald fighting to buy- Er, win Harry's affection and Harry being bewildered as hell by it, Or Harry wanting to take divination and muggle study, Grindewald somehow intercepting his choice and (after throwing a fit) changing the electives to aritimancy and runes.

Bellatrix, while being viable to create chaos with Harry has great potential to create a “hate triangle with Harry and Neville, would be funny.
