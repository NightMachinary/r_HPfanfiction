Like everybody here Harry Potter has formed an integral part of my childhood. The canon books have been a form of escapism as well as a coping mechanism for me for more than a decade now. I was also very fortunate to discover fan-fiction that allows the stories and characters to be explored differently and from other angles.

I am in a crappy place in my life at the moment with work seeming to gobble up my time, energy and enthusiasm. I was wondering if there are any fics out there where Harry does not have a really happy ending after school or where he is stuck in a crappy ministry job after his glory days. It's doesn't necessarily need to be dark or angsty but just something where Harry is forced to face some of the mundane things that grownups face. As always your help is greatly appreciated.

*TL;DR Do you know of any fics of Harry after school where is struggling with adult life?*


** This is probably the hardest request i've seen, I still haven't read it yet myself but I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/1/Lost-Time][Lost Time]] could be what you're looking for. It's the only one I could find after over half an hour of searching anyway.

** You should try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister]]

I'm not sure if they are exactly what you are looking for but they seem to both be about a more adult Harry coming to terms with the realities of life.
