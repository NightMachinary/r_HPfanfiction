Hey guys! I'm looking for some specific Harry Potter Fanfictions - maybe you can help me?

1. A Jily Fanfic - I only found very poorly written ones or unfinished fics
2. A Hufflepuff fanfic (no matter what era)
3. A fanfic that focusses on one of the lesser known characters, such as Terry Boot, Hannah Abott,...
4. A fanfic that is about Harry's seventh year, but instead is about Hogwarts and how the DA operates

So, I guess my preferences are very specific, but maybe one of you has got an idea for fanfics like those?

Thank you so so so much!

(Oh, and by the way, this is one of my first posts so please don't hate on me if it is a weird one - I'm still learning :) )


** For No. 4 try linkffn(The Seventh Year) or linkffn(Under Snape's Regime) - both very dark fanfics going in detail about exactly what might've happened at Hogwarts during the year the golden trio weren't there. Heavy reading but both are one of those rare fics that deserve to be inducted into canon immediately.

  Neville has no choice but to return to Hogwarts for his seventh year. But will it even be like Hogwarts anymore, with Snape as Headmaster? Ron, Hermione and Harry are surely on the run miles away. Neville must restart Dumbledore's Army along with Seamus, Luna, Ginny and the others in order to protect what's left of the school in time for the trio's unknown return...

  Hannah Abbott? She's no one special, is she? She would be the first to admit that. This is the story of an ordinary girl who lived in extraordinary times.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.
