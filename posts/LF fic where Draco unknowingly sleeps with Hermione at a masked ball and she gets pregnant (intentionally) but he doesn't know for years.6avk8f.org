The only other details I remember was that she was married to someone else at the time and he lied to her about being able to have kids even though they had been "trying".

I think the masked ball was at Flint's house. I think the child's nanny was somehow related to her husband but knew Draco was the father and helped in the process of getting them together.

It was a really good story and I had it saved into my library in a fanfic app when my phone messed up and had to be wiped. Unfortunately I never got around to favoriting it because I usually do that when I finish the story and now I really want to find it and finish it.

  Hermione lost it all when she divorced. Draco would lose it all by age 30 if he didn't marry. Marriage to each other would be perfect, one would even say it was most convenient. Her daughter even looked like him, although, he wondered why that was.
