**** linkao3(five people lily evans never fell in love with by thirty2flavors; Culture Shock by thirty2flavors) both kind of meet your request. They're really Lily character studies with Snape making an occasional appearance, but they're good, quick reads.

i also wrote a fic, linkao3(not gonna save you (go save yourself) by SiderumInCaelo), which isn't a perfect match either, but it's another Lily character study that might be of interest.

His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** It's a stupid move by Rowling to retroactively add some humanity to a character which she went out of her way to make despicable and nasty.

There, it's been deconstructed. Everything else is just post-hoc rationalization of Rowling's absolute butchery of relationships and storytelling.

Have you read about Snape's first words in the series?

JKR didn't retroactively add some humanity to him, she had decided on his backstory from the very beginning. It doesn't make him a good person, but it does make him more than just a caricature of an evil professor who loved to torture his students.

** Honestly, there isn't much that is good. Because Severus was already hanging out with Death Eaters and using the word mudblood, just not at Lily, in Fifth Year, so if Lily "gets" with him it kind of makes her seem insane. And I've seen Lily survives and gets with him, which again makes little sense because no mother would ever forgive a man for telling crazy wizard hitler about a baby that could destroy him, and that baby being Harry.

The only somewhat believable Snape/Lily stories have him as a very AU character or one who gets with her very early on and stays away from DE philosophy.

Sera dy Relandrant has a good one shot on Fanfiction.net where Lily is a pseudo horocrux in Harry and lashes out.
