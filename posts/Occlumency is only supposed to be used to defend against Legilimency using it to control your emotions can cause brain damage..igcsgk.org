This idea is mainly from bashing stories with manipulative Dumbledore. Supposed master of controlling his Snape turns into a frothing lunatic if someone mentions the name Potter. Voldemort is self explanatory. And all the purebloods learn it as kids are usually mouth breathing idiots.


** This is somewhat similar to an idea I had a while back: Occlumency defends your mind from /anything/ that could affect it... including new ideas or information. Using it all the time makes you pretty much incapable of changing your mind about anything or altering a plan no matter how badly it's failing (or recognizing that the abused kid in front of you isn't a spoiled, arrogant brat "just like his father").

** Well, if we're going strictly by Canon, then the relation between Occlumency and emotions is likely the precise reverse of the one typically depicted: Being able to control your emotions is a requirement for Occlumency, not the other way round. It /starts/ with "clear your mind, let go of all emotions", it doesn't end there.

People come in many different degrees. It appears unemotional people are basically natural Occlumens, whereas everyone else has to learn to control themselves, before even starting to learn Occlumency. I wouldn't know if that is even possible -- it appears to me it's perfectly possible to learn to not /act/ on feelings, but to learn not to /have/ those feelings ...? I kinda think that is hardwired. I (on the unemotional end of the spectrum) certainly can't think how I would even begin to feel more.

In any case, once you do manage that, indeed it's about selectively hiding /both/ memories and (attached) emotions:

#+begin_quote
  Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his [Voldemort's] presence without detection.
#+end_quote

(Snape in OotP)

And yes, its only real function is to protect against Legilimency. Depicting users as unemotional, then, would be true, but just a correlation, not a result.

.

That said, I don't mind the typical Fanon extension. How far to go and what weaknesses to introduce should simply be a matter of balancing characters. So going into perfect recall and 3,474 identities-and-layers shit is just that, but simply using it to control yourself, mentally and emotionally, is a weak enough advantage that doesn't need to be offset with additional drawbacks, IMO.

**** Does he, actually? All instances I can recall are linked to James and the Marauders, which might be excused. Having a sore point isn't exactly uncommon, even if you're a very calm individual otherwise.

For the rest of the time, my general impression of Snape is more that he gets quite deliberately angry. But regardless, I'd say it simply shows that Canon!Occlumency in fact isn't used the way we often see, because surely, if you could control all of your emotions with it, even those instances wouldn't happen.

Of course, in the end, our sample size isn't great. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Draco, Bellatrix. It remains an "obscure branch of magic" -- Sirius doesn't seem to know it, for instance, or he would have offered teaching it to Harry, so you can't even make a case that it's a Black thing, nevermind a Pureblood thing.

****** Right, but that was what I was getting at in the first post: There are people who get upset at anything and everything (also not just anger, the whole range -- sadness, joy, fear, etc.) and people who just don't. Naturally you don't need emotional control for things that don't upset you, but the fact that there even /are/ a lot (or even, most) things that don't upset you already is a statement about your nature.

Now Snape is perfectly vicious, but when he's like this

#+begin_quote
  “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”

  Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

  “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

  “You---Potter---why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.”

Through his own shitty choices, he's been basically serving three masters (Voldemort, Dumbledore & the Vow to protect Harry) for years. The past is full of regret and the uture looms dark -- it's probable that Snape would think the best option on the horizon is a quick painless death.

So he lives in a state of constant misery. Being that Snape was probably always a thoroughly unpleasant person, he doubled down on that. Making others as miserable as he is, probably gave some relief.

***** There would be incentives to controlling your emotions, though. No more distractions. Shutting down that emotion of "I'd rather do something else" while studying. Anyone would be extremely tempted to disable sadness when something horrible happens. I know a lot of people who would gut their mind to be rid of depression, or moodswings, or PTSD.

But all of these aren't healthy. If it is used that way, it should be under careful supervision by an expert in the frame of therapy, not permanently (once you stop feeling depression, would you /really/ turn it back on?). Disabling your emotions would also disable your empathy, too.

Maybe Snape is struggling because he learned it after Lily died to suppress his grief at her death, and now realizes that he couldn't go on like that, emotionless. So he tries to self-acclimate by occasionally disabling his occlumency, which causes his untamed emotions to control him instead. I could easily see the price of controlling emotions be that they only become stronger the longer you do it. So every time he sees Harry, he would feel the anger and sadness at the hand he had in Lily's death a thousandfold, which causes him to lash out.

*** I fully agree with you. Occlumency should not leave an otherwise emotionally healthy human devoid of emotion if they are not using it constantly, which would only happen because staying emotionless for long enough would make that state a habit. I would add that Occlumency is also used to create false reality to deceive someone infiltrating you mind. It seems that Harry used a form of Legilimency to see through Voldemort's eyes (that's why Dumbledore wanted Harry to study Occlumency in case Voldemort discovered the connection) so that would indicate Voldemort used his connection to Harry to show him false images using Occlumency.

One thing that would make it strange though, is the fact that if Occlumency relies on shutting down your own emotions, Legilimency would require one to understand their victim's emotions, which would make the user quite akin to an empath, which is in contradiction with Voldemort's nature.

** I tend to see Occumency as a way to more or less suppress your reaction to certain emotions, not the emotions themselves. And fanon typically requires the person to review their memories and the emotions they caused as constant upkeep to keep the strength of their shields up, which would prevent damage to the mind. If they review their memories and sort through them on a continuous basis, then their Occlumency shields remain intact, and if they don't keep up on their upkeep, their control slips and they have to face the emotions and memories anyway and they risk turning into a frothing lunatic rather than simply angry but in control of their reactions.

** I've posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2ml5h/how_do_you_write_occlumency/g06sink/][my headcanon on the subject]] a few times.

In a nutshell, I think that Occlumency training is inherently traumatic and damaging, because any painful, traumatic, or disturbing stimulus that the Occlumens hasn't been exposed to during the training can be used by an attacker to make inroads.

** I think I've actually seen that in a fic where the ‘controlling potion' or compulsion spells were linked to the trigger word of ‘Potter', but honestly I can see why it's such a trope, because his behaviour looks like something like that could be entirely credible. He looses his fucking mind sometimes, and it's just so out of proportion to being a teacher with a bunch of little shits in your class who make you frustrated and angry.
