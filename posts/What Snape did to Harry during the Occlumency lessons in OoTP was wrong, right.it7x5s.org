About 2 days ago, the Wizarding World twitter account posted a picture of Snape with the caption 'clear your mind'. To me, that was a reminder of how awful Snape treated Harry during those lessons. But the replies were full of comments going 'yass king' 'oh snape my bby' etc etc. When I replied 'not everyone on here praising Snape for torturing harry', a lot of people replied with justifications and excuses for Snape and were even blaming Dumbledore (because every bloody thing is his fault in this damn fandom) and even Harry for how bad those lessons went.

I'd like to know people's opinions here about those lessons. Snape was in the wrong there, right?

******* On the other hand you have McGonagall presented as fair (and yes she did take 150 points from Gryffindor and sent the culprits to the Forbidden Forest at night for something that I would call no reason) yet in later books she actively favors her students too: she closes her eyes when Harry and Ron are up to some shenanigans, she actively defies Umbridge (despite the fact that from a purely academical standpoint she is not wrong as Trelawney is a fraud, Hagrid is a danger to the kids and the fact that Voldemort had returned was still accepted by most people as the delusions of grandeur of a kid starved for attention). She even approves of the use of the Cruciatus Curse.

So how is she better than Snape? Because through Harry's eyes she is more favorable?

As a matter of fact, we don't even know if Snape was unfair or not... the only time he is called that is because Ron said he heard so.

******** I always though McGonagall flexed too hard on "fairness" because she was also Deputy Head. I always though she was too strict in book 1. I mean, they couldn't have been the first students out after curfew in their first year. She just came to some erroneous conclusion and BAM kids in the forest searching for "whats killing the unicorns"

She disliked Umbridge and her beliefs and thus defies an "outsider" trying to take over her home. And her only real defiance was the attempt to arrest Hagrid.

I assume the Crucio was in Book Seven against death eaters? Other than "Dark Magic" why would she disapprove?

When does she "close her eyes" to Ron and Harry's shenanigans?

She is better than Snape because she doesn't take a grudge on a dead man out on his orphan son...

Snape is shitty towards Harry and towards others but in most of the interactions (after book 2 when JK started to get a clearer idea where the story was going and Snape was no longer only the mean scary professor) he gives Harry detention only when he actually seriously crosses the line and even when taking points, he does it for actual reasons (albeit he might have provoked Harry or others to give him those reasons).

His constant besmirching of James Potter to his orphan son, and refusing to listento Harry's side of anything just deciding he was up to no good....

Book 3 his irrational behavior in the shack and the trying to get an innocent man killed (why would he come up with the confounded story if he didn't just want sirius dead no matter what) and then leaking Remus's werewolfiness.

Book 4 with Hermione's teeth, and Trevor. Plus of course the blame game and not shut his students idiocy down. He also threatens Harry with veritaserum cause he "knows" he's a thief

Book 5's Occulmency(sp?) lessons and waiting hours to tell the order about Harry.

The 6 years of letting Draco act like James Potter and ignoring it because it doesn't fit the narrative in his head. And popping up "just in time" to see Harry's retaliation and punish him for being bullied....

​

As for the others... I believe Dumbledore played a part in both those instances. He had to agree to let Harry on the team and HE decided to put them on "probation" for the car stunt.( Which she seemed pretty mad about it my opinion...))

On the other hand she completely ignores their warnings in book 1, which they were partially right about(it wasn't Snape but there was an attempted theft), after sending them into the Forbidden Forest after curfew to look for whats killing unicorns for breaking curfew... and does nothing to help with the Heir of Slytherin or Tri-wizard harassment. Tells Harry to, essentially, keep his head down and mouth shut when he tries to tell her about Umbridge.

​

And all that is just off the top of my head....

***** Agreed. I had friends in high school that were straight math geniuses, taking college level Calc III and Differential Equations in grade 10/sophomore year when normally that year would be Geometry, qbkut 3-4 years of school behind that level.

They were all rubbish at tutoring me and treated me like I was an idiot because I didn't get it. One guy's twin sister I was kind-of friends with tutored me one week. She was only a year a head of me age wise so a year ahead mathwisr except she was a honors level and I wasn't.

Her tutoring was AMAZING. Her brother and his and my friends treated her like she was dumb too, but a week with her beat years of trying to get help from my genius level friends.

People who have a more difficult time learning things understand teaching because they were once in their students position, not understanding and having to learn the basic steps. Really high level people just understand the basics and never had to work to learn them.

I'm not justifying Snape's behavior to students but his poor teaching style totally makes sense considering he is a prodigy at his subject.

** Clear your mind wasn't helpful. It might have been the technically correct instruction, but that doesn't help Harry and Snape never tried to work around that. I've often heard a teacher can never teach a person something, only help them learn it for themselves. Snape never tried to help Harry learn, he just repeated what was clearly not working. While I do think Snape was a shit teacher and a shit person, I really want to point out that it might indeed be the overall aim. Harry might have needed to clear his mind to succeed but Snape never tried to help Harry get to that stage, and in my opinion, that makes Snape a shit teacher. I don't think Snape was maliciously trying to teach wrong, or actively hurt Harry's ability to learn, he just wasn't helping at all.

You would think that Dumbledore would have inquired as to Snape's teaching methods and insisted he instruct differently or try a different tactic with Harry.

But that is why Snape is the double agent: he can make his mind look like a death eater mind whenever Voldemort checks his mind.

I think Snape could have given Harry some subtle and easy techniques to at least start understanding Occlumency; and some book to read, simple exercises to try.

Whereas instead he just aggressively attacks Harry over and over Nd seems to somehow expect Harry to improve in Occlumency and understand how, with next to 0 instruction.

I don't think Snape was just trying to protect his double agent status by not teaching Harry well; he was just being an asshole IMO.

******* Voldemort may not be able to read Snape's mind, but he can read Harry's, and anyone else he talks to's mind. Given that Harry is INVITING visions from Voldemort into his head, caution is the way to go here. And if Harry starts making rapid progress in Occlumency, then Snape's life is forfeit.

Also, we don't really know how Occlumency works. It really could be that 'clearing your mind' needs to be mastered before anything else, and he can't really elaborate until Harry at least TRIES to sheild his mind (which he does not, as Snape knows).

Dumbledore's protection only means something if it is iron clad, if it cannot be shaken; because the further he gets from Dumbledore's inner circle, the further he gets from Voldemort's. So he has no reason to be gentle with Harry, because Dumbledore's faith does not depend on his gentleness.

Maybe he was being an asshole without even considering his double agent status and it's attendant association with his own life expectancy. But I think it far more likely that Snape wants Harry to get his shit together and at least take the whole war thing seriously, so he doesn't have to waste his evenings on someone he hates. Snape wants these lessons to be over as soon as possible; whatever joy he gets from tormenting Harry he can get during normal working hours.

I would imagine given his absent mindedness with leaving the Pensieve out in an unlocked room occupied by his least favourite student was due to exhaustion from his two jobs. I think at the time Snape desperately needed sleep.

Actually Snape's teaching methods are wholly in line with this person. Snape is someone who WANTED to learn something and he started doing his own research, figuring out the basics and sitting down and figuring out things before even his teachers' first "Good morning, children". As a teacher he again and again shows that he expects his students to be the same way - if they want to learn this they /start out/ by putting their own effort in and he as a teacher is there to push them in the right direction. Horrible attitude for someone teaching the basics but it derives directly from his own attitude to learning.

And this is how he approached teaching occlumency too - "If the boy wants to learn it he will have cracked open a book just to see what it is all about and to know how to get started". From there Snape assumes the role of the one nudging and pushing the student onward, not the one who handholds him through the baby steps.

Brilliant guy, but a total dick and a bad teacher, and the parallels would have been amusing if I weren't so annoyed.

He placed extraordinary emphasis on rigor and lab technique, and I learned an incredible amount from him, but he was a bully, a poor teacher who didn't like to repeat himself, had completely unreasonable expectations, and would make you keep repeating if you couldn't meet them.

If your talking about Snape, we honest don't know as he never actually goes out of his way to assist and help either side. He leaves Harry the Sword but leaves it under water (because Gryffindors have to earn it... Ignoring the fact that no they don't, Albus was able to use the sword while being attacked by the ring and didn't have to wade through fire to get it). Snape also seems to be quite the sive of information as it seems there is nothing the Order knows that Voldemort doesn't unless Dumbledore kept it to himself.

Snape after Lily died didn't give a fuck who won just that he was on their side, hell standing beside Voldemort all night he never "goes out to spill some blood" and talk to someone on the Order's side or mask his fighting to ruin the Death Eaters capability to harm the kids.

** As for the lessons themselves, Snape is making little effort to actually teach. Beyond that, there are likely at least some issues of incompatibility between teacher and student:

1. I seriously doubt that it's anywhere near ideal to have such antagonism when teaching/learning something as intimate as the Mind Arts. Maybe it helps, giving the student more incentive to keep the teacher out, but overall it just seems like it would make instruction difficult.
2. Not everyone's mind is the same. Just as different people learn, think, and perceive in different ways, it's likely that so too do they need different methods to protect their thoughts. Snape is presumably teaching the method he uses rather than trying to find one that comes most naturally to Harry.
3. Snape seems to be naturally talented at Occlumency, as he is with Potions, which actually makes him less able to teach such subjects. He expects his students to just "get" things without having them explained because to him those things are /so obvious./

Three, it does require repeated mental intrusion AND Snape was a terrible teacher because he didn't explain anything.

I go back and forth between option 2 and 3, personally.

#+end_quote

While asking Snape to teach, anything to Harry may not have been the best idea, it's not like Dumbledore had any choice. Apparently, a Legilimens is needed to teach Occlumency, and Canon only introduced 4 of them.\\
Dumbledore could not teach Harry himself because of the risks brought by his connection, and it's . . . doubtfull that either Bellatrix or Voldemort would have agreed to teach Harry. Snape was just the least worst choice Dumbledore had, not matter how bad he was.

Concerning the lesson in itself, I think his method (clear your mind and repel an attack) is one way to learn Occlumency, and that both of them are at fault about why it didn't work.\\
Sure, Snape' method was clearly not the good one (Harry just "master" Occlumency in DH after some kind of epiphany), and he didn't do any true effort to teach Harry differently or even connect with him. But at the same time, Harry didn't follow any of Snapes instruction (read the damn book and do meditation every night), and did the one thing the would have put Snape over the edge (watch his worst memory).\\
Still, I would say that Snape is a bit more responsible for the situation because, as an adult and a teacher, he should have known better.

**** I don't think Snape was wanted Harry to see it judging by how the scene happened. Pulling some memories out at the start of the lesson, and putting them back in at the end is a ritual Snape had done since the start of their lesson. And the only reason Harry was able to watch them was because Snape was forced to deal with an urgent situation that arised during their lesson, he usually always stayed in the room where he could watch the pensive.\\
From what I understood, it's possible for a Occlumens to see some memories of the Legilimens when he manages to successfully block an attack, so it's believable that Snape borrowed the Pensive as a precaution in case Harry did manage to learn the art (he had a lot of memories that he didn't want Harry to see after all).

But the main reason why I think that Snape wasn't "baiting" Harry was because he went to school with James and Sirius for 7 years. He probably has loads of memories where they act like ass without him losing his friendship with Lily. Just their first meeting of the Hogwarts Express could have been used as a bait (though they were a bit young at that time).

***** But again, why do it right in front of Harry, rather than say in his office or his quarters where it's secret and secure? Given both the true things he knows about Harry and the false things he believes about him, he had to know that Harry would go snooping at the first opportunity. Also, if there was a risk of Harry seeing Snape's memories then that one was NOT the most important thing to keep away - anything to do with the prophecy was.

Sure he did this every lesson, but it seems pretty likely that he'd be called away during one eventually. Either he didn't prepare for an obvious and probable contingency (which is pretty implausible for Snape of all people) or this WAS a preparation for such.

The specific memory that Harry saw was well-chosen for a number of reasons: It didn't show Snape as purely a victim, so he doesn't come across as pitiable (because he would HATE pity) and reinforces his "cover" as a loyal Death Eater (important if Harry's brain is leaking intel). A random bit of purely the Marauders bullying Snape would also be less believable to Harry - he'd reject it as a fabrication or as being taken out of context, because nothing in it would match his understanding of reality.

Snape taking the memories out in front of Harry may sound a bit stupid, but OotP (and the following books) are full of stupid moments. This one is not even in the top 3 of the year, which in my opinion are:

- Even if Harry chose to never use Sirius' gift, why didn't he opened it just to saw what it was. It would have been a way to contact him and stop Harry from doing something stupid.
- Why didn't he ask Kreacher "Is Sirius in the House" while in Umbridge' office, Kreacher would have been forced to say the truth and Harry would not have any reason to go to the Ministry.
- If he was going to London, why didn't he take a little detour by Grimmault Place. It would have taken 5 minutes top to see if Sirius was there before rushing into danger.

For the sake of the plot, Rowling often make her character hold the idiot ball. I prefer to see this moment as a mistake from Snape (to have Harry see a memory which is very important both for the plot and for him as a character) rather than some convoluted plot to destroy the image Harry had of James.

Also, if it was truly a plot, I'm convinced Snape would have maintained the lessons just to torments Harry with this memory, rather than stopping them all together.

Bear in mind that Harry peeking would have been an awful betrayal even in normal circumstances, but when he specifically knows that /his own mind may be vulnerable to being read by Voldemort and Snape is a double agent who could be exposed and tortured and killed if the wrong memory is leaked/, it becomes inexcusable IMO. Even if Harry had no respect at all for Snape's right to privacy, despite resenting the lessons' intrusion on his own privacy, he still ought to have had the sense not to interfere in a way that might well have resulted in losing the war.

Snape presumably thought that his own presence and Harry's sense of self-preservation would be enough security. He gave Harry enough benefit of the doubt that he did not assume Harry would have the patience and self-control of a pre-schooler, and that modicum of trust was shattered by Harry's selfish and thoughtless actions. (And it makes sense to throw Harry out of his lessons, albeit throwing items at him was unnecessary; clearly Harry completely lacked the self-discipline to succeed.)

Snape was abusive and misused the power he was given. There is no excuse for that. He was a thirty-something man and mocked one child to the point where he was his greatest fear despite that childs parents were tortured to insanity by a person said child knew. He also constantly mocked the efforts of the one child willing to learn despite his horrible behavior and he singled out and bullied one student because he looked like his father - and that‘s only Harrys class.

Punishment within the school rules? What do Harry's Occlumency lessons have to do with the school rules?! They're to help win the war, not Quidditch! The consequences of meddling with a known double agent aren't detentions and house points, they're the probable horrific death of that agent.

Harry's prying wasn't about school rules, it was about whether Severus Snape was ultimately loyal to Dumbledore or Voldemort. Which is an important question worth answering, except that he was not qualified to investigate it, nor justified in trying, when it's been clearly explained to him that Voldemort can probably read his thoughts at any time and any distance.

Harry spent the entire year dismissing school rules when they obstructed fighting the war, but he didn't do the same when it came to Severus Snape's mental privacy. He made it extremely clear that he thoroughly resented being treated as a child. But his action here was very immature indeed.

Snape is a confessed DE who wasn't under the Imperius curse that he has to face every day. Bella is a distant fear, locked up in a prison that was never escaped until year three.

***** As I said, if the memory didn't show him in a bad light Harry wouldn't have believed it. It would also have to be something he could plausibly claim to not want Harry to see. And yes, he IS a double-agent, and he's survived as one which means that careless stuff like leaving the Pensieve out in the open is out of character for him. Far safer and more sensible would have been to leave it in a secure location without indicating to anyone that he had it or that it contained sensitive memories. Remember, his mental model of Harry is "James Potter, but worse" so he would 100% expect Harry to snoop given half a chance. Getting angry afterward could quite easily be performative, at least in large part, to hide the fact that it was a setup.

Also, Severus Snape giving Harry Potter the benefit of the doubt? He's more likely to show up to class in a pink tutu (of his own volition).

** I'll be honest, I think Snape skipped more than a few steps in teaching. I don't recall whether or not Harry got any reading material on the matter, but Snape jumping in with 'clear your mind ... legimens' is asking for trouble. Telling someone something like that is the same as saying 'don't look down' near a drop or 'don't think about pink elephants'. The mind, particularly in teens, can be pretty damned contrary and ordering it 'cleared' with no verbal run through on how or giving a minute to attempt such is asking for trouble.

A decent teacher probably would have done more along the lines of Kris in Arrow's Flight by Mercedes Lackey. In that, Talia, a Herald with Empathic abilities has her shields worn down and eventually break. Kris, her mentor on her training run goes through the whole rebuild of her shields. Yes he's tough, but his 'ground, centre, shield' actually gets instructions on each step and guidance through it until Talia can do it reflexively.

'Clear your mind' isn't a useful instruction for someone new to things, particularly when they've a lot on their plate at the time.

'Find your centre' with a 'here's how' guides the student to getting themselves, to know what is /them/ and what is *other*.

'Bring your centre to ground' is pretty much about your foundation, the strength of your 'self' against the rest.

'Build your shields' finally allows you to create a fortress to keep yourself in and everyone else out.

Then again, Snape hates Harry because of reasons and he has a seen bad tendency to simple force people to rely on glorified cookbooks without showing in the classroom anything useful in terms of how the instructions work.

As a non-cook/chef, I'd not know the difference between slice, dice, julienne or the like, or about mash vs grind and as for colour/texture? Yeah, right. Where is the line between 'red' and 'burgundy' or 'scarlet'.

I'd honestly lay odds that this is a big part of Harry's, and likely Neville's issues with Potions, they're either visual learners, kinesthetic ones or a combination of the two and with Snape stalking about making an arse of himself punishing people for likely stupid reasons it's not like they can either concentrate or know what's supposed to be what, particularly with potential hazards like porcupine quills being added to hot liquids.

As for the method, I think it can work for some people, who would see those attacks from a teacher as a challenge, and would dive into studying on their free time just to “show him”. But I guess there is not so much information on legilimency lying around, so it was highly important for Snape to explain at least a little what clear your mind means, how it works, how to achieve it, etc. Not just demand it of a pubertant teenager who knows nothing about meditation.

** Snape was not a good teacher. Most of us can agree on that, yes?

Dumbledore takes the blame on one aspect. Why Snape? There was no one else in the order that could have taught the kid, even if they're not as good as testing a mental defence as Snape? To me this was done out of convenience instead of what would work.

It's perfectly possible Snape was trying to teach Harry in such a way that he'd figure it out on his own, like what happened with the Imperius curse. That backfired badly.

  Dumbledore takes the blame on one aspect. Why Snape
#+end_quote

From possibly my favorite canon compliant one-shot, consequence for cause by cambangst

[[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=2796&chapter=1]]

"Dumbledore!"

The old man finally paused in response to Snape's outburst. "How much longer do we continue to play this ridiculous game?" Snape stomped across the room and stopped in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Potter and I loathe one another. That is never going to change. If the boy must be educated, why not set the task to Lupin or Moody? Someone he does not despise."

Something in the room changed. A palpable energy charged the air, like the hum of electricity before a lightning strike. In spite of his anger, Snape took half a step back.

"Why do you suppose he hates you so, Severus?" Dumbledore's voice was soft. Dangerous. Like the whisper of an assassin's blade.

Snape threw up his arms in frustration. "We both know very well why he's been made to hate me. The Dark Lord can never suspect the truth, otherwise your plans would be ruined. This is the role you've cast for me, Dumbledore."

The old man's expression remained impassive. "What you're describing, Severus, is a consequence, not a cause. You're more than clever enough to understand the difference. Why does Potter hate you?"

Snape spun around like a petulant youngster, no longer able to stomach the hard blue eyes that saw through him. "He blames me for the death of his parents."

"Shouldn't he?"

The younger man turned back to face the Headmaster, eyes blazing with anger. "That was your failing, Dumbledore. Not mine, yours!" His voice rose to a shout. "I gave you everything. Told you everything. Swore my life to you! On one condition." He pounded his fist against the great, wooden desk. "One condition only! That you would keep them safe!"

Dumbledore continued to regard him with a cold, steely calm. "Keep her safe," he quietly corrected. "You asked me to keep her safe. And once again, you confuse consequence for cause. Why did she require my protection? What compelled you to swear your life to me?" Snape's eyes fell to the floor. After several moments of painful silence, the Headmaster continued. "There's something I want you to know, Severus. I never told her how the Dark Lord came to know of the prophecy." The former Potions Master's head snapped back up, genuine shock filling his normally stony face. "I thought she'd already suffered more than enough anguish on your account."

The old man rose to his feet. His blue eyes burned with barely contained fury. "Lily Potter never knew that the boy she befriended as a little girl was the one who betrayed her to the Dark Lord." Snape fell back several steps, looking stricken, until he bumped into an overstuffed armchair and barely caught himself before he crashed to the floor. "Lily Potter died without knowing that boy tried to sacrifice her family to the Dark Lord in return for her life." Dumbledore slowly made his way around the desk. The air around him crackled with magic. "And Lily Potter rests peacefully without knowing how shamefully that boy has treated her son." 

The Headmaster came to a stop in front of Snape, staring down at him with an expression of pure disgust. "Lily Potter will never have to carry those burdens. But you know how she would have felt about those things, Severus. How she would have felt about you. You know it every time you see her eyes, filled with hatred, on the face of her son. And so long as I'm alive, that is a burden you will never escape." He towered over Snape's cowering form for a few moments longer, eyes boring into the younger man, before turning away to face the window. "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able."

Neither man spoke another word as Severus Snape hurried out of the Headmaster's office.

** There's no indication that Snape's method of instruction was incorrect for leaning occlumency. But the lessons were certainly doomed from the start because of the animosity between Harry and Snape.

The fact of the matter is that Harry didn't /want/ to learn anything Snape had to teach him, and that very attitude of being unable to learn from someone you hate - inability to put that hate aside and focus on getting the job done - was precisely why Harry sucked at occlumency.

It was a catch-22. For Harry to be able to maintain the level head required to learn from Snape would have required him to already possess the skills which are the basis of success in occlumency.

Actually, there's an interesting take on that in Harry and Albus' World Trip: Dumbledore informs Harry that the quick, dirty, and painful route to protecting your mind is to have someone repeatedly invade it and dredge up painful and shameful memories until you automatically respond to an invader with nothing but an unpleasant cloud of fear and loathing and suffering. Keeping the student ignorant and antagonistic is an important element of the process.

Even if snape way of doing it was the fastest it certainly wasn't the best method especially for Harry. Though Harry is at fault for this as well. Beyond, reluctantly, going to the lessons what effort does he put into outside of them? While snapes behaviour is wrong his expectations that Harry put his full effort behind learning this life saving skill isn't wrong nor is he wrong to expect something more then an average student from the sons of two gifted magicals

** Was it wrong? Yes. Is it understandable? Yes. Does it being understandable make it okay? No.

Let me clarify. Snape started teaching when people who saw him perpetually ganged up on, who saw the Marauders take off his underwear, were still in school. (reread the worst memory scene, imagine it was Lily instead, and realise that pants meant underwear -- the situation was sick, and him being male doesn't make it better) He didn't want to teach. He was being forced by two powerful men, who were forcing him for what they believed was right.

Now, how is he going to get those kids to listen who watched him be humiliated for years? Let's be fair, potions is probably the most dangerous class in the school, except maybe apparition. It deals with high heat, poisonous ingredients, and obviously explosive and caustic results. The only way those kids will listen is through fear, because they're not going to respect the Marauders' punching bag.

Then he's outed as a DE, publicly, in two trials. Unlike Lucius or Nott who claimed Imperius, he didn't. Half those kids are already going to come into the school terrified of him because he's the only DE who isn't in Azkaban who chose it, supposedly. Not only that, but he has to stay in the good graces of Voldemort, according to Dumbledore, which means he has to show preferential treatment, which is not to say he wouldn't have anyway -- all of the teachers show this in one way or another. (Flitwick's 112% to Hermione, Dumbledore's blatant point awards at the feast, humiliating Slytherin, etc)

Then you have Harry show up, and every time he looks up it's like one of his abusers is back in the room with him. You see this with the return of Sirius too. He reacts like men with cPTSD. Do I think Rowling intended it? No. Does his behaviour absolutely make sense if he has it? Yes. Does that make it excusable? No.

Then, after being forced to make Voldemort wait at the end of fourth year and probably getting the crap crucio'd out of him for not answering, he's back in the spy life AND still teaching. He's then forced to have one-on-one lessons with the child of his childhood best friend/first love/insert opinion-of-relationship here and one of his abusers, and not only that but one of the most intimate (in a nonsexual way) branches of magic we see.

Harry then pushes through to his memories, seeing him as a weak, abused/neglected child, and then later spies in his pensieve, the memories that were so important he removed them before the lesson, so Harry couldn't accidentally see them.

Again, he overreacted and it wasn't right, but I get it.

** Well, that all depends... is Snape's method of teaching Occlumency the right one? I think it was. There was no indication in canon as far as I know that would suggest that there is another way to learn it.

That said Snape didn't exactly give Harry the right instruction. It was his usual way of teaching. Just say the instruction and give no fuck about wether or not the student understands. But then again, Harry didn't do what Snape told him either. You know, about practicing and meditating.

The problem was that those lessons were doomed from the start. Considering that those lessons involve fucking mental intrusions, there should probably be a lot of trust between the teacher and the student. And because of Harry's (justified) hate of Snape, he was also not willing to learn anything from Snape. Ironically, if Harry had the wisdom and foresight to let go of that hate for the same of learning and actually try to learn, he would probably have much easier time learning Occlumency. Not that I blame him. He was a teenager under a lot of stress, it's very understandable that was on edge.

So both Harry and Snape had a certain amount of fault in those lessons' failure. But Snape was the teacher and he should've acted more professionally. So in that regard Snape was wrong. But did he purposefully torture Harry? I don't think so.

Also, about blaming Dumbledore... it wasn't a good idea to force two people that hate each other into lessons involving mind intrusion. But he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. There are only 4 Legilimens established in canon. Dumbledore couldn't teach Harry himself because of the connection and I imagine he was a very busy man. And I don't think that Voldy or dead old Bella would want to teach Harry. So Snape was the least bad choice.

** We don't actually know. Not enough information is provided and not enough people have a grasp on mind magics in canon for us to know that there is any alternate method of teaching it.

Perhaps it's beneficial to have an antagonistic relationship with the one teaching you and that inclines you to shut your mind faster and more like a steel trap. Perhaps it's not helpful at all and a gentler method is better.

We don't know.

Perhaps "clear your mind" is all that's necessary for instruction. Perhaps there's not any better way to explain it, than, y'know, think of nothing. How else would you even describe that?

We don't know.

Harry never actually tried to do so for any significant length of time.

Maybe it would have worked for him if he had just practiced.

Maybe it never would have worked at all, because of the Horcrux being a direct link Harry couldn't shut out.

Maybe there's a whole other set of instructions Snape could have given; the famed "two methods" of fanon, with Snape choosing the quicker and harsher.

We just can't know. Not enough information is given.

However, if the intended effect of the "exercises" ended up in him being more susceptible to the dreams, I would imagine Voldemort would've ordered the same. Regardless, he still did such. So he is responsible, the same as Dumbledore.

** Snape was a horrible teacher. And sure, he was a prodigy or genius like the other comments say as well. But I think many forget, that he stated teaching nearly right out of school himself, not even the subject he wanted and obviously hated children. I think it's important to note, that Snape probably didn't even want to teach. He probably wanted to work as a potioneer somewhere or creat potions and experiment but was pushed into the teaching role because he had to.

So you have a guy, that loves potions and all their intricacies and push him in front of eleven year olds that have no idea how important it is to be careful while brewing. Explosions and stuff can hurt or kill people, best seen in Harry's first(?) class with the boilcure potion. One step wrong and Neville got horrible boils all over him.

In my opinion that's also why he had those high expectations for the NEWT student. You don't get an O, you don't get in. Probably because those potions are really dangerous. If Snape had to be a teacher because of his past, he should have maybe just been the teacher for sixth year and up. Because they know at least something, and they take it more seriously.

But this is in no way saying he wasn't in the wrong. Because he was. Same with the occlumency lessens as well. I think I read once somewhere that Occlumency was alike to mindrape. I totally agree. And you should trust the person that teaches it because they will see everything! With all the hate between Harry and Snape it was to be expected that it would turn out like that.

** The problem is that we have no idea how occlumency should be taught, the only lessons we see are those, maybe that is the only way it works.\\
But the bigger picture is that Snape is a terrible teacher of anything and it's not even really his fault. The magical world doesn't seem to have teaching degrees, nevermind that he was 21 when he started teaching. He might be brilliant when it comes to making potions but he doesn't know how to teach that (and yes he could do his own research, but he is a full time teacher and head of house I doubt he has much free time) and he also has barely any live experience having spend basically his entire life at Hogwarts.\\
So yes what he is doing isn't good, but we have no way of knowing how bad it is (who knows maybe if one reads that book and meditates properly the whole thing can be learned so fast the teacher barely sees any memories, or maybe that's just how it was for Snape that the mind arts came to him as easily as potions and he just can't understand why someone else would struggle so much).

** Snape was absolutely horrible. He never gave Harry proper instructions, never told him the theory of Occlumency or anything of the ilk. Sure, Harry never actually put any true effort into it because of his hate of Snape, unless it was during the lessons themselves, but Snape should have realized that Harry clearly knew nothing about Occlumency. He could have at least directed Harry toward books or something that would help him. (Unless he did and I don't remember.)

There's also the fact that what Snape did was completely vindictive and was practically mind-rape.

** Ok so I definitely am not on Snapes side he could have given Harry an explanation of what the process would include, what he would be doing, and why they were doing this. On the other hand I believe Dumbledore deserves some blame. Dumbledore didn't explain the reason he was learning Occlumency and also handed him over to a teacher who he knew had been tormenting him since he was eleven. If Harry has understood the reasons for learning Occlumency or had someone to better explain it step by step he may have researched and practiced on his own and actually completed the task.

** I blame both Snape and Harry. Harry made little effort to train, and Snape did not seek another method when progress was slow (unless that was to be expected?)

Snape (supposedly, IMHO) taught Harry based on what worked for him. Snape knew how to clear his mind and focus. He likely gained that effort by learning to push bad memories aside.

Harry probably needed a different approach, but because he never put much effort into it, how was Snape to know? Harry legitimately did not see it as a priority and practice what Snape was teaching. I saw Snape's anger targeted Harry's lack of effort. Snape's life was in the line if Voldemort saw the wrong memories.

If Snape and Harry had been able to approach the topic more calmly and with less baggage, Snape may have found a different approach that worked.

I wonder how Snape learned Occlumency. Did he pick it up himself, or did Dumbledore teach him? If Dumbledore taught him, what methods did he employ? Did Dumbledore manipulate Snape's bad memories? If so, how does that differ from how Snape taught Harry? Would it explain or excuse Snape's behavior is this was the only method he knew?

** I don't think he was helpful at all, but I think the 'torturing' part would make sense as a necessary part of occlumency. Harry also didn't seem to try much. And Dumbledore definitely should have predicted the (lack of) success, not to mention, wouldn't he himself still have enough occlumency as Snape did to prevent Harry learning something important?

** I mean Snape was definitely acting wrongly and was a rough character but he was an awesome character and I don't think people should be so upset about the Twitter account posting about Snape. Bellatrix gets hype and praise a lot for being badass, interesting, and evil, but no one posts about her on this subreddit??? We all know Snape wasn't the best person but is a fascinating character and tbh these repetitive posts just get annoying.

*** I think bella is liked because she is insane.

It just adds flavour to it. Bella is evil and a psychopath. (I think). Add in the Black madness and she is the perfect antagonist

We however get more of Snape's backstory so he is more disliked. Lily is a beloved character and seeing a Snape and already established antagonist as her one time friend and he calls her a Mudblood so he is even more disliked. However we see that his constant ‘James Potter was an arrogant bastard' thing isn't just baseless. This gains him sympathy but the mudblood incident ruined it.

Bellatrix and Snape were not by any means good people. Just Snape is seen as redeemable to some

** In canon we never learn how oclumency is normally taught we only know how Snape tried to teach harry. It seems wrong how he tried but it is also magic that may have weird rules or only work certain ways. I could go either way. For all we know oclumency is like scare tissue/ callouses and it needs to be toughened up with use or being broken repeatedly for it to work. Though I do think snape was just a d*ck head and wanted to hurt harry and that he was in the wrong. Either way if it was how it was supposed to be that should have been explained thoroughly before starting the training somHarry would have known what to expect.

** Snape was the wrong teacher for Harry. We talking about lessons where you have to let someone into your inner thoughts and feelings and for that you need trust and there was no trust between Snape and Harry.

But yes, Snape's ways of teaching where stupid as well. This reminds me that I still need to write that story from my plot bunny list where Harry gets another teacher for this...

** In Occlumency, Snape couldn't teach Harry competantly, even if he could. If Harry suddenly excelled due to his instruction, Snape would have been murdered.

I am genuinely asking, how else could Snape have taught Harry Occlumency without compromising his standing in the Death Eaters?

** I'm not going to try and justify Snape as a character, but I do think in canon there was a method to the madness. In the military there's a saying of "train how you fight", it's a principle embedded into almost all aspects of training you undergo. It's to make sure you can react on instinct under stress and keep your mental faculties. It's easy to learn something within the confines of a safe environment, but then under stress, would be much more difficult to actually think straight. Especially with something that directly attacks the mind. Harry needed to be able to defend his mind against one of the strongest wizard in the world, Snapes teaching method was something that was brutal but effective.

** Let's not forget that Harry is an unreliable narrator, since he only sees what happens to him and around him. And Harry has a connection to Voldie at the time of the lessons; that's the whole reason for them (supposedly!). What if Snape was instructed by Dumbledore to treat Harry poorly to (a) keep his cover, and (b) keep Harry's Voldie-com open to get info about upcoming attacks? Or what if Snape made an executive decision to do so, to keep his cover? At any time, Voldie could order Snape to get Harry alone and kidnap him, so he wants Harry to distrust him. Either the Order would lose their spy, or Snape would be killed, if Voldie saw Harry trusted him.

** Not only is “clear your mind” horrible teaching, Harry does the complete opposite to block out Voldemort. He fills his mind with the pain of losing Sirius. It seems to work well because by the end of DH he can enter Voldemort's mind whenever he wants. If you want to hide treasure, (important memories) you bury it, if someone tries to dig it up you fill the hole faster than the can dig.

*** Voldemort was a special case. He is a psychopath in a completely new body with a badly maligned soul. While he was possessing Harry, he had a full blast of Harry's emotions which inflicted him with great pain. So Voldemort took extra effort to close the connection and block his thoughts. Had it been any other dark wizard (like Grindelwald), the story would have been entirely different.

** I loooooove Snape. I think he had the capacity to be a great teacher... to Slytherin's. And maybe Ravenclaws and potentially a couple Hufflepuffs. I love Snape, but teaching was a bad move on Dumbledore's part. Like there couldn't have been any other job for Snape? Nothing? Not substitute teacher (rarely obviously). Not a co-teacher. Not a job behind the scenes like calculating expenses. Nothing? Lmao!!! That one was a fail. (And he could've let Snape stay there with a “job” because as he said to Umbridge about the Trelawny - the headmaster can let someone stay at hogwarts. Though that could've been movie only but I doubt it. I'm a little rusty on the books.)

*** This is reductive and wrong imo. This wasn't a case of both parties being equally at fault...not even close.

Snape is a grown ass man who has vowed to protect Harry. If he would have been the bigger person and Harry STILL hadn't taken it as seriously as he should than he would b be partially to blame.

And it could have happened, easily, if Snape would have really tried.

Dumbledore even acknowledges that Snape was at fault.
