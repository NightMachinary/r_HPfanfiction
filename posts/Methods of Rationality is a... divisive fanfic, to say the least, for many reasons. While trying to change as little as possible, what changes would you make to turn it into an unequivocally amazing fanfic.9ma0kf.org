Some people love it, some people hate it, and a minority couldn't care less. Everyone has their own opinion on HPMOR, as with many fics, though few as polarising. While it may have some great ideas and memorable quotes, HPMOR is plagued with a pervading feeling of [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] in its text, as well as unlikeable characters -- I'm sure that people who have more thoroughly read into the fic can provide more detailed criticisms.

However, I believe that almost any fanfic can be turned into gold. Without making drastic changes (unless absolutely necessary and with good reasoning), what changes would you implement into HPMOR, so that it becomes a much more enjoyable and objectively great story?


** I share some complaints that other people have already detailed - namely the overwhelming pedagogy and rather excessive length - but the biggest thing that keeps me from wanting to reread it is, well, the gender politics. I've seen other people complain about how McGonagall was all but villainized for disagreeing with Harry, her 11 year old student, and how Hermione was essentially fridged, but the part that always stuck with me is when Harry and Hermione argue about his being friends with Draco. Because, well, if I found out that a friend of mine - a /male/ friend of mine - was friends with someone who openly spoke about wanting to rape me as soon as he had the chance,* I wouldn't just be morally outraged, I'd be completely fucking terrified. But in HPMOR, the whole thing becomes an argument about moral development, which of course Harry won.

So the change I would make - though perhaps it would count as drastic - would be to have /Hermione/ as the main character, not Harry. (Even apart from the gender optics, I think it just makes more sense. If you're looking for a Muggle-raised, academically-inclined, voracious reader, Hermione is the obvious candidate.)

There is a pretty good series of fanfics with the premise of Hermione the academically gifted witch applying Muggle know-how to magic. They're not really like HPMOR, though I'd count that as a point in their favor.

** 1. Make the story stretch over 7 years instead of 1 year. Many of the themes and discussions just sound absurd when you put an 11-year-old in the middle of them.

2. Ditch the idea that Transfiguration operates on elements and chemicals as described by chemistry, but rather has its basis in an entirely different, parallel theory of matter which contradicts atomic theory. Use this to explore the concept of (scientific) pluralism and/or structural realism.

3. Present genuine rationalism to the reader, not "try to make everything fit into my pre-existing belief system" scientism.

4. Have Harry explore the idea that the magical universe seems to operate in a non-reductionistic manner (i.e. a thing like a "secret" is its own objectively existing thing and cannot be reduced to a belief in a mind, which is in turn cannot be reduced to chemicals in a brain, etc)

5. Remove the parts of the fic which take potshots at canon (and not even good potshots at that) such as the reworked Sorting Hat, Dementors as a symbol of death rather than despair and decay, etc.

6. Have Harry/the narrative take seriously the fact that the world is in fact dualist: souls exist, a person is not defined by their mind, etc. and explore the consequences of this.

7. Have Harry/the narrative explore the fact that evidence for an afterlife exists in the HP universe and explore the consequences of this.

8. Have Harry/the narrative explore the fact that the objective rules of the (magical) universe appear to be anthropocentric -- and don't take the "a wizard wrote the rules/the beliefs of wizards collectively dictate the rules" cop-out.

9. Don't ask for money in exchange for faster updates.

Ultimately, I think there's a lot of merit to a fic which explores the philosophical consequences of HP magic being real. Unfortunately, MOR seems to want to avoid the most interesting discussions and instead try to change magic to fit into a scientific/physicalist world view.

** There's no way, because many of the things that some people love about it (summing up particular plot points from canon and fanfiction, Harry's sarcastic streak, the change to magical mechanics, smart Voldemort) are inextricably tied to the things that others despise. Different things also appeal to different people. I honestly absolutely love the characterization and conversations with Dumbledore throughout the fic, but I didn't like the copout with the propechies dictating his crazy actions. The mirror mechanic change was dumb, but the mirror confrontation was cool. I also really liked some of other minor twists, such as the thing with Sirius, but even in this thread someone else already mentioned that they hated it. I thought the battles were cool and enjoyed the Ender's Game references, but it's true that the ones post-Christmas are basically just character filler and don't have a strong in-universe reason to take place.

I think there was a lot of pseudo-science/evopsych type stuff that was pretty dumb, especially the dialogue about "haha, I'm manipulating you," "oh wow you're such a good manipulator," and a lot of the science was bad in general, including straight up wrong information about stuff like the Robber's Cave and Bayesian statistics. I liked getting into character's heads, but that only happened because of the bloat from huge sections unrelated to the overall plot i.e. a big chunk of Hermione's whole bully arc- in what world does bullying work like it does in HPMOR? But the main point, to demonstrate Hermione's goals, the idea of heroism, Snape's attempt at atonement, etc. were interesting to the overarching structure.

For another simple example, take the re-imagining of Dementors as representing "death" rather than "depression." A lot of people hated it. I think the general theme of overcoming death, divorced from the real-life analogies Yudowsky was trying to present, was interesting, especially in a series where the idea of death plays a fairly important role. But I also see why it rubbed people the wrong way in terms of rewriting the HPverse, and furthermore why people hated that it essentially made the fic an advertisement for Yudowsky's research institute and their own poor practices.

** For me, my greatest issue is the core-focus of the fic on Rationalism, to frankly, the detriment of /everything/ that makes a fantasy story pleasing and worthwhile for me. There's a balance to be struck between /'characters who think about their circumstances and don't just accept situations on a 'that's just the way it is' basis'/... and what a lot of Rationalist works end up being. Let me provide a relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  /In SF/F universes, a Rationalist fic will start out close to canon, just with a Rational protagonist, and by the end of the story our protagonist has usually Demystified the Magic Using the Scientific Method, Defeated Death, and Taken Over the World For It's Own Good. (Irrational people make irrational decisions, you see, and only Our Rational Hero can be trusted to make the right choices for humanity.)/ ([[https://www.pillowfort.io/posts/138657][source]])
#+end_quote

I don't know about others, but my personal reaction to the above tends to be a very visceral /'yikes!'/ This quote managed to nail what always kept unsettling me about Rationalist fic and why I didn't manage to connect to a single one (whether HPMOR or something else), regardless of how highly it came recommended by friends. The course of a Rationali!fic protagonist (as shown in HPMOR and as described above) sounds very much like a Magalomanic Super-Villain origin-story, rather than the tale of a hero -- or even an anti-hero. Which in and of itself wouldn't have been a problem at all, I greatly enjoy /'start of darkness'/ type stories. The thing that makes my blood run cold with Rational!protagonists is that the author and the narrative never really acknowledge the darkness and continue to treat the character and their actions and attitudes as both justified and naturally superior and praise-worthy. That's usually enough to make me nope right out.

** I liked HPMOR, but everything has its flaws. It's too long, for one thing. It takes place in one school year, so anything from 100k to 200k is a reasonable length. 660k is not.

The plot should be streamlined, and the conflict increased. Quirrelmort's reveal should have been shocking. The battles in Quirrell's army should have had an impact on several plot lines (Harry's relationship with Quirrell and his classmates, the search for immortality, etc.) I liked the intelligence of the battle scenes, but they didn't seem to connect with what was going on outside the battlefield.

Harry probably should have spent less time plotting and more time experimenting on magic. I thought the plotting was funny, but half the time the plots didn't lead anywhere. They could be cut out without affecting the story at all.

When Harry /does/ make a magical discovery, he should have to work hard for it, rather than figure it out in one afternoon. His poor choices should have real world consequences (the Azkaban arc) and the whole prophecy thing needs to be reworked. It was a bit of a let down that Voldemort was overtaken because he freaked out over a prophecy (I know, it's similar to canon, but...still).

Character agency--Harry and Quirrell have it, and the other characters don't. Change the narrative to make other major characters matter, both to the plot and to the reader. Give them story arcs.

I think HPMOR has a lot of great moments, but it's bogged down by too much other stuff going on. Not all of it connects to the main plot. At its heart, HPMOR is a coming of age story. Harry learns that rationality does /not/ solve all your problems--you need to be a good person, too. If this goal was obvious from the very first chapter, I think the story would be a lot less divisive than it is.

Overall, though, I really did like the story. It's funny, engaging, and it has a lot of heart. I think a decent pass at editing would change it from a sprawling, chaotic fanfic to professional quality writing.

I will say that the word count was obnoxiously high, with tons of bloat in both the overall plot and the prose/dialogue, coupled with some big timeskips, but 200k or 300k would've likely worked plenty well. It's been a while since I read it, but I remember "To Shape and Change" being pretty good, and it's a ~240k word 1st year fic that similarly goes through the entire Voldemort plot.

Eh, Hermione's actions actually ended up being a lot more important than they appear in the short term.

There's this whole subplot where Quirrell tries to get Hermione and Draco to prove Harry's faith in them wrong, that way Harry will lose his optimism and follow Quirrell's master plan for taking over wizarding Britain. But Hermione resists all of Quirrell's manipulations, thereby achieving something that no other character (including Harry, Dumbledore and Snape) were able to. In fact, I would say that Hermione sticking to her moral code is the most important action in the entire story, because without that Quirrell would have easily won Harry over to his "human beings are worthless" world view.

But yeah, the bullies arc is one of the weakest parts of the story, partly because the change in tone and POV is so jarring, and partly because it does a terrible job conveying the point that it is supposed to make.

Not to mention the secret keeper backstory in the books is full of plot holes that make manipulative!Dumbledore look canon.

EY changed the identity of the traitor partly as a tongue-in-cheek joke about a common fanfiction trope. There are tons of fic in which a character from the future (or other setup) arrives in the past with knowledge of Petigrew being the traitor. They invariably save the day just by capturing Petigrew themselves or by telling the right people the truth. But in real life, if someone claimed that a pet rat is a creepy old man in disguise, people would assume insanity. In HPMOR, the joke is that it really was insanity.

As for the map, it's not like Percy walked around with Scabbers (who would?). And the map is very crowded.

In regards to those canon things not being "plot holes": The twins are supposed to be pranksters, who use the map constantly to look for hidden rooms, hidden passages or names of people who could catch them when preparing something. I find it *extremely* unlikely that they wouldn't notice a unknown person constantly hanging out in Ron's and Harry's dormitories - one of them being their brother and the other the boy who lived.

Scabbers possibly being a magical rat: Ron certainly doesn't seem to think so, he thinks it's just a boring old rat. Would have at least warranted a letter "Hey Perce, what's up with that rat of yours?!". Rats live 2 years, not 10 and that fact alone should be enough for the Weasley parents to at least be somewhat concerned: This is a world in which Polyjuice, animagus transformations and all other black-magic-fuckery exist. Arthur even seems to have a healthy paranoia for things like this: "Haven't I taught you anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain"

**** Which is fine, but this fic basically makes up it's own rules of magic for Harry Potter, that themselves aren't compliant with canon. It provides explanations, and apart from many being incompatible with canon, they're largely told to us through an author surrogate who does his science by /thinking really hard/ and being right.

The numbers riddle Harry told Hermione, his first experiment not working, the Malfoy blood magic thing, or even the time travel math formula thing were good little experiments. But they all disappear after that poin. He literally uses technobabble mumbojumbo, which isn't even real, to create his own unique branch of magic in partial transfiguration. The idea with potions ingredients conserving "magical" energy signatures is cool- Harry Potter magic isn't really shown to be "conceptual," but conceptual magic systems are cool, and the idea shown is not unlike the one in Taure's Victoria Potter fic. However, EY's method of introducing it to us is doing so right before it would be useful to Harry, then basically never having it show up again.

Why is this such a common response to criticism of HPMOR?

Simply put, Yudkowsky done fucked up by having so much of the moral of his story not being apparent until the last few chapters. So yeah, we find out at the very end that Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres has been horribly wrong all along, but until that point that's not how the story presents him. He's constantly ducking consequences for his dumb choices, which combined with the author stand-in/putting his nonfiction into HJPEV's mouth, does make it seem for most of the story that the audience is intended to look favorably upon him. When so many readers don't get Yudkowsky's intended aesop, that's on him.

In any case, the climax of the book is solved by him rationalisming magic, what with the whole transfiguration thing he does. And several other big moments are solved in a similar fashion, e.g. the Patronus 2.0. It's hard to take seriously the claim that the story is really trying to tell us that magic is weird and mystical and not amenable to rational thinking.

This isn't really true. Yes, Harry fails to completely grasp it in the space of a year. But the fic still, for example, accepts the atomic theory of matter and the chemical elements as the correct description of the universe and part of magic.

For me this is the weakest part of the fic: it's meant to be about "when rationalism meets magic" but the author stacks the deck in favour of rationalism from the start. The story never explores the idea that the rational thing is to discard the principles of rationalism in the face of an irrational universe.

In terms of improving the story, the characters of less intelligent characters would need to be reworked - or at least the main character's perception of them. The fact that the MC gives characters like Ron, or especially Hagrid, no respect just because they're less intelligent is fairly pathetic, albeit in-character for a genius 12 year old with an inflated opinion of himself.

Why I consider that a reliable metric: I recently set myself a goal of reading through every fic marked with a specific character tag on FFN, going from most favs to least. I read every fic that was more than 20k words long that had at least 2k words per chapter. I kept finding good quality fics (decent grammar, coherent plot and believable characters) down into the range of fics with only ~20 favorites. Below 10 favorites I didn't find any well written fics at all. The only exceptions were fics that had been published within the last year and thus hadn't had time to build up a readership.

I suppose I might soften a few of its harsher criticisms of canon; while it's great fun for Quirrell to mock Canon!Harry's use of Sectumsempra in such a beautifully scathing and sensible manner, I feel like the whole arbitrage scheme at the beginning should have had a reasonable impossibility rather than actually being plausible.

Gems like "what do I believe, and why do I believe it to be true," and Quirrel's lesson to Harry on the importance of learning how to lose, have had a significant role in my life as I entered my thirties and needed a better perspective on how to deal with difficult people. Delivering philosophy in the thin candy shell of escapism fiction makes it much more palatable for me than the dryness of other pure philosophy books.
