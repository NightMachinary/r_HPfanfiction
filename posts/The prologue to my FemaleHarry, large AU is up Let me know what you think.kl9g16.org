** Amazing work! I can't help but wonder where you're taking this story. I especially enjoyed the mother-daughter Parseltongue bonding scene, even if Magnolia was too young. Will Magnolia remember that? I liked your Lily Potter.

** Liked it so far. Although it looks like Dumbledore wanted Peter to divulge the Fidelius secret to Voldemort? Is this a setup for Dumbledore bashing?

I always like the idea that Harry gets his/her parseltongue from his/her mother.
