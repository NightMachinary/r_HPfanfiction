So been thinking of fanfic ideas and this one just popped in my brain. i wanna know if there's a story where Voldemort got busted for pretending to be a pureblood. I dont really care if its Harry or Draco or any of the main characters but just someone.

Like wouldnt that hella change how much power he will have and how many supporters will stay? I really wanna read one if there is.

*** I think you miss the part where voldemore died and lucius had to use his power to clear his name. He has position in board of governors and ministry and him hating muggle borns and halfblood can affect his decision to revive voldemort.

** Not exactly, that but this is a subplot of linkffn(13137899) or how Petunia destroyed Voldemort by the brochure of the Department of Muggle Liasion.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
