I'm just curious if there are any fics like that where Harry doesn't just steal the show and fix everything for people. Thank you!


** linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep) - Harry advises several prominent characters from the Avengers films in his role as their bartender. Minimal magic involved.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** linkffn(11132113) The Difference One Man Can Make is a interesting HP/ASOIAF cross. Harry leads the wildlings towards civilization, doesn't really want trouble, but does end up playing a major role in Westeros' politics. Not sure if it counts as teacher/mentor thing, but Harry does lead the wildlings as some sort of paragon.

Technically he becomes the Master of Ahsoka Tano in I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. linkffn(11157943). Its a fun read with very long chapters, but Harry is an immortal mage who does steal the show quite a bit, to be honest.

But well, these two were the only ones I found that somewhat fit the bill.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  A rewrite of my original Potter Sensei. More focus on the lessons and doing away with the harem route.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
