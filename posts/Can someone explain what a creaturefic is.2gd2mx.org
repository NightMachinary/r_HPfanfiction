I keep seeing the term while I'm browsing and searches haven't yielded much. Sorry, I am very new to fandom.


** Basically it means one of the main characters involved isn't completely human. (This is often accomplished by a really thin logic stretch such as "magical inheritances" - /genetic/ inheritances - that don't activate until the character's 15th-17th birthday.) Sometimes the creature involved will be canon, e.g. Harry turns out to have veela blood; often the creature won't, e.g. Harry is a siren, or catboy, or "dragonkin" or whatever the author wants to play with.

Oftentimes one of the characters turning out to have some kind of creature blood means that due to the creature involved the character has a particular "mate" which gives the author an excuse to pair two characters that canonically don't get along. (Like Harry and Draco. Lots of Harry/Draco creature!fics out there.)

The premise is silly, but the fics can be fun.

*** I would also classify Werewolf!Harry and Vampire!Harry fics as creature!Harry fics. I believe that many also include child Harry becoming an animagus as creature!Harry fics.
