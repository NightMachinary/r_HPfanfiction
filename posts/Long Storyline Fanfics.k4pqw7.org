I have been reading The Cupboard Series, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Sarcasm & Slytherin and I've been enjoying the whole process of how Harry is in AUs.

Are there any other Fanfic collections that start from Year 1 and go on till Year 7 other than the above?

Plus any good Slytherin!Harry storylines?


** Linkffn(Antithesis) Is pretty good! Fair warning on this one, it's dark, and just- well- be warned. Still amazing tho!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
