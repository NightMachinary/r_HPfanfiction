** " I demand to be given an audience with the queen " huffed Theodore Nott to the unamused palace guard " I am Lord Theodore Puckhloys Albousot Riabouch Nott the 3rd ! "

Suddenly a group of mudbloods ( Granger,Rivers and Perks ) and halfbloods who were as good as mudbloods ( Hopkins,Turpin and Corner ) ran up . Each of them was wearing a bright red badge that read " Institute Volunteer " . The Lord Nott then found himself being gently led away by Hopkins.

Sally-Anne turned to the guard " You'll have to forgive Teddy,it's not often enough he's allowed on an outing from the home "

The guard nodded sympathetically.

** they get off the wrong train stop and end up council estates. Things might not pan out for a few of the more uppity pureblood types.

I'm picturing Attack the Block level of muggle ingenuity.

*** I don't know, I think the purebloods might actually fare better then the muggle-raised, because the muggle-raised would be more reluctant to hurt the muggles, or do property damage, whereas the bigoted purebloods might not have any qualms about pulling out the big guns.

**** Remember Dumbledore's dad? Life in Azkaban for avenging her daughter Arianna.

If those pureblood bigot kids start throwing spells in Muggle areas and harming Muggles, the Ministry would crack down on them hard, and some quality time with dementors in Azkaban is all but guaranteed.

That would be gross violation of underage magic restriction and reckless endangerment of Statute of Secrecy.

***** OMG, the situation with Dumbledores' dad totally slipped my mind. And the trace would also be a factor.

On the other hand, the pureblood bigots could, hypothetically, get away with harming muggles, by turning the attacking muggles, and all witnessing muggles, into cockroaches. Cockroaches can't write to the newspapers about the strange things they witnessed, leaving no written record for the Aurors to find. And as seen in CoS when Dobby gets Harry in trouble for underaged magic, the Trace is not perfect, it has some loopholes, and I would expect a number of Slytherins to be aware of the loopholes, and how to exploit them.

My point that the pure-blood bigots wouldn't be in any direct danger from the muggles themselves stands.
