:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember much about this fic, other than it had fem!harry (or Harry's sister, possibly) tasked with watching over Draco's first year sister. The OC sister was either quiet or shy. I believe her name started with a C, but I'm not sure.

Thank you.


** Yeah I did a bit of searching and I couldn't come up with anything. Do you know what website it was on? Also I need more details; literally anything you can remember.

*** Either FFN or AO3; fem!harry might of been an OC, but I know she was a female

That's all I can remember right now, I'll edit if I remember more

** Are you sure it was fem!Harry X Draco's sister? Because the description you gave sounds a bit like Bound With Silver Threads which is Lily Luna X Draco's daughter, Casseopia.
