I am looking for fics where harry gets stuck in his animagus form when he first transforms and needs hermione's (or another girls) help to change back

Bonus for random nakedness in front of animagus harry before they know its him

Example : fussy wussy protector XxX Additionally im looking for well written novel length fics that forcus on the animagus training and then ACTUALLY USE THE TRANSFORMATION! -So tired of fics where they spend chapter after chapter training, and when they finally succeed, they only transform once or twice in the rest of the story.. Example: vox corporis

//anyone can tell me how to link to ffn stories?

  An escape pod lands on Earth with a 13 year old girl and a one year old boy as its passengers. The two have only minutes before they are being chased by a species they do not know or trust, humans. Kara runs across the country with only one goal in mind, fulfilling her oath to her mother and keeping Kal El alive while trying to deal with powers that are becoming out of control.
