As in characters from existing fics dropping into other fics. If not real existing characters then archetypes: for instance, a very manipulative and morally questionable Dumbledore who would be the almost-villain in one fic stumbles through a portal in Hogwarts and falls into a universe where his counterpart is actually a sincerely-trying-to-be benevolent Headmaster. Or Harry 'Hadrian Peverell' Potter, raised by his real parents, drops into a more or less canon-compliant universe to share in Harry Potter's misery at the Dursleys. So the Durlseys now have to deal with two Harrys, one normal and the other all sassy and bratty.

Are there any examples of this out there? Found any good ones, anybody?


** linkffn(11289525) - Had a Harry from the future teach his younger counterpart. It's quite fluffy.

linkffn(9824342) - Albus Dumbledore dies as a respected figure and wakes up in canon... he's not amused.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
