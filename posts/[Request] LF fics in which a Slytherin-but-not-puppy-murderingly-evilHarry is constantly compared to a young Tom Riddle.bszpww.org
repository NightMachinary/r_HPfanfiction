*** I'm looking for in a "he's very charming and seems to attract loyal friends." Beggars can't be choosers, so I would be fine with DarkLord!Harry as long as - like the title says - he wouldn't randomly kill a puppy

*** The second, if I'm remembering the fic right. I really like that adaption of canon--- Harry does resemble Tom Riddle in a lot of key ways.

#+begin_quote
  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
