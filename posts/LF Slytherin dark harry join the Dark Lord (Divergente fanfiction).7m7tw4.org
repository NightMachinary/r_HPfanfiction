"has it even occurred to you why all the bad guys think you'd make such a splendid bad guy along with them ?" On the way to greatness, Mira Mirth Slytherin Harry, Boy who Lived, is courted and conviced by the other slytherin to join the Dark Lord. I don't want Wrong boy who lived, I want a slytherin Harry on the dark side because he can only become a blood purist after the Dursleys. (How he didn't is a mystery for me !)
