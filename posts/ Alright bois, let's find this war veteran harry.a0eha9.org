I can't remember the name of this fanfiction I read some time ago but the first chapter is this whole thing about how THIS harry's future was filled with war as he became the leader of light even with Voldemort being on the winning side as the light side is forced into hiding. It has dates and all this other shit but at the end of the first chapter, Harry is killed by I think Death Eaters during I think winter as I remember something about cold or snow, and then in the second chapter he is very confused as he finds himself in his past self's body and notes that he doesn't have the scars that he got during the war when he was older, and thinks the whole thing is some trick and is only convinced that it's all real when something with Petunia (I think) happens. I'm sorry if this is super vague but I reset my laptop 2 times and the last time I read this was like a year or 2 ago.

Alright guys, thanks. The fiction was definitely "Circular Reasoning". I also knew this immediately after clicking one of the links because I immediately recognized the story's picture.


** Might be linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian)?

*** Definitely is. The winter/snow is the Winter Court and he has a confrontation with Petunia as soon as he wakes up in his "old" body.

**** Man, I totally forgot about the Dresden Files crossover in it (as well as the Abhorsen one later on!). I kinda want to reread it, but it's really grimdark and I don't think I have the patience for it in the end :\

***** Definitely on the darker side of things without going into full dark lord harry. It's more or less abandoned as well, last update i think was like a year+ ago and the update before that was even longer IIRC. I still thoroughly enjoyed it though and suggest it for people who want a damaged post war Harry

****** I'd definitely go with less abandoned as the author updated it like 11 or 12 years after beginning it. I think it shows intent to keep adding chapters throughout the author's lifetime, lol.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** Circular Reasoning. Harry is very powerful, but not Gary Stu like and the power/good fighting skills is explained as he's basically been in a war zone for 12 years of his life. Probably one of the best stories which has a strong as hell Harry but doesn't completely over do it.

A shame it was never continued, it was one of the few fics that explored the Fae and pureblood/creature blood without shitting on muggleborns

** Circular Reasoning is a well-written fic, but it's so depressing that I wasn't able to finish it. I am quite fond of Post-War fics though. There are a lot of them floating around. I don't mind non-explicit Slash, and I found these to be awesome stories:

The Most Powerful Magic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2457953/chapters/5448869]])

Anachronism ([[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/252197.html]])

Both are well-written and explore unusual magic and mysteries. There's no explicit slash in TMPM and very little in Anachronism. The latter is amazing and I recommend it highly; just have an open mind and try them.
