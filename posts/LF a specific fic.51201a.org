Ok. So the premise was taking every character and sort of making them opposite, not that I'm putting it that well. Lily is still alive and is pretty powerful and has adopted Hermione. Good!Hermione has switched places with the one from that universe. The bad guys kids are slaves to the good guys, and it's Harry/Pansy. Voldemort has a child with Bellatrix that is fostered by the longbottoms and is fomenting a rebellion inside the CoS. Ron was referred to as RÃ³nald.

Help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Something I just remembered is that Lucius has been kept prisoner in Hogwarts, so they sneak him out and try to rehabilitate him. He can't remember who Draco is.


** *Edit: I think it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] linkffn(4025300).*

I think I know the fic. Technology (or magic mixed with technology) is the 'good' thing, and Dumbledore in the big bad.

I've tried to google it, and I can't find it but if it is the same fic, more details: Hermione wakes up on the train to Hogwarts. She is sort of dating Ron, in that she is in this universe, a slutty tease, who has been together with Ron. Hermione is pretty horrified by this. AU Hermione is wearing make up and skimpy clothes and in general is a pretty bimbo. Lily basically adopted Hermione, a fellow muggleborn. Lily is a conniving bitch.

As for Draco, he is a slave. Hermione in fact saves Draco by betting that she can give Ron the best night of his life, and then using a Weasley prank product to think he slept with her, her prize is Draco, who before then was being tortured in the middle of the common room. The main focus of the romance is Draco/Hermione.

At one point, she makes it into the rebellion force, who (or at least Tom Riddle) have been living in the chamber of secrets which is lush garden paradise. It is there that they hide both Malfoy's after saving them. Lucius has been tortured for information that he deliberately oblivated from himself. It is a bit of a mystery what, exactly, is the secret.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
