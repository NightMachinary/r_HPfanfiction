J.K. Rowling's has stated that she is bad with math. So, let's ignore for the most part everything she has posted about percentages and so on. Instead, let's focus on a few other things that let us get to where we need to be.

Average Life Expectancy (ALE) for humans is around 70 years. We know from Rowling, and common sense, that magicals would have a longer ALE than non-magicals. It's even stated magicals live longer and are hardier than muggles. So, making a reasonable guess let's put the magical humans' ALE at 100 years.

This skews the population percentage statistics up a fair bit so we will have to adjust for longer life spans.

On average muggle children ages 11-18 makes up around 12% of the population. For magicals let's move this down to 8%. Now let's look at the story for the number of students attending Hogwarts.

The names and hints given in the books and movies help us here. We will say that around 10 students per house per year, which is 40 students a year over 7 years for around 280 students.

So, if 8% of the population is 280 that means the wizarding population is 3,500 Harry's first year of Hogwarts. The United Kingdom as of 1991 had a population of 57.44 million according to the World Bank. That is .0061 percent of the population are magicals.

Here is where I start to infer a fair bit and hope you will hold on with me. Two world wars claimed over 1 million British accounting for almost 2 percent of the population. In that same timeframe, the wizarding world also had to deal with two dark lords as well.

In canon it states that many once large families are down to only a few heirs at all with many others simply no longer existing. Let's make a few theories, perhaps magicals fled Magical UK to avoid the war, it is a reasonable assumption that a fair bit migrated during the British Expansion during its colonization phase. A fair percentage likely left for America or Australia hoping to make fortune or start anew. So overall bumping the world percentage up to .01 is not an unreasonable number. Magical UK had just been demolished after all. Family sizes during war are smaller as well, post-war birth rates are often much higher until they stabilize as well.

So, let's make Hogwarts 1991-1992 year rather small and the population of Magical UK small compared to the world average.

Using .01 that gives us just over 537,500 magicals worldwide. The North American Countries had a combined population of (253.5m USA + 87.07m Mexico + 28.04m Canada) 368.61m people. Taking .01% of that gives us a North America Continent Magical Population of around 37,000. Getting the student population of 8% almost 3,000 students.

Worldwide numbers would be 537,500 magicals and 43,000 school-age magicals worldwide.

Remember Rowling's already told us she is bad with math so take this next part with a heavy dose of salt. For the 43,000 school-age magicals around the world there are a grand total of 11 schools. Meaning each school on average would have around 4,000 students.

Now Hogwarts only has 280 so let's take them out the running shall we. They are a rounding error at best. Drumstrang only brought 12 and Beauxbatons (gathered from scenes in the movie) brought 15.

They would only bring students of age and only the best of the of age students as well. Those academically well enough to leave the main school for a year and still be fine. If this is the top 10% that means they likely have year class sizes of 120-150. They also have suffered from multiple wars though they draw from a much larger population to build their student body. So, round it up to 150 each and call it good enough.

Unless we decide that .061 is good as well for Europe, in which case we have 44,100 magicals and 3,500 school-age students.

Going with the larger number means between all three European schools we have around 4,000 students.

That means with 8 remaining schools we must house and teach 39,000 students or almost 4,900 students each!

Doing some quick research on the internet shows me that the boarding school with the highest number of students is less than half that number. That school is also a pre-k through grade 12, day school with grades Pre-k to 6th being day school only.

Over half of the boarding school around the world also have a teacher-student ratio of 1/8 or better. That is 1 teacher per 8 students and over half of those are Â¼ or better.

That is strictly teachers and does not include the amount of staff required as well. Cleaning, admin, dorm heads, medical, cooks, and so much more. House-elves take over a fair amount of cleaning and cooking for sure. Still, there needs to be around 1 support/admin per 5 teachers. That is also not including the counselors that are required as well. Remember magic is dangerous, remember a syllable off and you get a buffalo standing on your chest!

Let's use a better teacher-student ratio of 1 teacher per 4 students. That gives us just under 10,000 teachers for a population of around 540,000 magicals. This is about 1.86% of the population. This is about double the percent of teachers in a population on average normally, but these are boarding schools as well so understandable.

We need to add in about 2,000 support staff to the mix that gives us 1,250 teachers per school and 250 support staff. If the school has enough house elves to completely remove the need for cleaning staff and cooking.

So J.K. Rowling's world has each school other than the Tri-Wizard schools with 4,900 Students; 1,250 Teachers, and 250 Support Staff for a total of 6,400 people on site. That is assuming an even distribution across the schools as well.

Hogwarts! 280 Students, 12 Teachers, 5 Staff (Some also part-time teach) and a bunch of house-elves. Teacher to Student Ratio 3 to 70 or around 1 Teacher per 23 Students. This is over 5 times higher than our numbers and twice as high as what is considered high in a boarding school.

In the end, it is possible for there to be only 8 boarding schools around the magical world other than the big three those schools would easily also qualify as townships in their own right.

My thoughts are the 11 schools of magic are the ivy leagues of magic around the world. That for most they attend local day schools or smaller boarding schools.

Any thoughts or comments are appreciated.


** Rowling's Math makes pretty much no sense when you get down to it. I've seen a few different attempts to make sense of any of it. The numbers I would use would probably be a little different (because I tried to account for the fact that the number of births in Ginny and Harry's years would be unusually low, and the births after Ginny's year would be unusually high). That said, our numbers are not significantly far apart when you get right down to it.

I believe that since we have so little information, realistically the global wizarding population could be anywhere from 500k to 1 million (big approx). We just don't have enough information. After all, maybe there are some smaller schools in England that have like, 5 kids per year or something. Maybe some kids are home-schooled their entire life.

I do not believe for one second that there are only eleven magical schools. For me I would just discard Rowlings statement therein completely, but if someone wanted to at least sort of remain true to it it would be reasonable to say "These are the top eleven schools globally."

*** One thing that I always wonder about is, what happens to the muggleborn students that end up at Beauxbatons?

According to Rowling students come from: France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg  and Belgium.

Most of those countries don't speak French. And the kids would not start French class until highschool.

Which is all fine and dandy for the kids born in magical households. After all if you knew since their birth your kids would go to a French speaking highschool, you would make sure they learn the language. It could even be that French is the lingua franca in magic continental Europe. Considering most of them went to Beauxbatons and the odd are great that they didn't all get together with someone from the same home country.

However the muggleborns grew up in a Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese household with the expectation they would go to a highschool in that language. (Leaving France, part of Belgium and Luxembourg out of this, because they of course would go to a French speaking school regardless)

And if the language situation in GOF is any indication. (With ministry officials barely able to communicate in foreign tongue) wizards aren't strong on second language education.

**** That is an excellent point, I had not even considered that one. Holy dear god, they must spend obscene amounts of time just teaching the language.

No way do they not have some type of magical way to learn a language. iirc there is a flyer for a magical language school. So I am guessing a charm to learn faster perhaps?

There are cheering, calming and oblivation spells. So affecting the mind is possible, perhaps a combination of wit-sharpening potion (or more language specific potion) with a specialized spell?

**** Honestly I'd have several different explanations.

1. Discard Rowlings statement because that's too big a population for Beauxbatons to be servicing.

2. Beauxbatons contacts Muggleborn families much sooner than Hogwarts does, thus enabling them to begin learning French younger.

3. Much like Wizarding Britain, the concerns and needs of Muggleborns don't matter to witches or wizards in greater Europe.

Of the three I'd personally use number one in my own fics.

**** If you think Beauxbaton is bad, let me tell you that the only magical school in Asia is in Japan, a nation which has a very stained past with pretty much all other Asian nations. Sending a Korean or Chinese Muggleborn to a magical school in Japan in the 30s-50s would be akin to sending a Jewish Muggleborn to a magical school in Nazi Germany (from their perspective). In fact "magical school" would probably been seen as a synonym for death camp by the parents.

Also to prove she is even more horrible about understanding consequences, homeschooling is a thing.

I can see Mao (and Stalin for that matter) leading a purge of magic in their country. It would be very easy to get Muggleborns to cooperate (threaten them with their parents' with execution after your state security found those teenagers who mysteriously disappeared), and that levels the playing field. Afterwards, either execute the Muggleborns anyway or have them form your own magical secret police. It might not get you the likes of Dumbledore or Voldemort, but the average wizard struggles with a shield charm.

******* I've of two minds on this. The Mao Great Leap Forward purge makes a great deal of sense. That also includes a muggleborn led revolution for Russia with Stalin then moping up the survivors.

The other side for China is the Xianxia hidden sects and great families route. Like Mao wanted to take them out, they said come at me brah and demolished the Armies Mao sent their way.

Hidden away far from muggles are hidden magical sects that rule as Lords of their domain. Which way I go depends on how dark it is supposed to be.

Also power levels, magic sects use magic martial arts. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon on steriods. They are near, or at, the top of the food chain for war.

**** Muggleborns are identified fairly early on in their lives in most cases

It might be protocol in Beauxbatons serviced countries to contact them well before their 11th birthday (maybe as soon as the muggleborn is identified) to give them time to prep for going to a French speaking school. Those that speak romance languages would at least have a solid foundation and would probably pick it up decently after a few years.

Durmstrang also services multiple nations but doesn't admit muggleborns so it avoids that problem, though it creates another. Homeschooling and correspondence courses to the rescue, I suppose.

I'm sure the "Most Dangerous Branch of Magic" transfiguration is totally fine with learning on your own.

Seriously, homeschooling only works for purebloods with decent resources and a trade they are teaching their kids.

Imagine Ron homeschooling his kid.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Ron grabs a roll from the kitchen as his son works on the Leviosa spell. Remembering it all to well he skips the book and starts instructing taking a bite of his roll.

"Hits LebiOOza, with a swish." Trusting his dad he incants the spell.

** Firstly, according to movie canon and the wiki the Life Expectancy of a British Wizard is 137.75 years, so that has to be factored into any population estimate.

Also Wizarding Schools are a rarity partly for a reason- the small population made it difficult to assemble them. Much of the world still homeschools their magical children and that has to be taken into account.

Furthermore the 280 estimate is somewhat small - Harry's year is likely at least somewhat smaller than average because of being at the height of the war- this is supported by flashbacks in OoTP showing Marauder Era OWL exams with over 100 students in one exam at once. While Rowling's statements have to be taken with some salt as well given how bad at math she is, she had stated that the population of Hogwarts is between 600-1000. (This also likely means there are fewer Muggleborns proportionally than we may suspect because ironically enough their birth rate wouldn't be affected by an internal magical war the same way pure and half-bloods might). Since homeschooling is an option even in Britain we can assume some small portion of the population is homeschooled and thus Hogwarts doesn't factor them in.

With a lowball estimate of 50 students per year times 137.75 years we get 350 Hogwarts students and a total population of ~6888 Wizards, and we can probably round up to 7000 with Homeschooling. A midrange estimate of 100 students per year overall would get us 13775 Wizards and a highball estimate of 150 students per year gets us to 20663, perhaps rounding up to 14,000-21,000 to account for homeschoolers.

While Rowling has said the British Wizard Population is about 3,000 she's also said there are 500 million Wizards and neither of those figures match. A 10,000-20,000 British population estimate is more feasible for a substantial yet concealable magical community. In my headcanon that number is closer to 20,000

That gives us a maximum ratio of 1 wizard to about 3000 muggles. Assuming that ratio is constant across countries or Britain is average (which is a wild guess, really), we would currently have a wizarding population of ~2,600,000.

*** I know they say 137, problem is that in the movie, book, pottermore and every other source Dumbledore is labeled an old and powerful wizard at age 115ish. The HPwiki lists every mention of a wizards age, there are only a few around that age.

So once again either one or both sets of numbers are totally borked. Rowling's is horrible with math that is for sure.

Personally I enjoy the thought of several million magicals just due to basic population growth charts.

Think about it in medieval times and earlier. Who's going to have the most kids who will also go on to have more kids, magicals or non-magicals? Common sense says magicals would have been able to have larger more successful families.

Go back before Hogwarts and picture a magical warrior king. Dude is going to have a harem of honeys for sure.

Doesn't mean the average expectancy age isn't 100 like you said, but it also does support one that might be even longer. 110, 120, maybe 130.

***** True but I would not call most of the world 1,200 years ago comfortable. Not because of living conditions just due to food and war. Europe and Asia have been war zones for a long ass time. Europe has been marched across many times. Warfare on the Asian continent was fairly violent as well.

So yes, there were plenty of places and times it was peaceful though there were many more where it was not. We are not inherently noble and good people. Proof is in any preschool area filled with kids, they are as horrifically disproportionately violently revenge driven as they are sweet angels.

So give a young man, age 12, in 4th century Germany the ability to call fire to his hands (controlled wandless magic, he has no magical training) along with a few other badass tricks. He starts using his abilities to get ahead.

He has more food now, better housing, better everything because no one fucks with Henric Firehand. Suddenly he's the one women want, no pesky Christianity spewing single spouse marriage crap at him.

Oh yeah, Henric has a few wives and a dozen sons. Of those dozen genetics says about 1/3rd should be magical (if magic is a dominant genetic trait that can come from only one side). He teaches those 4 firehand eventually and they learn some other tricks. The rest are genetic squibs. So more chances for it to come back someday. He also has a few witch daughters he trades off.

They go on and have a few wives as well, because they grew up with a few moms and it was a happy home.

If each generation simply adds 1 more than the generation before while increasing the number of squibs that can marry into a magical family and have a higher chance to produce magicals?

Sorry got off the rails there, but yeah. Most of human history is not comfortable society and multiple wives for successful men was common before Christianity.

at first I pictured the founders fighting against the norman invasion, but that happens centuries after hogwarts was founded.

I like the idea of them talking about there skill sets when they realise, how limited the current system is, with wizards being trained by there family or being taken as an apprentice by another wizard. with some entire master-apprentice chains lacking vital areas of magical education.

your master sucks at potions, so your potions training is poor,so your apprentice sucks at potions and then his apprentice sucks at potions and so on.

so Godric and the others got to talking and realized they covered each others weaknesses quite well, I imagine early hogwarts was not for kids, but for adults to come and learn magic in areas they lacked and over the generations Hogwarts became trusted enough that the wizards starting sending younger and younger people.

I imagine pre hogwarts wizards where quite different, less trusting family spells based down for generations and secrets to potions guarded fiercely.

adult wizards go to hogwarts distrustful aiming to learn as much as possible while revealing as little about there own skills

Add to that the regular interruptions and disciplinary measures of a boarding school and you won't even get to teach at all. Ignoring numbers of students, McGonagal already has 7 years times 2 (assuming always two houses combined in one class) equals 14 (!) classes to teach and prepare per week. Of course NEWT level classes won't be just a measly once per week, so that number will be even higher. How would she handle 71 students per each of those classes? It's ridiculous...

** tl;dr: The schools are not there to support the population, the population is there because of the schools.

â

Yes, Rowling's strong suit wasn't world building or consistency. (She had imagination and the ability to spin that into a fantasy, but in terms of fitting it into a self-consistent model? Not even close).

11 schools can be pretty easily justified though, because the key number is the % of normal births that produce a magical, not the overall wizarding population.

If we assume that mixed births produce a low chance of getting a wizard (lets say, 1:6 or 1:8), then the total wizarding population in the world would approach the muggleborn birth rate. However, in those places there are social norms or institutions (like say, a school) to encourage wizard-wizard couples, they'll get a much higher / sustainable population.

â

I think we see what, 2-3 muggleborn's per year?

If you assume Britain's 57.44 Million population produces 2-3 muggleborn's per year, the worlds 5.375 billion population would only be producing only 180-280 new Wizards per year. If wizards generally exclusively married Muggles (say, wizards get apprenticed but rarely meet another wizard their age, so usually end up pairing with Muggles).

Thus, in a world without wizarding institutions to encourage wizard/wizard couples, you get 250 new wizards a year. Using the global fertility rate of 3ish kids per person, and a mixed marriage magical production of 1 in 6, you get the following:

1st Generation: 250

2nd Generation: 125 (250*3/6)

3rd Generation: 63

4th Generation: 32

5th Generation: 16

6th Generation: 8

7th Generation: 4

8th Generation: 2

9th Generation: 1

TOTAL WORLDWIDE WIZARDING POPULATION GENERATION: 501.

(if you use an average life expectancy of 100, then the total wizarding population is maxed out at 50K under this system)

Now, if WizardxWizard couples produce a very high magical rate (lets say 1 in 6 are Squibs), then that is good enough to have a self-sustaining wizarding population. Something like a school that keeps magicals together in their formative years and more likely to produce wizardxwizard marraiges would enable a population to spring up around the school. Even though your chances are halfed by the wizards marrying each other (two wizards marrying and producing 3 kids is less than them marrying muggles and producing 3 kids each), and even adjusting for a 1:6 squib rate, you still have a positive population growth. (2.5 wizarding kids per couple, or one squib every two couples producing 3 kids each).

â

Thus, under such a system, it isn't that they need enough schools to cover the natural wizaridng population, the wizarding population only exists where there are schools because the schools shift the population dynamics to produce more wizards.

â

This model works as long as your halfblood magical fertility is less than replacement level (1 in 3) and the pureblood fertility level is above the replacement level (2 in 3). The closer to those ratios you are, the higher the standing population is, but the dynamic would be the same.

â

I personally prefer to go with the 'low wizarding population' model. It lets you explain so many of the strange things in HP. If you imagine a class of 40-60 being normal per year (which is a class size of 20-30, with how Hogwarts has it structured). At 100 years life expectancy, that means you have a maximum total of 4000-6000 wizards total. Which would make sense on why there are only a few wizarding villages and only one major shopping district.

Why are the adults so incompetent? Well, they are more the equivalent of your local school or water board, being selected from a population of under 10K. Pretty much everything is going to be hand-made of crafted, no need for industrial level production, etc.

*** FUN WITH MATH

Using an average of 1 squib in 6 pureblood magical births, 1 wizard in 6 mixed blood births, and a very very low (2-3 a year) muggleborn birth rate.

Imaging two different systems:

System Apprentice: A few muggleborn wizards are born. When their magic manifests, they are taken under the wing of an older Magician. Given the low population densities, young wizards rarely, if ever, meet a magical member of the opposite gender. They generally mix with muggles. This produces 95% Muggle/Magical couples and 5% Pureblood couples

System Hogwarts: The magicals are rounded up and spend most of their first decade of sexuality in a magical-exclusive environment. This produces 80% Pureblood Couples and 20% Muggle/Magical Couples.

â

STARTING WITH 0 MAGICALS. Using 20 year generations.

This gives us 50 muggleborns per generation.

APPRENTICE: 6.7 Pureblood, 51.3 Halfbloods, 50 MugglebornsTOTAL: 108 MagicalsINCREASE OVER PREVIOUS GENERATION: + 0 Magicals (0% growth rate)

HOGWARTS: 2557 Pureblood, 256 Second Generation, 50 MugglebornsTOTAL: 2863 MagicalsINCREASE OVER PREVIOUS GENERATION: + 305 Magicals (12% Growth Rate)

Assuming 10 generations alive at once, the first system stops growning (and caps the number of magicals to 1080), while the second system already has 28630 potential magicals alive and is growning healthily.

I'm not accounting in this for the fact that replacement population isn't simply the spawn needed to replace yourself, but you have to account for those who don't make it to adulthood or are infertile. I think the replacement number is something like 2.3 per woman instead of 2. This would reduce the growth rates, but the relative differences would stay the same.

And also it was a behind the scenes takeover. All they did was imperious a couple higher up people which they did.

There have been situations in real life where the ratio has been better than that. For instance, the Khmer rouge. I couldnt find a ton of concrete data but in wikipedia it mentions at one point having an army of 50000 fighters. They took over a population of 8 million. And murdered 2 million.

HP only focuses on people who are willing to fight so it would seem like not difficult to take over a dictatorship regime but in real life most people just wait out the storm and hope for the best.

Probably a few families dedicated to growing and harvesting year round. Magic would likely make it faster, better and easier to get food. Maybe that is what led to Herbology orginally?

** Here's some of the math and mental gymnastics I did for my WIP to compare - was trying to figure out the logistics around class sizes and the number of coworkers for a teacher at Ilvermorny.

First off: it's /bonkers/. Ilvermorny draws students from all over North America - US, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. Since my story begins in 1966, those were the census numbers I used. Below are some of the highlights I wrote down before saying fuck it...

In 1966, there were about 37 million people between the ages of 10-19 in the United States alone. I first used "one tenth of a percent of the population is magical" which ended up being /thirty seven thousand kids/. Then I moved the decimal and went with 3700, rounded it up to 4000 to account for the rest of the continent and called it a day.

I also tried a convoluted ratio thing like you did, but I have no idea what I did with it lol.

In the end, I decided that Rappaport's, the scourers, etc probably gave the USA a bit of a bad name as far as immigration goes, and knocked the school population down to about 3000.

Speaking of bonkers though: Ilvermorny sorts their students. With 3 thousand kids, that means there's about 430 kids per year. That need to be sorted. If they're sorted at a rate of one firsty per minute, that's *seven fucking hours of standing on a fucking balcony*.

AND they don't get wands until they show up at the school.

You're fucking right the school has a goddamn orientation week in my story to deal with this shit, its ridiculous.

I also have some calculations for the number of teachers required, but its just as insane (while using a class size of 16, an unpopular subject that's taken for three semesters over three years and optional beyond that needs 20-ish instructors. And heaven help the charms and transfiguration instructors!)

Somebody else brought up languages: years 1-3 are taught in English, French and Spanish in my story, and starting in year four they're all in English. Second language studies are mandatory during that time period for everyone.

Edit - I also have some barebones calculations of what quodpot and quidditch scheduling would look like... and then I gave up and decided that I really don't care.

Why the hell is a magic contract/vow required of everyone to only use magic that harms others in defense of self or others?

Hear me out- it's a question of math. If you have an extraordinarily small population already suffering from some level of inbreeding all the genetic variance you can get counts. Muggles have a large enough population that this doesn't much matter: Wizards don't. An otherwise viable specimen dropping out of the reproductive race would constitute a heavy loss, especially with the really insular pureblood families where you could have as few as 28 acceptable families to marry into. I can't imagine a pro-pureblood movement like Voldemort's having at least a partly pro-natalist component- pop out some more magicals to compete with the muggles.

Then again, since marriages, especially pureblood marriages, are often more political then romantic it could be the case that Wizarding society is cool with extramarital gay sex so long as every witch and wizard (especially the purebloods) take care of the necessary business and pop out some kids in addition to recreational sex.

Yeah but they didn't die out. They married muggles. The problem was avoided. There's nothing to suggest they have a population issue. We know 100% that there are at least hundreds of thousands of wizards worldwide. This is enough. There are plenty of small communities, villages, towns, etc out there with smaller numbers that continue to exist just by themselves.

Using that line as evidence would be like me saying I'm dying because I nearly stabbed myself once. What matters is the end result. I didn't stab myself, therefore I'm not dying. Wizards did breed with muggles, therefore they don't have a population problem.

** Rowling's math certainly doesnt make sense.

But your "guesswork" isnt really any better. This is not meant to hate on you, but to point out that your "guesswork" is not based on anything concrete.

Lets go through it:

#+begin_quote
  So, making a reasonable guess let's put the magical humans' ALE at 100 years.
#+end_quote

Why? Because Dumbledore is estimated to have died at 116 (bearing in mind he did not die of natural causes and it is implied he could have lived quite a bit longer)? Or did you just come up with the number because 30 more than humans seems reasonable to you?

#+begin_quote
  For magicals let's move this down to 8%. Now let's look at the story for the number of students attending Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Again why? If anything thats likely misleading due to variations of war and peace in the world (specifically Voldemort in the UK). But the point remains, what is the basis for this?

#+begin_quote
  So, if 8% of the population is 280 that means the wizarding population is 3,500 Harry's first year of Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

This is a big one. To start with you make some assumptions about the size of the houses and years at hogwarts across 7 years time. While this is more based in facts than other assertions, it is still very much guesswork. But more importantly, you are assuming that the kids who attend Hogwarts make up the entirity of the UK's children between 11-18. This ignores some pretty big things like students who are homeschooled, or students who attend a different school (either within or outside the UK).

#+begin_quote
  Any thoughts or comments are appreciated.
#+end_quote

The rest of your post is simply guesswork on where magicals are located, population sizes, movements and the like as it relates to school totals and sizes.

The problem is that just like in the muggle world, that is NEVER a nice clean breakdown in terms of numbers. Some places might have 1 well known school, and hundreds of smaller local schools. Some places might have several major learning centers of magic and thats it. Some places might teach kids starting at 5, some at 15. Some places are more advanced than others within the magical world itself. Some places have significant numbers of wizards due to times of peace while others have significantly less due to times of war.

At the end of the day, what little we know about magical britain can NOT be used to view the rest of the magical world without severely skewing data and making too many massive assumptions.

--------------

so....

--------------

What we do know is clearly magicals must be taught. Your ending "thought" statement is probably the only thing that really needed to be mentioned. It is highly likely that while Hogwarts is the premier magical institution in Great Britain, its just one of many schools around the world that can claim such a status for their area. And it is HIGHLY likely that there are smaller schools at more local levels that may handle students who do not go to the larger schools, or perhaps start teaching students at different ages than some.

It seemed like there was a part about Ilvermorny though the 1,500 word short story we have is definitely not written in this style.

Rowling also hinted on twitter at some point that one of the unpublished parts concerned an Australian school.

My take on Rowling's is she is a good story teller and a horrible world builder.

The Harry Potter stories are alright so long as you don't try to make them part of a world. They fall apart at the seams when approached that way.

So while some things are cool such as Dementors along with Transfiguration and Charms, most of the world makes no sense.

Charms and Transfiguration are two of my most favorite things as they are so simple they approach elegance.

A Charm adds or takes away something and Transfiguration changes something.

Those two cover almost every aspect of magic by themselves. It's the little nuggets of gold that keep me reading FF and started me recently writing HP-FF.

Fair enough but nothing supports your 100 number either, so its arguably no better than Rowlings 135.

True but to my knowledge those are the "long-established" and "prestigious" schools. Those sources do mention other schools existing, just not under the heading of the ICW. It also mentions many countries not having their own school, which means populations of students are certainly going to vary based upon world locations. And of course, we have to bear in mind that just like migration and immigration (you yourself mention an exodus from Britain), some areas of the world may have up and coming schools that are yet to be well known but will become well-known and "prestigious" after time.

Oh and just to clarify, I dont actually disagree with your original post that those 11 are like the "Ivy-League" schools. Just figured discussion is discussion :p

***** Yeah my 100 is just a guess based on what is out there. This whole post is not my headcanon of the wizarding world, just an attempt to make sense of Rowling's sandbox.

The discussion has been fun and so far I have had to think of several things that I had not built in my headcanon Wizarding World framework.

What is awesome is my headcanon has always had the 11 as ICW sponsored schools similar to what you posted. Just makes the most sense.

I think they write Hogwarts as the best in the world not due to teachers or classes. Nope, it's simply because it has the single largest magical library in existence. At least that's my theory on it.

Tbf the source for that is a movie, and that doesn't mean Rowling decided that tho. Could've just been a random designer on set.

** I agree with your hypothesis - after all, Hogwarts is effectively a private boarding school. I don't know how the Weasleys managed to afford seven of those, but I feel like it's reasonable to assume that there are fairly standard day schools or some kids even getting tutored by their parents (it is a pre-industrial society, after all, one could assume that children grow up with the family trade from an early age).

*** The supplies for Hogwarts must have been near prohibitive for the Weasley family. The only reason I have came up with was simply because Rowling's is bad at math.

I've seen a few explanations for it, Dumbledore robs Harry to pay for them in manipulative Dumbledore fics, to The get assistance of some sort (from being a ministry employee to Dumbledore just being a good guy).

The trades is exactly where I am going with the fic I have planned out that started all this. Trade secrets pre-industrialization were a big deal.

Those few trade schools would all be prestigious places, requiring a sizable payment most likely. With magic in the mix possibly a magic contract protecting the trade spells from competitors.

**** I always assumed they were broke because of the number of kids they have. They've got over 1M paid towards school fees (assuming 20K per year + book fees) with Molly not really working.

They might be poor compared to the Malfoys or any other families with 1 or 2 kids but they aren't food stamps poor.

***** CoS they visit Gringotts and empty their vault. It has a few sickles and a single galleon. They poor as hell in canon, simply because Rowling's thinks 5 quid and some change is enough to shop for 4 kids back to school supplies.

5 GBP to the Galleon so his handful of sickles and single galleon is about $8 USD.

****** They've also paid close to 600K at that point, with about half of that over the past two years and I would assume probably a week before they went to the bank.

NGL my bank account would be pretty empty too if I had to pay out 300K in 3 years for tuition alone...

******* That makes no sense either though, but it all works out when you realize one important thing.

Rowling's was shit at math, basic economics and how a world works.

The only clue we have on it cost for Hogwarts is Rowling's Tweeted that the Ministry covers the full cost. That Tweet was 8 years after she released DH book.

I would bet serious money she had never given it any real thought before while writing the books.

Honestly though, headcanon it however you want. She was a good story teller, horrible world builder. I would take the entirety of what she says past the basics with a grain of salt.

** This is under the assumption that all the schools are boarding schools only. It is very much possible that other places don't have that system and are only day schools. Also population wise you would expect places with larger population like India and China to have a higher number of students.

It is also possible that children of the muggleborns are not going to Hogwarts making the class size smaller.

** Okay? I guess? I've honestly never given it much thought. Statistics bore me. I always assumed that the Wizarding world is much bigger and that canon only has a narrow focus on Harry and his friends so we only see a small part of it. So I've no problem imagining that there are 600 students in Hogwarts and more professors. Or assistants. Seriously- how much does a professor do- teach, grade papers, patrol at night and some are head of houses. It makes much more sense to have assistants for patroling, grading and maybe teaching the first two years. I've always imagined that there are more students and teachers and the books simply don't go in detail and list them by name.

Plus Harry never visits other big cities. So I've no trouble with Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow having magical communities and streets like Diagon Alley in London. Or in larger countries even whole wizarding villages. The UK is densely populated so it kind of makes sense to not have any fully magical villages and towns. But Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas are huge. I think it would be easier to find a scarcely populated area and build a magical village there.

*** True but a thousands of years ago redhead ancestor wouldn't really pay off significantly as that ancestor being magic would be.

There would be little drive spreading red hair across the land as they conquered and explored all creation with their red hair powers.

We know from the books and Rowling's ramblings that there were Native American wizards already. That means wizards have been around for a minimum of 15,000 years. At the absolute minimum it has been 15 millennia. Plenty of time for a relatively even distribution of wizards around the world.

So yes I would say wizards are a relatively evenly spread across the board. Some more just due to environment other less for a host of reasons as well, still all would likely follow a normal population distribution map.
