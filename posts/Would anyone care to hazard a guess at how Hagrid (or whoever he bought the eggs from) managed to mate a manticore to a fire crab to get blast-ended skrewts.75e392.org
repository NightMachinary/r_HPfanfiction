I was working on the year 4 storyline for my fic, and this question just popped into my head. I mean, the size difference! It'll be as difficult as mating a wizard to a giant, I'd imagine...

One way I can see this work is if somebody transfigured a fire crab into a manticore, and then encouraged it to approach a particularly desperate fellow manticore. Or maybe someone transfigured a manticore into a fire crab and left it to be ruthlessly violated by other fire crabs? Kind of like how Loki turned into a mare to birth Sleipnir...

Thoughts?


** New thought: if Pettigrew mated with other rats during his 12-year stint as a Scabbers, would there possibly be some very intelligent rat babies running around the Burrow? :o

*** White Squirrel adressed the issue in /The Accidental Animagus/, a story where (obviously) Harry is an Animagus. The long and short of it is, Draco tries to discredit Harry by having Mrs Norris's latest kittens marked with lightning bolt marks on their forehea, and McGonagall steps in to explain that "to Animagi's lasting shame several Animagi have tried over the course of history and the animal forms are sterile".

At any rate, I don't think Pettigrew was anywhere near this depraved.

** I always figured it was some sort of flesh-alchemy, mixing the seed/eggs/whatever of the species together, a little bit of magic and then unholy abominations are created.

**** Flesh-alchemy comes in many forms.

But the thought that a basilisk is the result of crossbreeding a toad and a chicken is most amusing.

** I would imagine there would be the magical equivalent to test tube reproduction for crossbreeding purposes. That could potentially explain some of the odder magical creature combinations. The trick would be getting a viable sample from each and marrying the two successfully, which might be beyond Hagrid's purview though I could see him being enthusiastic enough and curious enough to try anyway.

** The real problem here is not the size difference, I think. It's that /Manticores are a sentient species/. It'd be like trying to force someone to have sex with a lobster, it's absolutely preposterous and I refuse to believe even Hagrid himself wouldn't see the problem with this. So my theory is that there's some sort of magical ritual to create a viable hybrid of any two living beings.

** I imagine all these half-and-half magical creatures share some sort of magical "chimaera gene" that was introduced millennia ago which allows for all this unusual crossbreeding to work, while most other species would have to be bred with closely related species. To clarify, I think you could breed a manticore or chimaera with damn near anything, but if you wanted to breed a human with a dragon it wouldn't work (the human would just get eaten), however you could breed a human with a giant no-problem since they are both hominids. Though there could be some way to magically insert the "chimaera gene" to create new cross-species with those that don't have it, but I imagine this would be some fiendishly complicate life-alchemy type of magic.

** Maybe Hagrid threatened to breed with each of them if they didn't breed with eachother. Make some half half giant half manticores and half half giant half fire crabs. And then those can breed to make some half half half giant half manticore half half giant half fire crabs.
