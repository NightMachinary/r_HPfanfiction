This can be in any year up to 5th year but I would vary much appreciat if it was 4th year


** Search up spirithorse16 on AO3. He wrote a series of fics where Hogwarts students, teachers, and other people read the books in each one. They're currently doing Goblet of Fire now.

Edit: I'm pretty sure all of the narratives and dialogue from the books are included word for word, which makes it even better.

  Rita Skeeter's Harry James Potter: An Unnatural History is a best-seller, mostly due to the fact that Skeeter's collaborated with a photographer who's infused the pictures in the book with Harry's actual memories. As Harry struggles to survive the storm consuming his eighth year at Hogwarts, Draco Malfoy becomes an unexpected ally.
