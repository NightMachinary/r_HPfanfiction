Easy question first--I am looking for a way to make long FFN fics into epub files to read offline. I know the bot does it, but only for things linked here; it seems like it would be a pain for everyone to just come over here and link every long fic of interest to get the file. I used to make my own, but their inability to copy-paste has hampered that in recent years. If it makes a difference, the device in question runs Android and is a tablet, not a dedicated ereader or phone.

Now on to my real question. I'm looking for good, long Sirius-centric fics, or at least ones where he plays a major role. I've been continually active in fandom since 1999, so I've read most of the oft-recommended classics.

--Slash and gen are welcome, but I'm super hesitant about Sirius/female fics as most tend to be OCs (which I have little to no interest in) or one of the female characters about whom we have little info (Blackinnon is a pet peeve). Canon relationships are fine, of course, as well as relationships between developed characters. I am a Wolfstar shipper, but it's not mandatory--I think I've read most of them anyways.\\
--AUs are my bread and butter, and most of my all-time favourites fall into this category. linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin4) and linkao3(Cartographer's Craft) are standouts and excellent examples of what I'm looking for.\\
--Cliched, over-used tropes don't bother me. If I was unwilling to reread a theme that'd been done before, I wouldn't be reading anything anymore. There are even some tropes I am a total sucker for: time travel, pureblood society, rescuing Harry from the Dursleys. I await updates to linkao3(A Marauder's Plan) with bated breath.\\
--Did I mention I like long fics? 10-20k is a bare minimum for me, and 100k is still generally a single-sitting read. Complexity, world-building, and plot are crucial, and shorter fics (in my experience) just don't have enough time to really develop a concept and run with it.\\
--As for era, any is good! I am, however, a giant sucker for Sirius in Azkaban and/or dealing with the aftermath thereof. Fics in which he dies (other than as part of Bring Back Black trope) are not of interest, however.\\
--Any rating, any archive, as long as the site isn't dayglo orange text on neon green background. Good spelling and grammar go without saying, but the occasional typo is fine.

One last rec for you all, one of my all-time favourites that I don't believe I've ever seen recced here! linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina by Karmic Acumen) is superb, and not at all the cheesey parody the title would suggest. Also another great example of what I'm looking for in a fic.

Thank you all very much!

EDIT: Is the bot not working? Or did I do something really wrong with calling it?


** 1) Bot seems to be working fine. Sometimes, connection issues on either side (but usually Reddit's) leads to some replies not getting posted; call =ffnbot!refresh= if you need the bot to go over your comment again.

2) Bot works with PMs now. You can PM your requests to the bot.

3) I recommend using Calibre and FanFicFare together to download fics in bulk, instead of the bot.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** RE, the ereader stuff:

1)search the sub, and youll find a few other posts like it, at least one of which has a decent tutorial on how to use a program called "Calibre" to save epub files. If you have an ereader app on your tablet, it will work almost exactly like a "real" ereader

2) The ffnbot is supposed to work for pms now, so if you want you can pm yourself a call in order to get the epub download link.

** Your list of likes is very similar to mine. Do you have a rec list or favorites list somewhere?

Also, since you're open to slash, I know of 2 to try. Unfortunately, they are currently unfinished. However, they are from the 2015 NaNo challenge, so there's still a chance. They're both on a challenge site that requires signup to view.

[[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/?p=29401][Sometimes Goodbye Is a Second Chance]] by toasterpop Summary: Sirius Black had never really expected to survive to the end of the war. At most, Sirius had hoped to give his godson, Harry, what help, protection, and support he could for whatever time he had remaining. So getting killed by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn't that big of a surprise. What happened after Sirius fell through the Veil? Now that was a surprise...

[[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/?p=28932][Slytherin Black]] by Jilly James Summary: Since passing through the veil, Sirius has spent six years in limbo; because the veil is not death, not unless Death herself wills it. And for some reason, she didn't send Sirius on to the afterlife. So he waits and watches the living. For six years he watches and seethes over the injustices done to his godson. Then Death offers him a deal; he can travel back in time eighteen years and change the past, but in exchange, Sirius must promise that the Hallows will never be united under one master. He must ensure that there is never again a Master of Death. Sirius takes Death up on her offer and arrives back in 1984 determined to ensure that Harry has the life he was meant to have. He'll do whatever he has to in order to insure that the world is a better place for his godson. He tried the Gryffindor approach the first time around... this time, he's going to try it the Slytherin way.

*** Ooh, thanks for the recs, those look right up my alley! Also, another site that doesn't allow copy-paste? I wish site-owners would think more about accessibility when they do things like that, as it messes with my ability to adjust the text into a size and colour I can read :/

As for a rec/favourite list of my own, I used to, but sadly 90% of the stuff on it is no longer available on the internet as far as I can find. Of the ~150-200 fics that remain, what's listed in the post above is the cream of the crop. The rest are slash (which for some reason seems to be looked down upon here?), fics of mediocre quality that were trope namers or originators, and about a quarter of them the English translation of them is lost or never existed. I'm working on trying to track stuff down, and I'm making a new list!

That said, I've got a few pieces I especially like of more recent material:

linkffn(Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewellyn) is SUPER long, actively updated, and a massive, sprawling crossover that starts out HP/Marvel and just grows and grows and grows. I'm addicted, even though [[/spoiler][the author put Sirius on a bus and he's not come back yet, but Regulus is there]] and that's one of my favourite characters.

linkffn(Long Live the Queen by offsides) is another WIP I'm following with regular updates.

If you're interested in my slash (mostly Wolfstar) recs, let me know!

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

**** Well, that /particular/ site is a writing challenge site, not an archive, and those fics are considered to be rough drafts. So text selection and copying is deliberately disabled so the authors can control the distribution of "substandard/unfinished" works. Which is their right. (also, challenge site means those fics will be taken down in March to prep for the next round, so don't put off reading).

(Hint: that GrabMyBooks extension from my first post? Works here. Not the Android app, but the browser extension - I haven't tried the app. I have ebooks on my Kindle of both of those stories.)

On the bright side, the authors are pretty good about posting the links to the finished works on the Past Projects page. And many do get finished. And you can always check out the individual blogs from their profiles (Jilly has got some excellent crossovers in other fandoms). I have found the writers who participate there are pretty high quality.

Yes, I was careful to mention it's a challenge site, not an archive. She took the November challenge fics down on March 1, to prepare for the April challenge.
