Not a long question this time - what are the best fics that just cover what happened in canon with virtually no event divergence? They can add new things, or put different tones on things, but the major 'stations of canon' have to be hit.

Basically, what's the best Harry Potter series that's closest to canon, but that wasn't written by Rowling?

For the record, I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing to write. I'm just curious what ones are about that people have enjoyed or regard as 'the best of the bunch'.


** Stations of canon are shit on as far as most fics go here, so it will be interesting to see what suggestions come up.

It's on my mind from another thread so I'll suggest it here as well.

The Green Girl by Colubrina follows a Slytherin Hermione. Harry is a background character and he follows the stations of canon throughout the fic and up till about the Battle of Hogwarts.

*** Oh, agreed. But that's why I only asked for the good ones. :)

The Green Girl looks interesting, though Dramione is always a creepy pairing. Like pairing Anne Frank with Goebels (or however you actually spell that). Thanks for the rec! :)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] is probably my favorite canon rehash. Part of the reason I enjoy it is that the author mostly only includes the scenes that happen in-between the 'stations', so the story feels fun and new even if the plot doesn't diverge much at all from canon.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
