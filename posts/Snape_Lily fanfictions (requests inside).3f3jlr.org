I'm looking for some nice Snape/Lily fanfictions! They can include:

- Snape and Lily's childhood together (would REALLY like this)

- One-sided love/crush

- Past relationship/regrets

- One-shots or full stories

*Absolutely NO cheating though. Divorce is fine, but NO cheating/affairs whatsoever.*

Thanks!


** I really like [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=250668][Unwritten]], an AU where Lily survives and reluctantly goes into hiding with Snape: /Marked for death, Lily and Harry escape from Godric's Hollow with the aid of Dark magic. Sirius vows to find Harry and track down Severus Snape, his mother's alleged murderer. The prophecy has divided; destiny writes on a blank page./

I'm picky about Snape fics because I personally don't feel he's redeemed in canon and a lot of fics treat him like he is, but this fic goes earlier in the timeline and gets to write a different redemption arc so it avoids all that. Also, I unexpectedly adored Hagrid!

** I just posted this in another thread like ten seconds ago but ah well, here you go!

linkffn(a dream carved in stone) - my favorite Snape/Lily ever though it is AU

linkffn(the moment it began) - probably the best Snape gets to relive his life story out there and it's complete!

linkffn(second start)

linkffn(his greatest wish)

linkffn(come once again and love me)

linkffn(ananke) - tragically abandoned

linkffn(the apprentice by deborah peters) - also tragically abandoned

linkffn(obscura nox animae) - completely unique and awesome, ongoing

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

I never really liked it. The author had no idea who they were and just took their names and made a whole different character and relationship out of them.

  Dead. Severus Snape is dead. But now, he has the most important choice to make, and a green-eyed doe comes to guide him. This is my version of a "lost scene" from the end of Deathly Hallows; the Snape equivalent of the King's Cross chapter.
