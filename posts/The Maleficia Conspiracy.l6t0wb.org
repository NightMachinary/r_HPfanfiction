*/Something Luna and Xenophilius swear by with a grave tone. Mourning the loss of an entire discipline of magic.../*

Wizardry is now the most popular discipline of magic practiced worldwide, very simply because of a concentrated, international effort to discourage any other way of practicing magic.

The Maleficia Conspiracy allegedly began in Italy, where (just prior to the foundation of its Ministry) proponents of the precursor to modern wizardry began a campaign to oust the warlocks and witches of Europe. A campaign of violence and propaganda that sought to convert or kill anyone not casting magic with a stave or wand. Subsequent research believes it to have been sparked by years of pour sales for those particular foci, leading to a united effort to force the change.

On the founding of Ministries, governments quickly realised how much easier wizardry was to regulate, particularly because it required the use of a wand and texts/tuition. Unlike (for example) sorcery and the practices of warlocks, whose powers and abilities were not for the Ministry to control.

Fast forward to the modern age, sorcery has been successfully re-branded as "accidental magic", dismissed and forgotten as soon as a wand is introduced at 11. Warlocks teeter ever closer to extinction, sequestered in miniscule cults/communities and branded as Dark. Much of ancient witchcraft is a part of modern curriculum, which is monitored by governments to ensure students are not learning Dark/inappropriate magic (though the definition of such varies between countries).

But the growing popularity of a certain tabletop game looks to undo centuries of hardwork, by exposing hundreds of Muggleborn (and Muggle raised) students-to-be to many forms of magic all but lost to time.

** I'm currently writing a fic that includes magic different from what students are taught at Hogwarts. Some is magic forgotten to time, some is individual to different creatures or locations, stuff like that. It's fun. Thanks for requesting. I like reading these types of stories too.
