Is linkffn(faery heroes) the only fic that was completed for Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"? I've tried to look for others, and I've found a few incomplete, but none that made it to the end.

Please post any other well written complete stories.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will be followed through time. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"

**** This story looks abandoned like all the others that I've found. I dont think I've read this one, but I'm certainly not going to read 240k words of a story that's 3 years last updated.

** I remember a one-shot by Paladeus I think called It's Santa that was a response to his own challenge. It's in his Into the Rabbit Hole collection.
