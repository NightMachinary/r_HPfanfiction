** I mean, you can always read the canon and imagine Harry is secretly Sirius' son. I don't get how this is plot relevant.

*** Depends on the plot. First crossroad for a divergence would be the night of the attack. Instead of chasing Pettigrew, he looks for his son.

Or, James is killed and Sirius can bluff Voldemort during the night, letting Lily and Harry escape. Lily goes to live with Sirius and Harry grows up with his real father, which creates a deep rift in the Order which spawns its own problems. Plus, Voldemort isn't dead.

I say this again and again: Its fanfiction. Everything is reasonable.
