So, any discussion of cannon is invariably going to get very messy, so lets keep this general, yeah?

I was wondering last night how common Horcruxes might be. Voldy was famous for making so /many/, but the book was apparently just sitting in the Hogwarts library for... centuries, presumably. A fair number of other student must have at least read about it even if they didn't attempt it. It might even be a relatively large slice of the Slytherin population too; Horcruxes were invented by [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Herpo_the_Foul][Herpo the Foul]] who was also a famous Parselmouth, it doesn't seem like a stretch that the more historically inclined Slytherins would look him up and potentially find out about Horcruxes.

Now, Horcruxes are supposed to be essentially the blackest form of magic, literally the *most* evil thing you can do. This seems... kind of odd, since murder is pretty easy and common, so presumably it has more to do with the act of splitting the soul than the murder. Even then, a fair number of the Death Eaters seem like they would be 'evil' enough to consider it, Bellatrix for one, though I'm sure there are others. It is possible that they became more insane as a byproduct of serving Voldy, but that seems like sort of a flimsy defense. From a practical perspective, Voldy wouldn't want anyone else to be immortal to compete with him, but we're just considering them as a representative sample of the prevalence of 'dark wizards' in the population.

It seems like a big bad pops up about every century/half a century in HP, not necessarily in Britain specifically, but in Europe more generally. Compared to Muggles, this is about average; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuUW9i-mHs][we've had a big war or two about every century for a thousand years]]. Most of these Dark Lords or Ladies would likely be evil enough to think nothing of making a Horcrux, though likely only one since presumably the soul does /something/ important even if it isn't obvious what (and a *lot* of fanfic speculates about this). But beyond them, what about just dark families?

Can you honestly tell me that someone like the Malfoys or the Blacks wouldn't find it reasonable to make a Horcrux? Probably not very often, but these are the people more likely to find reference to it anyway; they aren't going to balk at murdering some random muggle if it means immortality (though the soul bit will likely give them pause of course). Given that some wizards can already live to stupendous ages with no one raising a fuss about it (see [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Armando_Dippet][Armando Dippet]], died age 355), they could likely just linger in the background of the family for centuries so long as they didn't put themselves into the public eye too often. If they were smart, which seems likely given their desire for immortality and their likely sorting to Slytherin, they can just whip up a new persona, deed everything to it, then fake their own death. No one need ever know that a member of the family is more than a thousand years old.

How common are Horcruxes among the general populace? How common is magical immortality or life extension in general? The Philosopher's Stone is a second method; there are likely to be more that are equally morally neutral.

I think you're misunderstanding and underestimating the wizarding aversion to splitting the soul.

#+begin_quote
  “Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.”

  ...

  “Merlin's beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .”
#+end_quote

The aversion is not wholly, and perhaps not even primarily, an aversion to the creation process involving murder. Rather, wizards find horcruxes so horrifying because they're an act of self-mutilation of the soul.

We don't know much about the soul in the context of HP, but if it's anything like the soul in traditional Western religion and philosophy then the soul will be the carrier of your essential being, your true self, which is not capable of being destroyed but rather will outlive the death of the body. To mutilate one's own soul would therefore be to a wizard as the idea of performing brain surgery on yourself would seem to a Muggle. You're fiddling around with your own character and nature, who you are as a person, and causing great damage to it. Not only that, but you could very well be destroying your chance at possessing eternal life as a disembodied soul in favour of clinging to mortal life.

I doubt many wizards would be willing to do such a thing, even Dark wizards.

You're taking this from a sample size of two, and even then, there seem to be some pretty significant differences between Grindelwald and Voldemort. Grindelwald was not "a Dark Lord", he was a Dark wizard. As far as we know he had no aims of immortality, and indeed his goals were largely political. Voldemort appears to have been the first Dark wizard in history who sought to become something more than just a powerful Dark wizard with political influence. Rather by inventing the title "Dark Lord" and by making the horcruxes he seems to be showing an intent to become an embodiment of dark powers, a kind of primal force of nature - a boogie monster. That's the reason why Dumbledore considers Voldemort to be the most powerful, most dangerous and darkest wizard to have lived. Grindelwald may have been "wizard Hitler" (or some such analogue) but Voldemort seems to have wanted to be "wizard Sauron".

**** I certainly prefer Grindelwald as a villain. I've always seen him as a more intellectual villain that Voldemort, who was unfortunately /shown/ to be completely crazy despite how much we were /told/ that he was intelligent. This ties in with my seeing Grindelwald as an essentially political force who happens to be a very talented wizard, as opposed to Voldemort, who is more of a pure magical threat.

That said, I do think that Voldemort would win against Grindelwald in a duel (or as you would prefer to call it, a fight), given that Voldemort had a slight edge over Dumbledore in OotP, and Dumbledore had a slight edge on Grindelwald in 1945.

***** I actually disagree with this. Dumbledore was over a hundred years old, and was way out of his prime when he dueled with Voldemort in OotP. That does not mention the fact that at the time he dueled with Voldemort, he was protecting Harry, with an animated statue. He was also not attempting to kill Voldemort.

We haven't seen the duel between Grindelwald and Dumbledore. For all we know, Dumbledore won via luck. The whole conversation where Dumbledore tells Harry he was slightly better with his wandwork, took place in Harry's head, and was not said by the living Dumbledore. He did not learn anything he couldn't have if he thought about it. He just needed "Dumbledore" to show him the way.

I think that in a fight, because it would be a fight not a duel, since Voldemort would not bow to Grindelwald as is a requirement for dueling, Grindelwald would fair much as Dumbledore did.

I know that the Elder Wand was supposed to be the most powerful wand in existance, but we know that isn't true. The elder wand not only has been beaten, but it was beaten by a teen who had less than ten years of magical education. It was beaten by hundreds of wizards and witches throughout history. The whole Elder Wand is superior nonsense is just that. Nonsense. The only amazing feat we have seen from the wand itself is the repair of Harry's Holly Feather wand. Sure Dumbledore dueled with it, but Dumbledore was also said to be one of the greatest wizards to live.

The whole power/danger scale is up to personal interpretation, and as such is bound to be a matter of contention.

#+end_quote

Is there any evidence of this? That wizards have a prime, and that Dumbledore was past his? I can't think of anything in canon to indicate as much. Slughorn was most definitely physically unfit but was also a formiddable duellist, being one of the three who confronted Voldemort himself in DH. And Dumbledore never seemed to be experiencing any handicap in his duel with Voldemort as a result of his age. Any time he needed to manoeuvre he apparated, as did Voldemort.

All signs in canon point towards high level duels being primarily cerebral exercises involving no significant amount of physicality.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think it's disingenuous to present this as something that hindered Dumbledore. He animated the statutes before the duel properly started. It's not like he kept having to abandon his focus on Voldemort to remedy some issue with Harry. He basically created protection for Harry and that was that.

#+begin_quote
  He was also not attempting to kill Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I don't see how this changes things at all. Whether or not Dumbledore was trying to kill or disable Voldemort, winning the duel involves the same state of affairs: getting through Voldemort's defences such that he can land a single decisive spell.

Ultimately, it comes down to this: Voldemort would have successfully killed Dumbledore in that duel had a third party (Fawkes) not intervened and taken a hit on Dumbledore's behalf. And that's Dumbledore /with/ the Elder Wand. As flawed as the Elder Wand is, surely it must impart some kind of advantage.

When you're older, your reflexes are slower, you tire quicker, you even think slower, you're sight decreases... Aside from this, even the more intellectual tasks are impacted by your physical condition. Not to say you're wrong, I actually agree with you for the most part, but to say that a duel doesn't require any amount of physicality, well maybe not directly, but it doesn't mean it doesn't play a part.

I heard somewhere that when Kasparov beat Karpov at the game of chess, Kasparov was in a much better shape, and that it played a huge part. Although it's difficult to find more intellectual than chess. And in chess, you don't actually put your life at stakes.

What I don't understand, though, is how someone that only led a few terrorist strikes in a relatively small geographic area (The British Islands) can be considered a bigger threat than someone who actually gathered an army and carried war over a whole continent at the minimum. I mean nobody's going to pretend that Ben Laden or al Baghdadi were more dangerous threats than Hitler...

I mean, Grindelwald seems Stalin-level threat, Voldemort, not so much...

Wildly speculative theory ahead that I was going to incorporate into TOHF:

There are a few indications in canon that temporal authority has magical weight. See this section from PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.

  "Let me see, let me see...." he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. "Reveal your secret!" he said, touching the wand to the parchment.

  Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.

  "Show yourself!" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.

  It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.

  "Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
#+end_quote

Snape seems to believe that including his position within Hogwarts school as part of his second spell will give it a greater chance of success. This implies that him being a Hogwarts professor gives him greater magical power (presumably within Hogwarts). Snape is generally someone who we can trust to know about magic.

Another example of this is how Dumbledore was able to fly through the no-fly spell over Hogwarts in HBP.

On top of this, the Ministry appears to possess a number of very powerful unique abilities. The Trace, for one. The Taboo is another. The ability to instantly collapse the substantial magical protections around The Burrow in DH, despite those protections having been enough to keep the Death Eaters out.

Speculative part: the Ministry is able to do those things because it has authority within Britain that boosts the magic used by its agents in its name, like Snape and Dumbledore did within Hogwarts. That authority stems from being the accepted magical ruler of Britain.

Voldemort sought to make himself essentially the dictator of magical Britain, and came very close to doing so. If his rule had endured for long enough, surely there would come a point where Voldemort was considered the accepted (however reluctantly) magical ruler of Britain. At that point it's possible that Voldemort would absorb the Ministry's magical authority and as such become an almost godlike immortal entity, at least so long as he was within Britain.

That's a pretty terrifying prospect compared to Grindelwald's ambitions, which were ultimately about promoting the welfare and power of the wizarding community at the expense of the Muggle one. Grindelwald did not really pose a threat to most wizards - only those who opposed his ideals.

[[/spoiler][Immediately afterwards, the knights around the second princess received a large amount of power from Curtana. They received the power from Curtana Second. Elizard must have sent out some sort of order. However, that was not enough to explain it. Curtana's effects were supposed to only work within the borders of the United Kingdom. “Surely you know that I was planning to head out to Europe in order to destroy all opposing forces if I had succeeded in my coup d'etat using Curtana Original.”]]

Yes. Although the intent seems to have a bigger role in the casting of a spell, whereas knowledge, emotions, intuition or familiarity with the spell seem to affect the power of the spell. And there also seem to be a threshold of knowledge underneath which you cannot cast your spell. Also, a strong enough emotion allows one to use magic ignoring the usual requirements but without control.

I like the fact that magic seems full of weird quirks and exceptions. As a result, it feels almost alive like it should.

Killing Curse simply "kills".

Fidelius Charm protects "secret", and the Secret Keeper can only divulge of his "free will".

"Love" is a powerful force that is studied and can protect from powerful magic.

The sword of Gryffindor is made to appear to does who are brave, this is the intent in (of?) the spell. Being brave has a certain meaning (it probably is what the caster thought being brave is).

The caster wants a spell to do something and so the spell does it. Thus, intent. I mean, it's still an idea, but a very specific kind of idea. You don't cast a spell by simply having an idea, you actually have to want something to happen.

Ok, "killing" you can explain in terms of "stopping bodily functions" or whatever. But "secret"? The intent behind a spell is to "protect the secret", but this mean that it works on the "secret", which is not an objective physical fact, but an idea. And so is "free will".

But I will try to find more decoupled from intent examples. In transfiguration it is easier to transfigure things with similar names. The intent of the spell is the same, what changes is the language connection, which again is not a tangible, physical thing, but a system that exist within human minds.

The matter of authority from which the discussion sprang upon. Neither authority nor country are directly physical ideas, they exist in the world of ideas. The use of the authority to support magic doesn't change its intent, yet it's supposed to change the effect.

*************** The intent is to protect a secret. It is enough that the person casting the spell knows what a secret is. The spell works because the caster wants to protect a secret. Whether a secret is tangible or not is irrelevant. The spell basically makes it so your intent becomes reality. That your intent is about physical stuff or ideas has nothing to do with it. Once again, you don't cast spells using a simple idea, you cast it using an intent, you want the spell to do something and it does.

If spells were cast using ideas, you would imagine something and it would become true. It obviously doesn't work like that.

However I would /still/ say that dark wizards of the kind to catch the public eye must be pretty common, otherwise how could Slytherin house get a reputation for producing them? The Malfoys in a Voldy vacuum would still be a 'dark family' but no one would actually /call/ Lucius a 'dark wizard' since he isn't blowing up orphanages or whatever. There has to be a pretty big crop of people openly practicing dark magic, even if they aren't necessarily leading insurrections against the government.

Heck, Aurors are explicitly said to be 'dark wizard catchers' which is a /different job/ from the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement][MLEP]], something more like a constable. If you need an entire branch of Law enforcement devoted just to catching dangerous practitioners of the dark arts, it has to be relatively common.

**** I'm not entirely certain about this, but it is possible that the Slytherin House reputation only became really prominent after the rise of Lord Voldemort. There's no real mention that I can recall of their reputation for producing Dark wizards prior to Voldemort. Maybe for being a House where pro-pureblood sentiment was more openly displayed or more common, but being pro-pureblood may not have equated to being a Dark wizard as it seems to have had in the Harry Potter years. Their reputation may only have been earned in the years of the war, due to both the fact that people would likely see a large proportion of Slytherin recruits amongst Death Eaters/Voldemort supporters, and especially the fact that Voldemort is a known Parseltongue and the Heir of Slytherin.

And certainly the existence of Aurors implies a prevalence of Dark arts practitioners, but also the nature of the Dark arts makes it so that it's necessary. The Dark arts, as far as I know, are typically magic that is aimed at causing harm, pain, and murdering its victims. Dark magic is very specifically to cause harm, but it's also so vague and varied that it becomes necessary to form Aurors in order to control it. Hence, I think you're overestimating the prevalence of known dark wizards. The formation of Aurors may indicate instead the variety of the Dark arts or the fear wizards and witches hold toward the Dark arts, rather than a high quantity of known dark wizards.

***** I can understand that argument, but compare it to the ATF in america. Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are all *legal*, they just need extra regulation because of the capacity to cause harm.

*This is not that.*

The Dark Arts are (in cannon) literally all about inflicting violence on your fellow man in horrific and inventive ways. This would be like if we had an /entire branch of the police/ dedicated to orphanage arson and rape. That isn't 'something that happens and is legal but needs more oversight'; that's something which is /already a crime/ but apparently is /such/ a large concern that it needs an entire division of law officers to monitor it.

It /could/ be that it gets that much attention due to the high profile nature of the incidents, but it seems more /likely/ that it is a concern because of frequency rather than intensity.

My personal theory is that 'Dark magic' was though of more as 'traditional magic' a century or two ago; something out of fashion and not very popular in the main stream, but which still /happened/ and people were more or less okay with it. Calling /all/ spells which can harm another person 'dark' seems dumb, because then Lily Potter's protective shield (which was a, lethal and b, requiring of human sacrifice) would be like some absolute pitch black shit. It seems plausible that with the wars with Grindelwald and Voldy, and a bit of meddling from Dumbles, it was gradually made more and more unacceptable to perform Dark magic. Dark magic likely includes other sorts of spells that are somewhat grisly, such as blood based magics, but which aren't necessarily 'evil', thusly; a division of police to regulate it, not because it was 'super duper bad' but rather because, like with the ATF, this is dangerous and needs oversight /but is legal in general/. Overtime, it has become less and less acceptable until we get to the modern day where anything more than a dim grey will get you sent to Azkaban (in theory).

Erm, just a note, it wasn't really any effect of /hers/. What happened to Tom back then was backlash of his own magic that struck him because he gave mercy and then took it back once Lily struck a deal (her life for her son's) with him. This is why it's called “old” magic: it's not about whatever shield or other rubbish but about making a deal with intent and magic to back it up and then breaking that deal.

I do like the notion of dark magic being something different than simply curses and stuff, but if you want to get into actually picking it apart then you shouldn't slip on something like this one as this one is very much not a good example for dark or light anything.

****** But are the Dark arts about inflicting violence in horrific and inventive ways? In canon, we see that, but we're also only offered a small glimpse into the world of Dark magic. We see everything through the eyes of Harry, who clearly does not study Dark magic, and who only experiences the Dark arts when it is being inflicted on him by Death Eaters, or when Harry used the Sectumsempra curse. This is a very limited sample of Dark arts, and there is potentially a whole lot more that may not be geared towards causing harm in the most painful way possible.

Snape's speech about the Dark Arts in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Arts are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.
#+end_quote

Snape very clearly outlines the ever-changing nature of the Dark Arts. It's hard to fight because it's so varied, always changing and always developing. The danger of the Dark Arts, as implied by Snape, lies in its variation, its ability to adapt and persevere.

Hence, I don't think you likening the Dark Arts to murder and arson is very accurate. Murder and arson are two very specific crimes, far more specific than what it seems the Dark Arts are. I think, weirdly enough, the closest thing that I can relate the Dark Arts to is the Internet. The Internet is something almost everyone has access to, just like how wizards all have access to a wand. But the Internet is mostly harmless unless you choose to use it for harm--cyber bullying, hacking, advertising negative and hateful messages on forum boards, etc. The potential harm the Internet could cause is many and varied, from causing a cyber-bullied person to fall into depression to hacking government databases and releasing massive amounts of sensitive information, which is why there's a cyber division in the police these days. It's a bit of a strange leap, but I think describes the danger of the Dark Arts more accurately in a way.

Perhaps frequency plays its role, as well. But I don't think frequency is the major factor in the formation of the Auror corps.

**** To be fair, though, being a dark /wizard/ might not necessarily mean being a bad guy. Do note that quite some of the stuff used in Defence Against Dark Arts is really dark magic taught to be used defensively. Likewise, the Malfoys are sometimes said to be a “dark” family despite the fact that people actually believed Lucius about being under the Imperius rather than willfully following Tom, Thus, it is possible that there are some qualifiers for being a “dark” wizard or witch and we simply do not know what they are, and while I do not doubt that a “dark” wizard or witch probably is not the nicest a person, I think it is not tantamount with being evil.

  Horcruxes are supposed to be essentially the blackest form of magic, literally the most evil thing you can do.

Let's say creating a horcrux were no more punishable than the murder involved in its creation. Then it would be sensible for me to murder someone to create a horcrux, go to Azkaban if I'm caught, commit suicide on the first day, and get resurrected. I've got an escape method at my fingertips. And if you can create a horcrux from killing a Muggle, well, that's barely even a crime, is it? So a person could then escape any punishment for real crimes just by dying.

By making it /evil/, you potentially turn the rest of society against anyone willing to make a horcrux, which reduces the likelihood that that escape will succeed. Azkaban or living forever as a bodiless wraith, turning less and less human as time goes on -- they're both sufficient punishment.

I'm not sure how you would convince random people to treat it as evil, though.

Otherwise making seven doesn't make much sense, except for redundancy, and then why stop at 7? Of course it is possible that they /do/ make one resistant to common forms of death, like dragon hide makes you resistant to spells, but the AK is just powerful enough to slice through that since reflected AKs are what killed Voldy twice.

** I think we need to take into account how massive the Hogwarts Library is, and that the term "Dark family" is a political statement.

I believe in the first or second book, the Hogwarts Library is stated to be one of if not the largest library of magic in Europe. if it is magical, I would bet harry's trust vault that it is mentioned in that library, in some way.

Also, the whole "Dark family" thing needs to be taken with a grain of salt. So far we have only seen the Wizarding World through the eyes of Harry Potter, who is definitely bias towards the "light". Every "Dark family" is considered an enemy of Harry Potter in the series. The only one that is a stretch for is the Blacks and that can be explained by them being labeled "dark" by Sirius who loathed his family. Dark families seem to be a political thing. Nothing more or less. they dislike muggles and muggleborn and are conservative.

The reason I think we dont see alot of Horcruxes is because the process of splitting the soul is most likely extremely complex. Not only that, but upon splitting you must bind it to an object. Then you must figure out where you are putting the object. Also, it should be noted that there are doubtless wizards who created a horcrux, and then decided to carry it with them, and after death, their bodies were destroyed, and the artifacts possibly destroyed as well. We dont know what happens to the wraith of a wizard or which after their horcrux is destroyed.

I think horcruxes are those niche pieces of magic. I also don't think that Wizards or Witches view mortality like standard humans. They went to school in a place that had ghosts, and were undoubtably told all their lives about how so and so lived to be over a century. For them, I bet time does not seem to be a factor. Voldemort was unique in that he was an orphan, during one of the most death filled times of human history, and had a phobia of being alone and forgotten, most likely due to the passing of his mother.

In the same way that having your soul sucked out by a Dementor is the worst "ultimate" punishment anyone can have, a Horcrux is the worst of the worst Dark magic, something that you'd have to be half-mad to even entertain the idea let alone actually do it.

Why? Well, to make one, you're shattering your immortal soul for a prolonged mortal life despite living in a world where the afterlife is /proven to exist/.

#+begin_quote
  Unless there's something else?
#+end_quote

Well, there's canon.

The afterlife isn't usually explicitly mentioned in so specific a term, but its existence can be inferred from evidence in the books, like, as you mentioned, the Resurrection Stone and Harry talking with Dumbledore after the latter is dead. First, a quote from /Deathly Hallows/ when the Stone is used:

#+begin_quote
  "They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile."
#+end_quote

So the people summoned by the Stone seem to be more "there" than ghosts do. Interesting. Maybe there's something to that. A difference of some kind.

In /Order of the Phoenix/, Harry asks Nearly Headless Nick about the afterlife and if Sirius will come back as a ghost, which leads to him saying:

#+begin_quote
  "He will not come back," repeated Nick. "He will have ... gone on."
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  "I was afraid of death," said Nick softly. "I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact, /I/ am neither here nor there ...."
#+end_quote

So Sirius has "gone on" while Nick, as a ghost, is "neither here nor there."

The Veil is further proof of an afterlife -- both Harry and Luna heard voices emanating from the other side (and Luna implies that she heard her mother later in the same chapter of /OOTP/).

As far as the soul goes and what it means -- it is the essence of a person and what "goes on" to the afterlife. Nick, again, same book, same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod," said Nick miserably.
#+end_quote

But what exactly is the soul? Remus Lupin knows what a soul is and what it means when a Dementor takes it, from /POA/:

#+begin_quote
  "You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."
#+end_quote

And, lastly, in /DH/, Harry in the "limbo" of the imaginary train station, is given a choice to either stay (in the world) or "go on."

So, from what evidence there is in the text, a soul is the essence of a person and when a person dies they "go on" to somewhere else. A ghost is a pale imitation of the person who once lived. The dead can be summoned via the Stone, personalities -- essence -- intact, aware, but not of the flesh.

From all that, it's reasonable to conclude that the soul is something that exists beyond the body, something that is, for lack of a better term "immortal," and it is the soul that departs for the unnamed beyond.

***** That's pretty weak evidence for an afterlife actually. Even if we take it as evidence of an afterlife, the ultimate question becomes 'is it better than here?' and no one seems to be arguing in favor of that.

Nick says he could have chosen to 'move on', but to what? Nothingness would be somewhere other than 'here', after all. Also, if ghosts are an 'imprint' of the living wizard, that does not require the existence of a soul. Only magic.

That the veil produces a sound superficially similar to human voices is /definitely/ not in favor of an afterlife; it sounds more like a sort of dark compulsion deal to me.

Ghost seem to be similar to humans, but apparently only form from magic/in high magic areas. They aren't really evidence in favor of an afterlife on a surface level, just complex soul/mind magic.

The Resurrection stone has not been /tested/. It /appears/ to bring back a dead loved on... *as a memory*. Your quote has Harry comparing them to the Riddle memory; that seems like a mark against the 'realness' of the wraiths, and if they aren't real then they aren't being called from an afterlife. The Deathly Hallows in general sound more like lures made by Death to kill the users than something which would actually be a challenge to Death's authority.

Lastly, the limbo state in DH is again, not necessarily an intermediate stage before an afterlife, it could just as easily be a hallucination or bizarre side effect of magic.

All in all, we have a fair bit of /weak/ evidence in favor of the soul and afterlife, /but/ nothing to indicate the afterlife is 'good', only /different/ or that making a single horcrux completely excludes one from it. The soul fragment appeared to be insufficient for the task, but an only slightly damaged soul might be able to make the transition.

That's not just weak evidence -- that's /no/ evidence.

No matter how "circumstantial," what facts can be gleaned from canon point, at least for me, in one direction. Wizards do not appear, generally, to doubt the existence of a soul or its departure to wherever souls go. Dumbledore states that making a Horcrux, separating a "body and soul," goes against one of the Fundamental Laws of Magic. By that, it appears that souls are not physical but they /are/ real.

It seems to be general knowledge that souls can be destroyed (Dementors). It's less commonly known that souls can be mutilated (Horcruxes). If a soul can disappear or be altered, it has to exist in the first place. The body dies but something "goes on," and that something is likely the soul.

JKR left enough wiggle room for other interpretations, yes, but the various things in the text as a whole (along with the heavy-handed Christian themes and parallels of the last book) render the idea of an afterlife in the /Harry Potter/ 'verse plausible to me. And I'm not religious in the least.

It makes sense to me that Horcruxes would be considered the darkest of the Dark Arts purely because making one sullies what should be the most important thing a person has -- their very being.
