I'm wondering what were some of everyone's favourite opening lines to fanfics they've read?

What was it that caught your attention and helped you read the fic? Keep reading a fic, despite any flaws?

Or, what first line completely turned you off the fic you thought sounded good?

(Okay, I'm kind of asking because despite not updating my own stories in god knows how long, I've been bitten by a plot bunny and I'm wondering if there are trends to what people like and what catches their interest - slightly scientific curiosity here and shameless, /hmm, can I use this format??/)


** It's not exactly just a single line and it's from a Harry Potter story of any kind, but I quite like this one:

#+begin_quote
  It was a dark and stormy night.

  Well, no, it wasn't. It was certainly stormy, for slashing rain whipped across the wind-tossed countryside, and the sky was covered from horizon to horizon in clouds the colour of lead. And it was most definitely dark, save for the moments when the entire world was cast into bleak contrast by calamitous crashes of blinding lightning. But it was still mid afternoon, and somewhere above the thick clouds the sun was high and bright, as marked by the patch of sky which was merely iron-coloured, rather than lead.

  Hence, it was a dark and stormy mid-afternoon, which is a phrase with far less poetic cachet and precedence than its nocturnal cousin. Still, two out of three isn't bad. It's sixty-six point six recurring percent. It's a solid pass.

In case anyone is wondering, it's the intro for “Overlady”, a crossover between “ゼロの使い魔/Familiar of Zero” and “Overlord”, the former a light novel (and I guess a series of comics and TV series) and the latter a video game. It's not a perfect story, but there are moments when it's quite hilarious.

  Overlord

Actually, I think this one is a cross between Familiar of Zero and a completely unrelated game series of the same name.

**** Actually actually, it's a crossover with specifically the first game in the series, which is why I wrote that it is a video game rather than a whole series.

Your comment did make me aware that there is another game with the same title, but as that other game seems to be of a completely different genre and I presume it is decidedly less known than a fairly popular game released many years later that did well enough to get sequels, I do not think it easy to mistake which one I meant.

***** I thought you were referring to this Overlord: [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/29803/Overlord]] , because I misread when you wrote 'light novel'

** Can't recall any opening lines off the top of my head, but I did write a pretty good hook in an unpublished non-HP fic.

"Alicia was singing along to the radio when the avalanche hit her car."
