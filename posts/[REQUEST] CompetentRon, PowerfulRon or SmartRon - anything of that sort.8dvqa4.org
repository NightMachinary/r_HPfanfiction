It would be great if the characters are competent but not over powered.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

** Ron tends to be competent and a hero in most of my stories, even in those where he doesn't start out like that.

He is one of the two main characters in "The Dark Lord Never Died", where he is infiltrating a Britain ruled by Lucius Malfoy as Dumbledore's spy.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Harry Potter: The Last Avatar has Ron as fairly powerful, but also pretty arrogant. It is a crossover with Avatar The Last Airbender so if you don't like that then ignore this one. I think that, even if you've never seen the show you'd enjoy it, one of my favorite fanfics. Fair warning though, it is incomplete and unfortunately I doubt it will ever be updated.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.
