- What stories are you currently developing?

- How is your writing progressing?

- Need some quick feedback on a story you've written? Post a link and get some advice.

- Are you in need of a beta/willing to beta someone else's story?

- Have other writing-related thoughts? Post away!


** I'm curious if other authors write every day and if so, then how much? Do you have a set amount that you like to write every day? Do you take days off or not?

I can edit around 1500 words or write around 800 words per day. I used to think this was quite a bit, then read that professional authors typically write [[http://boostblogtraffic.com/stephen-king/][much faster]].

*** I think getting into a daily writing habit is good discipline when you start out; word count is overrated, though. Finding inspiration, reading, and editing all contribute to improving writing, too. After the initial learning curve, I don't think it's important to write every day. I probably write on average 500 words a day on a productive day; very slow but it's an exhausting process for me.

I do need some time to "ramp up" to get into a writing mindset, especially getting into the minds of the characters I'm writing. I'm sure if I had the time to write every day, I wouldn't need it so much.

*** I mostly write on the weekends, because I'm knackered after work and have no head for it. Also, it's only fair to bear in mind that many professional writers have 1) much more free time to devote to their work and 2) financial incentive.

The nature of fic writing (for pleasure) affects how I write. For those scenes I'm excited about, I leap in and scribble and spin phrases and stick with them until they're 95% polished, because the spark is there and the sheer zest of it is inspiring. But that often leaves the connecting scenes piling up unwritten. They're important to the story's coherence but tend to feel like drudgework because they're mostly carpentry, or they might feature a character I'm not thrilled about. Those can take forever.

I actually do believe in trying to write 1000 words per day - it really shouldn't be that much to ask - but so far I haven't managed it.

** I'm currently working on a HP/Sherlock crossover that explores the possible science behind magic. I became interested in this idea when I thought of how funny it would be to see Sherlock trying to rationalize the weird and unexplainable. Which of course lead me to using Luna as my other main character! :)

I'm personally a pretty slow writer and I have to continuously go back and rework scenes until I'm satisfied. Even then, I constantly fret over "Will people like it?", "Is it funny?", "Can I do it better?". That's why I'll never be able to be a professional writer haha! Too much anxiety.

I wrote my first draft of this story over a year ago, but I had way too many ideas that I tried using all at once. So I dropped it and eventually came back to it around a month ago when some inspiration hit me. My first chapter is now done and the second is nearing completion as well, with several more outlined. If anyone would like to give feedback on it, I would absolutely love second/third/etc opinions!

*** I really like it.

Your writing style would be overly verbose in a standard HP fic, but since you've crossed over with the Sherlock fandom, the expanded vocabulary makes sense. I'm not 100% sold on the idea of [[/spoiler][Sherlock seeing Luna simply by engaging in a 'contest of acuity,']] but I suppose you have to introduce your main characters /somehow/.

I think you've managed to capture the essence of the main characters in Sherlock quite well, but it's been ages since I've seen the show (haven't had time to watch The Abominable Bride). We're limited to physical descriptions of the only HP character so far, but you've done justice to Luna. So long as you don't make her an omniscient seer who foreshadows your entire plot, I'd be happy to keep reading it.

I actually agree with this. The issue I ran into is that, to use scientific jargon, I have to spend more time than I would like explaining individual words/ideas. Mostly because I'm afraid those things are not common knowledge (and not usually found in most HP fanfics). Also, Sherlock is a smart cookie. His vocabulary needs to reflect that whereas John's will be limited to mostly medical terms.

** I've recently finished the first chapter of my HP/Witcher crossover, and working on the second. It's currently only a two-parter, centring around Harry and Ron (as witchers, in the Witcher world) taking a contract in a port town outside Cintra some 210-220 years before the Witcher books and games, but I've an idea to throw in a chapter with a sorceress Hermione in Oxenfurt. If you're a fan of HP or The Witcher, and this sort of thing interests you, the fic can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804414/1/The-Lesser-Kindness][here]]. Feel free to trash me if it sucks.

As for OP's question about daily writing, I'm a terrible flake when it comes to writing: I might go a fortnight without writing a word, even though I have the story beats planned out, and then I might type out 4000 words in two nights. I wouldn't worry too much about your pace, however; it's better to take your time and write something good rather than speed through writing and make something mediocre. Sure, many professional authors can hit well over 800 words a day, but there also just as many who spend weeks agonising over a single sentence or two.

** I'm writing smut. Snape/Harry smut, to be precise. It was supposed to be quick and fun, a piece of distraction written for a friend. Now it's 15 pages long and still not finished, and I'm cross with it. It was supposed to be the quintessential hobby fic - dash it off in a few hours and think no more about it - but my brain automatically latches onto anything with words, so now it's deep into nitpicking and revising. Sod it. I was hoping it would help me shake off my - well, it's not a block, exactly. My writer's limp.

I often include explicit scenes in my fic, but I've never tried my hand (ahem) at plotless porn before. Let me tell you, the vocabulary issues are a challenge. I'll redact more specific ruminations to spare any delicate sensibilities.

Meanwhile, my WiP languishes while I ponder the implications, policies, and procedures of the magical prison I'm trying to create. I may have overloaded the setting with ideas of equal and sufficient potential to split into two separate fics. Or maybe I'm just being a chicken who doesn't want to wrangle the plot complications. I can imagine readers thinking, "The idea's promising, and the story's all very well, but it would have been so much better if you'd done /that/ instead."

The Bloodmoon Rises is nearly at a halt. You know the feeling when you facepalm about the decisions you made in earlier chapters and now have to deal with them? That is whats happening right now with that fic. Its just not a lot of fun to write the next two chapters, so it takes me forever to get them done.

The Salem Settlement on the other side feels good to write. Here the big update delays comes from having 15.000+ words chapters.

Yes, for The Salem Settlement.

Also, I realized that I write a good 1000 more words per writing session with Scrivener. I used Open Office before, but for some reason I don't get into as much of a writing flow there. With Scrivener I hack out words like its nothing. Maybe its because you actually have to press a button to go out of Writing Mode. One more obstacle to procrastination.

Absolutely. One of my betas is a geologist and recently told me that a setting I had pictured 'wasn't geologically possible.' After thinking about the problem, I decided to scrap ~4500 words and came up with something that works much better. Another beta told me that several of my character interactions lacked emotional context, so I had to re-imagine several dialogues over three or four chapters.

I can't imagine how I'd deal with these problem if I had already started publishing. Do you already have a plan of action for how to deal with the earlier decisions?

** I have a couple stories on the go. My current baby is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11755402/1/Snakes-and-Ladders][Snakes and Ladders]], which is going to be a 13 (or possibly 14) chapter story following 12 Slytherins (8 canon and 4 OC) from July 1997 to May 1998. I loosely modeled it after the TV series Skins where the chapter is character-centric and the last is meant to capture everyone at the BOH.

I just have one more scene for chapter 3 to go. It's a bit different than I usually write, because I've got most of it planned out scene by scene for each chapter. Although there's a couple of character arcs that I'm torn between two ideas.

I'm almost done with part 1 of my 3-part fic. Currently starting the climax of this part, and I have the next part pretty much laid out already. I just need to write it.

I do need a beta. I don't know how to find one, and I'm thinking of scouring SIYE for one, as that's my favourite community within HP fanfiction. If anyone is willing to beta a pretty dark H/G fic, please contact me!

I was in a very hard struggle of staying true to the characters. Harry can be a bit tough at times, since you kind of 'become' him when you read the book. But at the same time, he's not like me at all. So I had to rewrite a lot of scenes so that Harry isn't massively OC.

Now that I'm more sure of myself, writing has become a lot more fun. I really enjoy it, and can't imagine my life without writing every day anymore. I started writing last summer. Strange how fast that goes.

Like, I deliberately wrote her as a flawed character, but any time a reviewer points out one of her flaws I just want to yell "back off!" at them. It's ridiculous. I WANT people to see that she's not perfect, so why am I getting so offended?

*** OCs are so fun and freeing :)

Maybe it's the way people are pointing it out? I love writing flawed characters, but sometimes reviewers point it out like it's a bad thing or as if you didn't notice that they're coming off that way. Then there's some that assume because I write a certain flaw that I condone it and I feel my defences go up. It just really annoys me when I'm write characters that are meant to be sexist or prejudiced and I get some big lecture in a review.

**** Yeah it might be. One particularly hurt because she said the OC should be in a differentry job, as if there was no room for her to grow and develop. I suppose it felt as though they were saying that to me, or as if I hadn't noticed that she's initially hopeless.
