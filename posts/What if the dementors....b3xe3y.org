So I was reading an HP fanfiction based during 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' when I started thinking. What if the dementors had gone after Harry on the train because he was near Sirius after he had left his aunt and uncle's house? I mean, think about it? Harry was the only person, on that train, to have seen/felt the presence of Sirius Black after his escape, so maybe the dementors had sensed that and gone after him because they thought he knew where Sirius was?


** My Headcanon is: or Harry was a Buffet compared to the other students or they were attracted to Wormtail because both him and Sirius were Animagus, and probably had similar feel

Their mere existence violates any of these. Especially since they cannot restrain themselves as became evident in PoA. Any rational government would try to purge or at least neutralise them.

**** A mere existence can't violate them. If there is a human who causes everyone to feel like they were being tortured by just looking at them, then they aren't doing anything wrong by existing. To be more realistic, if the scent of humans were lethal to an alien species, then we aren't at fault. It's just an inescapable fact of our existence.

If the Dementors took measures to ensure they don't harm anyone through intent or negligence, then there isn't really any reason to discriminate against them. This is assuming they are intelligent though which is likely as I seem to recall negotiations with them in canon. Anyone who refused to eat food cooked by a benevolent Dementors is in the same category as refusing to let their kids work near Lupin. Or refusing to let a black person eat in the same restaurant as them. It doesn't matter if they are an alien, a robot, or an exceptionally smart chimpanzee that we modified to have human intelligence.

They all deserve at least human rights if they are "intelligent" enough. I'm already horrified at the acts we're doing to our ape cousins. They aren't on the same level as us, but they are leagues higher than the animals we tend to shove them in the same category as. To see something like that happen to something like a dementor...

All living things deserve rights. The more "intelligent" or "aware" (A hazy concept, I'll admit) the more deserving of rights. Bacteria don't qualify as intelligent and have no rights. Animals do and they get some rights. Humans get rights too. If Dementors existed, then I would certainly be in favor of giving them rights. Even if 80% of Dementors were insane and killed people, we don't punish an entire population for the crimes of some. I'm not a vegan even if it sounds like it with the notion of animal rights. Them having some rights doesn't mean they are on the same level, or a higher level, as humans.

Write to your local senator about Dementor rights today! Together we can assure justice is given to these people.

(I'll count this as my daily rant.)

It would be infinitely better to glass the entire planet than allow a single soul to be destroyed.

It is infinitely better to allow a million guilty people to go free than it is to punish an innocent person. If I see a hundred people and I know that one of them, I don't know who, wasn't a rapist, then the moral action is to let them all go. That's why legal systems function by innocent until proven guilty.

Also, do note that we're not talking about sapients going to jail or not, or being murdered or not, or raped or not. We're talking about eternal souls being destroyed. In comparison to that, the combined offense of every crime that has ever occurred on earth is absolutely trivial.

***** They are either feral beasts incapable of restraint and therefore ought to be put down like any such animal or choose to disregard their instructions not to attack CHILDREN and therefore violent attackers who ought to be hunted down like any group of beings who does so, like ISIS.

****** If they are feral beasts, then they are clearly not human, or above, and deserving of those rights. If their very nature is to attack while still being intelligent, then we still don't have the moral authority to kill them. Whether or not we should put morality aside to ensure our survival is a different issue where I fall on the side of we can defend ourselves if needed. If some of their species is unable to control themselves while others can, then we restrict the rights of those who cannot control themselves. If they aren't feral, then I've made comments about that scenario, but to summarize, they deserve civil/human rights.

If they are indeed feral, then they obviously don't get any more civil rights than we give tigers. If they are truly a threat to humanity in such a feral state, then I wouldn't be very opposed to putting them down.

As for them attacking humans, I don't think we know enough to make any statements. We don't know if every Dementor feeds on humans for example. We can't punish an entire population for the crimes of the minority.

I am also against the killing of any sapient life. I think the people in ISIS should just he kept in prison and/or be given the therapy they need to be fully functioning humans. I would even say that Hitler was human and deserves the same considerations. He was human and therefore had the right to live. Death is the absolute last case scenario, and if Hitler surrendered to some court, then the moral action is to imprison him. Unfortunately, Hitler decided to take matters into his own hands - which I support. The right to live also brings the right to choose to no longer live.

******* What would have been the point of capturing Hitler alive if he would have been hanged a year later regardless? And that's disregarding the possibility that the Soviets would have shot him then and there.

Also, the morality is very clear cut to me. You deliberately take a life, you forfeit your own (excluding things like self defence or legitimate acts of war).

Lastly, we know that dementors attack humans. Be it at the Quidditch pitch, Harry at the end of PoA, Durley or later when they are unleashed by Voldemort. That makes them a blight to be purged, nothing more.

******** I say capture because I thought it was clear that I oppose the killing of any human life as anything other than a last resort. If Hitler was captured, then he wouldn't be killed if I had it my way. Hitler may have had power, but a few iron bars in a secure preferably secret location is more than sufficient to remove him from the equation.

Anyone who sees morality as clear cut is very naive. All human life has value even the very worst person. An eye for an eye will make the world blind. There are situations where life must be taken, but that should always be plan Z. If Plan A successfully stops the threat, then we shouldn't jump straight to an even more severe and unnecessary action. People who murder aren't suddenly incapable of recovery. Justice should indeed be dealt, but there are other ways to do so.

We know /some/ dementors murder just as we know some humans murder as well. Are all humans a blight to be purged because some commit evil a thing? Are you judging an entire population for the acts of a minority? If so, then all humans are guilty of rape and murder because a minority of humans do those things.

Oh my gods, they would rule the world.

Like imagine, if one dementor is annoying the other, they just pull out their wands and think of their happiest memory of when they sucked the life out of someone and use a patronus. Or if someone tries to repel them with a patronus, they stun them.

OH MY GOD!! THEY STUN THEM!!

** Seems possible, but we just don't know anything about how they sense people. They were expected to be able to hunt down Sirius. I mean, Umbridge sent two after Harry. How did they find him? Did she give them his address?

Harry has a second soul tied to him. It's just a piece, yes, but that piece is somehow connected to all the others. Not to mention that this is probably the very first time that any Dementor has ever sensed such a thing - I imagine that it would be very enticing.

Harry has a lot more misery in his past than most students. Canon says they eat happiness (which I think was a mistake and if that's the case then being driven off by concentrated deliciousness seems weird - no, they should eat misery and hate joy), but maybe it's tastier to take it from someone who has a lot of unhappiness or something.

Remus was also in that compartment. So this compartment not only has the unusually unhappy double-soul kid, but an unusually unhappy adult as well.

As in they were not an element of the setting. Askaban was protected by wizards and spells, magical security and criminal capture is handled likewise.

At the start of year 3 the Hogwarts express is stopped somewhere in the Scottish highlands. The door to Harry's compartment swings open to reveal... A grumpy Mad Eye Moody one year from retirement and his apprentice Tonks searching the train for an escaped convict.
