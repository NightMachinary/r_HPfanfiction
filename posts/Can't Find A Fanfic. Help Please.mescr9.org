:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So there's this fanfic I read a while ago and I can't seem to find it. I've tried adding keywords into google but I still can't find it. The fanfic was a wbwl fanfic where James and Lily live but Lily is neglectful of Harry and James doesn't like that. They divorced and James got custody of Harry but lost practically everything else. Turns out the Potters are rightful heirs of the Slytherin line and since it isn't public knowledge Lily couldn't get the castle and vaults. James and Harry move there and you get some minor events before they prepare to go to Hogwarts. On the Diagon trip they run into Severus Snape who finds out what happened and is disgusted with Lily but requests to spend the day with Harry and James. That's everything I remember other than it was a smaller fic maybe a couple chapters or at least when I read it. If anyone knows what fic it is I would be forever grateful!
