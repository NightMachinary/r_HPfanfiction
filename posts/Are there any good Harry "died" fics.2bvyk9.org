Where people think he died but harry surprises them by being alive or something like that


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late]] is one that I rather enjoyed. The basic plot is that instead of his spirit reurning to his body right away when Voldemort kills him, he comes back after everyone is sure he's dead, and decides to let them think he is for several years so he can live in peace.

*** I read this one yesterday after seeing your suggestion. I think it is pretty good. My only complaint is that it is unfinished and hasn't been updated since 2012. :-(

*** The plot is that Hermione becomes the heroine of the story and she is so much better than Harry ever was and oh my god why didn't everyone see it earlier.

Been a while since I read it, I think it was pretty good.
