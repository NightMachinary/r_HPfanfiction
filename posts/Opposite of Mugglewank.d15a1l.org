Fics that involve wizards being able to do most things better than muggles. For example, in mugglewank stories I've seen Harry kill Voldemort with a gun, and I want the type of story in which a gun would be obsolete against him.

** Shit, only thread I could find by searching is a graveyard:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cpvue3/request_fics_where_mugglewank_and_martial_arts/]]

The only actual fic I see there is linkffn(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) which is great but that element is basically a one-off joke.

EDIT: Actually this thread might do better, since that one was derailed into one of the funniest threads in the history of this subreddit.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

*** In linkao3(The Arithmancer) Voldemort has specific measures against muggle tech but as far as I remember that's either something specific to him because he's a half-blood or a specific countermeasure to things Hermione has revealed might have made him vulnerable beforehand, not something wizarding culture has generally solved.

** Unless wizards and witches have Flash level reaction time, guns are always going to be effective against them. Sniper rifles will be even more so, since they can't know a threat is going to hit them in half a second from like, a hundred miles away somewhere. They're as human as anyone else, and thus susceptible to pieces of metal flying at them at over a thousand miles per hour. They couldn't blink in the time a bullet could blast their face apart, let alone lift their arm and make wand motions with their hand in time. Sorry, but unless they get prep time, or shield charmed clothing like Fred and George made, then they're going to be taken out by bullets quite handily in any one on one, surprise scenario.

*** 1. The scenario is unlikely to arise in the first place as the Muggle first has to find the wizard, and most wizards do not spend much time in the Muggle world.

2. You're comparing apples to oranges. The comparison is not the time it takes to cast a spell vs. the speed of a bullet. It's the time it takes to cast a spell vs the time to raise the gun, aim, fire, and /then/ the speed of the bullet. Given that wizards can cast spells at the speed of a single thought, my money is on the spell being faster than the gun.

3. Unless this is literally the first action in a wizard vs Muggle conflict, wizards are likely to very quickly adopt persistent protective measures before they venture out into the Muggle world.

4. I'm not convinced a bullet to the head would necessarily kill a wizard - not instantly, at least. Harry survives a metal cannonball hitting his head at likely 100mph+ in HBP. That would squash a Muggle head like a melon.

*** Rowling has said spells move at the speed of light, thus faster than a bullet.

That being said, if someone was unaware of a wand or gun pointed at them from a few feet.. It would be nearly impossible to block. However, if it's from several meters away, it's likely the bullet/spell would miss, and once the wizard is aware, they have the advantage.

**** That plainly isn't true, death of the author applies here. You cannot have the Protego charm if spells move as fast as light.

***** I just had the odd thought of a Protego shield that retroactively blocks spells. Like, you cast it, and it reaches a couple of seconds into the past to protect you, making it so that any spells that hit you actually didn't.

*** The wizards have spells for making things unbreakable. I am pretty sure that Hermione used it on the jar in which she placed Skeeter. It would thus be trivial for them to make superb armour; and that's without coming up with new spells.

*** Yeah, but between invisibility, the ability to make muggles avoid a certain zone, mind-reading (or veritaserum, same effect), polyjuice or metamorphism, and effing MINDCONTROL, it's not really even a contest imo. To say nothing of the potential op-ness of transfiguration (nuclear reactions anyone? or perhaps instant mustard gas?) Or curses, like the one on the DADA position, although the last isn't strictly cannon.
