So in it Harry was like middle aged (I think, he at least had like some white hair) and accidentally went back in time bc he's an Unspeakable, then he got it "legalized" in the Bermuda Triangle and became the DADA teacher for GoF after taking out Crouch Jr in the Great Hall or smth like that.

I think the description had like "time travel without the angst" or something in it???

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
