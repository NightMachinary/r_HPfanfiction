*** I used this reason in a fanfic of my own. Reasoned that if there were canon rituals that needed "bones" of a father, then there were probably a lot of even sicker rituals that needed body parts/blood from one's own CHILD. Only the most depraved dark wizard/witch would have a kid just to use as a ritual sacrifice or a tool. Voldemort fits that bill; so in my story he had sex with Bellatrix just to get a kid to do the ritual and get more powerful.

Which leads to Snape stealing the baby away and giving her to Harry, and there you go - a Harry raises baby Delphi fic. Under the assumed name of Daisy, with a neat cover story in place that Harry got with some witch in the past school year.

  Harry Potter, recent vanquisher of the Dark Lord and potions apprentice to one Severus Snape, is absolutely certain he is going to have a peaceful year learning the secrets of the most elegant magical art. The mysterious baby girl Snape declared his daughter after the Battle of Hogwarts can't possibly cause any trouble, surely? She's a baby. Babies are easy.

******** Lol sorry. After reading it though, i have to say this fic has some plot problems. Why does Dumbledore leave Delphi with Harry instead of an actual adult with the capability of caring for a baby? Like Weasleys for example.

Also why would Petunia want another "freak" in her home when she was an inch close to throw Harry out summer before fifth year?

********* Dumbledore explained it in his letter? Anyone in the house gets auto protected from Voldemort, behind the strongest enchantments ever, so if you snatch a baby from him what better place to stash it? And Dumbledore might have had other reasons for putting her with Harry the Horcrux too he didn't tell him about.

Petunia DOESN'T want another one, and she wasn't the one inches from throwing him out in fifth year, that was VERNON. SHE actually told him Harry had to stay. She knows better by now than to try to go against it, so yeah, she decided she has no choice but to help keep Delphi there. Not that it mattered because Harry took it into his own hands to leave. And personally I think not even Petunia would be heartless and cruel enough to just kick a baby out like that. She DID still take Harry in after all.

Anyway, look, it's a fanfic, I don't really care how solid the reasoning is, it's just to get the plot going... xD Have a little suspension of disbelief if it's not doing it for you. I thought it was solid ENOUGH, at least, to get the ball going.

********** I wasnt trying to be too critical of the fanfic. I think it is a good story. I was pointing towards certain things i tought to be inconsistent so you can improve it on the later chapters. Maybe Dumbledeore wanted to give Delphi to a safe family but they refused her because she was from Voldemort and Harry was the last safe resort? Also a short look into Petunias thought process when Harry said Delphini was his would be good too i think("Never have i heard such a blatant lie..." Petunia tought at the ridiculous decleration.)

Also Harry should resent Dumbledore more i think. Maybe he starts resenting Delphini too at some point only to realise how close he came to acting like his aunt. That would be some good character development.

Harry already isn't having a great time with Delphi, and I think I did put a bit in there about that. But yeah I guess it could go further until he realizes it?

************ Well you must keep in mind Harry is a 16 year old young man saddled by a baby withouth anyone asking him despite barely being able to take care of himself. A baby that belongs to the man that murdered his parents and woman that murdered his godfather. He shouldnt think rationally. He should be angry.

I like the story as it is and hope you write more of it. It has a lot of potential. Also while Harry needs to be angry, it shouldnt be the main focus of the story. Maybe make him talk about it when he meets with Hermione and Ron, break a few things in his anger even but Main conflict shouldnt be on Harrys emotional issues, it should be on the war at hand.

Furthermore, Maybe Delphini is the power he knows not? Voldemort might try to use Delphini to take Harry down, only for it to blow up on his face as Delphini chooses Harry over him? If you want story to take a more tragic turn, you can make Voldemort kill Delphini and add a few chapters about the backlash of it over the trio.

And canon Harry just isn't going to hold Delphi's parentage against her. I just don't see it. So I wrote him not. He's an incredibly empathetic person, you know? He spent his whole life being treated like shit for who his parents were, by his aunt and uncle, so he's just not gonna turn around and do that to her. I mean the guy feels bad for Snape during his worst memory, and he even feels sorry for Voldemort for how shitty his mom was in the pensieve memories. It's just not his nature.

I don't think he would want the danger of possible attachment, sire a possible rival who would perhaps one day want to overthrow him, nor does he need a heir if he is "immortal". Why put another parselmouth/descendant of Slytherin out there if it destroys his "uniqueness". I don't even think he would sire a child for ritualistic purposes as I think it's more likely he would search for an alternative first.

If you need a reason you can use any of these but I don't think canon!Voldemort would ever have a child, not to speak of the fact that his resurrected body might not even be able to produce one. It's one of the main reasons I dislike Cursed child after the "improved fucking timeturners" Time travel doesn't work that way! I've read fanfic with more believable plot damnit. But I digress.

If you write a believeable story thoigh no one would question you.

** A lot of very bad people did, and do, have children and heirs. Arguably, the most logical purpose for having a child, natural or adopted, is to further propagate your specific individual value system. Because individuals whom you yourself nurture from infancy are most likely to do things the way you do. So if you're Voldemort, or any other despotic tyrant badguy or literally anyone you can think of who has the long-termist motives* of founding a New World Order, there's no reason /not/ to want children, and every reason /to/. It's probabilistically the best way to expand you influence posthumously.

If he's immortal, it's more cannon fodder; if he's not then it's insurance. Win-win.

Yeah a lot of people in HPFF have clued in on the pureblood baby farms, I hate to bring up this comparison but look up /Lebensborn/. Though actually many regimes all over the world have gotten the idea, especially in good ol Africa; the "production time" of child soldiers is about half of everywhere else.

A point in favour of making baby Death Eaters of Voldemort's lineage is that they might inherit some of his exceptional magical talent. True or not, we can't really say (there are examples for and against), but at least /he/ believes it.

/If/ he were to produce children I think he would settle on one heir on which he would focus.

** I've been writing an AU where Voldemort has a wanted (more accurately: intended) child. He meets a semi-human creature called a doppelgänger that should he have sex with, creates a genetic replica of him. The doppelgänger can split his soul and place half in the boy once he's born. When Voldemort dies or is killed, he would then assume his son's body. The doppelgänger can take the son's soul out and carry it again, starting the cycle anew. Voldemort isn't immortal per se, but it's a buffer to death. Of course Everything Goes Wrong™ or else there'd be no story, but that's the gist of it.

** Huh never really thought about it before but considering Voldemorts body is formed from Harry's Blood and Pettigrews Flesh does that mean Delphini is technically either Harry's biological Niece or Grandaughter depending on how you view it?

Wonder if that was why Voldemort had her, to ensure he has a successful claim for the Potter Vaults once he killed off Harry (Black Vaults too if Sirius left it all to Harry) after all his body may disputed due to being artificial but Delphini would be essentially pure in that regard

Or he saw how powerful Lilys protection was and wanted a devoted family member to protect him in the same way, who better then a devoted daughter raided from birth to be devoted to you & your cause who would willingly sacrifice themselves to save you

We saw how powerful a mother son bond was, why would a father daughter one be any weaker? Plus it has a symmetry to Harrys situation that may appeal to him

** I'd only believe Voldemort to have had a child if it happened like straight out of hogwarts or something like that (how unfortunate if the first time he had sex a lassie ended up pregnant with his kid. But it happens)

But after is resurrection? Definitely not.

He doesn't even have a nose so I refuse to believe he has a fully functioning penis.

Admittedly....... the thought of him having to use fertility clinics sounds horrific (for them) and hilarious

** Maybe out of boredom. If he won and took over the magical world then he might try having a child to create a potential rival in the future. After all there were much easier ways he could have taken over the magical world, but I think he did it the way he did for the fun of it. So, if Voldemort were to get everything he wanted then he might want a potential rival in the future and the only thing he believes could challenge him is something he created.
