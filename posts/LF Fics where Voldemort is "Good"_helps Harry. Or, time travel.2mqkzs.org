So I'm looking for a new fic to read...

Not saying Voldemort should be good as in never killing people or things like that, but stories where Voldemort either has a goal that he thinks is justified (instead of just killing muggles for fun) or helps Harry in some way (I've read some stories where the Horcrux in Harry becomes self aware and decides to help him that I really liked, for instance). Preferably one where he doesn't die at the end... :(

I also really like time travel fics set during Harry's school years (as opposed to marauder years)

** Here are some time travel fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/Ground-Hog-Day][Groundhog Day]] Harry lives the same day over and over again. This is sort of time travel-y.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4778694/1/To-End-in-Serenity][To End in Serenity]]. Dimension travel and time travel. Who says the war was over? Voldemort created one more Horcrux and sent it back in time and Harry, Ron and Hermione, the Golden Trio, travel back to destroy it, doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HPOFC, RWHG, RLNT, SBPC. COMPLETE

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4165301/1/Time-Mr-Potter][Time, Mr. Potter?]] Five years after Voldemort's victory over the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is a man on the run. But what happens when he is thrown into his twelve-year old body in a freak accident? Non-DH compliant. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5396819/1/Time-Warp][Time Warp]] Harry Potter wakes up one morning in the body of his ten-year-old self. This time around, he declares, no way anyone's going to die! -And it's gonna be totally awesome- "People shouldn't meddle with time, Potter." Little did they know...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3693052/1/Back-Again-Harry][Back Again, Harry?]] Harry makes a different choice in King's Cross and is given the double edged gift of a second chance. Time Travel AU, DH canon. WIP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future's Past]] The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/Three-s-The-Charm][Three's the Charm]] Time Travel fic. It's the end of the Battle of Hogwarts but the price has been high. The Golden Trio dearly wished that they could have done more to save lives and fate decides to grant their llow the Golden Trio as they redo their years at Hogwarts, starting from First year and work to make a difference in the wizarding ease sign to stop SOPA petition on my profile.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7215035/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Veil][Harry Potter and the Veil]] Something went very wrong that Dumbledore never planned for. After only a year of peace, Voldemort came back to power. Now, eleven bloody years later, Harry Potter makes a critical choice that lands him in a position that he could only have dreamed of: to do it over once again, and make it right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets: First]] Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

Here are a couple fics where Voldemort helps out Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512582/1/Keep-Your-Enemies-Closer][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] What if Voldemort knew that Harry is a Horcrux? The capture of Hogwarts marks the beginning of the Dark Lord's reign. Harry is in for a rough year, with sinister summer school, torture instead of lines and a new understanding of Dark Marks. A horrible truth looms close, one he'll wish he never found out... Dark AU, NO SLASH and NO focus on pairings. Kind of what you're looking for, I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9392346/1/My-Friend-Tom][My Friend Tom]] When Voldemort gave Harry that scar he gave him two other things; a part of his soul and a friend. The last remnant of Tom Riddle's humanity mentors Harry.

Hope you find something you like!

** I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running][Hit the ground running]] which is one of the Horcrux in Harry's head starts talking to him type fics. Its a good read. I really like a lot of the internal dialogue, particularly when one of Voldemorts plans goes wrong and he and Harry are forced to flee the scene.

**** well yeah... it's sort of a part 1 of X in a series for which it lacks a series...

It covers all of year 1, and has /some/ closure, which is better than abrupt ends on a mid scene cliffhanger. But I would very much like to see what happens going forward. The ending did leave me rather WTF!?
