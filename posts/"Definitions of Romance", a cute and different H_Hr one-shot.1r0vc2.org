** Description from the site:

/Everyone said they were the least romantic couple in the world. A love story: HarryHermione./

Remembered reading this ages ago and decided to share. I thought it was pretty good. This sort of a relationship seems to suit Harry and Hermione better than poetic declarations of undying love and such.

*** Thank you for sharing that. What a great little one-shot. I'm actually completely jealous of their relationship - I'm certainly not one to appreciate frivolousness for appearance's sake and can completely understand where both Harry and Hermione are coming from.

*** Thanks for the rec! Relationships are often so inscrutable to those outside them; fun to see that explored for HHr.
