:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, Harry, alone and hurting at Privet (again probably post 5th year after Sirius dies), ends up with Kreacher finding him and removing him from the Dursleys unseen. Kreacher then educates him in the ways of the pureblood wizard. Possibly a faked death and new identity. There's a story called "Kreacher Comforts" by slytherinsal that's similar to the one I'm thinking of, but with less detail than I recall.

Honestly, that may be the one I'm thinking of and I just misremember the details. But I figured if a 2nd such story exists, someone here might be able to help. TIA!
