The bigger the dragon, the better. LOTR crossovers are cool too. Most crossovers would be cool, really, but none where the crossover is with an anime/manga world or anything like that.


** Would be funny if he became a dragon only to discover that his species of dragon only grows about an inch per year.

*** I've written this. It was one of my first stories. It featured a Harry that ended up in the founder's era. So the idea was that he'd start off as a dragon whelp back then, and by the time the timeline rolled back to present, he would be a massive dragon

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called â€˜The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

** Esama has a few good dragon Harry stories, assuming you haven't read them already. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3717275][Chapter 15 of Tumbling HP Crossovers]] is a short, but good LOTR crossover where Harry ends up in Middle Earth stuck in his dragon animagus form. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765][Alone Together]], a Temeraire crossover, but I haven't read very far into it because I'm not that familiar with Temeraire. But pretty much everything Esama has wrote is great to me, so that's probably pretty good too.
