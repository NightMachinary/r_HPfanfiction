They are on Life 17. They have been reborn into the MCU after dying in a plane crash.

They meet at a diner of all places.

They bump into each other outside of the diner and thats a start of a beautiful friendship, according to Hermione's parents and Ron's family.

"Still no parents." says Harry. Somehow he had managed to become an orphan for the 17th time now. "At least I live at an Orphanage."

"Didn't we decide that Orphanages are evil in our 8th life?" asked Ron.

If anyone had heard him say that he would have thought the kids were just playing pretend, even though they were technically too old for that.

"Well, technically, it wasn't evil. The problem was the person we had to share a room with." said Hermione, staring at the big, expensive looking Stark Tower. "Tom Riddle doesn't exactly make a good roomate."

"So, what do we do now? There is no way we will manage to stay out of trouble in this Universe. Stark Tower, the Avengers Tower, is right there. And we attract trouble like a magnet." said Harry.

"It's not us mate, it's just you." said Ron, his mouth finally full with delicious pancakes he came here for.

"Ronald, stop speaking with your mouth full. It's rude! Honestly, you'd think you had learned something after living for so long." said Hermione fondly, even though she was glaring at Ron.

Harry grinned. He was happy his friends were in this situation with him. There was no way he wouldn't have gone insane if he were alone.

/// I would have written this myself but i already have a lot of other fics to finish and there is also homework to do. This has been in my head for a week now and it wouldn't leave me alone until i had written it down somewhere.


** "Okay, what the everloving Fuck is this?" Harry's arm flung out with the last word, an exploding hex flying from his fingertips to detonate a new form of Inferi. "They're faster than normal, and seem to infect everything!"

"I don't know, Harry," Ron said while ducking under a leaping dog inferius. "There's that S.T.A.R. Auror group with the muggle firelegs."

"/FIREARMS/!" Hermione complained loudly. "/Christ/, you can't ever get the words right! What are you, five?" She levitated the undead dog, then flung it over the edge of the roof of the building. "Harry! This Life Sucks! I want a Refund!"

Harry blew over his fingers, unleashing a large gout of Fiendfyre. "Gimme a minute!"

"Holy Shit!" one of the adult civilians they picked up shouted at the sight of the fire. It was the woman who had amnesia. "Is this Normal?"

*"Fuck! No!"* the trio chorused, spellfire flying every which way.

"You know, this place is oddly peaceful." Harry commented.\\
It was true; the three of them had reincarnated, scattered, in what Hermione would call a 'high fantasy' world. Swords, sorcery, dragons and dungeons. Yet, their lives to date here had been...normal.\\
"Tell me about it," Hermione sighed, "There was this war a little bit ago, a Roland Ironfist fought against his evil brother Archibald for the throne and won...but despite being /called/ Ironfist, as far as I can tell he's a noble king."\\
"I looked into that too," Ron picked up after Hermione, "Apparently this Archibald was petrified after his defeat, so unless someone turns him back to normal there's nothing on that end. I checked the Dark Guild up in White Cap, too, bit chilly up there."\\
Harry leaned forward, "And?"\\
Ron shook his head, "Nothing. They teach some /really/ destructive magic there, and they /call/ themselves evil, but as far as I can tell they're less malicious than the official thieves guild."\\
Harry looked a little downcast, "Well, darn. I guess that means we have no idea what's coming, then."

There was a pause, then Hermione coughed, "So, what have you been doing? I've been in Mist, I've been learning magic from the Marquis Albert Newton."\\
"Cool," Harry grinned, "I'm an orphan, again, somehow, but I was adopted by some hunter guy halfway between Bootleg Bay and Free Haven. He's been teaching me to use a bow, but I still prefer spells."\\
"Lucky you, Harry. My family are travelling merchants this time," Ron answered, before adding, "My dad this time is a bit of a historian, actually, he's got an obsession with some ancient civilization from long ago, who he thinks had future technology."\\
The sides of Hermione's lips turned up, "What, like, the steam engine?"\\
Ron shook his head, "Nah, future future stuff. Like, space travel and robots. Like with that Alderaan place we ended up once."\\
The three fell silent; /that/ life had ended abruptly with an earth-shattering kaboom, for reasons they had never quite figured out.

After a minute's silence thinking about their past lives, Harry cleared his throat, "So, the rival for the throne is out, none of the lords under Roland are plotting a rebellion, the dragons are staying put in the desert, the Dark Guild and Thieves Guild and Whatever Guilds are behaving...what other mess could this world possibly be facing?"\\
Hermione raised a hand like a student in class, "There might be one thing; my studies with Lord Newton include scrying-assisted astronomy, and a few days ago we saw some kind of meteor headed our way...it's a small one, so it should break up in the atmosphere, but..."\\
Ron shook his head, "I don't think that'll be anything to worry about, unless the meteor's actually an alien spaceship and they're invading us. And what are the chances of that?"\\
"Maybe ask the Seer on that one?" Harry suggested.\\
Hermione tilted her head, "You mean the one near Castle Ironfist?"\\
Ron frowned slightly, "I...don't /think/ he actually sees the future? Just an awful lot of the present? Still, maybe it's worth a shot..."

**** Harry blinked as he stared down at his self. He was so sure that he was a baby just five seconds ago. All of the sudden, a flash of multi-colored stars surrounded his body. When the stars were gone, he was now in his eleven year old body.

He looked at his parents, who were sitting at the dining table. Harry blinked and rubbed his eyes. He's got parents. They looked nothing like James and Lily, but... wow. Parents. But for some reason, none of them even noticed that the baby they had placed on the floor was now an eleven year old walking around in front of them.

He was about to talk to them when suddenly, his mother starts waving her hand in the air while screaming to the ceiling, "Oooh dabee dooh! Ooh saga dah!"

He glanced at his father and noticed a strange, yellow gem floating above his father's head. Out of curiosity, Harry tried to reach it, but before he could get to his father, his father got up from his chair and started doing the I-need-to-pee-dance. Then he started waving in the air again and shouting gibberish. Not only that, a red thought bubble appeared on top of his father's head with the symbol of a toilet bowl on it. And then his father peed. On the floor.

/Ooookay,/ Harry thought. Apparently, his parents were insane in this life. He'd just, erm... take a walk. Yeah. That's what he'd do. Without so much as a backward glance, Harry slinked out the door and walked outside, but before he could even get two steps out the door, something made him walk back inside.

Okay, that was weird. Harry decided to try again. He walked out the door... and stopped. That was when he noticed. A green gem was floating on top of his head. Then, before he could stop himself, he started walking back inside. Strangely enough, he now had a strange urge to play on the computer.

Five eternities later, which was probably only five minutes, but felt like hours to Harry, he was finally done with the computer. He decided to head out the door again. This time, the green gem was gone and there was nothing stopping him from going out.

He walked a few blocks down and entered a public park filled with people. As he walked past the gates, he saw two very familiar figures playing chess by the fountain.

Harry grinned. He waved to them. When they spotted him, they abandoned their game. They stood up, waved to him, and walked over to where he stood.

Hermione opened her mouth and said, "Yargbo bay tazzle."

Ron started chortling like crazy.

Hermione glared at him, then said angrily, "Ugh! Chee waga choochoo! Ugh!"

**** Harry woke up in a new world. That in itself was not too unusual, but the fact that Ron and Hermione were absent was. In fact, he was quite sure he was entirely alone - he was standing on a square platform made of stone, barely five feet across. Noticing that stone floor was not, in fact, very comfortable, he got up.

Emptiness. His platform was the only piece of land he could see, inexplicably levitating over a great white expanse. Occasionally, a cloud would appear and pass hundreds of feet below. Noticing a squat wooden chest sitting in a corner of the Platform, he opened the container, curious about its contents...

"Ow..." Harry rubbed his head staring at a small book that had just shot out of the chest and bounced off his head. It was somewhat reminiscent of the tomes in Hogwarts library in that is smelled of age, worn letter and dried out ink. On the cover, the title was engraved "Skyblock and You: How not to die horribly". Harry shrugged and started reading.

***** Harry woke up in a bed, for a change. It was his fiftieth day on the Skyblock, as the book called it, and the platform had grown quite a bit. While Harry was still hesitant to take the author's advice and " just punch" stone to collect the resource, the descriptions of physics were spot on, and Harry managed to automate his cobblestone generator using a few levitation and animation charms.

With building material in abundance and space greatly expanded through his efforts, he had actually build a house - while neither rain nor any other weather phenomena were present at that height, warmth was also lacking. Fortunately, bonfires didn't spread fire around and didn't need any extra fuel. Nor did torches.

Not that it would have been a problem, he admitted to himself as he went on his daily inspection of his holdings. The Evergrowing Forest was an early investment of his, providing lumber by tonnes despite being grown from the few saplings contained in the Chest. The "Spawners" were interesting too - were Hermone there she would probably complain about the Gamp law of Transfiguration and how fod couldn't be conjured. Harry was just happy to have a steady supply of farm animals to start a proper farm with - the Spawners were obviously magical and worked in a way he didn't understand, obviously he was not going to rely on them.

Yes, Harry admitted to himself as he turned back towards his house, where, in the depths of his furnance, lunch awaited. It had been hard work to get it all up and running, but oh, so satisfying!

****** The Villagers were annoying. Harry had first encountered them when he decided to create a cobblestone pathway northwards and see where it would go - he was quite bored, then, and while eternally grateful for not being dropped into this world as a child, being a pubescent teenager had left him with unbalanced hormones, variable attention span and way too much energy.

After placing a few thousand blocks - because stone apparently liked being stuck as three feet cubes - of cobblestone, he encountered a village, and the first sentient (somewhat) being that didn't immediately try to kill him, other than himself. Actually, scratch that part.

"WHAT!?" Harry screeched. "ONE emerald for four dozen blocks of wheat!?"\\
"Mumblemumble" responded the Villager with a smug smirk.\\
"No, I spent all day carrying those! I refuse!"\\
"Mumble-mumble!" warbled the Villager. Iron Golem standing behind it rumbled threateningly.\\
"Allright, one emerald it is."

Harry valiantly ran away accompanied by amused warbles of the big-nosed thieves.

The very next night he took the Book's advice regarding villagers.\\
He snuck into the village during the night under influence of Invisibility Potion (he missed his cloak, but the potion worked well enough - and he'd brewed it perfectly. Snape would be spinning in his grave. Hey, now that's an idea..!). He raised stone walls everywhere, cutting the village into chunks, obstrucking space and turning it into a maze only he could traverse unhindered.

When the Villagers woke up, he opened the dam and sent a wave after wave of water into the passages. Within moments all villagers were washed away into custom built containment chambers, away from their golems that were instead pushed into deep pits. The containment spaces were arranged thus, that any golems summoned since would fall into the pits without the need for Harry to supervise - a good thing since Iron was quite resistant to magic, and useful for construction - with villagers supplying a steady flow of iron golems, the Lava Forges were officialy in business, and Harry himself, rich.

The best part was that no matter how much the big-nosed obstructionists hated him, they loved trading more and could conjure a truly wondrous array of items from thin air - and without the golems to apply pressure, Harry could get some very reasonable prices.

*** "so.... Ran into any mortally challenged lately?" Ron asked as he sit in front of his friend. Gladly seeing his friends survive the demons.

"I still think that is a stupid name. A demon is a demon either way." Harry commented. He continued to watch the surveillance monitors. "but it's still better than calling them you-know-what"

"you'd think the hell in hell energy will clue the muggles to not go poking into it." Hermione sniffed from the table where she was modifying guns to reload with magic. Argent is already close to magic, or at least dark magic. Small modification is needed to allow it to work with their neutral to light magic.

"do we have to save the world from the apocalypse." Ron sighed as he looked as the pulsating flesh tentacles outside. He shivered, it looks disgusting. He walked towards Hermione and dropped his weapon beside the ones she was working on.

"nah.... Word has it there's a slayer dealing with it. We can just hold on and help in rebuilding once it was dealt with." Hermione assured them.

"a slayer? Is it like that Buffy girl?"

Harry laughed. "nah, a lot more bad ass a lot less chill. Guns, chainsaw and explosives with demon guts flying around proves that it is more violence and less drama. The hell demons and the title slayer is the only thing similar. The guy has zero chill. I saw him rip a demon in half and beat a demon with another demon. I'm pretty sure he got this in the bag. We just need to hold out long enough."

"Speak for yourself, mate," Ron said, picking peanuts from random sugar spun bushes that had no business having peanuts on them.

"Honestly," Hermione scolded, "You're going to get a cavity at this rate, and there aren't any dentists here!"

"Oh fuck off," Ron responded good naturedly. "I'm just en-BLOODY FUCKING HELL!"

Harry and Hermione stopped to watch in both amusement and exasperation as Ron stepped on that particular orange hard candy tile that swept him through the rainbow bridge onto one of the adjacent paths.

** Okay so I seen this the other day and since then it has plagued my mind and I had to come back and comment.

So the way this was playing out in my mind is:

1. Each universe is different in some way or form. One time they're in the Percy Jackson universe, the next they're in 16th century England. They have no idea what to expect next. They don't realise until their 4th time around that, universes that existed only in fiction previously, are now apart of their new lives (meaning that in one life time they watched Doctor Who, and the next they lived it) (bonus points for when they realise this, Ron just sitting there going, "well I hope we never come across the Hunger Games. Harry'd start a revolution before Katniss...")

2. They look forward to finally turning 11 and seeing each other again, the years leading up to turning 11 adults will ask "what do you want to be when you grow up?" and after being reborn so many times they know the answer, "11". Because they just want to be the trio again.

3. Of course drama follows them. In one life time they're suspects in a murder, in another they become involved with the MCU (as OP mentions)

4. They're born with different names (my thought of this being only last names a majority because they can more easily differentiate their different lives ("back when I was a Smith"), and also because in many of the universes they have been in, the Harry Potter franchise is a thing that exists (bonus points if in that universe theyre born as Dan, Rupert and Emma))

This has so much potential for a series of all types of fics (short, long, AUs (obviously), crossovers) as well as being a collaboration between many fanfic authors.

And in all that time, learning to walk, talk, read and even think over and over again, going through whole lives without contact to the Wizarding World) Ronald never learned to address non-magical tools by the names the locals address them (and in turn he himself learned to address them from his parents)?

Like they didn't actually live any lives after the first one, like they didn't make any new experiences to shape them (and that as children, so very quickly and strongly shaped by their experiences). They seem more like anything past their first life passed them by, like they were nothing more than disconnected observers waiting for it to be over.

******** Aren't we assuming that they retain their memories when they're reborn? Which means every time they are born, they're apart from their partner for 11 years - reasonable enough break to not get bored of someone? And although the hormonal changes would not be fun, I don't see them as "learning" to read or think - because their minds already know that. Of course, you /could/ get bored, or static, of someone after spending some time together and want a divorce, but that's just life isn't it - sometimes real life people get divorced for that reason too.

Also for your static life claim to be right you have to assume a married couple is basically dead while together and can't grow which is not only wrong but kinda insulting.

No, you don't have to. But a sign of growth is change. Which the setup specifically negates.

** Well, I was playing Battletech, so here goes:

*Reincarnated - Battletech*

*Somerset Starport, Somerset, Federated Commonwealth, May 5th, 3050*

“So, what do we know about our enemies?” Harry asked as he grabbed his neurohelmet.

“That Leftenant Bauer is an idiot who has managed to graduate from Nagelring without learning anything about tactics or strategy?” Ron chuckled at his own question.

“I meant the enemies currently invading the planet,” Harry clarified after a glance at Hermione's expression - even after all their lives, she wasn't quite as comfortable with pre-battle banter as Harry and Ron. Of course, the fact that she had had to deal with the insubordination charge against all three of them a few weeks ago might also play a role.

“They call themselves the ‘Jade Falcons' and have already conquered nine worlds of the Commonwealth if the HPG blackout is any indication,” Hermione replied as she adjusted her cooling vest. “And according to the survivors of the 8th Arcturan Guards RCT, they are an elite unit with unknown ‘Mechs and weapons technology superior to Star League Royal standard. They do have tactical limitations, though, refusing to focus fire and trying to force duels on their opponents.”

“Which didn't seem to be much of a disadvantage,” Ron pointed out. “They wrecked the Guards when they attacked Here. The planet, I mean.”

Harry snorted. Why would anyone name a planet ‘Here'? Or ‘Anywhere'? This was a weird world - or universe - they had been reincarnated into. Though the BattleMechs were cool.

“We cannot underestimate them,” Hermione reminded them.

“If only we had wands,” Ron muttered.

Harry agreed with his friend. If they had wands, they could use magic - and this war would be over in a few hours. But they didn't, and what spells they had learned to cast wandlessly wouldn't affect a ten metres tall ‘Mech. Perhaps Hermione had been correct about spending more time training in wandless magic.

Ah, well - they could always do it next life. And they had found a way to use their magic with ‘Mechs.

“So, what's the plan?” Ron asked.

“We get in our ‘Mechs, get into position, and once the enemy appears, we shoot them,” Harry said.

“Simple and easy. I like it,” Ron replied.

Hermione sighed but didn't disagree - it wasn't as if they had a lot of options, anyway. As cadets of the Somerset Academy, ‘MechWarriors or not, they couldn't order anyone around.

“What are you doing? Why aren't you in your ‘Mechs yet! You've been given the order to deploy!”

Case in point: Leftenant Bauer. Harry would love to order the idiot out of the way.

“The techs are still loading ammo into our ‘Mechs,” Hermione reminded Bauer. “Sir,” she added after a second. “Regulations state that cadets shouldn't be in the cockpit during this unless specifically ordered to.”

“What?” Bauer glared at them. “Well, I order you to get into your damn ‘Mechs! We're being invaded! You're piloting junkheaps, but they're still ‘Mechs! Move!”

“Yes, sir.” Harry rolled his eyes as he followed his friends to their ‘Mechs. Bauer was correct in that their ‘Mechs weren't the newest models. They didn't even sport any advanced technology. But even so, his Phoenix Hawk, Ron's Shadow Hawk and Hermione's Griffin were nothing to sneer at - which meant, of course, that Bauer had done so. Repeatedly.

Ah, well. They could chat over the private comm channel Hermione had rigged up. Harry hoped that the Jade Falcons wouldn't take too long to attack.

--------------

Star Commander Rilon grinned as he finished off the enemy Zeus who had answered his challenge for a duel. His Nova was thirty tons lighter, but the enemy assault ‘Mech had been piloted by a fool who had barely managed to dent Rilon's armour.

That left the only force blocking his Star's advance to the starport a trio of obsolete ‘Mechs piloted by Inner Sphere scum barely out of a sibko. Ah well, he could be magnanimous and let his Star have some fun with them.

“Jen, Markus and Liam - take the trash out.”

He watched as the three ‘MechWarriors he had named pushed their OmniMechs forward, sprinting towards the enemy ‘Mechs. A few more seconds and they would be in range.

A moment later, the enemy ‘Mechs disappeared from his sensors. He blinked. “A feint? But how... how had they managed to fool his sensors? And why could he still see the enemy ‘Mechs while his computer insisted they weren't there?

Liam opened fire with his laser and autocannon, but the shots went wide, missing the phantoms completely even though they were standing still. How...?

Then the enemy started to move - towards them. The three Warriors of his star picked their targets and fired, but all their shots went wide.

What was going on? How did they do that? Had someone hacked their computers? Impossible! Sabotage? No - there were no bondsmen among their techs.

The enemy started firing, and their weapons hit. Liam's Kit Fox staggered as a PPC and a large laser, followed by autocannon shells and LRMs, hit it. The dezgra scum were focusing on one 'Mech!

And his warriors kept missing! Rilon's computer still didn't show the enemy even though they were dismantling Liam! This was... this was...

The Kit Fox fell, torso shot through and reactor leaking. Liam didn't eject.

Rilon moved forward, engaging the enemy Phoenix Hawk. His medium lasers reached out - and missed. The old ‘Mech turned to face him while its two companions wrecked Jen's Ice Ferret. The Phoenix Hawk's arm moved, waving at Rilon.

Rilon cursed and fired his second barrage of lasers, missing again. And the damned enemy 'Mech charged!

Another salvo - missed. Why couldn't he target the enemy? His heat was spiking even with Double Heat Sinks, but Rilon didn't care - that damned enemy ‘Mech was almost upon him. He moved to the side, to get some distance, kicking his Nova into gear - and the enemy matched him.

Then the right arm of the Phoenix Hawk rose, and the last thing Star Commander Rilon saw was both lasers flashing and hitting the Nova's cockpit.
