** *My Name is Harry Potter* - linkao3(4002850)

Ugh, it's Megamatt09, so smut filled harem/multi crossover. Conspuracy! CONSPURACY! *CONSPURACY!*

Ahem... Well, Ginny gets caught up in the conspiracy and ends up squibbed. She still ends up a badass in the end anyway.

There are aspects of this story that are interesting, like the super mysterious organization/entity that caused the canon plot to happen. Oh, and Hermione is evil.

  Harry Potter runs afoul of a conspiracy that puts him on the wrong side of the veil. For Harry Potter though, death is merely a temporary rest stop. AU, Arrow/Flash/Supergirl/Harry Potter Crossover. Harry/Multi, but naturally you already knew that.

** There was a story where not Harry nor Ginny (it was mostly canonical), but Lily, their daughter was a squib, and Ginny just didn't get over it and their marriage broke over it. It is actually a bit questionable how tolerant towards squibs Weasleys really were (with that cousin accountant nobody talked with). Does anybody know what story it is?
