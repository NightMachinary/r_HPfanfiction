/sigh/ alright, I admit it, I love this sort of fic in a shameful way. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2771223/1/][This]] is probably the best/worst in different ways.

It doesn't have to be H/Hr, but I enjoy that pairing. And the bad!weasleys type stuff.

Any similar, COMPLETED fanfics you know about? I'm at a stressful time in my life right now and I would just like to read guilty pleasure fics.

Double thanks if it includes any of the following:

-Luna Lovegood

-Magical Trunks

-Sirius's Will

-Goblin Allies

-Anything to do with Wards

-Anything to do with Ancient Runes

-Anything to do with 'Old Ways' like..wizard pagan rituals I guess?


** Anything by Robst on ff.net will probably fit your bill pretty well.

** I also have at least somewhat similar taste, though my enjoyment might be less guilty. If you don't care as much about fics being completed, a longer list could be made (I mean even though it seems none of Radaslab's works will be finished, most fulfill your wishes and are still 600k-700k words long, and A Boon for bill also fits and had it been a book, one could easily justify ending it where it is now to start the sequel). Anyway, running through my favorites list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heros]]: Based off of Paladeus' Champions of Lillith challenge. From your list contains manipulative dumbledore, bad weaselys, H/Hr/L pairing and wards (really a good fic in general regardless)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9933967/1/Inseparable][Inseperable]]:H/Hr pairing, has manipulative Dumbledore, but plot makes it so it's mostly nipped in the bud (trying to avoid spoilers)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]]: from the description "Merlin, not happy with how the future unravelled for the life of Harry Potter, intervenes early to set the course of history back on track. Implied Pairing Only. Smart!Harry Bash!AD Idiot!RW"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]]: "A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][The Power of the Press]] Forewarned Harry makes his escape from Britain, leaving the tournament in shambles. Protected by family, Harry sets about to fulfill his destiny free from the bigotry and manipulation of others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7782623/1/Damn-Wizards][Damn Wizards]] Probably one of the more unique takes on how to have Harry "defeat" Dumbledore

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7485658/1/Waiting-for-Godot-erm-Harry][Waiting for Godot...erm...Harry]]"Every wonder exactly how long Albus would have waited for Harry at King's Cross at the end of Deadly Hallows? A small bit of fluff asking the eternal question "If Death had an alias, what would it be?". Lunar Harmony H/Hr/L at the end"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3592708/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Light-and-Dark][Harry Potter and the Order of the Light and Dark]]"COMPLETE AU after fifth year.Harry sees through Dumbledore and starts his war on both the Light and the Dark forces. Please Read and Review."

For things that don't quite fit what you set out, there are unfinished fics I could recommend (most of Radaslab's work, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624958/1/A-Boon-for-Bill][A Boon for Bill]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4122447/1/The-Pureblood-Conspiracy][The Pureblood Conspiracy]] etc), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] contains, at least from what I've read, has the best explanation of a "canon" Dumbledore that is neither evil/manipulative or incompetent to the point of not barely being able to remember to breathe (still has H/Hr pairing and bad weaselys) and the rest of Seel'vor's work, while not complete, fits the bill otherwise. Most anything that is based off of or relates to reptilla28's challenge (Harry dies, meets Death, goes back in time to set it right with H/Hr pairing) will most of the time have the elements you mention and canoncansodoff and xelan both have a few entertaining H/Hr one-shots/ficlets (though canoncansodoff is perhaps more NSFW than not.)

*** I think I love you. I don't think I've read more than one or two of those. :D This makes me happy! :D

that challenge is also one of my favorite tropes, the going back in time to make things right, but as its a little more rare, I decided not to include it in the post. Actually, I like /anyone/ going back not just H/Hr.

**** Well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]] is absolutely hilarious. It's not exactly the lone-wolf Harry/evil Dumbledore story that you're talking about, but it has tongue in cheek Ron bashing that is goddamn hysterical and an /interesting/ take on Dumbledore. Seriously, I remember laughing so hard it hut reading this one.

For serious ones, I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5721324/1/Rocking-the-Boat][Rocking the Boat]] being pretty good.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7261904/1/The-Reluctant-Lord][The Reluctant Lord]] by SmallBurnyThing has the unique distinction of hitting nearly every single one of my non-technical pet peeves (Powerful!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, harem, Submissive!Hermione, magical oaths, titles of nobility that mean something, etc.), yet doing it in a sufficiently rich and interesting way that I still enjoyed reading it. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, though the author uploaded a chapter outlining what he had planned.

** Have you read the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] series? It has everything your asking for minus magical trunks and H/HR pairing. It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]. It begins year one too.

**** If this is the stuff you want I would pick it up again. It's a slow start. Most of the things you want to be reading about doesn't come into play until about the 4th book, but it's amazing! I loved the whole Goblin portion, especially because there were multiple clans that needed different things done. And the whole Gringotts thing came into play. And if you are into old ways, old magic and pureblood customs and traditions you will really like this. There is some really interesting festivals for things like Walprus night etc.

** For a completely, and I mean completely re-imagined harry potter world, read this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]

Darth Mars keeps the major theme of Harry Potter, but changes just about everything there can be about it, it's like reading a whole new book.

** I really detest this genre of stories... however, one that I find so well written as to be barely tolerable is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] by Lady Kali.

It's manipulative Dumbledore, but done moderately well, with an actual competent Dumbledore and a constant atmosphere of fear while Harry is in Hogwarts, vulnerable to Dumbledore's whims.

It doesn't have any of the "magical trunk" stuff you like, but at its core it's still a manipulative Dumbledore story.

I know, I know, most of them are pretty damn bad, I just can't help myself. To me, they are like the trashy romance novels of fanfiction.
