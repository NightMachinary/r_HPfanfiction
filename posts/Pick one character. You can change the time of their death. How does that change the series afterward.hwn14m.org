I had an idea for a story and this question came out of the research for it. As the title says, if you could change when any character in the series dies, how would that change the series? You can also change the events around their death to a certain degree, if you need to in order to make them die in a certain way at a certain time. To give some examples:

You could bring a death back. Arthur's death isn't really noted in wikis, so I assume it was relatively quiet and years after the series ended. If you moved that into the series and Arthur died after Nagini bit him, how would that change the story after that point?

You could bring a death back and change events to match. Draco also died after the series ended. If instead his name came out of the Goblet of Fire and he died in one of the tasks, how would that change the later books?

You could bring a death forward into the series. If the Potters survived until Harry went to school and the 1981 events happened in a summer holiday during Harry's Hogwarts years, how would that change the series?

You could bring a death forward after the series. If Sirius survived the books and didn't die until he was a hundred and thirteen and consumptive-as-fuck, how would that change the series?

If Voldemort died in 1981, what would be the outcome? If Dumbledore was killed by the Basilisk in book two, what would be the outcome? If Katie Bell died during Draco's machinations in book 5, what would be the outcome?

That was probably too much explanation and too many examples, but I really wanted to get this idea across because I'm very curious what people think and who people'd pick. Remember, you can only change the time of one character's death! But you can pick any character and give them any death you like, whenever you want to.


** James: he's not there that night, perhaps he's lured out by a Pettigrew who doesn't want his friend to die (but is still perfectly willing to sell out his wife and child) things play out the same, except Harry has a father, albeit one likely plagued by the thought that if he was there maybe he could have saved Lily, the truth about Pettigrew is known and pretty much nothing would happen as it did in canon.

Ginny: She dies in that chamber, could go two ways, either Voldemort is back in a younger body or perhaps she just doesn't survive the ordeal (or even a mix, he comes back but makes the mistake of trying the killing curse a second time). Voldemort bring back is probably most interesting, but you could definitely do a lot with the simple fact that Harry and Ron failed.

Another interesting one is to let that troll squish Hermione, since she is pretty instrumental to solving the first two books (and still fairly important later).

I'm curious about your second idea - do you think Harry and Ron would/should be aware they failed, or keep it secret?

** I always felt that JKR did Harry dirty by getting rid of the only real ties to his parents and psuedo father figures by killing off both Sirius and Remus. So the change I would make is to keep Sirius alive. Have him barely avoid dying but be in such shape that Harry believes he is dead and still chases Bellatrix into the Atrium. Then with Voldemort seen and Sirius fighting for the light, Sirius should get his trial and be free. Then Harry can get away from the Dursleys and live with Sirius after he asserts his rights shutting Dumbledore up. (Assuming Potter Will or Wizard Godfather trumps Muggle Aunt. And considering the Dursleys don't want Harry once Sirius becomes Harry's Magical Guardian he could easily get the Dursleys to sign over the muggle guardianship).

This could lead to the locket Horcrux being found shortly after Dumbledore's death with Harry muttering about it and Kreacher hearing.

Obviously that means that Remus and Tonks would still die and you could have the story continue with Sirius as godfather to Harry who's godfather to Teddy all living at a remodeled Grimmauld Place with Andromeda joining them.

Then you could either continue with canon with Ginny, or just go with Harry as a Single Dad, or go with Hermione as Teddy's Godmother falling for Harry, or pick any of the other possible girls (Luna would be my next choice).

**** My preferences in terms of relationships has always been Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna, when it comes to trios it's Harry/Hermione/Luna, Harry/Hermione/Fleur, or Harry/Fleur/Tonks. So there is lots of flexibility in terms of relationships.

I think you go with a combination. Keep with the timeline and set up the personal stuff/drama during the war as Harry builds a relationship with Sirius and with whatever single girl/combo you want. Coming up with why two girls make sense and why they both agree with it take you to a lot of things to explore.

With Harry's lack of self worth and desire for a family, you can really explore his emotions when Remus and Tonks tell him they want him as Teddy's godfather. Then you have the entire post-war parenthood for Harry to explore.

There are a couple of good Harry raises Teddy Fics several by the same author.

What We Lost by JacobApples has Harry finding Andromeda a wreck and he takes over raising Teddy and bringing Andromeda back from the brink.

The Disorder of the Phoenix by JacobApples starts seven years after the war. Harry is raising Teddy with Andromeda as Grandma. Suddenly all three are sent back to Harry's 5th year. That Harry is completed replaced by the older Harry eg physically and mentally 24-25 years old.

***** Indeed? A good collection. Plenty of fun fics with those pairings out there. I'm more a "Whatever the fic can justify" pairing person, myself. So, definitely not exclusionary to your suggestions there. :)

That would be an interesting approach, yeah. Definitely seems like a focus on personal stuff over war stuff. I'm curious - what's your favourite justification for a multi-pairing you've seen? Be it one person with two partners or an actual poly-cule/triumvirate.

Those are good fics. Read 'em all already - though I do keep forgetting that Disorder is written by the same author as the other two, they did feel very different upon reading. Have you read Teddy's Excellent Adventure? It's another favourite Harry-acts-parentally-to-Teddy fic, though with Teddy time-travelling instead. :)

****** The best justification is that the two girls in question realize that they both equally love Harry and that He loves them both as well. They decide to each give him up for the other making them realize that each of them really only want to make him happy. So they decide to share him and let Harry eventually decide.

Harry can't choose between them as he wants to make sure they are happy as well. They end up just naturally becoming a trio. Now I see this a lot with Harry/Hermione/Luna stories and a handful of times in Harry/Hermione/Ginny stories.

To me it's a better justification then the more common multiple lordships, marriage contracts etc as the "trio" comes together more organically in my opinion.

** Mrs Crouch, she remains in Azkaban and shockingly enough, she doesn't succumb to her illness, and the Polyjuice Potion starts to run out. However, the problem starts to arise when she gains her strength back, and Barty Crouch is left with the knowledge that his wife isn't dead yet. Dementors seemed to confuse Barty and his mum because they were both dying but when she regains her health, something will be a bit off. However, the plot thickens when the Minister of Magic (I think Bagnold at that time) makes her way into Azkaban for the annual inspection, and to her horror, finds a woman who is (a) not supposed to be there and is (b) dead.

Mr. Crouch is investigated, and both him and his son are arrested, and put into Azkaban with Mrs. Crouch. Sirius sees Crouch Snr and you can say he has another spark of obsession with seeing a man who sent him there without a trial, like the obsession he had with finding Pettigrew. As a result, his escape is much earlier as he seeks his way into the world again, and seeks out Dumbledore. One person who js supposed to be dead is found alive, so why not Pettigrew? Dumbledore is a bit more open towards accepting such a theory as a result. They either don't find Pettigrew and the trial is really hard, or they do find him with some sort of deux ex machina, and Sirius is a free man around two years into his imprisonment. He can raise Harry, albeit with resvervations from Dumbledore. Voldemort's rise to power is delayed, and because ~plot~ Sirius is in Grimmauld Place to find something or another (Lily's letter!), but he stumbles across his mother to add drama. Plot happens, they fight, hurl stuff at each other (locket, because convenience) and maybe they discover the horcruxes earlier as a result. Regulus does not die in vain, Voldemort is defeated earlier because there is no Death Eater like Crouch Jr. who's still fanatically loyal.

P.S My hypothetical scenarios are really far fetched but if you couldn't tell, I really want a happy ending for these poor idiots. Someone with slightly more creativity than I can make reasons other than convulated justifications.

No big changes to plot aside from Teddy now not being an orphan.

In terms of character development for fanfiction stories, Lavender Brown surviving the battle of Hogwarts. Big possibilities of stories of her adapting from her previous vapid persona into someone forced to grow and confront some serious issues, like being a scarred werewolf now.

And hey, for your first idea, could lead to a pretty big change if you were a Honks shipper. If fanfiction has taught me anything, it's that parenthood is the perfect way to seduce someone. :D

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs.

****** Surely Voldemort has to be taken down. Now that Harry's sacrifice is there and Voldemort is tired and no Horcruxes are around, he just needs a final push. It would be quite poetic to have Neville do it, but I am betting more on a realistic Kingsley/Slughorn/McGonagall combo. Or you know someone random who catches him in the back, propelling himself/herself to glory. You know like Hestia Jones... or someone mor unlikely like Parvati Patil.

More people die. Yes Harry's sacrifice yadda, yadda. But Harry's sacrifice protects people from Voldemort, not death eaters... So the fight last longer and more people die.

Ron doesn't join the Aurors.
