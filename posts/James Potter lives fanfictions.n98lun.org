I've read a lot of "Lily lives" fanfictions, not that I'm complaining but why are there more of them than "James lives" fanfictions ? Considering that Lily's sacrifice is needed for Voldemort's defeat, but James's death while being very noble was pretty much irrelevant. So I suppose making a scenario where James lives would be pretty easy ?

Anyway, I only found like 2 decent fanfictions (I'm gonna link them at the end) and I'd like to read more, because I think that James-Harry father and son relationship isn't developed a lot in fanfics, and grown up marauders either.

My only request is that I don't want the clich√© WBWL fics, where James is portrayed as a villain because I honestly don't think he is one. He has a lot of flaws but I don't see him abandoning his kid. I don't mind if both James ans Lily live.

The other story is Blood Binding by SphinxScribe, unfortunately I can't find the link anymore. I think the story was removed from ffnet.


** ‚ÄúBlood binding‚Äù has been pulled down from FFnet, I have my downloaded [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/cizi/Blood%20Binding-ffnet_10382653.epub][copy of EPub]] on my web.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] is a very good one shot.

Both James and Lily survive in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], but that fic ventures into very different territories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13786171/1/Stranded][Stranded]] has a good Peter as double agent, so they got Voldemort on that Halloween night. On the other hand, this Harry Potter never likes Hermione until they both got stranded on a strange magical island.

** So this is actually a three-book series from Wattpad (the third one is currently on hold or in progress, not sure) and it's the Nepenthe Series by kmbell92 and it has the most unique plot I've ever seen and the author in general has loads of awesome books on their profile. It's totally worth reading, I'll tell you that!

These are the links and summaries, in that order:

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/143244638-nepenthe-%E2%9F%B6-james-potter][Nepenthe]] (Book 1; complete) by kmbell92

#+begin_quote
  It has been over a year since the murder of his wife, Lily, and James Potter wishes every day that it is simply a nightmare that he will wake up from. Unfortunately, it isn't and in the wake of her death, James finds himself as a single parent to their son, Harry. The Boy-Who-Lived is known all around the wizarding world as the one to defeat Lord Voldemort on the same night that Lily was killed as the proclaimed "Dark Lord" attempted to rid of the child as well, yet failed. However, James is just trying to do his best in raising Harry in the most normal fashion as he can possibly muster but it's not easy.

  With one of his former best friends in Azkaban for the betrayal to the Order and his two remaining best friends not on speaking terms, James finds himself drowning in stress. Yet, relief comes in the form of a young woman, named Renata, and their first encounter is nothing short of a chaotic mess. But at the same time, it's the first thing that's made James laugh in months.

#+begin_quote
  For those that survived the war and carried on, happiness was waiting for them just around the corner, they simply had to find it. For James Potter, it took a wrong turn to end him in the right place where he met Renata Abate, a witch who was searching for her purpose in life. It was Harry who initially brought their paths to cross, but there was something else that kept the paths intertwined. Renata didn't only help to heal James, but he helped to heal her as well as some of the brightest smiles in the world hold the darkest pasts.

  Soon it became two imperfect people refusing to give up on each other and from that blossomed the start of a beautiful family and the wonderful memories that they would share in, for years to come.

#+begin_quote
  Magic has always played an intricate role in the life of Harry Potter. He is the Boy Who Lived, a title hovering his head since the time he was one year old, marked by a lightning bolt scar. He learns that a dark wizard targeted him as a baby, although he still doesn't know the true reason why. What he does know, is that he survived and wherever he goes, people just want to catch a glimpse of his forehead. He's famous in the wizarding world, although lives quite a normal life at home with his parents and siblings for the most part.

  But the time has come for Harry to start his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, alongside his best friends, and it seems the pressure is on to live up to the greatness placed on him during a time he can't even remember. However, it shouldn't be a problem for Harry to find his next adventure when the castle holds a three-headed dog and plenty of secrets for him to uncover.

Another one is also on Wattpad:

  The entire Wizarding World knew of the three truths that occurred at Godric's Hallow the night He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named first fell.

  One, Lily Potter lost her life protecting her loved ones.

  Two, Harry Potter survived the Killing Curse and vanquished the Dark Lord.

  Three, the body of James Potter was never found.

Book 1 is done, book 2 has two chapters so far and I loved it so much! Her other fanfics are worth reading too, but this one just fit your requirements.

Now, I'm sure I've read loads of those James Potter survives stories, but these are the ones that were stuck in my head because they were so good.

I just remembered another one, but I forgot the name of it...I will tell you if I find it though!

**** You're welcome! And you should read it, it's awesome and totally worth it!

Also, I just found the fanfic I was talking about at the end. It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14469255/chapters/37378826][Let's Try Again]] by DayDreamer315 on AO3 and it's really one of my favourite fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  After the war Harry Potter's world falls apart. Then he is offered a chance to try and make a better future for himself and his friends. Of course things are never simple.
#+end_quote

So this one has hell lot of bashing in it (including Molly, Ron and Ginny (though she gets better), most of the Order, Lily and...I think there's McGonagall bashing too, but I'm not sure), so if you're not comfortable with these, then it's not one for you. Same with the ships Severus/James, Sirius/Remus and Harry/Fred/George. I just love the plot of it all and it's just awesome! Both Lily and James survive, but there's a complete plot with twists and all and I just love all of it, but of course it's not everyone's taste.
