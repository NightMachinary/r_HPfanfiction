Lost fanfiction, don't remember name or author. Story plot remembered: -Fred survives the battle of Hogwarts, they think he is dead but it turns out he is stunned, taken to St Mungos. -Healer witch called Alice from America. George fancies her. -Hermione goes to visit Fred in Hospital.

I read this a few years ago and have been searching for it since then, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!


** This reminded me a lot of a story I read ages ago (maybe 2007 or so). However, if I recall the Weasleys think that George is missing/presumed dead. But he actually has amnesia and is dating Alice/Alice is taking care of him. Eventually his memory comes back however leading to angst and whatnot.

It may be a different story and I may have some of the details mixed up - but I think it may all be part of the same story? I usually read fics on simplyundeniable or checkmated so it probably was on one of those sites?

*** Hi Crayonbox, It was definitely on the fanfiction website, I didn't know those other sites existed... Thanks anyway!
