Even in canon, a single trained magical person can get most of what they need to thrive with minimal effort by magic. But they still need marital partners outside the family to have healthy kids, and they still need exclusively owned space to live in, and they still benefit from economies of scale in educating their kids, and they still need external help with a few specialized tasks (like healing). Suppose that those unifying factors were flipped on their heads:

- Any amount of magic completely prevents genetic disease, so marriages between magical siblings or cousins work fine. Because of this biological fact, magic switches off the Westermarck effect, so magical people don't find sexual relations with relatives repulsive.

  - When monarchs have kids with their relatives and collect genetic disease (Ancient Egyptian pharohs did this a lot, but even modern European royalty does some), they're imitating how wizards behaved before the Statute of Secrecy, but aren't protected like wizards

- Space expansion spells have no limits except the caster's power, and most casters are powerful enough to make enough space for many magical people to live in. You can contain an infinite amount of living space in any volume.

  - The story of the old lady who lived alone in an internally expanded shoe is a fairly minor example. You can fit a town in a crack in a wall. You can fit another town in a crack in one of that town's walls. It's arbitrarily large expanded spaces as far down as anyone cares to build them.
  - The Statute of Secrecy was really mostly a formality anyway, because practically no one lived in the surface-level world with muggles by that point.

- The more generations magic is in a line, the more it changes how it interacts with them. Muggleborns (and purebloods from families a handful of generations old) experience magic close enough to the baseline way that they can learn useful things from Hogwarts classes. But family lines with parseltongue can develop spells in it that wouldn't work for muggleborns or for members of other parselmouth lines. Some of the Peverell family's necromantic spells wouldn't work for anyone else. In general, finding a grimoire of another family's magic gets you approximately nothing you can use (the grimoires of magic anyone can learn are just called textbooks and are readily available).

  - Special gifts like parseltongue and metamorph ability and the Sight showing up in a family are signs that magic is starting to customize its interaction with that family, and they're a few generations from needing to leave Hogwarts and homeschool their kids

- Simple healing spells and potions aren't very hard, and complex healing on people in old families has unpredictable results, what with the custom ways magic interacts with their bodies. There are specialist healers, but most magical people do almost all healing in their homes with no help.

​

I think this could make an interesting aesthetic for a story. But I'm also imagining a scene where someone from an isolated branch of the Potter family comes to the surface world for the first time in a few decades, hears the "boy who lived" story, and is like "Yeah, we're usually immune to killing curses. Got that from old Ignotus. What of it? Haven't you heard of family magic?" And/or one of Herpo the Foul's friends surfaces for some reason and tells Voldemort what an idiot he was, doing the horcrux ritual: "Herpo wrote that ritual as a proof of concept that you can do soul magic without a family talent for it. Obviously if you're a Gaunt, you make soul anchors differently. Did you even read the description before using experimental soul magic on yourself?"


** All of my yes. I'm a fan of magical worlds that are exceedingly bizarre and fantastical by modern standards, where the unimaginable is mundane. Okay, that might be a bit of an exaggeration but my point stands.

The Lovegood house looks like a rook? Nah, son, they live in an /actual/ rook chess piece.

Hogwarts, Diagon, Hogsmeade, and the entire magical population are tiny compared to the countries they're in? Well of course! Those are just the crossover points between the mundane world and the larger magical worlds. /Plural/.

Hogwarts has moving staircases and tiny servants? Nah, son, the castle is alive and sapient! If things have been getting inconvenient for you, you best think about what you've done before it decides to "expel" you.

Wizard homes use house elves as servants? Nah, son, any self-respecting mage can make semi-sentient constructs to take care of their estate's upkeep.

Dragons are just very big flying lizards? Well, maybe the young ones...

Vampires sleep in coffins. Only enter a vampire's coffin with them escorting you or you'll get lost and never find your way out.

Okay, this one is regarding canon but I feel the moving portraits were severely underutilized from what I remember. You have interactive snapshots of people! Imagine each family has a sort of "gallery" where prominent family members are displayed to serve as a council.

This is bit is inspired by your prompt more directly but what if all the beings, that is to say sapient magical species, are descendants of really old magical lines? Like, their bloodlines have become so altered they've barely got anything in common with baseline humans.

​

This is a fun prompt. I'll be keeping an eye on it :-)

** I have always assumed that this was sort of how the magical world worked in canon. Even children who grew up in it, like Ron and Neville, didn't seem to know anyone at Hogwarts who wasn't a relative or direct neighbour. This is why 'magical colonialism' has never worked for me as a concept, because with instant travel, the ability to set up anywhere and be self sufficient and the low population density, the Ministry can't enforce its authority in its own country, let alone half way around the world on a hostile populace.

No amount of questions and subtle prompting will convince me that you're right there. 2)For us, incest would be bad and dumb, because the human genepool has a lot of bad recessive genes. But pea plants can self-pollinate without causing any problems. If humans were like pea plants, there'd be no problem with it.

*** I'm mostly interested for the aesthetic of a world that's been heavily modified by human hands since a very long time ago. I like the idea of people running into things that were clearly built for a purpose, sometime long ago, but where that purpose is non-obvious and the designers aren't around to be asked. Of characters being confused what's truly mystical, and what would be obviously normal if they just knew the context. I'd like to see a magic system that's actually weird, not just picking a subset of ordinary people and giving them a standard box of levers that produce convenient reality-altering effects. The possibility of a few funny interactions with OCs is a side bonus.
