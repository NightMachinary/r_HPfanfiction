** "You are srsly all prepz, lol. No contest."

Lord Harry squinted at the girl, who despite being half naked was entirely unattractive to him. "Maybe so, but no one is happier due to your actions. You solve nothing."

** Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell would absolutely clap Ebony's arse, then they'd bond over music or something idk and she'd join his harem.

*** Was Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell an actual character from a real fic? I thought it was just a satire of all of the lordship or indy fics.

***** Confession time: in the rare occasions in which it keeps a smudge of verisimilitude and doesn't dissolve in a power-wank bashing Fest with the world kissing Harry's ass I still enjoy some of them occasionally. Besides it I can read petty much anything (even if extremely tropery) if it has a good-enough world-building or ideas particularly interesting used well.

**** I don't think I've seen Gaunt, but I've definitely seen plenty of fics where he got all of those other titles at once.

***** Gaunt I think I saw once. It's not used much though, I think it's because of all the negative connotations.
