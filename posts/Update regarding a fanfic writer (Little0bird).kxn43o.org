I'm pretty sure that almost everyone who read hp fanfics have heard of little0bird. I rarely read fanfic as it was more OOC and AU rather than canon most of the times, and the writing style just seemed out of place (an unjustifiable demand since one can't expect the same exact style as the og books).

I really liked her way of writing and exploring the characters and keep us in touch with the HP characters. I read her works in the last few months and her last fanfic (Questions and Answers )is not marked "completed".

So, is it over? or there are more chapters in the fray? Does anyone know whether she will continue?


** I think you're wildly overestimating this author's popularity. But whatever, that's not too important.

Except that when I googled her name to figure out who she was, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/little0bird/pseuds/little0bird][her AO3 profile]] immediately popped up. It looks like she copied most of her stories over there from FFN, and has started posting at least some fics on AO3 exclusively. She hasn't posted any Harry Potter stories in about six months, but she's regularly been writing for other fandoms in that time, with her most recent update being only two days ago. So she's clearly still active.

Questions and Answers hasn't been copied over, so you're probably not missing any chapters or anything like that. Maybe she's abandoned it, or maybe she'll copy it over when she writes the next chapter. The best person to ask is little0bird herself. Her AO3 profile also lists [[https://xxlittle0birdxx.tumblr.com][her tumblr account]], where her asks are open, and she seems to post fairly regularly.

Really, you could have at least put a /little/ bit of effort into figuring this out for yourself.
