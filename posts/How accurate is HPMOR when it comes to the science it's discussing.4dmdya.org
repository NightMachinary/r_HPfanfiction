** It's about as accurate as Harry Potter is about the standard schooling experience in the UK. The basic barebones that JK took from real life like houses and boarding school is real but dramatised. Then it's filled with magic and house elves and an ill-defined evil that must be overcome because the author has a point to make.

** A tumblr user, su3su2su1 did a chapter by chapter review of HPMOR and commented on the science. Unfortunately, the account is dead, looks like some of the original posts were archived though.

***** Eh. All the stuff about Harry inanely babbling about rationality -- that's true. And the science quibbles are probably mostly correct (although EY did say that he avoided looking things up when writing Harry, so that Harry would have plausible errors, like the misnamed fallacies the reviewer complains about). And the stuff about EY shoehorning in too many of his favorite theories is also true: HPMOR would be a better novel if it didn't mention "timeless physics," for example. And, yes, MIRI is ridiculous. And, yes, the book would need an editor if it were to stand on its own as a real novel. There's a lot to reasonably hate in HPMOR.

But there are a lot of criticisms in there that seem really silly. Like the rant about kids using their time turners too much (like he wouldn't), or the complaint about the laws of magic being poorly defined (which is something I think HPMOR did very well). Also, he keeps complaining about there not being enough magical science, which, well, how much of the book /should/ that be? Is it bad to write books that aren't 100% descriptions of scientific experiments?

Random example nitpick:

#+begin_quote
  Hariezer tries (and fails) to transfigure something into “cure for Alzheimer's,” [...] I guess the thought here is he can then give these things to scientists to study? Its unclear, really.
#+end_quote

No, it's not unclear; Harry says specifically that this is exactly the idea. Is EY too verbose, or does he not repeat himself enough? Make up your mind.

Another:

#+begin_quote
  -the author intends for Hariezer to be a teacher. He is supposed to be the master rationalist that the reader (and other characters) learn from
#+end_quote

Is he? The author says in the intro:

#+begin_quote
  [...] the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, [...]
#+end_quote

Or this bit:

#+begin_quote
  I have some bad news for Hariezer's philosophy. You are going to die. I'm going to die. Everyone is going to die.
#+end_quote

Did he forget that he was reading a book involving magic?

#+begin_quote
  Hariezer solves this through the time-turner-ex-machina of Quirrell knowing someone else with a time turner, because when Yudkowsky can't solve a problem with a time turner, he solves it with two time turners.
#+end_quote

Well yes, the Harry Potter universe has so many time machines that it gives them to children. Complain to JK Rowling.

And the damned "not enough science" complaints:

#+begin_quote
  Terrible things in HPMOR: Lack of science: I have no wrong science to complain about, because these chapters have no science references at all really.
#+end_quote

or:

#+begin_quote
  Another large block of chapters with no science.
#+end_quote

or:

#+begin_quote
  Another chapter with no science explored.
#+end_quote

We get it: you misread the title as /Harry Potter and the Unbroken List of Scientific Experiments/, stop whining about it.

Or when he repeatedly complains about having battles after the mid-year celebration, as though it would be weird to have a football game after homecoming.

And there are big complaints that just make me think, "Yeah...it's supposed to be like that." Like Harry being an elitist asshole: it's OK to have a character be an elitist asshole if it makes sense in the story. Or their being a tension between Harry's ideals and the magical world. Or complaining about things being different from canon (why did you even start reading it!?).

Oh, and our reviewer says this:

#+begin_quote
  Also, I know as much physics as anyone,
#+end_quote

...which I'm sure is totally accurate, and not at all a hypocritical boast from someone actively ranting about nerd elitism...

****** You have a lot of emotions about this.

I found the review entertaining, and it accurately conveyed many of my frustrations with the fic. I feel sad for EY since I connected some of the things he has said about himself with some of the things about Harry in his story, and a little worried for him tbh, but I do not think I would enjoy his company. I also would not enjoy discussing Harry Potter with him, as he seems to have a superficial understanding of the books and an alarmingly classist attitude. I even, sadly, suspect I would not enjoy discussing scifi or science with him. I probably would enjoy discussing these things with the author of the review: they seem like they have a pretty laid back attitude, and a desire to learn things and share them.

** It's been a bit since I read it, but from what I remember:

HPMOR doesn't contain that much hard science, as in biology, chemistry, or physics. There's some physics jargon dropping, which I can't comment on, as I'm not particularly well versed in this topic--see the links that others have posted to su3su2su1, who actually was a physicist, and who hits the author pretty hard. But Harry doesn't bother to explain much of this, or really any, so I'm guessing that you're not that interested in the possibility of that being incorrect...so let me go on...

There is a fair amount of cognitive science. And I think that for the most part, this is pretty widely accepted material. When talking about cognitive biases (e.g., the planning fallacy, the Lake Wobegone Effect, scope insensitivity), I believe the author was mostly drawing from research done by Kahneman and Tversky, who were/are (Tversky is no longer alive) considered to be reputable researchers in cognitive science and behavioral economics. The descriptions of the biases themselves in HPMOR seem fairly accurate. However, as su3su2su1 points out, they are perhaps applied in questionable ways once or twice (su3su2su1's mentioned Harry talking about the bystander effect, referring to countries that refused to intervene in Voldemort's rise to power, when the bystander effect is really focused on individuals), but I can't think of any other examples. Su3su2su1 also mentioned that the Robber's Cave experiment is misrepresented, and I believe he was right on this--Yudkowsky says that the two groups of boys developed individuals cultures and names only after they found out about one another, but that's incorrect. The names and cultures came in the first, non-contact phase.

And then the evolutionary psychology...I don't feel well informed enough to really debate the particulars of HPMOR's forays into this field. I will say this: there is a huge debate regarding the validity of all sorts of evolutionary psych claims, among academics and among laypeople. I always am rather skeptical of evolutionary psychology claims, because they're very difficult to test, but really easy to come up with and get them /sounding/ reasonable (and they're often used to justify views that one already holds or that one desires to hold for personal reasons).

So that's a brief summary of the science itself. But I'm guessing that the OP might also be asking about the "methods of rationality"--that is, the reasoning techniques and logic that HPMOR claims to teach. And as for those, I'll go out on a limb and say that they're probably correct. I'm willing to discuss with people if there are particulars that they think are wrong (and it's also entirely possible that I'm just forgetting about some stuff--as I said, it's been a while), but the hypothesis testing (though su3su2su1 did have a good point about Harry's testing of the blood purity thing), the Bayesian updating, the focus on empirical observation, the way that Harry tries to use evidence--that's all pretty reasonable stuff. Of course, you can find people who will take issue with that (philosophers of science argue about how much we can actually know from science and what is the best way to conduct science, and philosophers of mathematics argue about Bayesian probabilities and how you can actually arrive at them), but for most of these cases, such controversy is probably irrelevant for the casual reader--what's important is that these "methods of rationality" will hold up in everyday life, and I think that they will.

*TLDR: Not sure about the physics, mostly accurate for everything else, but there are a few questionable things that you should be careful about*

[EDIT: Source--I'm almost done with my bachelor's degree in biology, plus I just like science and philosophy in general.]

*** I'd add to this that the author has stated (either in a footnote, or in an author's note, I can't remember right now) that when talking about real-world science from Harry's perspective, he uses his memory (so he could be incorrect or imprecise), but when he uses Hermione's perspective, he checks it in a book so he's sure it's accurate. I think that most of all, this shows that the author's intent is not for the reader to take everything Harry says at face value. It's mostly supposed to be a way for the reader to get a general idea, and, if curious, to look up the science on his or her own.

***** Harry is most certainly shown to be wrong. Not about science, but that's not something you could plausibly do in a fictional story where most characters are scientifically illiterate. But I think he's shown to be flawed enough that the reader would pick up not just to take what he says at face value. The whole point is to figure out why you believe what you believe - trusting a fictional character would be silly.

** Almost all the stuff on psychology and biases is correct. The author's interpretation of quantum physics is not widespread. Drexler style nanotech is unlikely to ever happen. Dyson Spheres are obviously highly theoretical but legit except for that. The discussion of genetics is oversimplified but essentially okay. I can't remember anything else that might have been in the book. I only read it once, although I was slogging by the end of it.

I think the best aspect of the story's attempt at realism was all the safety related changes made to transfiguration.

** This isn't exactly relevant to OP's question, but as for the criticism of the fic (because there isn't enough debate on the matter already): Harry is shown to be wrong in many different fashions many different times throughout the story. The author never pretends Harry is anything approaching a perfect person, but Harry is fairly narcissistic and the story is primarily told from his perspective. So there's that. Keep in mind though prior to Hogwarts, he deals exclusively with condescending adults and is horribly undersocialized (is that a word? I don't think so. I think my meaning is clear though.) He's basically never had a friend his own age.
