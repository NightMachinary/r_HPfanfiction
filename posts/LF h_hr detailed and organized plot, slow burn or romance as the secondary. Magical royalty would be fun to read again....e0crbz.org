Or complex system where there is an actual hierarchy and the houses are truly more than just a title (looking for the ‘royalty' respect aspect)

really tired of the lack of depth of the Bashing tropes (Weasley or dumbles) if it's in there, best it not be a whiny “im doing the best for you” “but you owe me” “Hermione is mine” etc etc.

Reiterating the SLOW BURN on the relationship. I am so overly tired of the immediate “I love you” and “you are my life” tropes. I will literally exit out of that fic with no remorse!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), should fit well:

- 625k words long, defeating Voldemort is the easier part of the plot
- Very slow burn romance between them. Both had dated other people before getting together, especially Harry
- Both are awesome and yet flawed characters, especially Hermione
- They have some rivalries going on between themselves, and how they settled their one major issue is very interesting
- Ron and Luna are very helpful here

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

Escape? The ministry tries to trap Hermione in a marriage with either Draco or Snape so she just up and leaves with her parents and Harry. Also, Snape and Mcgonagall have an interesting friendship. It starts in their 6th year so they have already been friends for 5 years and there are no soul bounds or immediate "I love you"s. I suppose there is some Dumbledore bashing, but he is so remarkably thickheaded and always thinks he knows best in this one that it didn't bother me much. Hermione's parents, the twins and even Percy also have their roles to play. The final battle even has a plan. IMO it's a great fic.

*** I'm gonna have to veto this recommendation for OP. This has heavy Dumbledore and weasley bashing, and it seems the only people who are immune to his "manipulations" are the authors favored characters like snape mcgonagall, weasley twins etc.

Its a mom fic imo.

**** Sigh... Everyone's a critic on here. Newsflash honey: I read fanfiction to entertain myself. I don't expect some Shakespearean tale of tragedy, philosophy and life meaning. It seems everything less than the quality of the likes of Tolkien or Shakespear gets immediately hated on here. Which seems incredibly stupid to me. We are talking about more or less amateur writing. It's stupid to expect the quality of professional writers who only do that and have had years of experience in doing it and the help of editors. I stand by what I said- it's a great fic. It's fun to read and has a well-structured plot. It's like watching action movies like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon and expecting some deep meaning and philosophy about life like in Stalker or 2001: A Space Odessey for example. Of course you're going to be disappointed.

***** You completely missed the point.

I see this fic recommend a lot but I don't always shit on it. I might inwardly roll my eyes, but it's a bad rec for op.

He wanted a SLOW BURN fic WITHOUT bashing.

Yet you recommend a fic where there already together and bashes Dumbledore and the weasleys.

Don't preach to me HONEY.

****** No need to fight, I appreciate the back up but if someone believes it's a note worthy store I'll bookmark it and give it a try

I've been an avid reader of fanfic since 2006, I've averaged reading 500K words weekly in recreation alone so I've read tons and tons of stories.

I appreciate ALL recommendations. But vex is right, this doesn't follow the current request “pre-requirements”
