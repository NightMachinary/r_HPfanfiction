*** The British School Year

In the course of reading a significant amount of Harry Potter fanfiction, I have been gratified to encounter many excellent works by authors from many nations all over the world. The collective authorship of Harry Potter fanfiction is possibly the most diverse of any other fan group.

While this is in large part a Very Good Thing, it does, however, have its drawbacks. Most of these pertain to Harry Potter being a British story, set in Britain, and therefore being very British. One aspect of this inherent Britishness, is that the Hogwarts school year generally parallels the Standard British one.

As many authors are from countries other than Great Britain, Scotland, Wales, and the countries on Ireland, they are commonly less familiar with how the British-style school year works.

On the British Isles, the school year is almost universally split into three sections, called terms.

- *Autumn* term denotes the beginning of the school year and typically runs from early September to about the third week of December.\\
- *Spring* term runs from early January to early April.\\
- *Summer* term runs from late April to about the third week of July.\\

This trimester system has a number of breaks built in. There are three major breaks:

- two weeks in late December to early January for Christmas and New Year's\\
- two weeks in April for Easter\\
- six weeks in late July through August for the summer.\\

There are also three one-week mid-term breaks located somewhere in the middle of each term.

In chronological order, the British School Year looks like this:

*Autumn Term*: Early September to 3rd week of December, one-week break near the end of October\\
*Christmas Holidays*: Two Weeks\\
*Spring Term*: Early January to early April, one-week break in February\\
*Easter Holidays*: Two Weeks\\
*Summer Term*: Late April to 3rd Week of July, one-week break in May\\
*Summer Holidays*: Late July to Early September

Using the power of maths, we can determine that since there are 52 weeks in a year, then after taking out the 2 weeks for Christmas Holidays, 2 weeks for Easter Holidays, 3 mid-term one-week breaks, and the six weeks for summer holidays, then you have 39 remaining weeks. Dividing this by the three terms, this means you get about 13 weeks per term.

Rowling has stated in canon that students are to report to the Hogwarts Express on September 1st, every year. This necessarily results in uneven term lengths, because there are 115 days between September 1st and Christmas. That is 16 weeks + 3 days. Even taking into account the 1-week mid-term holiday, that is 15 weeks + 3 days. And since New Year's Day is traditionally included in the Christmas Holidays, and there is exactly one week in between New Year's Day, then even if the Christmas Holidays end on New Year's Day, that only gives us one extra week to put before Christmas. However, that still only reduces it to 14 weeks + 3 days. At minimum, the Autumn mid-term break would have to be 2 weeks, which seems rather long.

A solution to fix this is to make the Autumn term about 15 weeks while the Spring and Summer terms are about 12 weeks each. This is annoyingly uneven but should not significantly affect any stories. In fact, it is /very/ common for British schools to have uneven term lengths. Especially since the date of Easter tends to move around from year to year.

For a visual example of the British system, I compiled a sample 2019-2020 Hogwarts School Year using the British system, but adding Rowling's September-First rule. You can check it out [[https://i.imgur.com/ya3Fkbk.png][here]].


** Few things to take into account: JKR gives no indications that Hogwarts has half-term breaks, and the summer holidays tend to start at the end of June for them. This is pretty standard for public schools; they tend to have longer holidays than the state schools -- eight at summer, three for winter and spring -- and, tuition aside, Hogwarts is obviously based more on the public school system.

That said, there's a couple of instances in the books where the winter break is clearly only two weeks, so whether all this gets taken into account is debatable.

All that said, JKR's entire school system is flawed (1st Sept. start date /every year/?), so if you wanna make it realistic then just overhaul the lot.

*** To be honest, the main point of this post was to illustrate to non-British authors the general overview of how the British school system works. The French school year is similar, as they both operate on the trimester (three-term) system.

In the USA, for example, almost universally uses the semester (two-term) system, with a Fall Semester and a Spring Semester. The school year isn't nationalized, so some districts do use a trimester system, but it is uncommon. Canada's education similarly isn't nationalized, so it varies widely between provinces. Some run semester, some run trimester. Oddly enough, some school systems in Canada run a trimester system for the younger years and a semester system for the later years.

Schools in Germany don't necessarily have separate terms within a single school year. Brazilian schools typically have four terms, and their school year generally runs from February to December. Australia also has four terms, typically, and also follows the calendar year (first term starts in January, fourth term ends in December).

**** In my experience, trimester systems are more common in elementary and middle school, and semester systems are more common in high schools. But again, it's hard to generalize because schools districts all differ. I worked at a high school that combined both systems for some odd reason.

*** Aye, but I can't reasonably take into account every school. The majority of schools, and of resources I consulted on this matter, refer to them as Autumn, Spring, and Summer. I spoke to several friends who grew up in the British school system and each person referred to them in that way.

My aim is to give a general overview, not to exhaustively give an account of the British school system.

Rowling did not name the terms in the books, of course. And fiction writers should feel free to refer to them however they want. But I find naming the terms as I did eases the understanding of the important bits.

** I want to point out that these things aren't true in Scotland!

Our first term starts in early-mid August, runs til early October where there's a week-fortnight break (depending on where in Scotland the length of this holiday varies), then runs til the week before Xmas where there is another two week break, then runs from early January til whenever Easter occurs, around which is a two week break, then runs again til late June/ early July when we finish for the summer (which varies between 6 and 7 weeks).

Therefore our term lengths are usually unequal, and we don't have half-term breaks the way they do in England.

So whilst, yes, American and other nationalities have different school years to the U.K., the U.K. doesn't even have the same system everywhere! So this post is really about the English school system, not the â€˜British' one (which isn't a thing).

*** When I did my research, I saw that there were differences between Scotland schools and English schools. However, most of the differences tended to be minor. I saw Scottish schools with mid-term breaks, and ones without mid-term breaks. I saw ones where the October break was two weeks, and even one where it was three weeks.

But you'll find more similarities between the system you described and the one in my post than you will differences.

Again, I want to avoid missing the forest for the trees. Yes, there are very few schools that follow that pattern /exactly/. However, my post provides a general rule of thumb and introduction to how school years work in Britain, with one eye always on what details the books give us.

A four term system to three term system is a pretty big difference... and the summer holidays particularly are very differently timed (HP term timing is immediately recognisable to Scottish readers as English) because of that fact. We also go to school for a different number of years, have completely different curriculums and exam systems etc.

It's fine to say the differences are smaller than between other countries' systems, but at least don't call it the â€˜British' system and then use what is clearly and instantly recognisable as the general English school year pattern. To a Scottish person, that is more frustrating than typical Americanisms in writing because where that is an accident, going to the extent of researching the school year here and still ignoring that Scotland is a completely legally distinct schooling system with a different number of terms, different year pattern, different curriculum and completely different exam system is just pretending all Brits are English for the sake of ease.

You might say missing the forest for the trees, I say that if you go to the effort of making a post to correct people on a typical school year pattern then you might as well be correct and call it the English school year.

However, [[https://www.pkc.gov.uk/schoolholiday][Perth]], [[https://www.primarytimes.co.uk/glasgow/school-term-dates][Glasgow and the West]], [[http://www.moray.gov.uk/moray_standard/page_55829.html][Moray]], [[https://www.highland.gov.uk/info/878/schools/32/school_term_dates][Highlands]], [[https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/schools/parents-carers/school-term-dates/#term19-20][North-east]], [[http://www.orkney.gov.uk/Orkney-Schools-Calendar.htm][Orkney]], [[https://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/media/12744/bcd49101-school-term-and-mid-term-holidays-2019-20.pdf][Western Isles]], [[https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/service-area/children-and-families-service/education/school-term-dates][Dundee]], and more all list four terms, and in fact the only council I found that listed only 3 was Edinburgh - so hardly the majority.

Now, I get that researching another culture isn't straightforward, especially when there are a lot of variations (and the differences between countries of the U.K. are a particular sore point for Scots because we continually get lumped with the English even by the English, let alone people half a world away) but please, when someone from there tells you that you've got it a bit off just actually read what theyve said rather than get defensive.

What you've described is the typical English system, not the â€˜British' system (because there is no such thing).

All those have 3-term school years. Note that as a small part of doing my research, I clicked randomly on five separate Scottish councils, and four of them used a three-term system. This is a case in which extrapolation led to a non-entirely-accurate conclusion. Also please note that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term#Scotland][Wikipedia page]] /and/ [[https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/my-school/general-school-information/Term][an official page from an Executive Agency of the Scottish government]] /both/ make no mention of 4-term years. So while I knew they /existed/ in Scotland, my research did not reveal that.

| I want to point out that these things aren't true in Scotland!\\
From your original post. They /are/ true in Scotland, but not /universally/ true. I will admit that I could have reworded my original post to take into account the non-inconsequential number of Scottish school districts that run a four-term school year.

Though you know, if the vast majority of English and Welsh schools, the majority of Northern Irish schools, and a good portion (though perhaps not /majority/ of Scottish schools) use a three-term system, and since from all indication J.K. Rowling seemed to operate Hogwarts under a three-term system, then I think I am /okay for the purposes of this post/ with giving a "generalized British School Year."

If I were to do the post again, I would not change a damn thing, except instead of saying:\\
| On the British Isles, the school year is almost universally split into three sections, called terms.\\
I would say:\\

******** I can see we aren't going to agree on this, so I'll leave it here.

However, one further unrelated bit of Brit-picking - I really wouldnt use the term British Isles. It's [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute#Republic_of_Ireland][dated and can offend Irish people]] - it dates to pre Irish independence and it's a symbol of British imperialism over Ireland to a lot of Irish people.

Ironically they do I believe also run an English term structure, however I'd avoid that phrase personally.

** Luckily for me, I have a Brit for an editor. This is one of the things we discussed early on, and I already had a fairly good understanding anyway. We didn't try to mimic the J.K Rowling class schedule structure, though. Instead, we mashed up my Australian experience and his British experience to create a timetable that is practical, believable and serves the purposes of the story well. It's stored in my phone in a timetable app because that makes it easy to flick through.
