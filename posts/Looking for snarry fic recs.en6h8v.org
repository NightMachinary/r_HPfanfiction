Hey hey, been lurking here for a while since I got back into reading fic.

Instead of just rereading the same old I was hoping people could point me in the right direction.\\
There are a few things I'm mostly looking for:\\
-medium-long fanfics with a (somewhat) happy ending and that are finished.\\
-I like Snape as a top and Harry as a brat, I dislike it when they are perfect or seem emotionless.\\
-Not completely AU, alternative endings are fine but I like the wizardy bits.\\
-No established relationship\\
-M+ rated and not because of violence if you know what I mean

I kept a reading list in 2013 and just reread the Tea series which was fun. I enjoyed how the relationship developed there. I also really liked When the Rose and Fire are one. With some of the more well known fics like the chocolate series and cambiare podentes(although the plot for this one doesnt appeal to me now at all) I enjoyed the first half but usually found the second half to drag a bit. I read everything by Dementordelta, Raewhit and Loupgarou1750, Perverse idyll, pir8fancier back then :)

Any recs would be greatly appreciated!

Cheers.
