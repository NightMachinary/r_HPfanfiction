I know they exist, but I don't have any bookmarked, and I'd prefer well written ones. Are there any AUs where the Founders took interests in students with particular talents, rather than personalities? Like there would still be core subjects, but students shown to have great potential in transfigeration, like James and McGonagall must've had, would be put into, say, Gryffindor, where there is a heavier focus on it. Neville would still have to go to wand classes, but imagine how much happier he'd be if he were able to focus on herbology a lot more. Harry would actually be able to focus on defense and combat from the start, and Ron would find his groove a lot faster

For the all rounders, that'd be Hufflepuff - taking all the rest, all the students who have a wide potential, and less potential.


** The only thing that I could find that even remotely fits your request was

linkffn(Harry Potter:The Last Avatar)

Houses are replaced with elements AU. That said this is stretching what you asked for, and its also abandoned or on a really, really, really long hiatus.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

  All wizards are born gifted in a particular branch of magic. At Hogwarts it's important for wizards to work out their speciality, for the ministry demands that they dress accordingly. Harry goes into his fourth year, unsure what his specialisation might be even as the wizarding world makes ever greater demands, until he meets a girl whose gift is her curse. Harry/Fleur. Somewhat AU

*** I this one of those fics where for all his angst about being unable to choose a specialisation, his "talent" turns out to be the best and the most powerful possible?

** This... is a good idea. I started my first HP fic recently and it's pre-Hogwarts right now (only just did chapter 2). It's AU-ish, so I think I'll use this somewhat. My system will be slightly different. The hat will take into account both personality and specializations for the decision.

So thanks for that, even though I didn't really answer you request (sorry!) If you're interested, here's mine (though Hogwarts is still several chapters away):

  Upon realizing his strange abilities, a young Harry develops them to free himself from the constraints of his hateful family. Given his importance to a world he doesn't even know exists, how will life on the streets change the Boy-Who-Lived and the destiny he is fated to have? Who can provide the love he never had?

**** And not to spoil it, but the suggestion of Gryffindor being for transfiguration specialists works really well with the Harry in my fic and McGonagall's role in Harry's life (once she catches him anyway). So thanks again, and I hope my writing isn't unbearable for you (I need a Beta to Britishize dialogue). xD

****** Nope, no bashing planned! I've had my fill of those myself. However, that's not to say no one will have to grow after messing up and others may be hoisted by their own petard. But at the end of the day, I'd prefer only Tom and his goons be irredeemable. Greedy Dumbledore and endlessly dickish (or deceptive) Ron are too common and silly. Though sad to say the Ron being a dick thing is kind of canon Ron's depiction, lol.

And I appreciate the kind words~
