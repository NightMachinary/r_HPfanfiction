as the title says, is there a fanfiction of his fix of the cursed child? or something similar?

if you don't know what I'm talking about, here are the 2 videos that you SHOULD watch because they are genuinely interesting.

Thanks!


** I stopped at the toffee twist because exchanging one bad fanfic for another is not worth it. That whole idea feels just as out of character as the AU Snape we got instead. :-/
