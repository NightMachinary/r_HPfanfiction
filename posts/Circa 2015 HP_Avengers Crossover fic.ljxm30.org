:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Around 2015, I read a fic where Harry, with the whole Master of Death thing, got shoved into a different reality. I don't remember much, but it was kinda angsty and at some point Harry tries to un-alive himself, but his body heals itself bc he can't die. I also remember that Harry was really close with Bruce Banner? I can't find it anywhere, I've looked through ff.net and a03 and I see tons of similar ones, but not THE one.

** So, not sure if any of these is the one you want, but this is my collection of HP Avengers crossovers:

Hyliian Adrift 1: Recalibration [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7151309]] Completed

"The Asset had been without a handler for four days, six hours, twenty-seven minutes and fifteen seconds. A newspaper it had found in a bin seemed to suggest that it had not only relocated itself physically, but temporally as well, seeing as how the last time its handler had removed it from cryostasis had been 2011, not 1980."

Hyliian Adrift 2: Rewired [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7208333]] Completed

"Lord Slytherin had been acting erratic and increasingly illogical for the past few weeks. He had not given the Asset a single command in nine days, twenty-one hours, seventeen minutes and four seconds. According to protocol, Lord Slytherin was no longer its Primary Handler. The Asset wondered if Lord Slytherin was aware of this. *Sequel to Recalibration.*"

Hyliian Adrift 3: Recommissioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7365097]] Completed

One thing the Asset had known, without its handlers having to tell it so, was that there will always be someone willing to pay to have someone else killed. So far, even in this new world and new time, this had held true. The Asset had breathed reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering long before it had become the Fist of Hydra. Before the Winter Soldier had been Hydra's attack dog, it had been Призрак, the Ghost of Russia. When given an inkling of choice, the Asset would always choose subtlety. There was a reason the Asset was at its most lethal from miles away. Sequel to Rewired

tielan Avengers Wizarding World 2: How To Ask A Girl To The Yule Ball [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7350724]] Completed

It occurs to Steve that he might have started with some small talk. Only Maria doesn't do small talk. Their last conversation stayed innocuous for two sentences before she asked him what he wanted and he made up some question that she knew wasn't what he wanted and so she answered it and he had to go away again.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 1: Finding Home [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/413495]] Completed

When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 2: The Letter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8193983/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427446]] Completed

Oneshot in the Finding Home!verse. The problems grow as Harry receives a letter. It's been eight years after all.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 3: Difference of Opinion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8198799/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/429134]] Completed

Oneshot in the Finding Home!verse. Things get explosive when Harry breaks the bad news. All Harry can think is: why me?

cywsaphyre Finding Home 4: Choices [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195160/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427957]] Completed

Oneshot in the Finding Home!verse. In a war, there are always sides, and choices must be made. Some choices are easy. Others, not so much.

orphan_account (LockedOwle) Falling Skies [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/709133]] Declared Dead In-Progress June 23, 2013

"Dark lords and alien invasions are the least of Harry's worries. The world won't end if he has anything to say about it. Approved sequel to cywsaphyre's Finding Home. No Slash."

Aytheria Misunderstandings 'Verse 2: Misunderstandings and An Alien Invasion [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6304756]] Completed

"*""A giant of a man wearing what looked like the American flag as some sort of armour was storming towards him from the ground. From above, a red and gold flying metal robot dove towards them. And directly in front of him, an alien struggled through the wreckage of its hovercraft with a snarl and a deadly looking gun.* *Sometimes he had to pause a moment to wonder how he got himself into these situations.""*"

cywsaphyre Wanderer 2: Wanderer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/]] Declared Dead In-Progress August 13, 2017 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431643]] Declared Dead In-Progress June 16, 2012

Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

*** Whispering Darkness Strangers in Bars [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8329787/1/]] Completed

Everyone else was avoiding the strange man but Harry felt himself drawn to him. His loud, archaic speech and enthusiastic drinking seemed to be off-putting to most people but to the Gryffindor it felt comfortingly familiar how different the man was.

Whispering Darkness Beyond Secrets [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9292567/1/]] Completed

He wasn't a threat here -- he wasn't an issue. Just a bystander - someone who didn't know what was really going on here. Except that Harry did know -- he knew enough, because he knew Bruce and he knew lies and he knew being hunted and in the end this was Bruce's choice. One-shot.

hctiB-notsoB I See The Moon [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/]] In-Progress January 18, 2015

Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

cywsaphyre Of Strangers and Friends [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8253391/1/]] Declared Dead In-Progress August 13, 2017 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/443303]] Declared Dead In-Progress June 28, 2012

Five times Tony Stark crossed paths with Harry Potter and the last time that never really ended.

The Plot Bunny Whisperer Deus Ex Machina [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10983547/1/]] Completed

(Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork. [One-Shot]

Whispering Darkness Fly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8330170/1/]] Completed

Harry fled his past, flew away from the shadows that still haunted him. Steve had his own futuristic foes to battle. And even Fury wasn't sure how to go about debriefing a supposed mythical creature. Rated for Fury's coarse language.

ShunKickShunKers My Name Is Yasha Romanov [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10303864/1/]] In-Progress July 23, 2017

Sirius found baby Harry first and asked the Black Widow to keep an eye on him while he dealt with Peter. Unfortunately, he never came back and Harry Potter disappeared from the wizardly world. Ten years later, Yasha Romanov receives a letter from Hogwarts...Rated T to be safe.

TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel Transfer Student [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1370410]] Deleted In-Progress March 29, 2014

"Phil Coulson is not actually a wizard. No one at Hogwarts notices."

Steelbadger A New Man [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/]] In-Progress March 27, 2016

Torn from his family and lost in an unfamiliar world Harry Potter will fight with all he has to return to them. He has to navigate self-absorbed geniuses, secretive government agencies, megalomaniacal Norse gods and a huge green rage monster if he is to find his home. Post-epilogue story.

WhisperingDarkness All Hallow's Eve - New York [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020]] Completed

"Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit."

Morta's Priest Wand and Shield [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/]] In-Progress July 22, 2015

The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

CJaMes12 Harry Potter and the Aftermath [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8282970/1/]] Completed

Who can walk away from a title like 'The Master of Death?
