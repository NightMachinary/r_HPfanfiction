:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember almost every detail of this fic, but I can't find it. Harry dies and is sent back in time. He arrives in first year, and instead of being smart about it, he murders Quirell right in front of everyone in the Great Hall. Dumbledore sends him to Azkaban (I think Harry used an unforgivable). During the brief time Harry was at Hogwarts he befriended Hermione. After he's sent to Azkaban, he somehow escapes with Sirius and they flee the country. During his time away, he sends yearly gifts to Hermione (rare books and so on) and keeps an eye on her somehow. At the end of her Hogwarts career, Hermione poses as some random woman, and hunts Harry down.

Any help would be appreciated.

** You should probably post this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] as they might know about it.

*** The request for this fic was posted in Harmony & Co originally which is bigger and has most of the redditors from that sub in it already. We're pretty sure the fic was deleted which is why no one can find it.

** I vaguely remember reading this same story, and I can't remember the title for the life of me. I do remember an additional detail; I'm pretty certain Harry and Sirius are living on a tropical island when Hermione finds them.
