I am in need of some marauder era (or marauder-related) fanfiction... I've already read TLAT, Shaken Not Stirred and The Shoebox Project, and am currently reading The Lost Generation. Has anyone got any to recommend?


** set in the marauder era, although not really focusing on them specifically, and also one of my all time favourite fics.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it. (Fifth year COMPLETE.)

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013]]) This one uses the premise of a triwizard tournament happening when the marauders were at school. Remus/Sirius, funny dialogue and well fleshed-out characters. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) This one is plot-heavy written from many different points of view. It's set just after the marauders finish school.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

#+begin_quote
  War is looming over the witches and wizards who graduated in 1978. Thrust into an exciting world where you party hard, find a job, take care of your friends and take love where you find it, they quickly learn that this is not all there is to life. Everything turns sour as they are faced with increasing paranoia, traitors from within, and morbid revelations about Voldemort's soul. Can the wizarding world be saved from the Death Eaters, or will they all go down fighting?My take on the first wizarding war and the rise of the Order of the Phoenix. The story follows many different characters and their experiences in the war and is written from different points of view. OCs are kept to a minimum and will not play big roles in the story. Canon-compliant to begin with, but turns into a horcrux hunt starting from chapter 25.
