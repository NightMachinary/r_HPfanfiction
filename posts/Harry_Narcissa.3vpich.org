This is a short romance story. Unfortunately the author ships Draco/Narcissa mainly.

As if that family isn't dysfunctional enough.

**** Is the family dysfunctional in canon? Mostly it's just Voldemort coming in and flinging death threats around.

***** Yeah the only real dysfunction I remember is the stereotypical elitist rich-family stuff like "we need to be perfect" and Lucius being the belittling father of a spoiled brat.

** This is actually one of my favorite pairings... not particularly sure why or what that says.... but anyway. Here are a couple of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766122/1/Ladies-and-Gentlemen][Ladies and Gentlemen]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3418412/mrs-milfoy][Mrs. Malfoy]] - I find the final scene and last bit of dialogue to be particularly enjoyable.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10990939/1/Why-are-you-in-my-house][Why are you in my house?]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6309912/Hyperopia][Hyperopia]] - I thought this one started off fairly good, but then the author just kept going with it. I think the story would have been better served having been ended sooner, but it's still fairly good.

*** I liked Ladies and Gentlemen a lot, but I disliked Hermione's attitude towards Ginny and Harry's relationship.

**** I've often found that Hermione is a hard character to write, if not one of the hardest. I'm not even sure that JK Rowling did it perfectly 100% of the time.

***** The series was so wonderful when I was growing up, but trying to reread them is awful. Harry's The-Boy-Who-Was-Dense; Hermione is a nosy, obnoxious bitch; Ron has so many negative character traits that I struggle to list them all. In fact, almost every major character in the book has some major character flaw that is their defining feature. Maybe I've just read too much fanfiction and it jumps off the page to smack me in between the eyes.

****** I've found that reading fan fiction has increased my love for the Harry Potter universe while at the same time actually lessening my enjoyment of the original works. For me, what has happened is that fan fiction provides so many options and opportunities to find that "one true telling" that no single telling is able to compete - even the original. AND, if I can't find a story that's just perfect - I can write one myself. I've not gone back and re-read the original series in a number of years, specifically to preserve my fond memories of them.

****** KUDOS TO YOU - no, really: Finally someone who agrees with that sentiment!

I mean characters having flaws is ok (it's even recommended, because it makes them more real as all living people have flaws!), but having characters so flawed that in reality they'd be outcasts (or dead - I mean Harry being a damned slacker should have gotten him killed in year 5 at the very latest IMHO, if not way way earlier!) with no one liking them at all isn't great either! (hell, even teachers normally don't like someone (like Hermione) who always wants to impress them, gives them double (or more) stuff to read and correct and is annoying in class (not taking part in the lesson is something teachers hate, but always needing to be the one to answer a question is also annoying) - not that they like the opposite (slackers!) any better (Ron, Harry), much less if they break the rules quite often...though: Don't get me started on the teachers -.- the only teachers I remotely like are Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout (McGee loses because she always parrots (she's not showing any initiative what so ever) Dumbledore and doesn't at least check on the stone in year one and doesn't confiscate Malfoy's badges in GOF and because she tells Harry to "keep his head down" in year 5, Snape is awful at best, negligent and dangerous at worst and he's a bully to boot, Hagrid is dangerous to the class, can't follow a syllabus and frankly can't teach anyway (monster book of monsters anyone? -.-)...and we don't know enough about the others IMHO))

*** Looking at mrs.milfoy's profile, I'm extremely happy to stumble onto the realization that Narcissa can be paired with Snape. Why didn't I think of this sooner? Thanks for linking it! :D
