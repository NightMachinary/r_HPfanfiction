**** That's a bit of an unfair thing to say without any evidence either way of Yudkowsky's actual intelligence. As I understand it, he was an extremely precocious youth, if nothing else. My impression is that he /is/ in fact of vastly-above average intelligence, simply with an ego that is larger still.

***** Well I for one laughed out loud at the all-caps description of his intellect. Don't get me wrong, he's very smart, doubtless in the 99th percentile on standardized tests and such.

But it's a humorous way to describe him because of how much it'd appeal to his inflated ego, which is very much on display in his writing.

****** I'd argue that quite a bit of the science is vastly misrepresented, in that GCSE level lies to children sort of way. It feels like the author has assumed that because he knows slightly more than average, he's now an expert and therefore anyone who disagrees is wrong. This is particularly true of all the genetics, which use an extremely simplistic model. This would be completely forgivable for the character, who is after all 11, but the authors notes confirm the authors views on the science.

Edit: have a read of this, it's a fun read:

******* Haha, yes that was a fun read, thanks!

I'm generally not a huge fan of trying to come up with science-based interpretations for magic. It's what turned me off of MoR even though I love the idea of a Genius!Harry experimenting with magic.

Like, I feel like it'd be more interesting to mine concepts in philosophy, particularly metaphysics, rather than physics or biology, with respect to magic. Because if you're taking a scientific materialist perspective, there's really no good way to fit magic in, which MoR was proof of for me. Magic is just too impossible given what we know about physics.

***** From what I've seen it was definitely very removed from reality. If that Harry was a student, we'd at the very least be beaten up for being an annoying shit. His overall concept might have been "intelligent", but trying to pass the human interactions as believable is proof of a very low emotional intelligence (or a complete disregard for anyone but him).

****** We're not talking about Harry here, we're talking about the /writer/ and whether /he/ is an extremely intelligent person or not.

(As for Harry, it is acknowledged in story that for all his book smarts he is in fact rather clueless about people and their emotions, quite quickly. There's a rather excellent scene where Snape tries to gauge his opinion of the whole James and Lily business and he can only answer in terms of movie tropes and generally makes a mess of it, losing Snape's respect for good.)

******** I... don't see how? Yudkowsky set out to write an ultimately benevolent, but often overconfident and (to some) annoying child-prodigy with munchkin tendencies. He succeeded. Your point is?

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
