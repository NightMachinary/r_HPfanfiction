Voldemort's killing-curse rips off three shards from Harry's soul, that fly away and joins the soul of three girls, making them Harry's soul-mates. Pretty sure one of the girls is Hermione.

Edit: I'm pretty sure it starts with a description of how Voldemort casts the killing-curse, how three bits of soul gets ripped off and flies off in different directions, and how they each finds a girl capable of nurturing it.


** Linkffn(soul scars) sounds like the one you want

**** Surprising that's the only one I can think of with that premise. Hope you find the right one then

** I also came here to say that it was linkffn(12501270) like Aniki did. The Killing curse rips off three shards of Harry's soul and they get sent to Hermione Susan and Daphne. The first chapter even has Dumbledore arriving to explain it to the Grangers and asks Hermione to "Cherish and care for it as if it were your own".

So if it is not that story then it seems almost amazing the similarities

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.
