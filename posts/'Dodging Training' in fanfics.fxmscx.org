Many fanfictions appear to have pure-blood children from more well-off families be more naturally good at dodging in duelling because of their ballroom dancing lessons (unless your name is Neville Longbottom, of course). Not that I'm against that in any way, but why do we never see (at least I never saw) more hardcore duelist families give ballet lessons to their children? It's certainly more physically demanding than waltz or quadrille and would better develop flexibility. It's also noble enough to not be too out-of-place for, say, Ice Queen!Daphne Greengrass or The Smoothest Eleven Year-Old!Blaise Zabini so used in fanfiction. What's your two cents on the subject?


** Do they? That's odd. Ballroom dance is a modern muggle invention.

I can see wizards having their own dance traditions, possibly in common with pre-Statute of Secrecy muggles. But if wizards want their kids to be good at dueling, they'd give them dueling lessons. It's standard for rich muggle kids to get martial arts lessons, so it should be standard for rich wizard kids to get training in wizarding martial arts.

*** They also give them duelling lessons, but the dance lessons are to help with their balance and keeping an image of effortless elegance.

**** Rich people could pick any difficult art, ballet for example, to make their kids look distinctively rich and cultured. There's no reason they would pick ballet over other arts, though.

I dance in a lot of different styles, and it's always funny to see a dancer who obviously has ballet training trying to dance in some other style, since they're generally very bad at it. Ballet turnout is inappropriate and looks stupid when applied to other dance forms. Ballet training doesn't confer generic physical grace, it just marks someone as having paid for a lot of ballet training.

** Why would you give your kids ballet lessons to make them better duellists if you could give them actual lessons in how to move to be a hard target to hit instead? Much more efficient. Also, unless ballet is a thing in the Wizarding World, it would be a muggle pastime.

*** I would be very surprised if modern waltz, which was developed after the Statute of Secrecy, would be considered a proper pure-blood dance but ballet, which was introduced in many royal courts during the sixteenth and seventeenth century, would be considered a mere Muggle pastime.

**** Me too. But I would be surprised if ballet were considered a thing among wizards and witches.

** I have my doubts on the efficacy of dodging in magical combat. Besides that, I doubt authors who view dancing as practical for dodging practice thought it through beyond "this would be cool". Ballet would most certainly not be a good way to train dodging. Seriously, excellent pointe technique is not going to save you from a killing curse to the chest. I suspect it also allows authors to bring in some pureblood superiority doctrine for wish fulfillment.

*** I think it's more about the balance and gracefulness and ease-of-movement type stuff than the actual moves themselves. I don't know if I agree or disagree that it would work - I'm not a fighter or a dancer, so I have no point of reference to judge - but I'd assume that's the logic of it.

** One day someone will dodge a curse and their best friend who had been standing behind them will die leading people to come to the conclusion that it's a terrible trope most of the time.

*** It is canon, actually. In the graveyard duel, Harry jumps behind a tombstone and Voldemort's Killing Curse misses him.

Whether that is dodging after a spell is cast or dodging as it is cast to be a harder target does not matter. Moving to be harder to hit is canon and works even against Voldemort.
