Like Voldemort still goes by Tom Riddle in public. He mingles with the rich purebloods to form connections. Dumbledore is on the height of his fame since he defeated Grindelwald in 1945 (Voldemort is 19 btw when that happens)

Just give me a oneshot about a 20 year old Lord Voldemort (who is still a looker bit creepy because of the Horcruxes he's already made) standing amongst a few people during a party. Maybe he is fake socialising while inwardly he is super done with everything and getting another drink because how else can he survive another hour of this nonesense and 40's music is playing in the background while people are dancing and having fun. Others discuss the war like WW2 etc.
