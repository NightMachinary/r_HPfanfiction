I'm sorry for the open-ended question, but it's very rare I find fics that genuinely entertain me without making me gag at the quality of the writing or the plot. I hope if there are others who have read this fic and were similarly impressed, that they could offer recs that are of similar quality.

​

Particularly I'm really enjoying the lack of bashing, the creativity of the plot overall and the fact that the characters feel real and not like absurd caricatures(tho to be fair the fact that it's taking place during the fifth year, my favorite one in canon, probably has something to do with it too; Sirius, Tonks, the Order, all of these things are some of my favorite in the HP universe). I know this is quite the high standard, but I'm hopeful still... Thank you. I will link the fic in the comments.


** linkffn(The Second String) Starts from the same premise of being kissed by a Dementor. The consequent time travel and mystery is creatively explored. There is no gallivanting with Mauraders or any such cliché tropes. The characters and the world feels real in a way that most fics fail to depict. There is a reasonable explanation for the time travel. Must-read even if you are discouraged by the summary/pairing or the initial pretending-to-be-a-squib subplot.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

***** Romance is not a focus though. The ffn version is quite tame and pairing breaks up soon after its formed. Its mostly a background thing.

******* The second String is hands down, the absolute best fic I've ever read. It was brilliant. Tense and funny and scary and heartbreakingly sad. It's so well paced, so many cool twists and tops. Honest, you'd be mad not to read it.

It's has a slash pairing but it's not a slash fic. There's no romance or pining. Gideon isn't even in half the fic. And when he does come in, he really balances Harry's stern character. It adds so much tension with the secret and it's genuinely adorable.

I'm not overly fond of slash either but this story uses the relationship as a plot device. It's barely a focus of the story at all and in the few times it is, it is used to develop character. Please dont let such a small part of the story stop you from enjoying the rest.

Again, Gideon doesn't show up till half way through and there no slash up till that point. Id recommend reading even just the first half and if the pairing really ruins it for you then, fine. But this story is so so worth the read I cannot express it enough. It was brilliant.

** linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is a well written fic that I really enjoyed? I thought the characters and drama were honestly great I had a really fun time!

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) is also absolutely fantastic but a Wolfstar fic so probably not your thing. Worth the read though.

Everything by TheDivineComedian is brilliant, they are truly an incredible writer. They do a lot of Black family stories. All of which are fantastic. This has the best Regulus so I'll link this one but rlseriously, read all of them linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian). Edit:: I've checked and apperently this is tagged RL/SB but there's no slash in it I don't know why that's there... Sure their other work isn't slash anyway so check out their other work!

linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) was also veeery well done. Very very well written but jesus it's quite dark. It's a Handmaid's tale esque story so mind yourself reading it it gets dark. The characters are quite OOC I thought but it really worked for the world they were in. Good stuff 😊

linkao3(The Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) is a oneshot about Sirius and Orion Black and it's absolutely fantastic. Orion is terrifying. Really worth the read.

I'm like you, I'm picky about what I read, it has to be good. These are all brilliant. I don't feel bad about reccing them.

The Second String and recommended before is also completely worth it 😊 but if you are really antislash then the above are all slash free (bar ATYD but read that anyway 😋)

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
