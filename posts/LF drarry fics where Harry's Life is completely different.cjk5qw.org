Hi! Im looking for fics where Harry is generally raised differently- or maybe even raised the same, but coming out with a different personality? Like maybe he becomes more cunning or something?? idk.. Anything like this would be much appreciated!

** If you've got a bunch of time on your hands, the Saving Connor Potter series would probably fit, though it's focused more on plot than it is on Drarry.
