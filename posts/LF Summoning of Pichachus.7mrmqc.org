I'm looking for a story I found that had a Harry that didn't care. He ended up making some doom potion (think it was related to Shakespeare) that caused the pichachus to appear.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
