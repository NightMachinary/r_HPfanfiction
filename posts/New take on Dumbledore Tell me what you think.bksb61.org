There is no story in wich i have seen a logical but not evil reason for Dumbledore second chances and non lethal predisposition that actually is reasonable in my opinion. My idea was that in his youth when he first took his teaching position in Hogwarts he was the last to take an oath to always protect the students. Now a few years later in the war he is older and he is set in his ways and actually sees every combatant as a student still, and the oath forces him to protect them. With this idea in mind most of his actions could be explained, including his hands off aproach. Tell me what you think.


** I think the reason he gives people second chances is very simple - he himself fell sway to a future Dark Lord and hateful ideology in his youth. He knows from personal experience that people /can/ change for the better, and I believe that in offering others some amount of forgiveness, he is trying to assuage his own guilt.

As for not using lethal force, the only time we see him do that is during the Ministry battle with Voldemort, right? That may well be a special case, given that he knows Voldemort has Horcruxes and is therefore functionally immortal.

*** He should still have given it his all (including any "dark" magic he learned in his youth!), why? Because it would show Voldemort's followers that he can be beaten (if Dumbledore wins!), not to mention giving them time to actually prepare for war (destroy the bones of the father and you might even gain more time, because Voldemort would have to devise another ritual to regain a body!)

** He simply genuinely believes people can change for the better. He himself was once fully on board with Grindlewald's "Crush the muggles and conquer the world, we'd do a much better job of it, so really it's all in the name of the greater good" ideas, he may even be the reason his sister is dead, and yet he managed to turn himself around.\\
Then there's Snape, and while he's still a petty arsehole he has taken that second chance and is genuinely on the right side.

Then there's the fact his second chances attitude doesn't really seem to extend to many people, the only person we really see getting away with things because of it is Draco, and Dumbledore didn't think he could bring death eaters into the school, he thought Draco was just trying to kill him, and he's doomed to die by the year's end anyway, so why not give the boy a chance.

We only see one example of him refusing to kill, and that's against Voldemort, a man he knows to be immortal and his response is that there are worse fates than death. I've always interpreted that as him having a plan to somehow incapacitate Voldemort indefinitely if he won that fight.

I interpret it in a perhaps more prosaic manner: Dumbledore is saying what is necessary to conceal the fact that he knows about Voldemort's horcruxes.

Strategically, a captured and contained Voldemort (if such a thing is possible) is superior to a disembodied Voldemort who is free to return to his followers and arrange for a new body.
