I've read Mystical Magicians stories 100s of times and I can't find any other good fics that are completed. I neeeeeed that nostalgia back! Almost all the good ones have been abandoned. Doesn't necessarily have to be from ff.net, can be from ao3 or any other websites.


** Also, any Draco/Ginny pairing recs would be appreciated!
