Would prefer to see Harry gaining an amount of control of his magic. No Drarry or Tomarry please.


** Tb_ll57: Crow Rides A Pale Horse - series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/632600]]

It's a mature story where things grow dark and the stakes are high after the first fic of the series. I still feel touched by things that happen in it. Contains a slash relationship, but not the ones you don't want.

  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.
