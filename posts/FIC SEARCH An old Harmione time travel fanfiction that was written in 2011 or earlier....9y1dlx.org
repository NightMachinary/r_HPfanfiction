So I was reading a fanfic the other day and it reminded me of the first fanfic I ever read way back in 2011. I've been searching for a couple of hours but can't seem to find it anywhere... Basically it starts after the war (possibly quite a while after) where Ron has become a git and kills Hermione and Harry. God or something appears in front of Harry when he dies and sends him back to his first year where everything plays out quite differently. It's a Harmione story but I literally can't find it anywhere. :/ PLEASE HELP


** This fits any fic that follows the Reptilia28 challenge and even beyond that this concept is super common in HHr fics. You'll need to come up with something more defining.

*** yeah I know, I've been looking at them but none of them seem to start with Ron killing Hermione and Harry... And that challenge is about Voldemort killing Harry during the Battle of Hogwarts if I'm not mistaken? That's not really what happened in this story but the concept of going back in time is pretty much the same. I'm not sure if this is correct or could even be of any help, but I believe in this fanfic Ron revealed he had a dark mark before he killed Hermione and Harry.
