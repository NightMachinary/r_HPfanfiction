At the top of the tower, just as Snape is about to kill Dumbledore, Draco, knowing what was about to happen, stuns him. In the confusion of it all, Draco picked up Dumbledore's wand and just as Snape falls, throws it to Dumbledore who swiftly catches it and turns it on the Death Eaters.

Any story with such a premise? Could be interesting how events unfold from thereon, how Dumbledore and Snape reacts, fate of his parents. And of course how Harry would react to all this.


** If you find anything I'd be interested. I don't think Draco has the guts to do this but I'd love to have someone persuade me that he could.

*** He knows of Snape's unbreakable wow, Dumbledore just promised him mercy and safety to his family. While it is a stretch, I think, if taken care how it is written, can be quite canon-believable.

** you know I don't think I have. It's a good thing to think about though. Draco does behave much like a Gryffindor at times---to the point that I find his instant sorting really unbelievable---and it would be interesting to see him have a split second of courage earlier in the war

*** I don't think being in Slytherin means inability to be brave. Can you imagine the guts it must take for Snape to meet Voldemort every single time? Knowing that any moment could be he last?

Even Slughorn showed courage at times, cowardly though he is.

**** Oh I definitely don't think that at all. It's the way he does a lot of things that mirrors Ron's behaviour in a lot of ways. In my headcanon the reason Dobby is such a fan of Harry Potter the saviour of the magical world is because he and Draco read a lot of books about bravery etc and Harry's books were among them. I don't know I just think he would do well there if things were different
