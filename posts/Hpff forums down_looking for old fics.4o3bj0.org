  Anyways I wanted to ask about two fics I read on there like 2-3 years ago but I can't find in their search engines. They were both apocalyptic stories. One was a next gen about Rose, Scorpius, and an evil (or grey) Albus. Rose was the main character and she brought her brother back from the dead.

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** Also if you were curious about the forums, there was a blow up and they seem to have been closed. A group of us have started hpfanfictalk.com for people to use.
