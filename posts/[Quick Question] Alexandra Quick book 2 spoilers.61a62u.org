Hello! A quick questions to those who read book 2 about Raonake Train Crash, there is a line I didn't understand at all.

In the last chapter of The Lands Below, Ms. Grimm said "The train should have passed through, into the Lands Beyond, it hit solid ground" Now, I thought the Lands Below need to be accessed with a portal or gate or something? In any case, what does a train have to do with the Lands Below here?


** If I recall, Thorn had shut down the portal for the train to pass into the Lands Beyond and avoid muggle rail lines. It was the locomotive version of Dobby shutting down the entry to Platform 9 3/4. What in canon was a prat fall became for the Roanoke Line a terrorist attack/disaster.
