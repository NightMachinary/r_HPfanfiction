Hypothetically, if the hat has an adults mind it can more easily understand a child's memories better then they can, especially if terms they don't know are used.

Here's my example- I'm not the best writer and did this on my phone, so someone please show me up:

“Belchley, Albert!”

The pale red-headed boy trembled as he walked up the dais to sit on the three legged stool.

The wizened old sorting was plopped unceremoniously atop his head, it's floppy brim hiding his view of the great hall, and their view of him.

“Hmm oh, yes.. I see.”

“What?”

“Quick to think of your friends, and diligent too.. you would do well in Hufflepuff... but a mind as curious of yours is only suited to

“RAVENCLAW!”

McGonagall goes to pull the hat away as the crowd erupts into cheers. Just before the hat is pulled away though, Albert just barely catches its parting words, “Also your parents are getting a divorce and you're probably adopted”

Albert is stunned, for a moment before Headmistress McGonagall all but pushes him towards the cheering table, drowning out his cry of “What!?” As his uniform colors turn to blue and bronze.

Headmistress McGonagall glares at the sorting hat in her hand who only offers a wry grin before calling out the next name.”

** "Slytherin!" "Although, I always thought that Lucius Malfoy deserved Azkaban for life." Said the sorting hat, to the enraged Draco Malfoy.

So many drabbles you can do with something like this. The potential...

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
