****** Dislike the characters, the plot, and the setting.

Characters: super angsty Harry, adult Harry who acts childish, adult Harry who spends his time with kids and has romantic feelings towards 11-year-olds.

Plot: completely illogical and full of rehash filler, there's no reason for Harry to be hanging out at Hogwarts reliving events with minor variations. He should have gone AWOL to horcrux hunt as soon as he got a wand. Or as an alternative, just told Dumbledore everything.

Setting: the magic is incredibly boring at best, rage inducing at worst. Point and shoot, dodge and shield, training dummies, magical cores sort of stuff. Given that a large amount of the fic is focused on "training" (and the use of the word training instead of studying always indicates bad things to come), this is a serious problem.

The author comes up with contrived in-story reasons to justify stuff like the hanging out with kids, going through all the rehash etc. but they're just excuses. The author didn't have to write a story full of rehash, they wanted to, then came up with an arbitrary reason to justify it in-story. No one is buying it.

****** I think this mechanic is used most often in fanfic to make Harry look bad, often a kind of "Slytherins are just misunderstood" rehabilitation where Harry is made out as incredibly naive.

As I identify primarily with Harry, I'll generally perceive this as a personal attack and dislike it accordingly.

Not to mention it's a dirty trick. In canon, Slytherins aren't just misunderstood... they genuinely /are/ House Evil, with very rare exceptions. Changing that canon fact without changing Harry's canonical perception of Slytherin accordingly is just character assassination.

******* Mmh, I don't know if it's specifically to make him look bad/naive; at least, in the majority of the 'fics I've read with alternate perspectives, I haven't really seen them as having that as their goal. But, then, I suspect we probably tend to read different 'fics. :)

Regarding it being a "dirty trick"... I think it's important to keep in mind that the majority of our canon facts /are/ Harry's canonical perceptions -- it's possible for the "fact" (in a fanfic, of course) to be different from canon than what Harry's perception of the situation is, without either of them being "wrong" (or at least inconsistent).

Taking Slytherin -- we know Harry perceives them all as evil. But how do they perceive themselves? (Most people don't think of themselves as 'bad guys', after all.) And both of their perceptions -- Harry's and Random Joe Slytherin's -- can be valid at the same time; they just emphasize different things, and each include some pieces of knowledge that the other doesn't have (and that, if the other DID have, may change their perception of the matter).

Taking a concrete canon example: Harry thought Snape was evil -- but it turned out there were things he didn't know about Snape that showed he was not evil. Harry was certainly justified in thinking Snape was evil (he had many, MANY good reasons!), but he ultimately changed his mind when presented with new facts that he was previously unaware of, at the end of DH.

A fanfic that is, again as an example, from Dumbledore's point of view (who knows the truth of Snape, but also doesn't have Snape's biases against Harry) of the situation would necessarily show a very different light on things that happened between Snape and Harry than Harry's point of view does in canon.

It doesn't make Harry naive to think Snape is evil; his conclusion, based on the facts he has available to him, is perfectly reasonable. But it does mean he doesn't have */all/* the facts available to him.

...

I'm not sure that what I'm trying to say is coming across very clearly; am I making sense here?

********** Especially with the revelations in DH. We learn that Snape's only real motivation for siding with the good guys is his "love" of Lily Potter.

He doesn't actually believe in the cause. Snape remains a believer in pure-blood supremacy, it's just that he has a personal grudge against Voldemort because of Lily's death. You see this all the way through the books: his treatment of Hermione for being Muggleborn, the way he prefers the company of people like the Malfoys, his choice of friends while he was at school. Snape was a racist. He just so happened to an enemy of an enemy.

He certainly doesn't care about Harry's survival for Harry's own sake. Again, the only motivation was his "love" for Lily, and that didn't transfer to Harry: when he went to Dumbledore, he tried to bargain for Lily's life without caring about Harry or James. And it's not necessary to mention his treatment of Harry throughout the books. Snape himself explicitly recognises that he doesn't care at all for Harry, only Lily, when pensieve!Dumbledore asks him about it and he conjures his Doe Patronus (implying he was still doing it for Lily, not Harry).

Snape's certainly an arsehole as well as evil, though. No more on this needs to be said than pointing to the time Hermione's teeth were enlarged by a hex and Snape said "I see no difference". Adult deliberately undermining a teenage girl's body image. Go Snape? Do that to the right (or rather, wrong) person and you've got a suicide on your hands. An honourable mention also goes to his continued attempts to get Sirius Black killed, even after Snape knows he's innocent.

Harry and Dumbledore seem to admire Snape simply because of his love motivation. To Dumbledore, it's not possible to be motivated by love and evil. I disagree with this fundamentally. People can do terrible things for love. Plus, I have major doubts over whether Snape loved Lily. He was obsessed by her, certainly. But love her? I don't think so. Not once does he show any kind of consideration for Lily's happiness, nor respect for her world view. Snape is entirely selfish with regards to Lily: he wants her as a possession, not a partner.

Winston Smith, Arthur Dent, Frodo Baggins, and Harry Potter are all examples of this. Some people just find it hard to identify with normal.

******* The point, as I see it, of a fanfic, is to tell a fascinating story set in the world of the original novel. Which character is the main one is irrelevant if it's a good story. I am a fan of the world JKR created, not of Harry Potter himself and I don't understand why people are so fixated with him (especially since Ender is a somewhat better version of the exact same character). It isn't as if he's particularly interesting.

So, it doesn't work that way for everyone. And looking at the sheer numbers, over 70% of the fans agree with me.

******* I... hadn't noticed that before. I have always had difficulty identifying or imprinting on Harry. Even as a young child near to him in age I always day dreamed my way into the world as another character who was not Harry. Harry could never have been me, the Dursleys were clearly not on enough kinds of fire for Harry to be me. I couldn't manage sufficient mental gymnastics for that until I was significantly older. weird.

I wonder if that's why Ron, the only main character who's role I could probably have pulled off, pissed me off so GD much whenever he acted like a dingbat.

Plenty of stories juggle multiple storylines and a huge cast of characters, and rely more on you becoming invested in the world--if only a single protagonist mattered, half the story wouldn't be emotionally accessible.

******* I don't see any controversy. Teens are bundles of hormones who likely go through multiple shallow relationships based almost entirely on physical attraction.

It's quite rare for teen couples to have any real personal connection beyond wanting to make out. They haven't yet developed the adult social skills required to genuinely think of other people as subjects with their own agency, a necessary precondition of an adult relationship. Further, they'll still be too shy/nervous/insecure to communicate properly, and likely never even show their true self to their partner.

Generally, each partner will continue hanging out with their own circle of friends and only meet up occasionally to make out. If the circumstances are right (privacy, lack of religion, alcohol), they'll have sex, because see above: hormonal teenagers with a physical attraction. A lot less maturity is required to have sex than to have a genuine relationship.

In the vast majority of cases, teens are simply too immature to grasp the nature of an adult relationship that goes beyond the honeymoon period. That kind of relationship requires your partner to basically be your best friend, someone who you can trust and who you know inside out, as well as they know themselves... it's the only way to survive cohabitation with someone XD
