Looking for a fic that starts GoF or after and has Draco change into a good person and not be an arsehole. Don't care about other friendships that may form or break I just want a genuinely good redemption story. Not worried about pairings as lomg as it isn't a slash story or HP/GW because gin gin's a bitch and I don't like her. Hoping for some really good character development to build Draco back up.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]) is my favorite Draco redemption story. It is book-canon compliant. Draco gets caught up in some postwar stuff and has to live for a few years as a muggle before he can rejoin the wizarding world.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
