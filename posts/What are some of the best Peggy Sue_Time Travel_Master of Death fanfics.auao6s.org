Title. Crossovers welcome


** I'm quite fond of the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] where Harry is sent back in time due to a drapery accident (it was very traumatic).

The claim that his scar is great at divination (not him, his scar) allows quite a few shenanigans.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

**** BLINDNESS SPOILERS

That idea reminds me of Blindness where Harry eventually is like "Death is a wonderful thing. It is a shame that they would never be able to recognize that beforehand. He recognizes it as a good thing, but he understands that other people aren't capable of that understanding.

***** I always imagined Harry understanding death the way old people tend to do - as anatural part of life that everyone gets to in their own way but still a good bye. My issue with her is that you get the idea that she thinks of death as kind of like video game deaths where the characters just resurrect from the last save point. She doesn't see people as real but instead as lesser characters there to serve as background for her adventures so it doesn't matter if they die. It's very off putting.

****** I believe that that is the whole point. In any case it's fourth-wall breaking by poking fun at the incongruencies of the Canon storyline. Very few characters are well developed and so they stay undeveloped even in the face of a literal god because some higher power (Rowling) made these not-people to fill in the story.

********* Empathy is not a two way street - being empathetic does not impact whether you in turn will be treated with empathy. Does she lack it because no one taught it to her? Maybe, but it still makes it hard for me to like or even tolerate the character.

I don't know if it's the writer wanting to be artistic or deep or whatever, I didn't like the character and if I don't like the character, I don't read the story. It sucks because it's a very long series and the writer is technically good (good grammar, pacing, etc.) it's just the character that is off putting.

** If you want a more crack-fic style fic, Gryffindor's Never Die is a favorite of mine, where Harry and Ron are pretty much frat boys who revel in violence to cope with the trauma of their miserable lives.

No bashing but neither Ron or Harry are happy with Hermione and Ginny at the start, though it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the story.

Ends with canon pairings, though any shipping is pretty background. Also they try to not be gross with the mental age difference.
