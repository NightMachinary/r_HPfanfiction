I've seen a few posts around recently requesting Harry/F!Voldemort, but I'm curious if there are any fics where Voldemort is a woman but doesn't get shipped or even ship-teased with Harry. It can be an AU where everything is the same but Voldemort was always a girl, a “potions accident” fic where Voldemort arises from the cauldron magically transformed into a woman, a complete gender-flip universe, or even a transgender Voldemort. I just want to read a fanfiction exploring what it means to be simultaneously a Dark Lord and a woman, and how a differently-gendered Voldemort might have an effect on both her inner circle and the greater world. For example, would her relationship with Bellatrix feel the same if they were both women? What about her relationship with the Malfoys? My only criteria is that she not be shipped with Harry in any way.

I have already read Limpieza de Sangre, which was a bit shippy for my tastes.


** LdS is probably one of the few that doesn't exactly ship them. Harry's crush on Emily is purely one-sided, though Emily does flirt back when it suits her goals.

That said, I did find a oneshot on AO3 that predates the existence of the female Tom Riddle tag, and thus has gone under most people's radars. !linkao3(Green Apple by tumblewaltz)

*** Obviously, they do not end up in a real romantic relationship, but I did not particularly enjoy reading about Harry being (one-sidedly) attracted to F!Voldemort and do not want to be recommended fics that play up this sort of relationship dynamic, even if it is ultimately not acted upon.

***** It's likely I am slightly misremembering, since I read it a while ago. I do remember thinking it was an good coming of age story and I enjoyed reading it, but I realized that Harry's one-sided adolescent attraction being used as a weapon to manipulate him was about the maximum level of “shippiness” (I have a low tolerance for romance and sexuality in HP fics in general) that I would tolerate for such a prompt. It is unlikely that someone has written a fic that treats their relationship like Limpieza de Sangre did without devolving into even more explicitly shippy territory, and I don't want to read something that apes that fic's premise anyway.
