***** But it sets up the whole 300k word story doesn't it?

So Harry is the minister, he and Ron and Hermione had a falling out and they all call each other by their last names. Draco and Harry are best friends, Hermione is apparently a shrew and who didn't have time to find her parents because she was just so busy fucking Ron ( not exaggerated), Harry defeated voldemort and his horcruxes by himself in a span of a couple of months, Harry is a Baron and lord of house Potter, black and Slytherin and this enables him to have 2 more wives, he can't fucking wait - his current wife just have him permission!!

After reading all of that ( and a couple of paragraphs of the proper main story) I just couldn't continue. Does it get better? Was the prequel fake?

*** Except that that fic is awful.

Harem, Poochie syndrome, zero conflict that Harry doesn't roflstomp, canon retcon to suit the handwaving of the author... oh, and terrible spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Guilty pleasure at best.

The other above GoT crossovers are enjoyable. I would add linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988) (not great but ok) and suggest the OP look into the FFN author DarthImperius, even though I don't like his prose style (or his tendency to rewrite his fics 2-3 times each). Lots of fics that fit the request.

Also, in a slightly different take on “ruling” consider linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild).

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.
