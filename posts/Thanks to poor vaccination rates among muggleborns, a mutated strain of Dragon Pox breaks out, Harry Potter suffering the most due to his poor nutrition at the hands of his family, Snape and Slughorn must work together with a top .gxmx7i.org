** Is vaccinations in the wizarding world actually a thing? I mean, vaccinations the way we know them require scientific knowledge that I doubt healers have, and also, they might just use healing magic if you come down with the illness rather than to use preventative injections. Not sure how well accepted it would be to puncture the skin and inject something into the human body (when they could just drink it), if they consider cutting people for surgery barbaric.

*** Also, who's to say that the vaccines aren't orally taken potions? Oral vaccines are a thing.

**** Sure, but personally I wouldn't include in a fanfiction something that's super unlikely for the type of society.

** I once read a fanfic where Harry got dragonpox as a really young kid and Snape almost killed himself finding a cure. Harry was very young and Snape wasn't raising him but he was involved. Edit: It was from the What if? Series where McGonogall and Madame Pomfret are married and raising baby Harry. It's very fluffy. I was wrong it wasn't Dragon Pox it was the flu.
