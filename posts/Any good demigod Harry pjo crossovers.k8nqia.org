I've been looking for good demigod Harry pjo crossover fics for a while now and I can't really find any I really like. . Pls no fem Harry, I can't stand a gender bend Idk why . Slash is okay is preferred cuz I really can't stand straight ships atm, either slash or no ship. No ship is preferred Idk why but I really can't stand hetero fics. .

Ik technically there is no genetics when it come to god but I can not stand some of the pjo ships, like Percy/Annabeth they're cousins. Ik gods don't have genetics or whatever but it just weirds the hell out of me when two demigods that are closely related by gods get together in the books. .

Oh absolutely no snape/Harry I can't stand that ship.

Bashing is fine, I really don't like dumbledoore No super oooc Harry, I don't mind a dark Harry or op Harry just not like super ooc

Harry finds out in 4/5th year would be good, but younger or older is fine

Harry's godly parent isn't an Obscure god

A03 is preferable I think it's better for reading but fanfic is cool too That's that


** Well, I assume you already know it since it is by far the most popular fic of this crossover, but on the off-chance you don't, here you go:

EDIT: It fits all your requirements btw.

** This isn't what you're looking for but When Wand and Sword Collide is fantastic. It's been a few year since I read it, but from what I remember there's a new prophecy and Harry and Percy get switched in a Lost Hero type deal. There's no active romance that I remember, but characters are in their canon relationships. Harry isn't a demigod, but I think he gets some kind of blessing from the greek gods. linkffn(8665858)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter wakes at Camp Half-Blood. Percy Jackson wakes at Hogwarts. Neither know who they are, where they are, or where they come from, but when dreams are invaded, prophecies are conjured and revelations arise, they discover the line between demigod and wizard is blurring. Something dark is coming, and Percy and Harry must unite with their new peers before it's too late.

** Uhm. He grows up at Camp Halfblood in Lokison. Explicit slash, a fair bit of bashing and power wank in a long (abandoned) series. The PJ section is complete, however (the MCU part is not). He's not the Harry from the books - this kid has a vastly different upbringing and it shows. So ooc or not, you pick. linkao3(4724522)

  James and Lily Potter had a secret, one which led to Thanatos saving young Harry from a dreary life with the Dursleys and changed the face of the Second British Wizarding War before it ever began.

** Damn, I just went though my bookmarks to recommend a few fics, only to notice that I don't have any Gen ones. Crazy, haven't expected that tbh

Also btw, Annabeth and Percy aren't really cousins. Poseidon is Athena's uncle, so she would be his cousin, not Annabeth.
