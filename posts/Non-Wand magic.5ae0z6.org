Looking for stories with Non-Wand magic. Wandless will be the easiest to find but I'm looking for more exotic forms of magic as well. Elementals, Artifacts, Family magics, etc. I feel these powers change a story from the every day Harry Potter to something more. Thanks in advance for the recs.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) has my favorite non-wand magic. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) has a focus on magical traditions different than that of Wizarding Britain, including some interesting 'wandless' stuff.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) goes into it in a very roundabout way, if you're open to crossovers with Lord of the Rings.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** The tamblin stories qualify. I've written 5 but only the first three are posted so far.

**/SPOILER(slightly)/** Tamblin's secret relates to magic that his mother was taught and which he inherited and which does not require a wand.

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

#+begin_quote
  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.
