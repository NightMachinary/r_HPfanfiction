I'm currently writing a Voldemort-centric fic, and I wanted to explore other options for regaining a body that weren't just the same old Graveyard scene.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Voldemort got his body back in Egypt, and no, Horcrux Hunt didn't work either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): The situation in Magical Britain is rather different, and it was Snape who found and resurrected Voldemort on Dumbledore's order, while slipping a major vulnerability into Voldemort's new body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): The Potters were much better prepared that night than in canon, and Voldemort couldn't get a body back until 2005, with Harry nowhere to be found. But once Spain declared war on Britain in 2008, the story may finally begin...

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** 1. the apprentice upgrade - grab a useful body and feed it to a Dementor; once that soul is removed, spirit-Riddle occupies the body; through some ritual, his soul is empowered to take ownership of the body permanently. Can lead to flights of vanity, where the sorcerer shops for better and better bodies to squat in.

2. fullmetal golem - construct a powerful set of armour; use some sort of enchantment to place the horcrux into the center as the 'heart' of the machine; make like Dr. Doom and build a bunch of replacements, too

3. Sic Semper Memorex - Grow a clone; take possession; pitfalls of this method are unusual requirements to sustain the clone body, like monthly bathing in the blood of sacrificed virgins, or having to upsell the cloning process as a television spokesperson

** I'm guessing alternative to getting a new body. Like if he had the philosopher stone or something like that.

I was thinking of the stone as water, bone Ash for earth, Phoenix Ash for fire and living soul for air... Other some mix ritual like that.

Another is a Living portrait, I based on Dorian gray

Dorian Gray is the subject of a picture by a painter called Basil Hallward who develops a level of worship for the young man's beauty. After having his soul trapped within a painting, Dorian gained immortality. He does not age and seems to be immune to all conventional illnesses, diseases, viruses and infections. You can make it so that it needs charging of ambient magic of sort to trigger the creation Of a painted body (oil or paint based body mixed with Ash of the previous if it was un fixable or even slow Regen of ashes from that night of LV's death piling up)

The one I'm using for my current fanfic that I'm writing (trying to write) is inspired by Galatea and Pygmilion..

"The Actual Potter" Living stone given life or a giant soul doll.... (It is a Diary!TMRxfem!HP where Harry's power he know not is Potter magic... Literally, like terracotta soldiers, Golems, gargoyles, living/haunted doll... Soul Dolls. Basically a fusion of Peverell necromancy and Linfred the Potters enchantment and artistry skills. Because pottery reminds me of clay sculpting or porcelain figurines)

*** Also..... Other Myths that you can draw an idea from.

Egyptian

The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly brings Osiris back to life by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris before he again dies

an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of "divine" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with the inward parts of Osiris as described in the Book of the Dead

He dies every night, ressurects every morning

Greek Asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing. Other version states that when Asclepius was commanded to restore the life of Glaucus, he was confined in a secret prison. While pondering on what he should do, a snake crept near his staff. Lost in his thoughts, Asclepius unknowingly killed it by hitting it again and again with his staff. Later, another snake came there with a herb in its mouth, and placed it on the head of dead snake, which soon came back to life. Seeing this, Asclepius used the same herb, brought Glaucus back

Norse

You can read this as ressurection via runes and enchantment

I know that I hung on a windy tree, nine long nights, wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin, myself to myself, on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run. No bread did they give me nor a drink from a horn, downwards I peered; I took up the runes, screaming I took them, then I fell back from there.

Haitian voodoo

The process of zombification begins when a bokor selects a victim and administers the zombie powder to them. A day or two later, the bokor revives their now-zombie using another powder mixture called "zombie cucumber."Distinct from the reanimated corpses found in George A. Romero lore (think Night of the Living Dead), the Haitian voodoo zombie is not actively rotting, nor does it feel compelled to consume the flesh of the living. Basically, in the Haitian Voodoo religion, a bokor (or sorcerer) can capture the soul of a recently deceased person and reanimate their body. Only when the bokor dies (or voluntarily relinquishes control) can the zombie return to their place of burial to rest in peace.

** It's been a while, but I think there were a few in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon). It's unfinished, but if you just want to go through its pockets looking for loose ideas, that shouldn't be a problem.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
