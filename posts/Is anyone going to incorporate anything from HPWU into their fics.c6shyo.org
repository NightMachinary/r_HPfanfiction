I feel like the potions could be useful if someone needs something to mention during random potion lessons. Or a couple of the spells could be referenced during a DADA/charms lesson.


** Are there original spells? From my limited playtime, they seem like spells from other Harry Potter video games and media.

** /shrugs/ doesn't seem worth the effort of playing a game I don't like. Would just invent something original that would be important to the fic. Same with Harry Potter Hogwarts Mystery.

Though this isn't really any problem with canonicity for me since I regularly use concepts from Fantastic Beasts, side books, Pottermore and interviews. Most specifically because that information isn't gated behind hours of boredom.
