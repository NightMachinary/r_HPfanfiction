:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for two time travel fics where Harry travels back to the Marauder's era. The one fic has two scenes that I remember most of the basics but some details are "fuzzy".

Harry has been invited back to the Black family home (i believe for saving one of the daughters). While there talking with the head of the family (I believe it's Arcturus) lucius malfoy, the Lestrange brothers and Riddle come in with the girl's father (I believe it's Pollux). The girl's father has signed Betrothal contracts for all three girls that basically make them slaves to their Husbands. The contracts have a massive financial penalty if they are broken (that must be paid immediately eg by like midnight that night) as well as a clause of a duel fought between champions that can't be immediate family members.

Arcturus is pissed that the contracts were signed and there is no time to get the funds in time. Plus Charlus who is a friend (and expert duelist) is injured from a previous duel, and there is no one else that is friendly to the black family that would step in.

Harry volunteers to pay the fine (if I remember correctly he has a shrunken trunk on him that contains the potter/black fortunes) and be the champion for the duel.

The champion for malfoy etc is (I believe) Dolohov. The scene with the Duel happens in a barn where the lestrange brothers screw things up by giving Dolohov potions that increase his power but also causes him to go berserk, rather than his calm, strategic self. Harry of course is able to use Dolohov's potioned rage to defeat/kill him.

In the other fic Harry goes back in time and becomes friendly with James and Sirius. He is invited back to the Potter house where he meets his grandparents. Both of which do work for the aurors (or unspeakables) with mind arts/psychiatry. He tells them (or they guess) he's from the future. While there Riddle and the older Malfoy, crabbes, goyle etc, attack the manor. All the men go out to battle while Lily and the other women are in the house prepping to treat injuries. During the battle Harry removes Voldemort's wand arm. Dumbledore shows up after the battle and is disappointed that no one will tell him who Harry is and that they fought back with spells that could be lethal.

Does either of these fics sound familiar to anyone?


** The first is linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence).

The second sounds vaguely familiar, but that could just be because I've seen similar elements several times. In any case, I can't remember any specific fics with that scene.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** Thanks that was it. I had the story on my drive but it wasn't found in the indexed search. Looks like I will have to reindex everything.

  Sequel to A Brand New Start: Time Traveler Harry Potter/Hydrus Black once again travels to 1981, hoping this time he can save Harry's parents along with Harry. Having saved Harry once, this time should be much easier with his past experience. If only things would go as he expects they should... Time Travel!

*** I don't think that's it. James was just starting to like/date Lily eg they hadn't left school yet. And the story you identified has them married soon to have Harry. Plus the Hydrus name is not something I recall 8n the story.

Thanks for the effort though!
