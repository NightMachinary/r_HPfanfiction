I'm pretty sure the fic was Harry-centric, but right now I can only remember that Lucius dies, and that Narcissa was obliviated or something. This happens near the end of the fic but basically, Narcissa Malfoy is obliviated so she's living in like a muggle apartment with a normal life. But then Draco and someone else visit her, and when she sees Draco, she starts to remember and says "Lucius?" or something like that. I really can't remember any mre than that but if anyone knew the fic, it'd be much appreciated!

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
