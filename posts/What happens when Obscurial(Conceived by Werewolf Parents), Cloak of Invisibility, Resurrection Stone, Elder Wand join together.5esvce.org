Bad shit crazy Humanistic version of Death.... do we not Agree??

Could a Obscurial be Werewolf or likelihood is almost impossible???

  Think of it this way? The scratch of Werewolf must have left his own LycDNAe so what happens if Werewolf(in human form) mixes our blood. Normal Blood is turned into Blood of Lycanthrope. Hence its Genetic. Lycanthrope is Genetic in the sense Common Cold is Genetic. Now i understand that AIDs was metaphoric for J.K Rowling soo take into account that HIV/AIDs is a Cellularly moving, so Lycanthrope disease should move by the Cellular level aka Blood Transfusions or Bite/Scratch which leaves DNA soo that's where I'm coming from? This is strictly within what is Known in Harry Potter? that Werewolf gene can be passed by Conception or contracted by harm from Werewolf. Its Magical by Genetics? Science/Magic go hand to hand in this universe. Personally Magic and Science r the Same just at different angles of experiencing.

******* AIDS isn't a genetic decease, even though it can be transmitted from mother to children. What we call a genetic decease implies acquiring genetic traits from the parents' germ cells. AIDS, as well as what ou describe, is caused by infection.

If what you quote is WOG, it just means that JKR doesn't understand what a genetic decease is.

If lycathropy is genetic in the way that the common cold is, it means that it's not.

******** NO!!!!! If someone has AIDs; they can cause others to contract HIV(by sexual or Bodily fluid exchanges) and if NOT treated(long period) then AIDs can occur just as much as Baby can get AIDs because Mom is INFECTED, IF Baby drinks Breast Milk or during the time in the Womb of the Mother(who has AIDs). Lycanthropy is Genetic because its NOT A SPELL!!!! accord to Pottermore:

"When the werewolf's saliva mingles with the victim's blood, contamination will occur."

Hence DNA from Werewolf can reconfigure the Healthy Host to who is bitten or has piece of DNA of Werewolf in him/absorbed onto him..... Genetics as of DNA or its Cellular Activity(between Werewolf DNA to Normal host{who isnt Werewolf}), not ur thought?

Colour-blindness is genetic, as it is caused by the occurrence of a certain sentence in the genome and can be passed from a parent to a child /because/ of the fact that they are related and share the same genes.

HIV is a virus that infects the child of the mother due to the fact that during the child's time in the mother's womb there is the possibility of their blood mixing. It is something that is transmitted, amongst other means, by contact with infected blood. Whatever effects it has on someone, even if it happens to damage their genes, the disease itself is not genetic by any means as there is no specific genome that would cause someone to be a carrier.

Likewise, lycantrophy is not generic, no matter what it may or may not do to the genes. Genetic diseases are not transmitted by blood or by any other means, they simply can be or be not present from the moment of conception until the end of life depending on the person's genome. Calling it a “genetic” anything is like saying that ice cream do not need to be refrigerated because they do not magically disappear in a puff of logic when they melt, which is just nonsense.

I'm fairly sure it's established in Harry Potter canon that lycanthropy spreads if a wizard/witch (maybe muggles and magical creatures too?) survives the bite of a transformed werewolf.

Are you saying that its your personal theory that the werewolf virus/curse/etc spreads into the body and changes its host on a genetic level? I used exactly that idea for a were-minotaur superhero on Mythweavers once, the idea was that the lycanthropy virus altered host cells to absorb thaumic energy (read: magic) upon exposure to an astrological vector (the full moon); this absorbed thaumic energy could them activate special PIFI genes (introduced into the cells by the lycanthropy) which would transform the cells from human to werewolf, emitting a transmutation field that would alter nearby cells as well, infected or not. Before the first transformation, only those cells infected by lycanthropy would carry the transformation inducing PIFI genes, but after the first transformation, all cells would carry the altered genes.

In any case, my idea /here/ ("Where do you think werewolves come from?"), was basically that, at some point in the past, an obscurial manifested by turning its host into a fast, human-hating, magic-resistant, wolf-man hybrid, rather than being some smoky ghost thing.

One implication of this idea could be that it would be impossible to stamp out lycanthropy; even if all current werewolves were exterminated, all it would take would be one beast-obscurial to unleash another epidemic. Possibly it could be the reason why lycanthropy is so hard/impossible to cure, as well; fixing it would require radically altering a person's innate magic, to the point that they might well have an allergic reaction to their own magic, or become a squib.

*********** He says just the opposite. That lycanthropy isn't a genetic decease.

Also, talking about thaumic energy isn't consistent with how magic seems to work in HP.

I prefer the theory that lycanthropy is a curse that is strengthened with the moon becoming full until it takes over the wizard when the moon is full. Iut isn't a decease, it isn't about energy, it is only dark magic affecting the wizard.

  Werewolves generally reproduce by attacking non-werewolves. The stigma surrounding werewolves has been so extreme for centuries that very few have married and had children. However, where werewolves have married human partners, there has been no sign of their lycanthropy being passed to their offspring.

****** Your explanation is based on no canon evidence. Nor is it based on real world evidence as was proven in the other subthread.

The quote I given wasn't from the in-universe text, but from the out-of-universe one, written by that world's creator and maintainer. So it suffers from no bias due to discrimination. Also lycanthropy in Potterverse was reasearched as is proven by creation of potions that interfere with its working (like Wolfsbane).

So your claim that in Harry Potter lycanthropy is genetic was basically disproven on all possible fronts. Why try to force as true something that obviously isn't true?

Also, you could at least try to write more readable text.

Werewolf Gene, In my opinion, could be Partial Dominance based on the fact that Werewolf(in Human form without any Wolf aspects occurring) can have Normal offspring BUT if Both partners have Mated in Wolf form(very Rare). its possible to have "pure"(not really but a better version of) Werewolf offspring. Combine that fact that Saliva or DNA of Werewolf(Wolf form) Could Contaminate its prey to turn into the same beast IF it survives from being killed by the Werewolf.

When I mean Genetic; I mean at Werewolf DNA(in Wolf Form during Cellular Level) can get Living Human to become Lycanthrope.

I hope I'm not confusing this? The Potion PROVES that Gene could be modified (making a person conscious in Wolf Form)but I don't think in Harry Potter Universe has hit a Wall? u cant get results overnight it will take time. Future of Lycanthropy could possibly change?

So if we put those together, basically we get someone who's immortal (by means of Hallows OR Horcruxes OR some other immortality method), who transforms into a whirling maelstrom of death (werewolf/obscurial combination) whenever something upsets them.

...That would actually be pretty interesting to have as a character in a fic; if you assume some sort of accidental horcrux or some fancy plot device that gives immortality early, you could have a story about a student at Hogwarts who tries to avoid trouble as much as possible lest they lose control and decimate the student population.
