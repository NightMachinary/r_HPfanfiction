The request flair is for when you are requesting a specific type of story such as a romantic pairing or plot point.

The recommendation flair is for recommending a story you enjoyed to this subreddit.

The What's That Fic? flair is for when you are searching for a specific story you forgot the name of.

The prompt flair is for prompting others on this subreddit to add a short story as a comment that follows plot points in the post.

I just made this post because I'm regularly seeing several different posts mixing up these flairs in their posts.


** The flair descriptions are literally written right above where you write your post. If that doesn't help people flair correctly, not much will. :D

*** Really? I'm on mobile and I don't see it.

**** Might not be there on mobile, I suppose - I'm on a PC, so I honestly have no idea if they're there or where they might be if they are.

But yeah, on PC they're literally all right above the 'writing your post' box, with each flair listed and a short description of what each is.

** The most misused one is Recommendation. I think it should be changed to "I recommend" or "My recommendation" to make that clearer
