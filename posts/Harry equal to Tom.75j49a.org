The prophesy says that Harry is Tom's equal, I'm looking for fanfictions where that's more apparent.

Give me your Tom Riddliest Harry fanfictions. Things I would sort of expect to see in such a fic:

- Pre-Hogwarts

Tom had figured out magic enough to be able to reliably perform various things. Harry should have something similar, not the same vicious abilities, but something. He does absurd amounts of garden work right? There's no way he hasn't run into a snake at least once and talked to it.

The Dursleys. In the orphanage, Tom rose to the top of the children's pecking order. I want Harry to do /something/ to improve his living conditions. That could mean reporting the Dursleys and being put into child care himself, however there's no way that Dumbledore would miss Harry leaving the home. I'd rather the fic not have an evil Dumbledore; he's not just going to obliviate everyone and put Harry back in the cupboard.

Harry could stay with the Dursleys, but I would expect him to handle Dudley and his friends, and possibly to have gotten himself out of the cupboard and into the second room. Maybe with blackmail.

- Hogwarts

The hat says Harry is cunning and ambitious? Lets see it.

Tom would have cried tears of joy if he found himself in Harry's position. Vault full of gold, instant legendary reputation as the Boy-Who-Lived.

Tom was a no-name orphan who had nothing and he managed to charm the entire school, bigoted pureblood included. He was a prodigy that performed what I assume to be an absurdly advanced soul splitting ritual entirely on his own before he graduated. He also basically put together his own cult - made up of people who should hold him in contempt for being a half blood.

Harry started from a far better position, I want to see him do at least as well, just not as evil.

Now that Harry knows about the wizarding world and his place in it, the only reason he should stay with the Dursleys is if he wants to - which he might, if the Dursleys just pretend he doesn't exist while he's home.

If he doesn't want to and Dumbledore says he has to? Who cares, fuck off old man. By now TomRiddle!Harry has probably befriended Susan and could easily talk to Amelia Bones about his home situation. If he hasn't, still, how hard would it be for the Boy-Who-Lived who also owns an owl and an invisibility cloak to talk to someone about it?

If Harry is forced into the Tri-Wizard tournament, I expect him to /own it/.

Draco Malfoy? Harry isn't putting up with this irritation. He either wins Draco over or decisively scares him off.

Severus Snape? They don't need to be buddy-buddy, but Harry improves this situation somehow. Earns his respect, gets some good blackmail, something.

Umbridge? Carving shit into his hand? I don't think so. That's the biggest mistake she'll ever make.

Don't get me wrong, this Harry is likely to be more morally gray than canon, but I want him to definitely be a good guy overall.

Any recommendations?


** This would make a great discussion on here. I have to applaud you for bringing up the point that the prophecy literally implies that Harry is Tom's equal, but will have additional power not known to Tom. And yet, both in canon and in a significant chunk of fan fiction we don't really see Harry being equal to Tom in nearly any way. Whether power, mindset, cunning, attitude, smarts, or whatever you want to use as a measurement.

Thanks. Yeah this bothers me a lot. There's the prophecy, then there's the blatant lies that the Sorting Hat says about Harry.

I want fics where Harry = Tom, but Harry makes up for the experience difference and wins because of the power Tom knows not.

Tom Riddle did amazing, unprecedented things motivated only by his own ambition.

How far would he had gone if he had someone like Voldemort gunning for him?

Pretty much the only way I can see that he's Tom's equal is that he is absurdly brave and seems to have extreme willpower. Oh! Harry would also kick Tom's ass on the Quidditch pitch - but he didn't even get into that on his own, he was shoved onto the team lol.

That's about it.

Edit: Forgot about something that Harry is equal to Tom at.

** Something of a nitpick, but the prophecy says that one of its subjects will /mark the other as their equal/, not that they necessarily are. And marked Harry is, by the act of Tom choosing to treat him as an equal in his act of going after him in person.

That said, while it's only a one-shot and thus it skims over a lot of things, “Business” (linkao3(1113588)) may have what you are looking for, at least to a degree.

Outside of that there kind of is “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality”, but for one spoilers and for another it's a somewhat ... controversial story and not without a reason.

Oh, and there is “Heir of Dracula” (linkffn(8517195)), but that's ... kind of a wank, and it's a mild crossover with Castlevania. If you do want a dark Harry who does stuff, though, it's definitely an enjoyable ride even if it's a guilty pleasure kind of thing.

*** Not to nitpick back but by "marking" someone as your equal its implied that they ARE your equal. Adding further to this is the implication that they have power you know not, implying that not only are they your equal but they have an advantage in some way.

Now I realize that you could interpret it to mean that the person marking the other as their equal could simply have made a mistake, but the way prophecies work implies that's not the case and that Harry is a true equal to Voldemort in some way. Although to be fair its possible to be an equal in a certain area but not other areas and the prophecy is vague.

**** And to add to that, we are led to believe that this one prophecy is one that only mattered because of a choice, Tom's choice in particular. While I do agree that we are likely all used by now to prophecies mattering in stories simply because they are prophecies, of the two prophecies in this series that we see one relies on someone choosing not to ignore it to work at all, and the other seems to only be there for dramatic effect. There's a lot of bullshitting one can do when it comes to what the prophecies mean and how they work, really.

I can see why someone would choose to interpret the prophecy the way you have, for whatever reason. I just do not think it a universal enough view to justify starting a post with “The prophesy says that Harry is Tom's equal” and not having a counterpoint made.

** I do have to point out, that Harry's defeat of Tom in canon was one of my favorite parts. A little plot-padded for sure, but given the canon facts, far more realistic than several fanfics.

Here are the facts: -Tom is a genius among geniuses -He's had about 60 years on Harry when it comes to understanding and furthering his magic -He's on par with Dumbledore, another genius among geniuses who has about 40 years on him.

Tom Riddle truly is a once in a century wizard. Harry is fantastic to be sure. Maybe he could have been a little more interested in magic in canon. But in the end, I see him on par with people like Snape and McGonagall by the time he's Head Auror (youngest ever, so he's clearly good at what he does).

I really like that Harry defeated Tom by understanding him intimately. When Tom Riddle dies, there isn't another personal alive who knew him so well. Harry understands his motives, his decision-making process, his abilities. He understands his weak point is his own arrogance, and specifically his empathy, which I consider to be Harry's strong suit.

I'm not really sure what you're talking about here. Voldemort didn't lose because he was arrogant, and Harry didn't win by understanding him.

Harry won because Dumbledore tricked Voldemort into thinking he won mastery over the Elder Wand. Voldemort basically cast a spell with it and blew himself up when it collided with Harry's disarming spell.

That's what I remember anyway.

**** Isn't that the definition of arrogance. So confident in your strengths you don't acknowledge your weaknesses?

Voldemort, in his arrogance, didn't think anyone would ever find his horcruxes. Voldemort, in his arrogance, took Harry's blood, without realizing the consequences. Voldemort never once looked into the connection that he and Harry shared. If Dumbledore figured out that Harry was a Horcrux, I think Voldemort could have come to that conclusion with some research. Voldemort in the end was his own downfall.

My final point, even if Harry was a genius amount geniuses like Tom Riddle, Tom would still have 50+ years of practical knowledge and experience. The only way I could see them truly being equals, is if Voldemort resurrects himself when Harry is well into adulthood. Now, that, would be an interesting story, and one I'd read for sure.

(side note: there was a one shot in a collection of false starts where voldemort goes through the veil to a universe with Tom Riddle and Harry Potter and Dumbledore as the 3 wizards who define their generation, and it was quite good. I really wish I remembered the link :( )

****** I would be interested in a Harry that's maybe like Voldemort at 17. But almost every Harry in a fic like that tends to beat Voldemort through magic alone, which I just don't see happening.

For me, the power he knows not, more than love is empathy. Voldemort lacks it entirely. That's why he doesn't realize that Dumbledore allowed Snape to kill him. That's also why he doesn't realize the type of protection that Lily and Harry placed when they died. He can analyze opponents, an excellent strategist, but he misses the key part, which is empathy. He missed Snape's true purpose because he could never understand how much Snape loved Lily, etc.

In the end, a tom-like Harry (magic only) could probably keep up with Voldemort, and beat many death eaters (which canon Harry does, he's pretty slick with a wand), but I still don't see him beating Voldemort mano a mano.

*** That /is/ a good one. Interesting.

I still would rather [[#s][Harry's competence to be entirely his own]], but that's alright.

Thanks for the recommendation.

** While not what your describing, and at this point I can't stand another canon rehash, Black Luminary does a decent job of showing Harry working to live up to great expectations. The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited also touch on various points you've made in unusual ways. linkffn(12125300) linkffn(9708318)

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** I know this is an old discussion, but I'm going to chime in hear anyway. Maybe the prophecy wasn't comparing Harry and Voldemort directly, via magical strength or cunning or anything like that. Maybe, instead, it was comparing their ability to gather effective people to their cause.

Voldemort had his Death Eaters. Harry started Dumbledore's Army. Voldemort had Bellatrix. Harry had Hermione. Voldemort has incredible magical skill? Harry had Dumbledore watching his back. To me the only real comparisons that can drawn between Harry and Tom is that (going on the vague memories of hero worship I remember from the books and movies), they were able to attract people, either through circumstance (Boy-who-Lived) or skill (Tom Riddle); the difference is just that Tom choose to actually start his cult, while Harry only did so when pushed.
