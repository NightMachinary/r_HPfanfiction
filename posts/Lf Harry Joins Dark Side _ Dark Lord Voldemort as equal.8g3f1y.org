** Almost everything by Athey.

It's all slash hp/lv and almost all incomplete but the writing in phenomenal and the plots are better than most. I don't even like slash that much but 70% of his stories are on my favorites list.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
