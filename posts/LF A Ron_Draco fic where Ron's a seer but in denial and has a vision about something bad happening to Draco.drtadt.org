:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I've been hunting for this fic for a few hours now and I can't find hide nor tail of it, yet it was the fic that ended up making me ship this rare pair. If I can recall correctly, I read it a few years ago on ao3, and it's first person POV. Ron and Draco are both adults, and Draco is living on his own. I don't think it's canon end compliant. Any help would be appreciated!

Edit: At this point, via skimming through 5 years worth of ao3 history, I'm wondering if it didn't get deleted. You would think there would be some trace of it though? If I recall right it was pretty highly rated. Wayback machine wasn't much help either. Honestly, at this point I just wanna make sure sure I didn't hallucinate a fanfic or something, jeez.
