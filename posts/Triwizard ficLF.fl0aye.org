:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that the Triwizard tournament takes place at beuaxabatons or however you spell that. At least part of the tournament does. It features a part where Harry suggest someone could possibly beat the age line by obliviating how old they are from their mind. It was a girl who did it, and was a daughter of someone very very powerful who I think was an earthamancer or something, earth elemental maybe. Also they stayed on the Hogwarts Express as their lodgings i think.

If someone could help me find this fic I'd appreciate it :)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
