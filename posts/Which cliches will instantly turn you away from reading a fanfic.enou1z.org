For me, Lord Potter and marriage law are two that will make me stop reading, unless the writing has been very strong up until the point that it's introduced.


** any weasley bashing or alternatively ron being awful and abusive and everyone defending him anyway to set up a fic where hermione runs away and is shown love by magically redeemed slytherins.

really any fic that doesnt have the trio being obviously friends and treating each other with love and respect. and i mean all of them. not hermione and harry are best friends and rons just a bumbling tag along or harry and ron are best friends and hermione just exists to tell them how to do things.

i also dislike marriage law fics, the only one i would like to read is one where a law is proposed and it gets completely dismantled because its legalised rape and it would touch on how not everyone wants children and pregnancy can be traumatic and gay people exist who don't want to compromise on their sexuality but i have yet to see that done.

pureblood or halfblood hermione, the only exception i make for that is keogh by chelleybean because it had one of my favourite ships in it.

snape redemption/justification of his actions, snape being a mentor, g-d forbid snape being a father or snape/lily in any way

justification of house elf slavery and hermione being shown why it's not actually wrong and then sometimes agreeing that it's just a cultural difference and letting it all go.

post war fic with no consequences for those on the wrong side and linked to that any ship fics with characters like draco that don't actually have any type of redemption.

and it won't make me stop reading a fic but when emphasis is put on light magic and the history of light vs dark and champions of the light and such i just cringe. i deal with it but i cringe.

also not a cliche but american writing puts me off

** Helpful Goblins, as well as Swiss Gringotts.

- Like, alright, I can understand the goblins being... slightly polite, exactly up to the point their treaty demands, but nothing more. If they find a human particularily amusing, they may sell them answers or information, but really nothing more, especially if the human hasn't made an effort with them, like learned their language and customs and done a great service for them, or works for them like the cursebreakers. For example, I can see them respecting someone who single-handedly slayed a basilisk or a dragon or some other great evil, but only up to a point. And they'd never fully trust anyone, least of all a wizard.

- The other thing is Gringotts - it's a bank, with a large expanse of vaults and unknown structures beneath. Most likely, some sort of city or outpost where the employees and their families live, as well as everything else. If you want to go big, you can say that Gringotts in London is most likely some sort of embassy to the wizards, with everything beneath the ground being Goblin territory. So I can understand that goblin healers exist, as well as ritual chambers and whatnot, but they'd be goblin-only, accessible only to employees and goblins living in the underground, not random humans. Especially when rituals are deemed dark magic by said humans.\\
However, the biggest gripe is when some account manager, x-manager or anything like that becomes a swiss army knife of services, like organizing random books or enchanted items. Gringotts is a safe deposit box at best, and only because it needs to be because of the treaties. having it be anymore than that is a tired trope, and makes me kinda angry. Usually, these fics are bad on top of that.

*** I dunno, I entirely agree with your first point, but I can see the other side of the latter two.

I mean, it makes some sense that they'd attempt to diversify in an effort to keep up with what I imagine to be a truly horrific unemployment rate. Unless they're more draconian about birthrates than the Chinese and Quarians combined, they're going to keep growing their population and them being restricted to banking (and assumedly being restricted to living under the bank, too) kind of limits their job opportunities.

A fic I read a few years back went into some pretty decent detail about how Gringotts diversified firstly to survive and secondly because the management don't want radicalised young Goblin NEETs causing another rebellion either. It was a pretty interesting take on it. I forget what the fic was, but I think it was Racke's Archaeologist. Would that kind of explanation make you less angry with the cliche?

***** True, and most likely the way it would be. But there's only so much space for all that, so it depends on if they're allowed to expand indefinitely under London of if they're restricted to specific territory. If they're restricted, and they've been under London for at least 500years or so, then it's quite possible they've reached the extent of that theoretical limitation.

Also, that brings up an interesting point. I wonder how far their 'everything we make is the property of the maker' philosophy goes? Like, does clothing count? Does your family have to return your jimjams after you die? Do restaurants exist, since the meal would be made by the chef and thus his property, or are all Goblin restaurants just buffets?

I read a fic once where Regulus & Snape were kinda friends/allies and Regulus tried to help him before his death, which also made sense to me. A teacher trying to mentor Snape, a visibly gifted but disadvantaged loner? Happens irl sometimes. Mature!Draco going to the maurauders era and helpong one of the only adults who ever treated him well? Why not? It's not a trope I immediately discard if it's marauder era or time travel and gradual.

But I agree giving adult!Snape the best friend treatment is strange unless it's a major AU.

** Drarry Fics

Harry/Snape Fics

Hermione/Snape fics

Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Ambrosius(Merlin)-Le Fay. I do admit I like Lord Potter/Lord Black fics but that's about it. When I first started reading I will also admit that I liked stories where Harry inherited many fancy titles/houses/fortunes but have since gotten tired of reading them. I usually shut down that tab.

G/F-Cup Breasts. Come on, be realistic

Evil!Dumbledore stories. I am even leaning away from Manipulative!Dumbledore stories. I love a story with good or a Dumbledore who is human and not out to control Harry/everyone.

Weasley-Bashing. I am largely tired of reading these stories as well. Do I think the Weasley's are a perfect family? No but most of them are pretty awesome. I like a good story that actually "redeems" Ron or has him grow up. He's a teenager. Teenagers get jealous and they mess up. Do I approve of everything he does? No but cut him some slack. It sometimes takes different people more time to mature.

Not really a cliche but something that makes me skip a story is mpreg. Ugh! Not my cup of tea thank you.

i dont mind lord potter or marriage contracts as long as they are well done and not harry is the heir to a dozen different houses and has insane amount of money and is contracted to several girls whose personalities are almost indistinguishable from each other and they fall in love with a few days

overly helpful goblins, i actually like fics where the goblins have a bigger role than canon but not when they are the solution for every problem

magical/mental blocks that dumbledore put in place to make it easier for harry to die. the only time that the blocks trope is fine if they are put on children that live with muggle or are muggle born to avoid constant accidental magic and that it is removed at st mungos but hagrid forgot or something like that

harry being shown as smarter or more powerful than everybody

mythical figure like merlin or the founders coming back from the dead only to train harry

the concepts of fate or death personified

snape/lily

bashing of any kind other than snape

the phrase "the greater good" used constantly

evil and/or extremely manipulative dumbledore i have no promblem with him being a manipulative bastard that is basically using the harry's time at hogwarts to shape him into a "hero" forged in adversity and all that but i dislike it if he is an asshole simply for personal gain

harry studying for a few weeks and becoming a lot more powerful its understandable if he is smart and has been working hard since he started hogwarts but not if he just started studying for a few weeks and is suddenly just behind dumbledore and tom in power

mpreg

harry/voldemort or draco or snape

soul mates/bonds if not properly fleshed out and simply used as an excuse to pair people together

The Dursleys actually abusing Harry. In canon they are assholes and terrible role models, but not actually abusive, certainly not more than any other parent in that time and age. Furthermore Harry isn't exactly a reliable narrator.

Exaggerated reactions to the cupboard also bother me, canonically the cupboard was bigger than many Japanese rooms, so it wasn't anything inhuman. The outside lock is the only thing social services would have frowned upon if they had seen that in the 80s, but they wouldn't have done anything about it.
