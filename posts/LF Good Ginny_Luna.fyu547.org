Can be Ginny/Luna in terms of friendship or in terms of a romantic relationship.


** Hey, I'm sorry you haven't gotten any other recs! I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I have an AU WIP that's a slow burn Luna/Ginny. The ship isn't the main focus, though - it's an AU where Luna is a Seer who starts a blood magic school for girls. There are some big twists coming soon!
