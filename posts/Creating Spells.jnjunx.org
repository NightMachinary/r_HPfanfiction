So I am in the midst of writing a chapter to a fanfic I am working on. I wanted to write a scene were the characters are practicing a spell. While we have a lovely list of spells already known I could choose from I wish to make a new one that would fit with their skill levels.

So the scene is set within their third year. I was thinking of having the spell be a transfiguration spell that creates glass cups from sand. You know, something a person could easily imagine a third year doing.

So I guess I'm wondering is what are some pet peeves do you people have about oc spells? What is the best naming conventions for oc spells? What do you imagine third years doing for their transfiguration classes?


** I guess I heating spell would do because you can transfigure sand to glass by heating it up a lot.Latin is what all the other spells tend to be so if you want to fit it in Latin is props best üëçüòÅ

*** I thought about such a spell, but I felt it was too sciencey for wizards. I figure they just make a spell that turned sand to glass instantly. I felt that fit with the pin cushion into a hedgehog spell more then heating up the glass then shaping it.

Do you know any good online latin to english dictionary? Or just googling it be good enough?

** I don't think we ever hear verbalization with transfiguration.

*** If you count lego Harry Potter, there's the *Draconifors* spell. It turns small objects into dragons.

Then there's the fringe of Transfiguration: Evanesco, Hardening charm (Duro), Serpentsortia (conjuration), Orchideous (orchid conjuration), Avis (bird conjuring), Color Change (Colovaria), Reparo(?).

*** And that will always annoy me that there is none because that would make transfiguration the odd one out compared to charms and defense as their spells have verbal components. It's a world building inconsistancy which is to be expected but aggravating nonetheless.
