  Harry Potter never wanted to compete in the tournament in the first place. And when his name mysteriously came out of the goblet, he still didn't. So he did what any sensible wizard would do, and didn't care. [Harry x Hermione - best friends to romantic] [M, W, F schedule --- 13ch, 33k words]

*** Thanks for the recommendation, I really enjoy these light hearted fics...

--------------

*edit:* In chapter 9 Ron bashing returns, and it made me sad; it seems to be a reoccurring theme now... and it's already taken 'too far' for my tastes... I did enjoy it up to Chapter 8, but brining Ron back as a adversary makes me not want to recommend this fic without this inserted caveat.

--------------

At least so far ^{chapter7} it's just Harry saying 'no', Ron bashing (which isn't horrendously executed but still a bit too much for me) and Harry&Hermione being lovey-dovey... no great overdramatized consequences from the adults or anything.
