Whenever I open a fic where baby Harry doesn't know his name, I'm immediately drawn out of it. Especially if it's a fic where Harry interacts with Mrs. Figg or seems intelligent for a child.

How abusive do you think they were based on canon? If there's a spectrum between neglectful and abusive (not sure if that's the right way to frame it) where do they fall? If Harry wasn't magical, what would have happened? I sometimes feel like JKR made the Dursleys too awful compared to how the books proceed (Harry is relatively untraumatized in canon from his childhood) but I might be remembering it wrong.


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cmrhbq/a_guy_on_quora_nathan_beard_put_together_a_large/][Here's a past thread on it, with a link to each example.]]

The Tl;dr - Harry was abused. The Dursleys were abusive guardians, though the brunt of the physical damage came from Dudley and Dudley's gang, rather than Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia themselves (though there are explicit incidents where Vernon grabbed him roughly and Petunia swung a pan at his head.)

Many readers write it off because Harry's internal narration brushes it off, except for the 5% of each book where he's staying at Privet Drive. Harry never thinks of his treatment in terms of abuse, by the Dursleys, Snape, Dumbledore, or the myriad of people who did wrong by him throughout the story, as a part of his "forgiving" nature.

By canon standards, /Snape/ was more physically abusive to Harry than the Dursleys.

#+begin_quote
  "So," said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb. "So ... been enjoying yourself, Potter?"

  "N-no," said Harry, trying to free his arm. It was scary: Snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.

  "Amusing man, your father, wasn't he?" said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose.

  "I---didn't---"

  *Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.*

  "You will not tell anybody what you saw!" Snape bellowed.

  "No," said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. "No, of course I w---"

  "Get out, get out, I don't want to see you in this office ever again!"

  And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head.
#+end_quote

.

Fanon, however, makes it so the Dursleys beat Harry black and blue every day and twice on weekends, sexually abuse Harry, call him "Freak" instead of teaching him his name, stunt his educational development by punishing him if he scores higher on a test than Dudley. I even read one where Harry didn't know what the word "Mom" meant (yes they spelt it that way) until he went to school and asked the teacher. Lol.

***** I'm not familiar with British laws regarding childcare (for any number of reasons), but that seems improbable to me: they locked him in his room and literally starved him for days on end on at least two occasions, the latter time with no intention of letting him out (as in letting him back into the world, not just letting him use the bathroom twice daily) ever and with the explicit intention of keeping him from going to school.

Yes, there was a 1933 law prohibiting child abuse, but the legal definitions as to what qualified as abuse were not as inclusive as we understand them today. Thus, even though the Dursley's actions were barbaric, their treatment of Harry was not extreme enough to be illegal at the time.

******* The Dursleys may not have broken any laws on the books at the time regarding child abuse (I personally don't much care one way or the other; the fact remains that they are very much abusive), but I'd be willing to bet that they're in violation of some truancy laws: children born prior to 09/01/97 (or 01/09/97, if you're British) were required to attend school between the ages of 5 and 16, and the Dursleys kept Harry out of school for a month in Philosopher's Stone as punishment for the zoo incident.

Unless the pre-pubescent child is held responsible for their absenses in cases where their legal guardians are actively keeping them from going to school, which I seriously hope they aren't, I'm willing to bet that Vernon and Petunia have broken /some/ law with regards to childcare, if not necessarily a very dramatic one.

At that time the legal definitions of "ll-treats" and "neglects" were not as nicely inclusive as we understand them these days. According to the standard interpretations of the time the Dursleys' bare-minimum level of providing for Harry was not lacking enough to qualify as neglect, and their punishments of him were not extreme enough to qualify as abuse.

Is that fair? No. But that's the way the law was interpreted before the changes in the mid 2000s.

*** The Snape Chronicles points out that the whole point of those Occlumency lessons was because Harry's mind was exposed to Voldemort, and Harry /knew/ that, and he also knew Snape was spying on Voldemort, and then he saw that Snape was extracting memories so that Harry wouldn't see them - so it should be pretty clear that those memories may contain damning evidence of Snape's true loyalties, which must not under any circumstances be shown to Voldemort.

For Harry to go behind Snape's back and deliberately put those memories in his own head was, from Snape's perspective, either an act of /monumental/ idiocy, or else a deliberate attempt to have Snape murdered, and either one could lead to catastrophe.

The Dursleys, especially their son, was more leaned towards physical abuse, something Snape only did once.

Harry's parenting and ongoing anger issues are attributed to his abusive childhood with the Dursleys.

*** First, I'm sorry for what you experienced - that's awful. And you're right, there's no way that abuse like that doesn't affect you in some way. However, it is important to note that not all who experience traumatic events develop PTSD - or at least, not all meet full criteria for it to be diagnosed. Thus, Harry could simply be an exceptionally resilient person, mainly due to genetic factors and such. On the other hand, again, I would expect someone to have at least some PTSD-like symptoms from someone with a background like Harry's.

** I posted this on another thread before seeing this discussion:

Early life abuse, trauma, and/or neglect are not things that just go away, or can be overcome through 'strength of character' - they cause serious, measurable damage that will affect someone for their entire life. Brain development is affected. Emotional control suffers. Attachment becomes extremely difficult and fragile. Learning becomes much harder in many cases.

The affects of this are almost never directly realized by the person being affected. They simply act out, misbehave, make poor choices, and quite often sabotage themselves and especially relationships. I.e. they don't understand why they do what they do, although they often realize it is wrong.

Stories where characters just shrug off an entire childhood's worth of abuse and neglect because their circumstances improved are pretty immersion-breaking to me. (I.e. Canon.)

And the periods of 'good times' among all of the normal (bad) times can often do more harm than good. Every time the 'roots' start to grow (a week with a family, or a relationship starting to develop) that is ripped away, teaches the person that nothing good ever lasts anyway, so why bother trying to have those things. Worse still is the lack of control or consistency - it is why many people will sabotage developing healthy relationships/situations. It gives them control, and provides consistency, even if the control is minimal and the 'normal' situation is bad.

- It bugs me that this is brushed off and/or handled poorly in Canon.

**** Understood, and mostly agreed. Like with a lot of subjects, I think JKR was just flat out lazy about this. Either make the abuse/neglect less serious (which wouldn't hurt the story at all) or have the character impacted by what they went through. This is another 'There's 7 years at Hogwarts, every year has roughly 25 students, and there's 1000 kids at Hogwarts' things. It just doesn't pass the smell test if you stop and think about it.

That said, my comment is as much, or more, about fanfic than it is Canon. Fanfic, especially now, is not really geared towards the young adult/children's market. Some of the best fanfic handles some very serious topics in very mature ways. But , as someone else described it, the 'beat black and blue every day and twice on Sunday' level of abuse while being starved and belittled, isn't a thing that builds character - it destroys it.

** Canon has some pretty significant emotional/mental abuse a lot of it is in the form of neglect as well.

There was some physical abuse as well, Petunia does swing a frying pan at his head when he's twelve, and in HBP I believe Harry mentions having learned to stay out of arms reach of his uncle whenever possible. Also in OotP I think I remember Vernon strangling Harry, or at least seizing him hard around the neck. Fanon tends to exagerrate the physical abuse to him being "beaten within an inch of his life" and Vernon hitting him with his belt, it wasn't that bad as far as I can remember from canon, but it was still pretty bad.

Things also get better for Harry from Prisoner of Azkaban onward since they're afraid of Sirius coming and just murdering them if they cross the line too much, and even though they know Harry risks expusion if he uses more magic, I still think they're afraid a part of him just won't decide he doesn't care.

All in all Harry is pretty horribly abused and yeah, probably should have been much less well adjusted than he was in canon.

Do the Dursleys ever get punished? Almost never. Writers always come up with strange scenarios where the Dursleys get away with it. They sometimes go too far; Harry gives a fortune to the Dursleys so they move to a different location because our brave and wise hero believes that getting the Dursleys arrested for beating him would make him worse than them...

I honestly don't think that it's such an unlikely scenario. More often than not people don't help or ignore something terrible going on because 'they don't want to get involved'. Out of sight, out of mind, so to speak. It's not happening if you don't acknowledge it. Ignorance is bliss.

Just look up the murder of Sylvia Likens.

** They're neglectful assholes, but you have to remember that canon Harry felt zero hesitation in talking back to the Dursleys nor did they even particularly react negatively to it.

They were abusive, but I doubt it ever reached the point where child services would even schedule regular visits much less consider taking the children.

Well, except the locking him in his room. That would have resulted in problems.
