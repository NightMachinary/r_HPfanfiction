I was wondering if there any any fics where the TriWizard Tournament takes place in a different year (harry or pre main series). One specific scenario I thought about was it happening in Harry's first year and someone putting his name in the cup to kill him do to his disadvantage in magic experience at the time.


** Well, there is linkffn(Hallowed by Shinysavage) which occurs in Harry's (I believe) final year where that Halloween in '81 went... differently due to Voldemort having a changed preoccupation/focus.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.
