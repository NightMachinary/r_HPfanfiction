** Interesting, would Riddle be different if he grew up with a loving family or would he still go Dark, possibly running off to travel with Grindelwald, after offing his siblings. Dumbledore's life would depend on what the other two do, he might be killed off for being muggleborn or welcomed as a strong wizard to help conquer the muggle world. I can't remember if Grindelwald hated muggleborn or just us muggles. There are many ways to take this. Wish I could write worth a damn. Was the time traveller Harry? Could be one of those Harry's who feels wronged by both.

*** Tom dumbledore, growing up bitter that is father went to azkaban for hurting the people who tormented his sister, I imagine this tom would agree with grindalwald alot more the only problem is Grindelwald fired a spell at his little brother, and tom is very loyal to his family

Meanwhile, Young albus Riddle is known at the orphanage for being a bit of an oddball who is dangerously smart. he is known for his skill at magic and for using it at the orphange to stop bullies and people picking on him for his short size, he does not relish in his power.

one day he recives a visitor, one tom dumbledore, defense against the dark arts teacher.

The story unfolds as tom mentors the young albus while tom wrestles with his own inner darkness and hatred and the fact he must one day confront the closest friend he has had and might risk losing himself while doing so

** Perhaps Tom protects Ariana or is the one to beat the shit out of those muggle kids instead of the dad which leads to the dumbledore family not completely collapsing

*** Or papa dumbledore still goes to azakaban but leaves tom with a massive sense that as the big man of the house his duty is to protect them.

he goes to hogwarts and is bitter that people look down on his father for protecting his sister

** I would love to read many versions of this. I have so many stories running through my head as it is that I wouldn't do this prompt justice though if I were to try my hand at it.

** Didn‘t Rowling tell us that Tom is Evil (with a big E and everything) because of he was conceived through love potion? His upbringing should change nothing. Albus likewise shouldn‘t change much, if we follow Rowling‘s example, Harry had a shit childhood and he turned out fine

*** Incapable of love is not the same as no loyalty. Tom is evil because that's what he chose to be, to seek more and more power. His first murders were either Myrtle (who was in the wrong place at the wrong time) or his paternal family (who refused to call him family and who cast his mother away - which I cannot and will not defend because I think they were right to do so even if they should have taken Tom from her).

Give him a family that loves him and is loyal and take him out of the abusive orphanage and Tom might make different choices. A Tom who does have to spend summers in London during the Blitz , who doesnt have to spend formative years terrified of dying to a bomb being dropped on the orphanage, might make a Tom who isn't obsessed with death and immortality.

Could be interesting to explore.

*** Maybe so. But he could possibly learn how to love in his own way or at least be a decent human.

Also, I'm pretty sure Harry turned out fine due to the up bringing. He learned to be more grateful, accepting and humble because he had always been denied and pushed down for everything he and his parents did.
