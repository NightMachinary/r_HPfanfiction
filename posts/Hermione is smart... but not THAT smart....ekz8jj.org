ã€ŠA Fic Where Hermione Isn't The Brightest Witch of Her Ageã€‹

Brightest witch of her generation?! Granger is barely the brightest Gryffindor!

The 1991/2 batch of First Years was a strong batch of students: Potter, the Boy Who Lived, struggled with his written work but was peerless in his spell casting, not a single spell giving him ANY trouble. Many other "hands-on" or "practical" applications of magic coming to him just as ludicrously easy.

Malfoy, as was expecting when his godfather stood as the youngest Potions Master ever, was the most talented Potion Brewer Hogwarts had seen in decades.

Weasley and Longbottom, both with their own flaws (lack of motivation and confidence respectively) had moments of sheer brilliance that highlighted brilliant wizards hiding beneath the surface.

But the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me really did seem to be the witches....

Forget Granger, Brown and Patil were exceptional. Brown a fairly exemplary witch all round, hot on Granger's heels in the grades department regardless of her propensity for distracted chatter and gossiping in class and during homework. Most of her teachers remarking that should she put her focus to her studies and not on who was in and out of Hogwarts Broom closets, the title of "Brightest" would be hers.

No, the title of brightest fell in a draw between the Slytherin's Daphne Greengrass and dear Lavender's best friends Ravenclaw twin, Padma Patil (Parvati, similar to Potter, a prodigy on the practical side rather than theory). Both were quick to grasp new spells, potions and concepts and neither had received anything less than an O on any piece of written work they received. Behind them came the quiet Megan Jones and the prim and studious Susan Bones. Bones a stereotypical "honours student" who effectively dragged her best friend Hannah Abbot to every gruelling study session (which accounted for her own exceptional grades).

It is not incorrect to call Hermione Granger a bright witch. Passionate, inquisitive and (of course) gifted. But the false idea that she stands head and shoulders above her female counterparts does need to cease. She is a talented witch, but when compared to others her age... she stands out as painfully average...

*** Not to be rude but I think you may have misinterpreted the meaning of this post. This is a fanfiction prompt, not a dissection of Hermione (and the others) academic performance.

That's why it's flaired as a "Prompt". Sort of an AU where Hermione is still great and still Hermione but the other students at Hogwarts out perform her anyway.

***** Harry wasn't on Hermione's level, and I am purposefully inflating his abilities a little for the sake of my post, but he was still an incredibly talented wizard and he did outperform Hermione in a few areas in the series (which she admitted to) particularly with some of his spellcasting. That's why he was left in charge of the D.A. after all.

***** And no worries, looking at it now I can see how it could easily be misconstrued as some Hermione bashing post if you miss the flair.

  Hermione attends a very one-sided, yet eye-opening, job interview. Some non-canon content; not for Hermione fanatics.
