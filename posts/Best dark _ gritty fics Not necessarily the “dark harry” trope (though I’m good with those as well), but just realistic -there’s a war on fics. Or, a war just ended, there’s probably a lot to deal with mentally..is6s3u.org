#+TITLE: Best dark / gritty fics? Not necessarily the “dark harry” trope (though I’m good with those as well), but just realistic -there’s a war on fics. Or, a war just ended, there’s probably a lot to deal with mentally.

For the most part, I tend to find fics that are just so unrealistic (lol yes I know it's fantasy but you know what I mean). Thank you for any recs!


** AU. Long one shot. Snape never repeats the prophecy, Sirius is the Potter's secret keeper, but it's not a happy story. Voldemort wins. Strong holocaust vibes. Made me cry despite there being only one major character death. It's just so fucking bleak knowing that people actually went through this IRL.

** Behind Blue Eyes is probably the best 'there's a war on' type gritty fic I know. Great fic, really interesting relationship between Harry and an emo-chav OC (one of my favourite OCs in any fandom, actually), and does Angry Sad Harry in a really interesting way, while keeping that wartime grit and stress on (more Anne Frank than Saving Private Ryan).

Warning in advance, it's also really, really, really fucking bleak. Still great, though. It's got a delicious Positive Nihilism to the later chapters that I utterly adore. Put it this way - it's a four-hundred thousand word fic that's worth the time it takes to read it. In my opinion, anyway. :)

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH

** Long fic. Not marked as complete but it is. Tom and Harry leave to hunt horcruxes without Hermione, so she's just another soldier in the war (albeit a clever one). Excellent use of safehouses IMO.

Excerpt:

“Ron is the first to go fight, and all by chance because he was at the Ministry when the Aurors received the alert. Arthur said he had been excited to go, and would return in a few short hours.

Ron is gone for two days, and it is on the third day that he comes back to the Burrow. His feet are heavy and his voice silent, and the door to his bedroom clicks behind him before he answers any of them.

He does not come out for four days.”

** I am going to get a lot of hate for recommending these two:

"DA and the Year of Darkness" used to be quite popular around here until the author turned out to be a dick but you have to give credit where credit is due because he is quite capable of writing young people forced to grow throughout a war.

"A Difference in the Family" is a Snape biography from his birth to his death. Snape is quite a hated character around here but the story makes you sympathetic with him and it remains canon compliant to the very last word. It portrays Snape's insecurities as the Death Eaters try to recruit him, his fear that what he's doing is not entirely right during the First War, his post-wars scars and determination to avenge Lily, his frustration with Harry, the Machiavellian battles in the Death Eater circles and ultimately how alone and hated by both sides he ends up. It's quite tragic but human emotions are written realistically in those circumstances.

I don't know how to put links but if you google the titles you should find them quite quickly.
