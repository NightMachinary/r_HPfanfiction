** Snily, snarry, snamione. Drarry/dramione. Bellamione. Tomione. Tom/Harry (I don't know what that ship is called).

Some of the really "out there" pairings are an instant turnoff. In no way would Harry or Hermione be with /any/ of those people listed above, I just don't get it and i don't want to get it.

The other one is an immature writing style. I've started a lot of stories lately that I just can't get into because I'm in my 30's and reading stories that sound like they were written by my 12 year old.

Or- fics that just dive right in with the all powerful Harry or the Hermione that gets thrown back in time and everyone just accepts her like it's normal with no explanation/no discussion on how she was so quickly and readily accepted
