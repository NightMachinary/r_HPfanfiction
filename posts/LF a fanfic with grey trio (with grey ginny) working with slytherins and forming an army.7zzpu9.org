** I would say the Trio in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] was definitely 'grey' as they had killed a large number of their enemies already by the end of Year 4. They actively recruited followers throughout their time at Hogwarts, and the Final Battle was planned out months in advance. They also enjoyed significant support in the Dragon (Slytherin) House. Ginny took part in many ops, especially during Year 7.
