I've just read so many accounts of Harry's sexy sexy rat nest that a part of me believes I'm more attractive with bad hair


** Nope.

My hair is too long for that.

** My hair doesn't care what I do to it, it will never stay nice and will always just be perpetually messy without me even doing anything to it and even when I try to fix it, it still looks like a mess so I just let it do whatever it wants because I can't control it.

** tbh, messy hair only looks good when it's clean and high quality. Get high quality hair, muss it up naturally, and it'll look cool.
