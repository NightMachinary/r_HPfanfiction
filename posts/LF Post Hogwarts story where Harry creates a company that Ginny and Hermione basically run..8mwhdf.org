Additionally I remember everyone believing Harry doesn't work or such but he's the one who owns the company, which basically goes about inventing wizard counterparts to common muggle technology.

I'm pretty sure this is part of a large story but for the life of me can't remember which. So many stories mixed together. I lost all my saved notes on what I've read and would love some help.


** I hate to link this, but linkffn(For Love of Magic) has a similar thing -- perhaps that's what you're looking for? Although it's not Ginny and Hermione, but two OC non purebloods

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
