We've all seen the stories where Harry is put into Slytherin, and how drastically this changes things and what have you, but why not the doing the same and shunting Draco off into the Lion's den? It opens up a lot of opportunities to look into House ploitics, and Draco's familiarl ties, since their reactions are likely to be interesting.

I realize that this change wouldn't make sense in the canon, but that's what AUs are fun for. Someone else has probably thought of this in the past before me, so I'd like to see if there are any fics written for it yet that are any good.


** Not quite what you were looking for, but linkffn(9469064) has a strong focus on the relationship between Harry and Sirius, and Draco is only a side character, but it does end up with Draco going into Gryffindor at the start of the second book iirc.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** Seconding that, it's quite a slow build up to the sorting if I recall but the development between Draco and his family as his loyalties get more and more divided is done pretty well imho - worth the read.

** There's also the Dangerverse series - linkffn(Living with Danger). It's a huge AU, and the relationship between Draco, Narcissa, and Lucius is totally different even before he goes to Hogwarts. I'm also not entirely sure that they make it to Hogwarts by the end of the first fic, but, well, you'll see what I mean.

** Oh man, do I have a rec for you!

linkffn(Like Brothers) is a WIP, where people don't put up with Dumbledore's shit and Harry is raised by Sirius Black and the Malfoys, and Draco and Harry are like brothers.

It's a Dramione, so if you don't particularly like that pairing, sorry!
