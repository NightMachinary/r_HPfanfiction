So the title is lame and my request is gonna be lame as well but y'all can't judge me ok

Basically I want stories where James and Lily never died and got to raise Harry. No "wrong boy who lived" please, I'm not looking for abusive or twisted Potter family I just want a story where they remain together. If the other Marauders are also alive and well that's a bonus.

I don't mind if the story turns dark because either Voldemort is still a thing or there's yet another dark lord threatening the world while Harry goes to school, I just want my Potters together, throw any recommendation you might have at me!

Please no Ron, Hermione or Ginny bashing, all ships are fine with me (even slash)


** linkffn(PromisesUnbrokenbyRobin4) I love this series. It's also totally completed with 3 sequels and a prequel.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/AidanChase]] The Author is rewriting canon and questioning how different would the books be if James and Lily had lived. She's currently on 5th year and it's really fun to read. There is also o prequel titled Gryffindor Blood o her profile.

*** This author is just rehashing canon events slavishly.

Don't they realize that with Potters being alive and raising Harry, everything is going to be very very different?

Can't they come up with some original plots?

*** Also have to chime in with my thanks. I'm doing a canon reread right now and am on DH, just after Harry and Hermione visited Godric's Hollow. Harry's nostalgia and pondering about how his life might have gone had his parents lived, the birthday cakes his mother would have made for him, the summer and winter holidays he'd have spent there.... it made me really want to read something like this.

**** exactly. It's sad that there are so many fics out there but most with alive Potters focus on bashing or them being manipulative/abusive. When I found out that fic i fell in love with the whole concept of Harry's parents being alive. So many great things could be done with it.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
