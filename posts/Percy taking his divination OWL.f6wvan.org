I know he got 12 OWLs, so he must have taken divination. But I just want to read about Percy having to come up with things during that exam.


** My headcanon for Divination was always that in the exam you got asked to use a form of divination of your choice to predict something for the examiner. Makes more sense to me than everyone having to do the crystal ball. I could see Percy having come across some sort of obscure divination technique that he decided to study and utilise for the exam. Perhaps something like bibliomancy would suit him (divining thing via randomly selected books/book passages)?

*** I didn't know something like bibliomancy is even a thing. I like your idea. Though maybe it's not as humorous as I initially wanted this to be. I really want to see Percy staring at that crystal ball or trying to make sense of a soggy mass in his cup. I think they actually had to do all the methods. Though your idea makes more sense. Now I think about it, if you're a seer, does that mean that you absolutely will see someone's future when you stare at those soggy tea leaves? They aren't being fair to true seers for sure.

**** I like to think that in Harry Potter there's a reason divination is a subject anyone can take because there's an academic way to master it. Perhaps it's a mental technique to allow your brain to interpret things correctly, with different techniques being used for different forms of divination. So when they try all the different types in class it's too give everyone a chance to find the one they're comfortable or confident using.

***** I personally think something along those lines, albeit the only way to master it is just being seers naturally, there being a limit to how much someone who isn't can learn/predict.

****** That could work, but I prefer to think that there is a difference between prophecy and divination, in that only seers can give prophecies but anyone can learn elementary divination.

******* Elementary yes, and that's what's taught at Hogwarts OWL years. But for example, the only way to get into NEWTs would be a true seer, to be capable of prophecies that are guaranteed to become true.

***** I've been reading about tarot lately, and actually, it seems perfectly fine to me to view tarot in an academic light. Prepare a question about something in your life, ie ask what career path you should follow, how you should approach your dad about his obsession with muggle things. Then lay out the cards in your chosen spread. To read, see what jumps out to you in connection to your life (say, a king card can represent Percy's father, or he might think of Ron when he draws a Page card, since Pages represent kids) then consult a book for traits to match to the cards/layout. Use spread to construct a 'sentence' out of those traits and apply to the question appropriately.

Percy /obviously/ asked what career path to follow, since he was so spread out in his studies as to not have a true focus (he's taking 12 OWLs, for Merlin's sake).

He drew the Justice card, and immediately saw that this tarot reading was going to have a great importance on his life (as Major Arcana cards are wont to be). He read a call for him to be the one in his chaotic family to accept responsibility and make something of himself.

The Knight of Swords pointed him to take a path to focus his studies towards a Ministry position, to shoot for an ambitious position.

The Nine of Wands told him that this was his path. That he needed to persevere, even if it was alone, and told him that he had the stamina to go for it, even if it would be a hard path that others didn't believe in.

â€‹

...I don't know much about card layouts, so I can't come up with a feasible one. But in tarot reading, drawing three cards without an intended layout is also an accepted way of reading tarot, since it is a very "believe in the cards" kind of divination.

***** There's not though. Trelawney tells Hermione so, annd warns her she's going to struggle. I prefer to think of it as something anyone /can/ learn, but wont necessarily have talent at it. Like art. You can learn things without being good at them. For example, the tea leaves don't seem to have been total bullshit. Hermione just decided that it was.

****** It makes sense that the tea leaves aren't absolute bullshit, since we do see Trawlawney's divination techniques work in a roundabout way. Her 'thirteen people can't eat at one table' thing predicted the deaths of Dumbledore and Sirius Black, and the Grim that kept showing up in Harry's leaves could have been either predicting his death in DH or it could have been predicting him meeting Sirius, who's also symbolized by the black dog.

My theory is that the reason why Divination is looked down on is because people keep on trying to assign consistent interpretations to certain symbols when context matters a lot for how you should interpret them, and understanding that context and applying it to the symbols is a skill that's really hard to develop.

***** I think Divination in canon HP is hard to nail down - IIRC, Dumbledore was planning to get rid of it at Hogwarts. Some of what we'd probably normally qualify as divination and divination goals fall into other parts of magic - like dowsing, which would just use normal spells I assume.

Canon wise, divination also seems to overlap with arithmancy (fanon arithmancy is much more interesting due to that), so anything too structured or number related would go there.

So overall, I think Divination in canon is just a vestigial class that doesn't really seem to have any actual basis outside of seers/oracles - but that it could easily be expanded upon to be an academic field, and it just happens that since Trelawney is a seer, she never bothered to learn the actualities of how to do it without the art. Expand that over the centuries...

****** I think Divination has probably just been a subject that many have taken, to educate the few who can use it. This fits with the way the English education system has worked for a long time (I am not so familiar with the history of Scotland's education).

Except, with the benefit that other witches and wizards could maybe learn what sort of divination services they should request, should they need them and how to see if they are being completely fobbed off. (E.g, your diviner tells you that a particularly expensive type of tea is required but actually Earl Gray is fine, etc.)

**** I think any random generator that results in interpretable patterns could be used for divination if someone figures out how to do it. There's nothing inherently magical about drinking tea.
