:END:
Okay so I found this story on Archive of our own and I could have sworn that I bookmarked it but now I can't find it. Basically what happened was it's in the middle of the first wizarding war and Sirius goes to check on Peter once he realises what Peter has done only to end up being tortured by Peter and then Remus comes to save him and they have a special bond Remus and Sirius. Can someone help me please!? A few of my bookmarks on Archive of our own have changed into hidden projects can anyone tell me why this is?
