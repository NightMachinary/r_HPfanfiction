** That's quite a lot of money for something that is commonly done for free. I get that you get it back if you complete it, but minus 25% - I don't really understand where it goes.

*** Heya :)

Money goes on the web hosting, mailing list, admin and creative time etc.. But it's not run for profit, and normally people get a couple quid back more than they put in, so, with a bit of tongue and cheek, a lot of writers celebrate being a 'paid writer' for the first (or hundredth, or thousandth) time!

I know a lot of people run these for free, and they do take a huge amount of time and effort, we're trying to find a sustainable way of doing it that doesn't require people to work for free - fair wage for fair work!

**** I mean, good luck but twenty quid can buy me a couple of rounds at the pub and I write every day anyway so I'll pass on this no matter how pretty the email your prompt comes in is.
