I'm writing a Harry Potter x Fate/Grand Order crossover called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13516576/1/Harry-s-Family-of-Chaldea][Harry's Family of Chaldea]] and I commissioned fanart! It's here and it's amazing!

  What do you get when the organization that's supposed to protect humanity ends up having a child as a master? Especially one who is from another world and is adopted by an Assassin? You get a collection of warm and fluffy, cold and foreboding - but mainly just a lot of fun. These are the stories of maybe one of the most unusual families to ever exist. Just try not to piss them off.
