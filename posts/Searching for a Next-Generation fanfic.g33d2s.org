:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this specific well-written & considerably long fanfic I'd read a long time ago (years ago really) that I can't seem to find anywhere now or remember the name of. The primary narrator/pov was Rose Weasley. It was rather dark & angsty, it involved almost all of the next gen teens with personal problems & so on. Rose, I believe, was seeking counselling after being kidnapped as a child. The fic had a sequel as well (a prequel also I think) that was well written too.

Suggestions/guesses are welcome, I'll provide any further details I can remember. Thanks to anyone who could help me out.


** Sounds like Lessons Learned (and the sequel) from loveadubdub. Unfortunately, I believe it's been taken offline.

*** Yeah, I cross checked & that seems to be the one I was looking for. It sucks I can't read it any more. But thanks so much, atleast I know the name of the fic now!
