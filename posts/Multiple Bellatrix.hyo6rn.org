I am thinking about writing a fic (maybe a few chapters) where some Bellatrix from other dimensions are dumped into the Canon universe. Things like a Geek!Bellatrix, Aristocrat!Bellatrix (used to political scheming and all that), etc. And here is a thing I am drawing a blank :

- when to make them appear : during the battle in the end of year 5 ? when Voldemort 'died' in 1981 ? when he came back to life in year 4 ? I've got too much possibilities and not much of a pulling toward one or another.

The rest can be decided when writing but it's just that point that blocks me : What would you consider a good time to make them join the current universe ?

Any ideas ? Many thanks.


** Screwing around with the veil would be fun to make the whole DOM fiasco even more chaotic. But the drawbacks would be the ministry presence maybe. Maybe you could have Bellatrix fall in instead of Sirius and the other versions come out?

*** That's an interesting thinking. I was actually hoping to confront them, like "here's what you could have been" but I think I can make my peace with that.

**** Perhaps then start with a more family oriented Bellatrix walking in on real Bellatrix about the kill Sirius, that'd be quite interesting.

** Or instead of all of them showing up at the same time you can have them show up at different times in the story. Then either have them stay or have them disappear when the "next" Bellatrix shows up.

*** That would be interesting , like the order waiting in a jaded style "what it will be this time"

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], contains at least 2 Bellatrixes. One is the smart and pragmatic wife of Harry, the other the hopelessly crazy canon version. So far, the canon one hasn't played any major role yet, while the good Bellatrix is in charge.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I read delenda est. I liked it even If I did not find Bella and Harry particularly affectionate toward each others. But I didn't know there was a sequel.
