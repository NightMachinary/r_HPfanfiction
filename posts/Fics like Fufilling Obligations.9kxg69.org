I really enjoyed fufilling obligations. I thought the way Hermione and Harry's relationship developed was mature, realistic and true to their canon characterization and their flaws and attributes. The subjects and themes the fic dealt with were moraly complex and explored these aspects without attempting to moralize or condemn it and really felt like it had a reasonable and realistic grasp of these issues. I also really enjoyed the lack of bashing of both Ron and Ginny. I really enjoyed the fact that these characters were portrayed as they deserved with both their attributes and flaws being accuratly portrayed. Such nuanced characterization of these two characters is honestly far too rare in this Fandom and especially this parring. Although to be fair this aspect has gotten far better over the years. Any recommendations for fics similar to this one?


** Off the top of my head, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister]] by MADharmony. It's unfinished (last updated in 2015), but for what's there, it's simply amazing. It's in my top three for FanFiction stories.
