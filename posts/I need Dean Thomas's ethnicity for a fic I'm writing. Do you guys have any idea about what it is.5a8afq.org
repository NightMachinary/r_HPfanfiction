** Well we know he's black, we just don't know anything else. We know he supports West Ham which would suggest he's from East London, but it's not a guarantee.

Demographically, a lot of black British people came to Britain from the West Indies post-WW2, as the NHS recruited heavily from Jamaica and Barbados. But Britain in general, especially London, is a bit of a melting pot so really his family background could be from anywhere. In my fic I wrote his Mum as Nigerian.

*** Thanks for replying. For some reason I had this conception that he was Indian.

** I am also curious as to why you need to know his specific ancestry? From the perspective of a black American, I can say that 'black' and 'Indian' are nowhere near the same thing, but maybe it's different in England? That's almost like comparing a Korean and Samoan, really. Completely and utterly different.

I can say that many ( I am not making this assumption for anyone other than the people I know personally) black people don't really know/care about what specific countries their ancestors came from. The nature of the slave trade made this pretty much impossible. So you won't get a lot of people saying "Yeah, I'm a quarter Kenyan and a quarter Ethiopian and the other half is from Botswana." We just don't do that (in America, again maybe England is different?) Maybe someone's grandmother was Jamaican and they will hold on to the connection to that culture, but that's it, really.

I personally wouldn't sweat it unless there's a major plot element tied to it. Dean Thomas is black and British, and unless your story revolves around him in a way that it's important that his family comes from X country, that should be enough. I'd say that if you're going for that angle you should really do some research into the culture you're thinking of.

*** I /think/ OP didn't know whether Dean Thomas was black or whether he was Indian or whether he was white and just portrayed by a black actor.

That said, most black British people emigrated within the last 100 years or so (there was a huge influx post-WW2). And people who have emigrated more recently tend to identify more strongly with that culture/country, and can more easily trace their history back to a specific culture. And yes, there are definitely people who don't care or don't know, but there would be others that would be at least mildly offended for the same reason that a Vietnamese person might prefer to identify as such and enjoy a distinct culture rather than be simply consider themselves Asian.

**** I can understand why OP might not have remembered if he was black in the books. If I'm remembering right, it was really only mentioned once in the first book? That was actually a great way to go about it. I hate when authors feel they have to constantly remind you that yes, this person is *insert race*.

Please, for the love of all that is good avoid this kind of descriptor:

"Hello!" the black boy greeted.

"Harry, did you finish that charms essay?" Dean asked, furrowing his chocolate-colored brow.

"I can't believe that move you made in the last Quidditch game!" Dean Thomas said, hoping that no one has recently incurred a head injury that caused them to forget that he is the token black character in this fanfiction.

End mini rant.

***** Yeah it was only mentioned in the first US book, the UK editor edited his description sentence for length and that bit was removed. But he was written as black and JKR [[http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/b/b1/Deanthomasoriginal.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20090811232538][drew]] him as black.

***** Dean is dead in my story. I'm writing a scene where his long lost grandfather sees his body for the first time after realising that he has a grandson. I realise that a lot of people get really uncomfortable at the first mention of race, but the scene is from the grandfathers' perspective. Hence a short description is unavoidable.

Well, that and I am introducing his mother as a character and didn't want to get her ethnicity wrong.

*** I'm afraid that my reasons aren't nearly as deep as you thought.

My story has a really long plotline about how Dean's wizard father hadn't actually died like in canon, but instead in the fight to protect his family, had been turned into a werewolf and had chosen not to return to his family out of shame. Back when I started the plotline I wrote the father as Caucasian. It was a throwaway detail back then, since race wasn't all that relevant to the story back then. Didn't think about it again.

But last night, I was writing his mother's description as Indian, I went to look up some stuff about the Thomas family, and realised that he was actually black.

For some reason, for the entire 6 years I have known this book series, I had /always/ pictured Dean as having Indian origins. Maybe its because /I'm/ Indian and Thomas is a really common surname where I live? Dunno really.

Hence my confusion and why I posted this question.

Anyways, thanks for clearing it up.

*** There are many. My own reason is because I am writing his description from the eyes of a character that hadn't seen him before.
