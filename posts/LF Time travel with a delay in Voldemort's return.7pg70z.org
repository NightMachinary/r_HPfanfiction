In most time travel fics Voldemort either comes back earlier due to changes in the timeline or the changes don't make a difference and he still comes back at the end of the tournament. I'm looking for any fics where the changes to the timeline actually cause Voldemort's return to be pushed back. Maybe until Harry is graduated and more fully trained.


** How about they finished him off very quickly:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516)

Now I've developed a strong distaste for keeping the â€˜timeline'. It's IMO dangerous, inefficient, and stupid. There was especially no need for the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme, if they came back in Year 4, because they knew Voldemort was hiding in Little Hangleton and weak in his homunculus form!

*** I agree. I don't like the whole lets not change the timeline stick. My thought was more along the line of something happens in first year to change the timeline and it causes Voldemort to flee and not come back for 10 years or something. I've just never seen a fic like this so I was curious if any existed.

**** That would be interesting too.

This premise could work as they failed to capture Quirrellmort at beginning, so they decided to go after his Death Eaters network and Horcruxes first.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** Personally I've always thought this should be the goal of any time travelers. Forget keeping the canon timeline intact, so much could still go wrong. Instead, blast everything to oblivion. Round up all the stray death eaters that helped Voldemort like Pettigrew and Crouch. Destroy every Horcrux you possibly can as fast as you can. Kill the basilisk and purge the chamber. Make sure someone better is the Minister for Magic, usually by giving credit for all these amazing feats to the right people (Amelia Bones, Arthur Weasley, Alastor Moody) so that they gain a swell of popularity. Then, in the middle of the night, desecrate the graves of all of Voldemort's ancestors.

Gather allies early and often. Get Sirius Black out of Azkaban and prep him to be Harry's bodyguard/mentor. Get the Hogwarts staff on your side and motivate them to get students on Harry's side early on. Get in touch with Karkarof and convince him you are the only way that he lives, and get all of Durmstrang to ally with you as well. Restructure the Hogwarts potions class somehow so that more auror's graduate who will be against Voldemort. If possible, do a purge of Slytherin and reorient it against the pureblood ideology.

Move against Voldemort politically as much as you can too. Discredit the Malfoys. Have the Lestrange Vaults purged. Kill or exile Macnair for his bloodlust. Find and execute Fenrir Greyback for crimes against humanity, but then have Remus Lupin waiting in the wings to rally the werewolves to your cause. Bribe them with better treatment. If necessary, use Harry's popularity as a lever to move the Ministry closer to where it needs to be so that it can be stronger and a more effective weapon

Then, if Voldemort still manages a comeback, you've obliterated his powerbase. His allies are scattered or weakened. You have multiple schools of magic and a government that will back you. When Voldemort shows up, remember that their is only one rule in warfare: Win. Hire muggle mercenaries: There are plenty of angry irishmen with categorical knowledge of explosives and how to use them as the troubles are just wrapping up or still underway. I'd like to see wizards survive having a their houses destroyed by a literal ton of dynamite while they're sleeping. This should make for a much easier war.

** Well, my story is not a time travel one, but I have never read a time travel one that delays Voldemort's return anyway, so i thought I might post a link to my story because it at least fulfills the requirement of a delayed return. I don't plan on having him resurrect at all until my main character is in her forties! :) So yes, his return will be delayed by thirty years in my story compared to canon. :) [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights]]

** I don't remember which one it is but there was a time travel story where Harry nabbed the Diadem from the forest in Albania. The result was that Voldemort never made it out of the forest for the whole story. He spent an additional 7 years looking for it as a specter before Harry got around to killing him off.

  linkffn(11993367) Status: Complete

  Is a good one from what I read. Plus, the main protagonists are Fred and George whom are really underrated as main characters in fanfiction.
#+end_quote

Anyways, the Twins travel back in time to the Marauders' era so they did not have any direct confrontation with Voldemort. I don't want to spoil much, but they did cause something to happen in the past.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/23/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano is also another time traveling fic featuring George. However, George prevented Voldemort rise before Harry's 4th Year in this one. On the other hand, this is mainly focused on the Twins.

Another quote:

#+begin_quote
  The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. No one knows that there's another George that travels to the past. Older George also have a sort of a mind link with his younger self. This causes problems with the younger George and Fred and they become quite stressed out about what's going on.

  Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasleys. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
