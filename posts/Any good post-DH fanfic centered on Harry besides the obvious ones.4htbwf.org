I'm at the point now where I've read most of the suggested writers who have tackled the post DH world from Harry's POV (and Ginny's to a degree). I'm looking to see if there are any other writers who deal with this time period that are worth the effort. Here's who I've read and enjoyed:

Northumbrian Little0bird Floreat Castellum My Ginevra

Now here's generally what I'm looking for:

-canon compliant (they wind up with the careers JKR gave them, they act in character, etc) -not overly romantic (i want to see the relationships develop but I think I prefer nothing over-the-top; My Ginevra was really good but I found the whole Harry/Ginny thing a bit too romantic) -Harry/Ginny have their tough moments (if we're being realistic, they would fight about several things) but ultimately are fine -no time travel (I think I prefer as realistic as possible) -I'm ok with stories involving the immediate aftermath so long as they move on from it) -epics preferred

Basically, I want stories that paint a realistic picture of how life would have been like post-DH. I know there is a whole website devoted to Harry/Ginny but there is just so much material it's tough to know where to start. I only read the authors listed above because of this subreddit and was glad I did. Thanks!
