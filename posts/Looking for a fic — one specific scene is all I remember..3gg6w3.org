The scene I am talking about occurs during the fourth year, when Harry realises that Moody is an impostor during his class; Moody picks up on it and asks him to stay after the class. Then the usual 'I subdue and obliviate you' game is played. However, Flitwick intervenes and saves Harry. Harry observes that Flitwick has a very specific dueling style that allows him to move very fast and in different directions; the professor actually tells him that the style has a specific name and offers to teach him.

That's all I remember. I am not sure if the story was actually good or not, but I just have to find out which one it is :)
