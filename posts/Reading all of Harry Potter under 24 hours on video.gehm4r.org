Some of you may remember that about a month ago I did an AMA just after reading HP all day long. I also made it into a video, which for some reason I didn't share.

So if you happen to be interested in how many positions one goes through in 24 hours of reading; here it is.

I am aware that posting this to the main HP sub makes slightly more sense, but I like the community here much more... So if the mods deem it inappropriate, so be it.

And if anyone has questions and missed the AMA... You can ask, but I finished this feat more than a month ago... So perhaps questions about the logistics would make more sense.
