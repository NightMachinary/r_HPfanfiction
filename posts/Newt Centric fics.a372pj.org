** I don't really understand your hate for the fic because the reason why Harry knows more about them, is the fact that he has better education on magical creatures because at the time it is implied that they are solely studied for killing or for potion ingredients.

However some guidance on what kind of fics you would like would be nice. I might recommend linkffn(12424188;12262250;1226225012814000) most of them I somewhat enjoyed.

If you prefer more Fantastic Beasts centric fics many of these would fulfill those requirements. However some are of dubious quality linkao3(7322935;9240317;10639245;13262967)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-

    I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other.\\
  Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  Falling in love is the easy bit (well, as easy as it can be for an awkward, inexperienced, occasionally insecure magizoologist and a troubled, commitment-phobic, jealous Auror to fall in love). Staying out of trouble is just a smidge more difficult, as is gradually navigating their way through a relationship built to last. Meeting the family? Stressful, but who doesn't love someone with a name like Porpentina? As for dealing with a nefarious flapper determined to kill Miss Goldstein, Grindelwald still at large, a mysterious series of attacks on both Newt and Tina, and everyone's general proclivity to jump headfirst into Dangerous Situations... well, that's rather the point of this entire story, and I don't give away spoilers.[read the notes]Stuff to look forward toJealous TinaInsecure/inexperienced NewtDamsel in distress (both Newt and Tina)Stupid domestic fluffStupid painful angstBAMFsLots of OCsComedic reliefA sister for NewtAMERICAN HOGSMEADE AND DIAGON ALLEYTitle from "Always" by Irving Berlin (1925)

  If Newt had had a little more time in the subway station, Credence would have lived. This is their story.Credence Barebone is dead to the wizarding world, but in actuality he is alive and under the hidden care of the Goldstein sisters as well as Newt Scamander. The parasitical obscurus has been torn from him, but his magic remains, and they intend to use the best means they have of training it: with a school. First to Ilvermorny and then to Hogwarts, Newt, Tina, and Queenie open Credence's mind and heart to the world he had been denied for so long.But first stop: the Kowalski bakery.

  It was just a butterfly.A pretty, ivory-colored butterfly gently resting against his knuckles.For half a second, Credence's heart skipped a beat. There was a witch on this ship. A witch that knew who and what he was...A witch that had deliberately sent this abomination-...He froze.If the paper butterfly was an abomination, then what was he?He turned to search for the witch or wizard who sent this and found-...No one.No one was there.But, Credence suspected, that he was not alone.

  Time Travel. Fem! Harry. HP/NS. A badly timed wish, a mysterious mirror and Harriet Potter's knack for trouble equal one unexpected trip to the past...naturally. Dropping into the lap of a young Newt Scamander was the last way she had expected her day to end but Harry soon learns that maybe fate intervened for a reason.

  "Bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time" At least that's what Hermione Granger has always been told. However, what if the fate's had another plan for you? Would you take the chance? A chance at the life you were always meant to live? (Major spoilers for the film inside. You've been warned.)
