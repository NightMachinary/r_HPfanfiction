I was wondering when did the "Ice Queen" persona of Daphne come about and why did the authors make this sort of character.


** Slytherins are mean, but

Harry wouldn't date a meanie, so

Her meanness is a facade for reasons that are absolutely not tropes

** It's a natural projection of a stereotype. Things we can assume about Daphne from the seven books only:

- Pure-blood in Slytherin; raised a haughty noble or is able to survive among them
- Slytherin House traits; personal ambition at the very least, self-centered worldview and questionable morality aren't unreasonable
- Quiet; she sees almost no screen time in six Hogwarts years in spite of being in Harry's year (contrast with Pansy)

Reconciling all of those things with an Ice Queen stereotype is fairly simple. On top of that, melting the ice queen is common enough male fantasy and is an easy way for authors to generate teenage drama without a whole lot of effort. Makes for a bland story, but both writers and readers seem to enjoy it.

Writing Daphne in another fashion requires a lot more work and explanation and probably easier done with pure-bloods from other houses. That doesn't mean she can't be interesting; Ice Queen is how /other/ characters perceive her. Under that personality she is just as much of an individual as anyone else. Why she acts the way she does and her own personal goals are what can make her interesting since they can be literally anything and still jive with canon.

******* The idea that a society that split from muggle Britain in 1692 wouldn't have some sort of nobility at least at the start seems very, very weird. Especially since Pottermore states that a Malfoy was courting Queen Elizabeth I - something he only would have been able to as a noble, and a high-ranking one at that. I know some imagine that the purebloods all went egalitarian and democratic as soon as they split, but we have no sign for such a revolution taking place.

And even if we assume that somehow, no noble titles were continued, the idea that there is no upper class - a defacto aristocracy - is not very compatible with canon. Just compare how the Weasleys live and how the Malfoys live.

******** My understanding was always that all the "noble" wizards had gotten their titles from the muggle royalty. Yes, the Malfoys were noble before the Statute of Secrecy, but under the muggle system, and presumably nowadays they're more ashamed than anything else of having held a title from a /muggle/.

And yes, there /is/ an upper class, the issue is just that people keep assuming purebloods are /literally/ nobles with Lords and title-inheritance rules and vassals and rings and all such nonsense.

********** FYI this is a very American view of class. I don't think any British person would ever:

A) Connect the idea of being upper class to the possession of de facto political power, though they have a greater association than other classes.

B) Think that you can just form a new aristocracy, since the entire concept is based on a reverence for tradition and historical precedent.

Being upper class is not wealth, nor is it power. It's something you can tell within 30 seconds of speaking to a person, without ever having met them before and knowing absolutely nothing about who they are. Being de facto in control of the country does not make one upper class. For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair was and is firmly middle class - something which he would have been reminded of at formal state occasions, when he would find himself about half-way down [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_precedence_in_England_and_Wales][the order of precedence]] in the seating plan.

In many ways, the laughability of forming a "new aristocracy" is exactly why we are supposed to deride the Black family for coming up with titles for themselves. New aristocracies come around when inherited titles are the same thing as political and economic power i.e. in feudal societies. The titles carry weight not because of tradition but because of the actual power they provide. Over time the titles accumulate tradition which can survive the end of their political relevance.

But British wizarding society is manifestly not feudal. They have an elected Minister and an institutional civil service which mirrors modern forms of government. Their economy is not agricultural, political position is not derived from land ownership, and neither is military power as individuals do not raise levies to fight based on land ownership.

It would in fact be extremely strange for wizards to create a feudal system of government when breaking away from Muggle society in 1692, since feudalism had been functionally abolished in Muggle England in 1290 with the statute of Quia Emptores and was finally killed off in 1660 with the Tenures Abolition Act. Not to mention that England had just been through a civil war resulting in the execution of the monarch and the establishment of Parliamentary supremacy.

#+end_quote

Because the upper class is much smaller than 5% of the population. It's closer to 0.5% (estimated to be around 36,000 people in modern Britain, or 0.6% of the population). And that includes all the minor nobility too. The core of the nobility - the ones who have titles attached to significant amounts of land - is around 1000 families.

Social inequality is not the same thing as the class system. By the late 1600s the merchant classes were already supplanting the traditional nobility as the holders of political power, buying rotten boroughs with the proceeds of trade to secure themselves seats in Parliament. The House of Commons had gained primacy over the House of Lords. The feudal system was long gone, and the government of England was highly centralized and administratively sophisticated compared to its European peers.

Yes, Britain was still a long way from real democracy, especially as the House of Commons was as yet unreformed and so elections were not really free. But just as social inequality is not the same thing as the class system, nor is democracy the same thing as having a classless society.

************* Are you actually claiming that the wizards wouldn't have a nobility, and yet argue that their own upper class would be based on the same criteria as the originally noble [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class_in_the_United_Kingdom#Upper_class][muggle upper class]] (peerage, gentry and hereditary landowners)? You can't have it both ways. Either they follow muggle standards, and have a (mostly) noble upper class, or they have an upper class [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_British_Class_Survey#Elite][as defined nowadays]] ("Elite", around 6%).

In any case, there's not much if any case for Wizarding Britain having been formed as a democratic society with a universal franchise from the get go.

************** I'm saying (and have been doing so quite consistently) that wizarding Britain would not have a nobility. They would no doubt have a social elite, as does any society. But that elite would not be a nobility/aristocracy. That the idea of a "de facto" aristocracy is a contradiction in terms, because aristocracy is a concept which is completely distinct from being a social elite.

Let us remind ourselves of the position which you put forward which began this conversation:

#+begin_quote
  The idea that a society that split from muggle Britain in 1692 wouldn't have some sort of *nobility* at least at the start seems very, very weird. Especially since Pottermore states that a Malfoy was courting Queen Elizabeth I - something he only would have been able to as a noble, and a high-ranking one at that.

You are now trying to shift the goalposts so that it appears that your position was simply that wizarding society would have a social elite (a trivial proposition which no one would contest). But your actual position, which is the position I have been arguing against, was that this elite would take the form of a nobility or "de facto aristocracy". And for the reasons elaborated above, that is simply historically and culturally ignorant.

*************** I maintain that it's far more likely that the wizards would have kept their aristocracy instead of abandoning them. It's historically and culturally ignorant to assume that there would have been the equivalent of a French Revolution in Britain in 1692, or some egalitarian "we're all equal" drive. Yes, they split from the muggles - but similar splits in history didn't result in the nobility shedding their titles.

**************** Let's assume they did keep their titles, but after the statute of secrecy they weren't given any new ones. As the person you replied to said, the aristocracy makes up 0.5% of Britain's population. That figure is when new positions in the aristocracy, like knighthoods, are still being given out. So we have no reason to think that wizards would have a higher proportion of aristocrats in their population, and it could very well be lower if any families died out. Estimating the population of wizarding Britain at 3000, if 0.5% of them are aristocrats...that means only 15 aristocrats total. Not even 15 families, just 15 people. So the Malfoy and Black families, and maybe one more. That's it. (Of course, a sample size that small is meaningless, but it was interesting to think about all the same) There is no point to an aristocracy if there are no other members of it.

Also, had there been an actual aristocracy with titles that Malfoy was a member of, I think he would have pulled it out to lord it over (heh heh) everyone else at the drop of a hat. We would have heard about it on the Hogwarts Express itself, probably .

1) After all the movies came out, there was a lot of inconsistency with characters in the movies over the years, but the later movies started showing a blonde Slytherin girl. She was unnamed officially but most people assumed she was Daphne (Pansy was already identified, the other other Slytherin girl Harry's year was Tracy Davis)

2) But Daphne became the most popular after DH and the Epilogue came out. Draco married Astoria elevating the Greengrass family and thus Daphne. She became a blank slate, a wealthy, blonde Pureblood. Because she had no canon personality, people were free to make their own.

It's definitely a more recent phenomenon. I've followed HP fanfic and the fandom since around 2000 or so and Daphne wasn't even mentioned until recently, and her popularity exploded.

So you're stuck with Slytherin for your dangerous romance. Could do Pansy but the hoops you have to jump through are tough. Millicent isn't overly pretty so people ignore her. So you have Daphne or Tracey and Daphne Greebgrass is such a cooler name than Tracey Davis. Plus it's canon her sister gets with Malfoy. You can get a lot of good stories from that. Helps she's never mentioned outside of sorting so you can do anything with her.
