:END:
It was on ff.net I remember that lily and James live and had twins Harry and a girl; I can't remember her name. They leave Harry at the Dursley's, after Dumbledore left Merlin takes Harry to the founders and he lives with them for 11 years then goes back to the Dursley's for one day. Sirius and Remus are his godfathers. Harry's sister is a brat and he's sorted into Slytherin after Harry's 1st year Harry is living with sirius, Remus, and snape(?). he's all the founders heirs. he helps bring back Voldemort. That's all I really remember


** linkffn(Twins: A Different Life)

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
