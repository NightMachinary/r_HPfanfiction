With all the Super-Harries out there it seems like I never see people just kill Voldemort a couple times to vent steam/ use the fact that he won't die permanently to really make it last. Have you ever seen a story like that?


** In Blindness, Harry... Experiments on a horcrux. I imagine it was pretty painful given it was supposedly screaming. Not exactly it, but it's close.

In classic Screams series by cloneserpents. Pity the sequel was never finished, would be fun to see what mayhem they would have wrought in the past.
