I've read all of the AQ Series so far and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It deserves the attention it gets.

AQ Series has a lot of original plots, but I see some plot points in AQ's life that are similar to HP's life: Neglected child with a prophecy about them, secretive headmaster and Snape-like professor, abused elf who becomes her friend, gets a broom as a gift, broom gets destroyed. There are probably some others I am forgetting.

My questions:

First, are there enough similarities that it feels gimmicky, like the author is saying "hey look! She's just like Potter!"?

Second, if the similarities between HP and AQ are a bit overdone, does it matter?


** There are some surface similarities (I never even noticed the destroyed broom thing) sure, but at their core Alexandra and Harry are vastly different characters. The neglect thing also really doesn't apply. I think that was a big point of the last book, that despite everything, including Alexandra's feelings, she did grow up in a loving home.

*** "The last book" meaning the most recent one? I hope you do know that Inverarity is currently writing book 5.

*** I appreciated that aspect of the last book. My use of the word neglect was not the appropriate word, and their experiences are extremely different. I also feel that AQ reacts and addresses her childhood and family in a very realistic way, and in a more fulfilling way to the reader than HP even. Overall, I really like the series and the originality. I remember being angry at AQ while reading it for some of the choices she made, "why are you getting into ANOTHER duel at school! It didn't end well last time either...". But looking back I like how AQ is characterized, she makes decisions impulsively like someone her age would. It doesn't make for interesting stories if the characters make every choice like we think they should.

** Perhaps I'm revealing my lack of insight here, but I only caught the correlations of neglect, prophecy, and secretive headmaster while reading. I admit that I didn't read as in depth as I should have, and AQ is probably worth a reread when the next book comes out. I'm sure I'll see more things now that I've consciously started thinking about your examples! The broom is so obvious that I can't believe I missed it, especially because it comes from an absent father-figure.

But no, I don't think it's gimmicky. Especially since in my casual read of the stories, I didn't pick up on all of them. Maybe lots of people read like me, and won't notice everything?

*** Thanks for the reply! I think I need to give it a second read as well. I read it a while before getting on Reddit and having an outlet to voice my thoughts, so my memory of the story is a bit fuzzy. Someone else responded and mentioned that AQ has it's own subreddit, [[/r/alexandraquick]], where they discuss AQ, and maybe this issue has already been hashed through pretty fully by more knowledgeable readers.

Overall, I don't think it's a gimmick. AQ is a good series.

** I wouldn't say there's enough similarities to warrant that. I mean, there are similarities, but no moreso than I'd expect between different characters from different works.

*** It's been a while since I read AQ, and it was before I was on Reddit and had a place to collect my thoughts. I think I need to reread it sometime. I agree, that overall AQ is a very original character, not a mirror to HP or a conglomerate of HP characters. For one, her assertiveness/aggressiveness is wildly different from HP (true cannon HP, not fanfic HP), and she acts like someone her own age, which seems like a hard thing to write well. Thanks for the reply!
