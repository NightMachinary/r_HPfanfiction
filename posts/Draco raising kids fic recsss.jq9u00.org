** Since you liked Dad says, I think you'd also like linkao3(Cassiopeia Lily Malfoy) by the same writer.

Oh and try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] as well.

  In eighth year, Harry had a toxic fling with Draco Malfoy. Ten years later, a little girl shows up, begging for Harry's help. Could the two be connected? And did Harry misunderstand what Draco was trying to tell him, the last time they spoke?Feat. angry 8th year Harry being truly horrible to Draco, Draco writing a lot of letters he never sends Harry, and the most Gryffindor-Slytherin hybrid ten-year-old you've ever seen.

  Draco's a father, Harry's in love with him, and it's really hard to take things slow.

****** I'm glad you liked it! I don't know of any others where Draco is a dad but I can recommend some more with a similar feeling (i.e., so cute you want to cry and also grab the nearest person, shove their face in your phone while shouting, "LOOK AT THIS IT IS PRECIOUS AND MAGICAL AND I WILL FIGHT ANYONE WHO DISAGREES!!!!")\\
Also, definitely read more from that author. I especially liked linkao3(640449; 17123729; 20946260). I didn't include them earlier because they aren't papa draco. ;)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad says" by GallaPlacidia]] is absolutely adorable, and the author has some other fantastic works. It's about Draco and Scorpius and their relationship, but also is about how Harry and Draco are both still messed up from the war.
