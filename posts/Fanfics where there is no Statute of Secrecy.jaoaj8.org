Looking for fics in which the Statute of Secrecy either falls or has never existed in the first place.

I'm curious how fanfic writers depict such a scenario, and how would Magical and Muggle worlds influence each other.


** NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series depicts a world where the wizards reveal themselves to the Muggle world but, while a big thing at the beginning, it doesn't really play a significant role later on other than the fact that the Potters' Muggle neighbors keep avoiding them.

** I just mentioned this in another post but I think it qualifies here.

I don't remember the title, but two sets of the Golden Trio are accidentally sent to parallel world where Voldemort won. He has taken over all of Europe and most of Africa. The humans are slaves or helping with the resistance (in South Africa, I believe).

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry
