**** She /is/ just a face in the crowd in the books though. The only mention of her is her exiting the OWL exam with Hermione and some other students whose last names start with "G".

In the wider canon of JKR's writing we get three things more (1.Slytherin 2.Draco's sister-in-law 3.hangs out with Pansy), but she has zero traits in the actual books. She's literally just a name of a girl in Harry's year.

** Ginny. Within the books, she's a character I wanted to like but could never be fully invested in. In large part because Rowling's romance writing is one of my least favourite elements of the books. Fanfiction is able to move away from that and dig into the elements of the character which didn't get much time to shine or which drew my interest originally.

**** Yeah, I wouldn't say I ever disliked Ginny---though the Ginny/Harry content itself isn't my favorite---so much as felt she was underwritten. She has traits and relationships which could be compelling. In practice, however, she's not given much to do outside of Harry and her characterization only breaks out of the spunky little sister box in brief flashes.

** I do. Fanfictions actually help because Rowling has only mentioned what happened to the Marauders through interviews and on her website. There was one though, the Harry Potter Prequel where James and Sirius was caught in the Muggle World by a policeman, which is really wicked!

The one thing I dont like is if the fanfic would really play up their character. Like its not canon anymore. I would stop reading immedietely and look for a different one one I dont like where the author is going with the character build up.

My favorite so far is The Debt of Time. A time turner fic where Hermione went back in time and became James Potter's twin sister. The charqcter built up of the marauders are so good and on point.

I would recommend that you download the FFNet app instead. You can download the fic so you can read while offline. Also, I did an experiment. If an author decided to delete the fic from the website, you will still have a copy of it in the app if you downloaded the fic. I have several on my faves before. There was one time I want to read a specific fanfic again but I can't find it anymore. Found out that the author decided to delete it.

** Ginny, in the books, barely gets any focus before her sudden promotion to Love Interest - and even then, not really enough characterization to make me care about her. I only really started to care when I found a few fanfics that explore her as a character.

Luna Lovegood is a character that's essentially begging for a character-exploration, what with her beliefs and her surprising amount of insight - and fanfics have a lot of fun with it.

Sirius Black is a unique case in that we do see a lot of him - for the books where Harry knows he exists, Sirius acts as a sort of confidante for Harry - but he's still only really seen as the man-on-the-run. Fanfic explores how he is without having to hide, and that made me like the character as a whole a lot more than the books alone.

There's also a few characters that are named but that basically get no characterization apart from having a name. Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Millicent Bulstrode, most of Hufflepuff House, most of Ravenclaw...

** It's been a long time since I read Harry Potter so my memory of characters outside of the golden trio is like very distant. Recently I read a marauder's era fanfic and I used to avoid reading this era because of the limited information in the actual book and how bad some writers write the story. This recent one started out innocent but by the time I finished it, I was really sad that Harry was denied the happy family he could have. Like almost everyone died. Two characters stood out to me, Snape and Lily. I liked their friendship and was very sorry to see it break apart due to the circumstance.

** Severus Snape. Reading the books as a child, I never had any particular attachment to his character - he was only ever the antognistic character who could not get over his hatred for Harry and his father.

However, fanfiction develops his character in a more appealing way as a mentorship towards Harry in different situations. That being said, any "evil" characters such as Voldemort/Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy etc etc are some of my favourite characters to read about. Of course, I understand that they'll never have any form of relationship/friendship/mentorship towards Harry if you think about it in terms of canon, but when fanfic writers develop and go into detail about how the character could be redeemed or even change the circumstances so that they aren't inherently dicks, then that's something that I can agree with.

**** No, actually. I rarely ever see Neville as the focus, the only time I do is when he replaces Harry as the BWL, and fics like that make him feel more like a replacement instead of his own character. I don't care to know what he could've and couldn't have done in Harry's place, I'd want to see what he does as simply Neville Longbottom. :(

After all, his whole character is being brave despite no one expecting him to, not even himself. Timid Gryffindor beong brave for his friends and all that.

***** Yeah I see a lot of those :/ I'm not a huge fan of that either. I think Neville's character is so wonderful in his quiet bravery - like he did things even in his first year that was brave like trying to warn the trio of Draco's plans to get them in trouble. I wish there were more fics with him where they didn't change him :( like you can just grow off what you know about him and develop him that's great, but why change everything ??

I write a Neville fic and the lack of Neville fics really fueled me to want to write one. I still look for them to read. We need more Neville fics !

** For me it was Ginny in Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood, although she was dead from the very beginning of the story. But the way Harry reminisces about her was very touching, and the end was very sad and great at the same time.\\
Normally I had never cared much for her.

And I¬¥ve got to mention Tracey Davis too. There were several fics with her in it but when I started to write my own ff I really got into her character. But I think that¬¥s nothing out of the ordinary.

** I have the opposite situation. I don't think there's any character where I feel like their fanon portrayal has improved upon their canon depiction. On the other hand, there are plenty of characters I liked in canon but whose typical characterisation in fanon has started to negatively affect my feeling towards that character:

- Hermione (Super!Hermione, Mugglewank Hermione, swimsuit Hermione, etc.)

- Ginny (Most often a vehicle for saccharine fluff and the propagation of traditional gender stereotypes and relationship cliches.)

- Fleur (All the Veela stuff.)

- Sirius (In PoA he was menacing, had a dark side, and was powerful enough to scare even Dumbledore. In fanon he is a womanising man child.)

- Snape (Snape fangirls have destroyed his character.)

*** This is true 99% of the time, but there are a handful of authors out there that take these characters, especially Ginny and Fleur (though never in a Harry/Fleur), and flesh them out well beyond their book characterizations.

Probably the most obvious example is Annerb's Ginny, who isn't quite canon but is extremely well done and bucks the traditional relationship stereotype far more than canon Ginny. And I say this as someone who likes canon Ginny.

**** There's a particular species of Mugglewank fic which we might call "Muggle cultural victory via liberal values" where the author rants a lot about how backwards the wizarding world is in comparison to Muggle society. These stories always feature a scene where Hermione wears a bikini and all the wizards are scanadalised by how much skin she is showing, and thereafter you can tell whether a character is good or evil depending on whether they are comfortable with revealing clothing (shares Muggle values therefore good) or not (socially conservative therefore evil).

Glossed over is the fact that liberal values are far from universal in the Muggle world. Also glossed over is the fact that Hermione likely falls somewhere towards the moderately conservative end of the scale of Muggle values.

*** Don't get me started hahah! All my fav fics are usually Sirius centric to be honest so if your not a fan of him you'll probably hate all of these!!

In the black and black mask by izzythehutt (a03 or ffn) I think this might be my favourite ever fan fiction, it's still being updated but there's a lot to read! It's largely based around the black family and it's set not long after the marauders leave school so it's first Wizarding war time! The idea is that Regulus survives the cave and it brings the black family back together and it's so funny at times but also super angsty! It's a great mix, honestly one of the best characterisations of certain characters I've ever seen, like the Dumbledore is so on point, I think if you like JK Rowling writing , you'll love this!!! I also like Falling Star by Goldenlioness4 (ffn) , it's during 5th or 6th year I can't remember and it's spanning the prank and Sirius running away, I really loved it - there is a Dada teacher who has amazing characterisation and I usually hate OCs but I've fallen in love with this character ( Professor Keenan) and I'm gutted he's not in any other fics !

** * The thing about JKR's writing is that though she is a great worldbuilder, she isn't all that great at developing characters, which is annoying when you are just reading the books at surface level for the first time, but great for FanFiction readers/writers. Characters like the Marauders and just throwaway ones like Daphne, though on opposite polls regarding their importance to the story, are given the same amount of Fanon development... I'm not saying we know them in the books at the same level! Because there is so much room for characters from the books to become OC's, people imprint onto them. The reason you like Fanon Sirius more than Book Sirius is that you relate to him better since he is more fleshed out. The thing about Fanon is that you can pick and choose between what different Fanfic authors have put out there while keeping Canon in mind and essentially create a version of Sirius that you like better. That's what's so great about it.

** My favorite is Orion Black for sure. Well I usually read marauders fics. But once I discovered izzythehutt's ‚ÄòBlack mask' I could never stop reading it. Very well written - a lot of fully developed minor characters from Original hp books. It's my favorite marauders era fic. Sirius used to be my fav of all times but it's getting even more interesting if you think about this handsome rebel's parents. After all, like father like son.

Actually I'd say that it's one of the best Sirius characterization I've ever read as well (for those who like a complex character of Sirius Black it's a must read).

Also I never cared much for Regulus while reading books but he is quite a popular character in fics - I guess now he is also one of my favorite. His life and his motivation definitely deserve more love and attention.

So I guess it's the trio I rediscovered through reading fan fiction.

** Ooof. I just stumbled upon this post and saw my giant letter answer from a while ago- wow.

A couple of months later, having read a lot more fanfic, I have a reply that answers your question instead of random bullshit- Sirius, Lily and Peter. 

(Before I talk about why these specific characters, I'd like to mention that my growing interest in these characters is not solely because of fanfiction and there are other factors. I think a big part of me loving Sirius, for example, is because of the kind of home he came from and how his circumstances were much like the ones I grew up around, albeit way more fucked up.) 

‚Äã

1. When I started reading fanfic, I didn't have much of an opinion on Sirius Black. I thought, as a decent chunk of the fandom still does that he was a bully and an asshole, and that was that (he was a bully and an asshole, but that was not it). The second time I read the books, after discovering Sirius!Centric fanfiction, I paid way more attention to his character- I genuinely kept a piece of paper beside me while reading the Sirius-heavy scenes to take down notes (I was going through an annotation phase, okay?). As I got more and more swept up in his character, I started reading more fanfiction about him and got particularly interested in his childhood (which, to this day, I find fascinating). My Young!Sirius headcanons, informed by multiple fics, have coloured my perception of Sirius as an adult, but this version of Sirius is still Canon!Sirius (I didn't take anything away), just with a more rich backstory, explaining how he became the person he was by OotP.                                         
2. Now, Lily. Lily is much more of a blank slate than Sirius, so to clearly define her, I had to read the two pages of Snape's Worst Memory over and over. Eventually, I was able to separate her from the Hermione 2.0 (or would Hermione be the 2.0?) that the fandom has created, and realise that in the few scenes we have, Lily was kind, a bit naive, brave, care-free, and somewhat righteous (or at least that's what I picked up on). My view of Lily became way more elaborate through fanfiction, and I was able to see her as more than the perfect mother I had in my head. And I got into Lily!Centric fics through Sirius-Lily friendship fics, funnily enough, so I suppose that was another way that my interest in the character developed through non-Canon materials. 
3. And finally, Peter. Let me admit- I was already interested in Peter before I got into fanfic, but not quite to the extent that I am today. The thing that got me into Peter the first time is that he must have been a likeable person at one time, right? He may not have been King Charisma, but there had to be something to keep his friends from abandoning him. And he had to have had some relationships with the Marauders. Loads of fics ignore this, but the ones that acknowledged it drew me into his character, and now, the story of Peter's betrayal is one of my favourite arcs in the entire series.

‚Äã

{Sidenote: I'm surprised how many fics completely ignore Peter as part of the Marauders and stick to Remus, Sirius and James. I understand that betrayal is hard and painful to write, but if Peter isn't part of the Marauders, then you aren't writing a Canon Compliant story, but an AU (not that there's anything wrong with that- most of my fics are AU's)}

Having said this, I have also experienced the opposite. I think fanfiction ruined somewhat Hermione and Harry for me (with the constant tropes)- with characters who I already knew, it was easier because I was able to ignore the tropes (I knew where to look), but with the Golden Trio, it's just shoved in your face. Luckily, I avoid bashing, so my precious Ron has stayed whole. Let's hope it stays that way.

In the end, I would like to go back to my original answer (April 2020)- fan fiction is something that flourishes because of ambiguity in writing. Luckily for us (though maybe not so much for her), while writing Harry Potter, JKR had issues writing clear backstories and fully developing most of her characters. There were also plenty of background characters, which gives the fanfiction community a lot to build on top and leaves things up to the imagination of the average reader, too. Her characters are perfect for writing fanfiction about because there is enough ambiguity for your interpretation and headcanons to add something to them, without revamping them. My Sirius, Lily and Peter headcanons do not contradict source materials, but they make the characters mine which makes them all the more interesting.
