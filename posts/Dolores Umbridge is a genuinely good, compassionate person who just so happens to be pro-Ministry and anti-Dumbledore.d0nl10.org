** There's a story out there where Umbridge raises Harry.

It's a good story, although I wouldn't call Umbridge â€˜good'.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is setting her up as a diligent, competent Ministry worker who is one of the few experts on a pretty shitty situation the Ministry ends up in through no fault of its own. Doesn't seem like she's going to end up being a villain in it.

But there's a LOT of story to get through before that happens, so may not be worth your time

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** */Detective Umbridge/* by /Avaday Daydream/

#+begin_quote
  "Nobody is willing to face another war. People would flee Britain." Cornelius Fudge believes that a new dark wizard is posing as Voldemort to weaken Magical Britain's morale. To try and expose the truth, he sends the heroic Dolores Umbridge to examine Harry Potter's testimony, Albus Dumbledore's motives, and Draco Malfoy's behavior.

** I believe it would be good idea to explore umbridge as a person. She would initially indeed be a good person who did things out of loyalty to ministry but events of first war breaks her and atmosphere in Minstery leds her to becoming who she is There aren't any fics that explore politics of ministry or rise of Dolores Umbridge

** The conflict of the 5th book becomes Umbridge trying to convince Harry to see a mind healer and Dumbledore blocking it. Of course, since she's Umbridge, once Voldemort comes back she starts campaigning for outright fascism.

Honestly, I'm surprised there are like no Good!Umbridge in Indy!Harry and Evil!Dumbledore stories.

***** I'm happy for him.

That has nothing to with Umbridge being one of the most well known and deeply despised heat-sink's in fiction. There's no where to go with a character like that. She has no redeeming qualities to grab onto, no facet of her character you can empathize with. She's a loathsome bitch whom nobody particular cares that she was (probably) raped by horse cock all evening as her book 5 comeuppance. Her character is too established and everybody wants to see her bested. That's â€˜staying antagonist' written all over it in glowing fluorescent ink.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
