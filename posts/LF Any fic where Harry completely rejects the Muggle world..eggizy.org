I'm looking for any fics where Harry completely rejects the muggle world in all forms. I've read so many fics, typically Indy!Harry where he tries to replicate some element of the muggle world using magic. I.e. wearing robes outside of Hogwarts. - Casual use of magic - Enjoying the whimsy of quills and parchment etc

Thank you.


** Yes officer there this boy with a strange scar and he wearing robes in broad daylight

** This would be great! Maybe instead of rejecting muggle though, it's more him embracing magic. RemindMe! 7 days
