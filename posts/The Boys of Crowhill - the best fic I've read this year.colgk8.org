It's a new-ish fic (July 2018) that has an actually fresh premise that's done incredibly well. The basic difference is that Harry grew up in an orphanage and the story spans his first year at Hogwarts. However, so many things are /different/ that it's hard to give a solid point of divergence. It is absolutely /not/ a canon rehash. The author's writing style is also amazing and the story feels very Rowling-esque in some parts. It features 11-year-olds as actual 11-year-olds and it's done /well/. Unfortunately, there's no sequel up yet although reading the story as a stand-alone is still satisfying.

Edit: It's actually not a new fic, it was just posted on FFN recently

**** you're welcome. I LOVED the first one, they get progressively darker, and I'm not at all sure I like where the author went with Lupin... but I think they are still updating, so I'm hoping it gets worked out.

** I'm in the middle of reading this now. I love those adorable little Slytherins trying to be Machiavellian and doing it badly.

** It moved a bit slowly for me at parts but remained solid in writing style all the time. The part where Nicholas Flamel talks about the philosopher's stone is very cool. Much about the end of the story if very cool, really.

** Oh my God, I just finished the first part a few days ago and it's already in my top 10. I actually love the way it's written, definitely inspirational.
