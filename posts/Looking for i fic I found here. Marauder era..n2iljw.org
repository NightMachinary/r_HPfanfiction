:END:
I don't remember if it was chaptered, abandoned or complete but I found it here just yesterday. But as I read dozens of fics at once I sometimes lose them. I don't know if I decided I didn't like it and deleted the tab but I just can't find it.

Premise: A prank war at Hogwarts renders the school unusable and different schools offered to host Hogwarts students.

Characters I remember:

The marauders Regulus Severus Lily Prewett Twins Narcissa

So Peter ends up in beaxbatons. Remus goes to a small school in Scotland as it's the only one capable of hosting a werewolf.

James and Sirius are going to a school I can't remember the name of and can't pronounce.

The school is an all boys school and is the much younger counter part to an all girls school. They are looking at combining the two schools in the future.

Lily, Narcissa and other irrelevant characters are in the all girls school.

In the boys we have: James Sirius Severus Regulus Fabian Gideon All the other boys I forgot

The twins are together because when magical twins sleep apart their magic unconsciously brings them together. Just easier this way.

Anyway James and Sirius want to room together but they're the guests and get told so.

One of the boys I can't remember mentions something about needing houses (Gryffindor, slytherin etc) so they can tell if someone is dark. They are told to get to know someone and find out that way.

Oh a prefect picks up the boys and Sirius suggests going to town and having fun and the prefect calls him untrustworthy and unreliable.

This is what I remember. The writing wasn't good but I want to read it anyway.

Does anyone recognise this?

If so please link it in the comments.


** Oh wow I remember reading that years ago. I don't know if I'd be able to find it though.
