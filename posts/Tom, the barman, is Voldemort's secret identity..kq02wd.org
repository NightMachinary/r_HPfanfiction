Ever wonder what Voldemort was doing for most of the war, or how he get's his information? No, it's not spies or trips around the world, its that everyone will talk up the local friendly barkeep.


** My tired brain read Victoria's Secret identity. I would read your concept though!

** reminds me of a self-insert I read where she worked at the Leaky Cauldron after the first war so she could keep up with the timeline. I thought it was so clever.

** It would be impressive to see him keep his temper in check the first time someone said something insulting about him.

It would be cool to see him using more of his sneaky Tom Riddle side. I mean in school he was this great actor that had everyone fooled. Then by the end of the books he came across as rash. He fooled Harry a few times like the mysteries department but I suppose it was a different way. It seemed he lost all his charm.
