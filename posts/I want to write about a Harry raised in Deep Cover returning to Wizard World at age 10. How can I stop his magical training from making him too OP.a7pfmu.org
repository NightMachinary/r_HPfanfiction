** You know, it's a cool idea and everything, I used to think so too... but, have you actually ever tried to get a ten-yeard old to do anything? Occasionally helping my niece & nephews with their homework for the last few years, I can tell you it's an exhausting process and pretty much an ongoing struggle.

Idk how'd you get a child even younger than ten into any sort of meaningful training regimen. Kids usually aren't even aware of their own mortality until they're 8 or 9. For a child that age to understand the stakes and make systematic effort & progress, I think it would take a huge amount of consistent negative reinforcement, like physical pain or emotional manipulation. Idk how you would end up with anything other than an abomination of a human.

*** I learned piano from the age of 4. We started off with 15 minutes a day, then half an hour, and by the time I was 9 I was playing an hour or so.

It teaches a base, and habits about sitting down to do/practice whatever it is that you're learning. But the most important time comes when you start practiicing for yourself. No 6 year old wants to be forced into playing piano half an hour a day, but by the time I was about 12-ish I didn't need to be told to play, I was practicing for the love of it, and because I liked the attention I got from being good at it, and also because I had dreams of being professional.

Same concept applies to pretty much anything. You have to 'make' kids do it in the beginning, but they definitely have a capacity for learning and practive from a pretty young age.

And if they catch the 'I love this' bug, then they'll pour everything they have into it on their own volition.

**** Very true. I should have specified in my comment that I meant survival-oriented training, rather than hobbies. Obviously if you can get a kid to try something and they like it and keep practising, that's all good.

I suppose you could even get a child excited in survival training. But the probem is, survival-based training depends a lot on performing under stress, be it mental, physical, emotional. And when you start thinking about intentionally introducing performance under stress to children, things turn ugly.

Seriously, you can teach kids a lot of stuff if you think about how you can integrate what you want them to learn into an activity they like!

Say with magic if you want to teach them a shield charm, duel with stinging hexes (which is fun) and then use a shield yourself (the kid will ask what you did and will probably want to learn it, too!)

Also: POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT :) - praise them (if they made an effort, even if they didn't get it totally right!) often!

With kids it has to be 'love' based (I guess this is a good sub to be talking about the power of love) rather than 'fear' based.

***** Your comment was about the ability to teach a kid, and your personal experience with your niece & nephews. I gave real-world examples of meaningful training regimens.

Getting a child younger than ten into any sort of meaningful training regimen is actually easier than starting with a ten-year-old. They are far less likely to be bored with or afraid of what they being taught. The best teaching methods (at any age) rely more on positive reinforcement than negative. If you don't encourage the behaviors you want to see they won't know what those behaviors even are.

** At age ten, your typical student from an industrialized country is learning multiplication and division, how to use the library, basic physics of sound, temperature, how to classify life forms (vertebrate vs. invertebrate), how weather happens and otherwise just beginning to come to the realization that things are connected and complex. They're still busy mimicking their idols without context. Talented ones may be getting close to competent at a sport, but only if that's the primary use of all their free time.

A talented wizard child might be able to control magic well enough to push things away, call them forward, set them on fire and make them float.

Whenever you consider advancing a character, set a particular age that they are meant to be equal to. An advanced ten year old might be equal to an /average/ person at fourteen.

** Have you ever read linkffn(Shinobi: The RPG)?

It's a gamer fic where a self-insert enters the Naruto world with a game interface similar to Fallout. /But/, at character creation, he dumps charisma to get more intelligence and luck.

Cue amazing ninja skills, but no social skills. No ability to work effectively in a team. He literally cannot understand the people around him, and even when he academically knows why they have a hard time getting along with him, he can't fix it. It's a really interesting read!

So, I would suggest putting your child soldier primarily in situations where advanced magic can't solve his problems, where he needs diplomacy and empathy and friendship. With the occasional chance to cut loose and kick butt.

** I'm going to join the general tenor of these responses:

I don't understand why a 10 year old child would be OP at anything. He's TEN. Personally I believe that there's a reason why Hogwarts starts at 11 and not say 7. The magic is probably too unstable before or maybe just too weak to make practical use of it.

So a very dedicated Harry might have learned some first year spells or whatever, but that's it. You can of course have him be relatively well educated in other non-magical areas or magical theory, but as long as you don't railroad the kid on one topic it's going to be something in the general area of what [[/u/wordhammer]] said.

He's a very young child. He's not going to be able to focus on learning for 8 hours a day, he's going to need to play and get sleep and socialize with other kids - unless you want to write a tragedy about a kid who's really messed up in the head.

** Take out magic and how much of a badass do you expect a kid to become after being trained up to that age? They might be able to shoot decently. They would be better able to run than other kids. They would know where to strike when they strike. But they couldn't hope to defeat any trained adult in hand-to-hand combat.

Similarly, a highly-trained Harry just entering Hogwarts would have a much greater breadth of knowledge regarding spells and would probably be a slippery bugger to pin down, but he'd have little chance of winning against a Death Eater.

I'd probably do it like: * He's a year ahead in general casting abilities and can overpower his peers. * Through cleverness, he can defeat people several years ahead of him with minimal preparation, assuming they underestimate him. * He can only defeat a Death Eater with cunning, stealth, and a large dose of luck, even with them underestimating him. * Socially, he's utterly broken because he's a child soldier.

Except this is a sort of character that doesn't lend itself to anything I would find interesting. Angst and fight scenes and that sort of thing. I'd rather not. So I'd make him a caricature, let him be OP, and have him fail miserably (but boldly and in full possession of his heroism) from having too little contact with the real world.

You can have your character be overdeveloped for his age, but temper his abilities. Don't let the character take on 7th years in dueling tournaments after just entering school, taking out Death Eaters in second year and fighting Dumbledore or Voldemort on equal grounds in year 3.

Most of all make sure there's a logical powercurve. Doesn't make much sense when a character is steamrolling death eaters but is struggling versus contemporaries the next scene because the author suddenly remembered he didn't want the character too OP.
