** Martyrdom and Paradox by UchidaKarasu [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1114206/chapters/2243645]]

It's pretty much the best Harry Potter/Death Note crossover that I've found (I mean there's not a ton, but the ones I've found, I haven't liked so much). They do a really good job of mixing in magic too, which I really appreciated.

I read this quite a bit ago (and I'll probably reread it again now that I'm thinking about it again) but I'm pretty sure they explain the Death Note universe pretty well... If not it's at the point where you'd only need a quick synopsis.

Oh! And this is slash. It's more focused on the plot of Death Note with added Potter bits than the sex and stuff though.

** Hm, try Child Of The Storm? Is Avengers/Harry Potter with a bit of X-Men mixed in.

Shouldn't need a ton of Marvel knowledge.

I can link you later/tomorrow but honestly it shouldn't be hard to find. Its obscenely long, too.

**** I absolutely agree. I think it would have been much better of if the author had stayed with an Avengers crossover instead of involving all these other characters.

I really liked the early chapters but then the author just kept throwing names around and I just couldn't keep up anymore.

Maybe it's more interesting for someone who's already versed in all of these crossover worlds but I personally gave up halfway through.

  One of the problems with crossover fics that I read is that they try to act like all of these people have always shared the same world, without that having really changed anything before.
#+end_quote

That's not really a problem, so much as the story being written that way.

It's not really intended to be a worlds colliding situation, it's more 'these worlds have always been together but we're only now going to zoom out and show you the bigger picture. But if that's not what you're looking for it's not what you're looking for.

Also, I'm not really sure what you mean that 'everyone is related to everyone'? Like everyone has blood relations? Or knows everyone? Knowing everyone, yeah that's a valid complaint.

I thought it wouldn't need that much knowledge of Marvel, I guess I was wrong. Sorry for the bad rec!

Like the fact that some of the characters whose family trees weren't really of any concern for anyone but the most hardcore fans suddenly got familial connections with characters from the other side of the crossover, for no visible reason other than what appears to be fanwank. Even if a reason for it is given later, it does cross a certain threshold with all the “x is related to y” revelations to the point where it can be off-putting to people.

** I don't know about the rest of your requirements, but linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) is 1.4 million words; an HPxMarvel crossover.

Also most of Darth Marrs's stuff is pretty good, or plums, or his co-writer's story, linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For). That's mostly all Star Wars stuff.

How good is this? My Marvel knowledge extends to a few of the newer movies (Iron Man and Avengers basically) and a decent amount of fanfiction; how much knowledge do i need?

The summary kind of sounds like the classic godlike!OP!IamVerySmart!Harry and harems are generally a poor sign...

**** Eh, I have some knowledge of the universe, like when he mentions (meets, really) the Fantastic Four, I know who they are, same with Doctor Strange, the Negative Zone that he gets pulled out of, etc. I haven't read any of the comics and such, but I can still follow the plot well enough.

Harry's pretty OP I suppose, but so are quite a few other characters. I think their powers are explored a bit more realistically; see: Magneto. "Control of electromagnetism" is a pretty huge power, considering that's one of the four basic forces of the universe. I would say that the Marvel Universe in general has issues with power creep, and that Harry needs to be elevated to that level in order to make for an effective story where he is the main character.

Most of the start (and I suppose the middle too) of the story revolves around the X-Men, and I think the "main" crossover is with a cartoon series where the X-Men were in high school? Not entirely sure, never watched it. 1.4 million words means there's a decent amount of explanation though, and you don't need a ton of knowledge to understand.

Mostly I just read it when I've nothing else to read, I'm only about 400k words into it. The author updates every few months with another novel-length chapter of 100-200k words, and that's good enough for my reading pace.

I'm not entirely sure you could call it a harem yet, but as I said I haven't finished it so we'll see. Mostly just Harry and Ororo where I'm at, with maybe Jean in the future.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is the best you can get in that kind of category, especially fitting the "worlds collide" thing (since the world-travelers retain their original magic when travelling from one world to another). I see someone has already mentioned it. Also, it's somewhat clunkier, and shorter, but /Star Wars/ crossover linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) is a pleasant read with quite a few very good ideas.
