I had an idea of a story where after Harry was left with the Dursleys, Remus opens a book store near Surrey in an attempt to keep an eye on Harry. When Harry is old enough, he finds his way into Remus' store, and befriends the odd Mr Lupin. Over time, Remus finds out about how the Dursleys have been treating Harry, and takes him away from them, and raises him in hiding from Dumbledore.

If anyone wants to take this idea and roll with it, feel free, just send me a link when its uploaded :P

*** Probably thinking of Stealing Harry. Sirius/Remus, both own a bookshop & eventually adopt Harry from the Dursleys.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

*** I can see Bernard as the squib son of Alphard Black, who after his fathers death turned his inheritance into a small series of businesses around England with it. The shop itself doesn't really make any money but Bernard loves it, Then one day who walks in? Sirius's Godson and James Potter's son, two men who saved his life during the war, who treated him quite well and it silently eats at Bernard till he takes Little Harry under his wing and helps him out
