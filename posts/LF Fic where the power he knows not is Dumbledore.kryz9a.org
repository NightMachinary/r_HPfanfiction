:FlairText: What's That Fic? (Solved)
:END:
In this fic, Harry Potter refuses to fight the war. After much wheedling by Dumbledore, he offers to do so only if Dumbledore does so first. Wishing Harry's agreement, Dumbledore goes on a rampage. I think he ends up killing most or all of the death eaters, but possibly he was just capturing them . Eventually, someone concludes that Dumbledore himself was the power Voldemort knew not, since Dumbledore demonstrated his true power before Voldemort was active (i.e., in his fight against Grindelwald).

I think it ends withDumbledore being sent to an asylum, with the muggles thinking Fawkes is a parrot. However, that might be me conflating two stories.
