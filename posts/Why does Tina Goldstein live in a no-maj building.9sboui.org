Aren't wizards in America forbidden from interacting with No-Majs? Then why does Tina rent an apartment from a no-maj landlady, whom she also regularly talks with? Also what does Tina tell the landlady her job is?


** That's true. From her interactions with Jacob kinda reveals that she hadn't had much contact with muggles. She relies massively on her magic, so it's actually hard for me to believe that she would pass as a completely normal muggle to a landlady.

*** Would it be hard to believe? We've no reason to suspect Kingsley or Amelia Bones were particularly able apart from their magic, and yet the Muggles around them never suspected anything (not even when Kingsley worked for the Muggle PM).

** People are also forbidden from running red lights or parking in many places and yet they still do it. The age of consent is 16 in the UK, but the average of the age in which people have sex for the first time is also 16, which means plenty of people ignore the law. The existence of any law enforcement agency proves that laws are not always followed.

As for her occupation, she works as a clerk/secretary for the government, the state or the city. Should be believable enough.
