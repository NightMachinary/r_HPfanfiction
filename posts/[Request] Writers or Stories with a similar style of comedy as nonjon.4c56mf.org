Title says it all. I like most of nonjon's work for example linkffn(A Black Comedy) and the Where in the World is Harry Potter trilogy. Are there any others who have a similar style in sophomoric comedy?


** These are not exactly like nonjon's stuff, but I enjoyed linkffn(6849022) and linkffn(2318355), the first more than the second.

*** Thanks for the suggestions. I've read Make A Wish, and also enjoyed it. Haven't seen An Old and New World before, so I'll definitely check it out.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
