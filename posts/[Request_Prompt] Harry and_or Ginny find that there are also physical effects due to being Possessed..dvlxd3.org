It could be that Ginny's is more severe due to the length and severity of her Possession. Perhaps the effects present differently in females and males.\\
I think it would be difficult to diagnose and treat because Possessions seem to be rare in the Wizarding world. Magic could more difficult to practise due to the effects.


** The Mind Arts indicates that Ginny had been conditioned to eg trust anyone speaking in Parseltongue, etc, and that she would need extensive therapy.

*** Initially, after she had been rescued by Harry Potter from the hands of Tom, she had not noticed.

It was her mother that pointed it out, something she had been unconsciously ignoring.

Her hair was darkening.

It was a gradual process. As she readied herself for her second year at Hogwarts to start, it had slowly turned from the standard Weasley red into a more copper and eventually a burgundy tone. When the roots started to turn rapidly black, she had panicked.

Her mother had comforted her. Hair darkened with age, she said. It was just a sign she was growing into a young woman.

But that was only the first change.

Towards the end of the summer, all of her clothing felt ill-fitting and outright small at worst.

She had entered a growth spurt.

Only years later would she recognize it was one of the things she got from Tom.

By her sixth year, she was nearly unrecognizable.

Tall for a woman, at exactly six feet, with hair no longer with even the slightest hint of red. It was now as dark as Tom's had been. Her eyes had gone from their bright brown to a dark black. Once the remaining baby fat had gone from her face, it revealed fine facial features that no others in her family possessed. How right they were.

With her changed appearance came the rumors. Glamour charms wearing off, the secret Weasley bastard, every rumor worse than the last. Until Dumbledore had finally called her to his office.

He had a calm but curious expression on his weathered face.

''I feared this might happen, Miss Weasley. While I cannot divulge what Tom Riddle's Diary did exactly, be assured that this is extremely rare. Before Harry destroyed the Diary, thwarting Tom's plans to return to physical form, Tom did indeed possess you, which has left its physical mark. The soul is a delicate thing, even for one such as him, and seeks to change the vessel it has to make it more suitable to inhabit. Which is why you have been changed in such a way. It is the lingering evidence of the possession, and I am afraid, irreversible.''

She had grown increasingly pale at that, and by the end, nearly could not breathe. It had taken months of therapy for her to truly recover from Tom's tender mercies, but this only confirmed her worst fears,and dragged it all up once more.

Which is probably why she eventually ended up with Harry Potter after all. None else understood truly what possession had meant for her, and Harry had undergone similar, if lesser changes. Tom's length was the primary thing he had gotten, though how much was inherent to his parentage was debatable. Lily Potter had not been a short woman, nor James Potter a short man. But after the final defeat of the last form of Tom, Harry had stood at six feet and three inches.

Both had been hurt immeasurably by Tom Marvolo Riddle. An influence that would continue to haunt them for decades to come, certainly when not one of their children escaped it truly.

Tom would always be a part of them.

FINIS.

My attempt. Could use work, but this is what I imagined.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
