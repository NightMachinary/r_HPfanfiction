Which one did you like better???


** That dissolving to dust in the movie completely missed the point of Voldemorts death. That he was just a guy and died at end like one, with a verifiable corpse and everything. How can the people in the movie be sure he isn't going to pop up again in 10 years?

** The book version of course. A crowd of people being there to watch; the final conversation between the two; Voldemort dying like any other man.... The book version was superior in many ways.

** I'm not sure I could call either of them a 'duel'. It's not like Harry actually tried to beat Voldemort.
