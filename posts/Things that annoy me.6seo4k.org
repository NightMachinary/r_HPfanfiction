I have been reading a bunch of stories lately and started to put together a mental list of things I see a lot that annoy me. I am going to leave out a lot of the bashing stuff because if I included that we would be here all day. These are just little things that come up a lot.

1. Dumbledore does not offer lemon drops to everyone who enters his office. As a matter of fact as far as I can tell he doesn't offer lemon drops to anyone, ever. In PS he offers a sherbet lemon to McGonagall who has no idea what they are. Sherbet Lemon is also the password to his office in CoS. That's it.

2. Hogwarts letters don't arrive on a child's 11th birthday. It was just a coincidence that Hagrid caught up with them on Harry's birthday.

3. Molly Weasley does not give painful bone crushing hugs, nor does she give them to children she just met. The first time we see Molly give Harry a hug is in the Hospital wing at the end of GoF.

4. "The sorting hat wanted to put me in Slytherin." This one is kind of justified because Harry does think that in canon but the Sorting Hat doesn't actually say that. The hat is thinking about where to put him and Harry brings up not wanting to be in Slytherin. Canon Harry seems like he would have wound up in Gryffindor either way.

There are more and I'll probably add to the list later but these are the first ones that pop out at me.


** I hate it when fics treat the four houses as a universal law for one's personality.

Griffindors are ONLY brave idiots. Hufflepuffs are ONLY sappy tea sippers. Ravenclaws are ONLY bookworms. Slytherins are ONLY dark magic purebloods.

People aren't like this in real life. Personalities change constantly, especially the teenage years. A quiet bookworm can easily turn into a brave idiot social butterfly over the course of 7 years. But the HP universe makes it seem like people have a master personality that guides them for life. real stupid.

PS I hate Rowling's portrayal of Slytherin. She made an entire 1/4 of a school population look like ogres based on less than a handful of people.

To be fair, this is a sort of enforced trope. Take a kid, find the personality traits they exemplify the most, tell them about those traits, put them in a house with like-minded children, reinforce those traits with propaganda-like conditioning and stereotypes, embed those traits into a group's collective identity for seven years during a child's formative period... and then see how much his personality revolves around those traits.

As a personality shorthand, /it works/. That's because they're living in an environment that passively indoctrinates those four personality archetypes. Obviously, there are exceptions - Peter Pettigrew comes to mind - and obviously, there are people with far more complex personalities than just what their house defines (basically everyone the hat took more than ten seconds to sort). But the use of the houses as descriptors gives a concise set of vocabulary to describe both the conformists and the exceptions.

If you're annoyed with it, well, that's JKR's fault for constructing a world pre-defined with such traits.

Let'a take impressionable 11 year olds, find their dominant personality trait, and stick them in an evironment that rewards the development of that trait to the exclusion of everything else.

***** Like others have said, it's really just supposed to be a system to separate kids to organize them for classes/other events and is normally assigned at enrollment.

*** God yes. I also hate when people say stuff like "Oh, how very Slytherin of you" if Harry tells one lie. Or when someone does something mildly foolish, and people say "That was very Gryffindor-ish."

As if the only two traits Slytherins have are ambitious and cunning. Just because those two traits stick out doesn't mean Slytherins can't be brave and or Gryffindors be cunning/ambitious. Hermione is in Gryffindor and she's super fucking ambitious with her SPEW thing.

** - It bugs me when a lack of speech tags makes me go back through a section of dialogue because I have to switch in my head who was saying what. It happens in published stuff, too.

- In fanfiction, having the bad-ass main character pull off some sort of aggressive, defiant, or even criminal action where there are a bunch of witnesses, but they aren't held accountable for it. Some of these edgelords really ought to be sent to Azkaban for their crimes.

- Mostly I get annoyed when I read stories using good ideas I had already planned for use in my stories, but that my lack of diligence in getting them finished and posted will make it seem like I'm copycatting.

1. Ron bashing - The guy already has plenty of realistic flaws you don't have to write him as a dribbling moron to get drama. He's also not this horrible dead weight either. I blame the movies for stealing all of his best lines and giving them to Hermione.
2. Super nice misunderstood Slytherins. - I get it, people get sorted into Slytherin by Pottermore so they want some nice relatable ones. I don't think they're pure evil or anything, but the bigotry wasn't completely in Harry's imagination.
3. Kids paired with teachers. - No guys, it's effin creepy. Stop it.\\
4. Misunderstood Snape - You can be a mean bitter old asshole and still have been on the side of good. They aren't mutually exclusive things.
5. Daphne Greengrass - I don't know why but her appearance always causes me to roll my eyes. This isn't completely fair on my part.

While that is probably the intended reading, I'd like to think of that as part of the Hat's decision-making process. If Harry were resigned or accepting, it would be evidence against him belonging in Slytherin. If he were eager about greatness, it would be evidence for him belonging in Slytherin. That sort of thing.

#+begin_quote

Daphne, the blonde Ice Queen of Slytherin, who's best friends with Tracey Davis, whose family is an old and powerful pureblood Noble House? And either whose father is abusing her and Harry will kill off as a favor to her, or whose father was careful to keep his House neutral in the past war but could easily be persuaded (by a random passing schoolchild, for instance) that neutrality isn't the right option this time, and who would become a key political ally for the coming war?

Yeah, meeting her would have been helpful.

** Some of my pet peeves:

- When people pretend that magical cores aren't canon.

- Having wizards being able to just cast magic forever.

- When the main character doesn't fall in love with one person and stay together with that person for the entire fic.

- When authors write Veela but don't include anything about their Allure.

- Dumbledore who is written as conflicted. He's not conflicted, he's stupid and evil.

- Fics where people don't obey the law. When Harry inherits all his titles, it's pointless if he then has to go around still earning power for himself. What should be happening is that everyone respects Harry's titles and complies with his legal powers, regardless of their individual magical power or political influence.

Sirius being stupid

James being stupid

Remus is boring and a teacher's pet

Peter is stupid

Lily is Einstein level of genius, more powerful than Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, Peverell brothers and the Founders combined. She casts the patronus charm at the age of 11, wandlessly, non verbally and at the first try. Gets straight 'O's and makes a veela look like a troll.

Lily was never described as the brightest witch of her age.

Lily is not Hermione. Lily is not a bookworm, all panicky about exams, she's not a party pooper, she's not a Mary Sue, she is not anxious and a know-it-all, she's not introverted. Lily is lovely, vivacious, bubbly, very funny and extroverted. She is closest to Tonks but she is not Tonks.

Lord Hadrian Black-Potter-Gamp-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Malfoy-Nott-Bill Gates-Your mother. (Bit never Hufflepuff)

Ron bashing

Dumbledore bashing

Snape had friends other than Lily, you know. He hung out with Avery and Mulciber and that was a factor of Lily dropping the friendship.

Well... that was painful.

Edit: Marlene McKinnon, Hestia Jones, Alice Longbottom, Dorcas Meadowes and Emmeline Vance being Lily's best friend/friends.

Marlene McKinnon is always the female version of Sirius and they always end up together if Wolfstar isn't there.

Wolfstar. It doesn't make sense just like Drarry and Dramione doesn't make sense.

  Lily is not Hermione. Lily is not a bookworm, all panicky about exams, she's not a party pooper, she's not a Mary Sue, she is not anxious and a know-it-all, she's not introverted. Lily is lovely, vivacious, bubbly, very funny and extroverted. She is closest to Tonks but she is not Tonks.

WIthout her, he would have died against the Basilisk because he had no idea about the killing gaze, would have been roasted by the Horntail, would have no way of saving Sirius and despite knowing that it was 99.99% certain that the DoM was a trap she still went with Harry.

*** I do like that idea. I have been sitting on the concept for a while that the Hat sorts into houses based on wherever someone has the most potential, and after that it's up to higher-year'd students to help the smaller students grow.

Hence, Hermione and Neville getting into Gryffindor; one's a genius who's a bit stuck-up about the rules, the other's a nervous chook, but by the end of the first book they both start developing some real courage (to break away from the rules or stand up against wrong).

Normally the Slytherins would grow to be ambitious (in a good way) under this model, but because of Voldemort, the strongest influence on growing Slytherins ends up being Death Eater ideology instead.

** It annoys me when Harry Potter is involved as a major character. He's perfect as a side character, really. His personal motivation is low, he hangs out around school all the time doing banal stuff, and he pops up every couple months with a bit of his story arc. He's pretty passive, so you don't really need to worry about figuring out what he's up to -- he's just going to school unless the plot says otherwise. (Hell, he's not even curious about his own parents, really. Harry doesn't know what his parents did for a living.)
