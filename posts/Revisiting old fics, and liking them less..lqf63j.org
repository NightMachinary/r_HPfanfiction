Does anybody ever find that when they read old fics, they like them less than they did the first time around?

I'm just finishing reading The Refiner's Fire/The Time of Destiny pair of fics by Abraxan, as I remember enjoying them when I first read them (probably over ten years ago, it was written pre-HBP). The trouble is, I'm enjoying it a lot less now than I did then.

Harry is overpowered (amazing magical power, phoenix animagus, etc), but seems to be sacrificing himself at every turn, seemingly just to give Ginny a reason to sit at his bedside in the hospital wing and angst. At least 60% of the fic seems to be "Harry gets injured, goes to hospital, Ginny angsts, Harry gets up to save someone before he should, because he's Just That Heroic, ends up back in hospital".

Also, Harry seems to spend a good portion of the fic angsting over atrocities that Voldemort commits, somehow blaming himself for them because if Harry had never been born, Voldemort wouldn't target all these people. It's supposed to come off as selfless (I think) but it just comes across as arrogant that Harry considers himself responsible for everything.

The main pairing (H/G) is also nauseating. They're ready to marry directly out of school, Ginny literally says she doesn't care about exams, her plans to study to be a Healer, a career, any of that. She literally says "I don't care about any of that! I just want to marry you now!" There's also a lot of "baby", "sweet girl" etc thrown around. It's all very codependent, and I'm reminded uncomfortably of Twilight.

I don't remember any of this bothering me at the time. Have standards improved that much, or have my tastes just changed? Has anyone else found anything similar about old fics?

Edited to use better words.


** Oh yeah. A lot of times I'll read something and it's not just the story I like less, it's the writing. Teenage me would really read anything. I have high standards now.

** I think part of it is just the greater exposure and experience: The first indy!Harry fic I read was fun because it was novel (to me) and because sometimes you just want to read about things going well for the good guys. If it were the only one (or close to it), it might even be well-regarded as original, even if not particularly dramatic, but there are /so damn many/ of the things that are so similar and formulaic they've become one of the shorthands for lazy writing.

Another factor is the sheer quantity and variety of fanfiction out there: As you read more, you start to develop your own tastes and preferences and thus get increasingly pickier about what fics to read.

** I think it his because you read more and more fan fictions the standards are raised. I have the same problem; I once asked about a fan fiction on this subreddit and I was so excited except when I started to read I cringe, it was one of the first fan fictions I read and it was good for the beginning but my standards have been raised, the same thing has/ is happening to you.

** Absolutely. I've been reading HP fanfic for nearly 20 years now, and sometimes I'll stumble upon a fic I remember enjoying a long time ago. And often it won't be anywhere near as good as I remember. My tastes have changed over the years, my standards have increased. That's just part of growing up. Added to that, a plot idea may have been unique or rare at the time, but if I then spent 5 years reading hundreds of fics using the same idea then it won't have the same level of appeal.

** I guess, you grew up. It happens.

I started to read fanfiction as adult (very very much adult) and most of the most celebrated stories are unpalatable for me (don't let me start on the whole indy!Harry subgenre). Specifically, ‚ÄúThe Refiner's Fire‚Äù (with most intriguing and most unused title; linkffn(2163835)) was one of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lq5nku/what_was_the_worst_plot_twist_youve_ever_seen/][the biggest disappointments in fanfiction]]: a story with absolutely marvellous beginning which turned into stupid super!Harry crap. I was so disappointed that I could read just a chapter or so after the turn of the story.

*** Definitely agreed! It did start really well, with Harry's Muggle girlfriend and that whole plot, it was nice to give Harry a realistic teenage romance instead of him jumping straight into a committed lifelong relationship immediately. But you're right, it did go bad after a while.

** This is why I don't reread fan fiction. For some reason I remember a memorable reading experience much more than the fic itself. There is some really high quality stuff I don't have very highly rated because the reading experience for me wasn't very memorable.

** I have 124 fics on my FFN Follow list, but I try to reserve my Favorites list for stories that I know I enjoy rereading, so that one is only 48 (and not all HP, and some of them are the individual books in a series).

Nightmares of Futures Past never gets old for me, even though it actually is pretty old. I've lost count of how many times I've read it. The biggest problem, really, is that it's incomplete and only very occasionally updated.

** I reread some LOTR fic last year that I obsessed over in middle school in the early/mid 00's...woof. I was a smart middle schooler, but damn if my crusty 30 yo self could stand reading the fic I loved which is full of typos/grammar mistakes/plot inconsistencies. And one of my least favorite devices fic authors use are out-of-character terms of endearment. See a lot of that in HP and Star Wars fic.

Ultimately we mature and so do our tastes, but it's nice to remember these fics---and of course---I'm forever grateful to the majority of fic writers who do it for free for their and fans' own enjoyment.

*** Definitely agreed on the terms of endearment.

British people very rarely call their significant other "baby", "sweetie", "honey" etc un-ironically.
