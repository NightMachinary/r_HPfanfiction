I'm trying to write a trashy ship fic parody and I want to use some parts of it as a reference.

Is it this one? I think Voldemort ends up killing him, but the rest of the drivel in it fits your description.

***** It seemed very personal. Like he was channeling his own frustrations through terrible fanfiction. It was definitely cringeworthy. Just gave the impression he was working out his emotions or something like that. It kind of made me laugh, though.

And let me disclaim I've never really read any of his other stuff.

*** i feel like i'm gonna catch some shit for this, but why you all saying that this fic is horrible? is it plot? part where Harry, insecure, socialy inept, no-one-ever-explained-him-how-girls-work, right-after-Sirius-died Harry, completely blown Hermione's "rejection" out of proportion and got himself in to a epic funk? or is it something else entirely? p.s. i not saying that this is "the best fanfic ever", but i definitely seen much, much worse.

**** I'm not saying that it's the worst thing I've ever read but the way it handles the "funk" is garbage. Harry literally stops moving, eating or drinking because his crush told him she wasn't interested. He doesn't even bother opening letters that fall a couple feet away from him. That's beyond a "funk." This is like brony neckbeard creep level.

This is a very good description of extreme depression, which is more common than you'd think. It is OOC for Harry, but it's very real for many people.

**** I don't think Canon Harry is that emotionally fragile, even after Sirius's death. Canon Harry's response to people rejecting him, or keeping him in the dark about something, is rarely depression; his response is almost always anger followed by self-reflection. If Hermione, or anyone rejected him, Harry would silently brood about it for a while, think about it, and then get over it. Him falling apart over being rejected is not only wildly out of character, it's simply bad writing.
