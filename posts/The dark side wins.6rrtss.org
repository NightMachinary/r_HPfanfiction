I'm after completed fics where the dark side/Voldemort/Grindelwald win. I've read a few good one's that I really liked such as Cruel and beautiful world, Nocture, The Courtesan and The Dark Lord Never Died (sorry I am so confused how to tag these if other's wish to read - although Cruel and Beautiful World is impossible to find unfortunately!) Just wondering if anyone else had some good fics to read? I'd appreciate any recommendations. I like where there is some kind of resistance but honestly happy with any. Thanks in advance! :)


** linkffn(3766574)

One of the best Harry Potter fan-fictions ever written. Highly recommend it, even if it was left unfinished at 1.2 million words.

*** I've always had mixed feelings about this one.

The first two "books" of the story are some of the best fanfiction I've ever read. Interesting world-building that leaves you wanting more, enjoyable characters, and some real great twists. Like seriously, the twist at the end of Book 2 is one of the best I've ever read.

The problem is that - like many great fanfictions - as time goes on /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ falls apart under its own weight. Exploring werewolf society? Cool! Exploring British politics under Voldemort? Cool! Exploring international relations? Cool! Exploring fae and pagan magic? Cool! Exploring numerous supporting characters? Cool!

Doing all of that at once while attempting to write a Harry-focused plot? That's where the story starts to fall apart. The author didn't seem to have an overarching plan, and as a result the story ends up being too bloated and convoluted. A menagerie of every plot idea they decided was interesting enough to incorporate. They try to accomplish too much and as a result accomplish too little. At the end of the 1.2 million words I found myself asking, "so what?" Where's this story going? What's the endgame? What's the overarching plot/theme? It's hard to call the fic a story rather than a series of interesting events and episodes.

The original Harry Potter series is 200,000 words shorter yet much tighter, more focused, and purposeful. Not perfect by any means mind, but there's a clear goal it's driving towards throughout and a story we're meant to be following. /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ ultimately lacks that, and I think that's unfortunate because it has so much potential. Better planning or a rewrite would do this fic wonders.

My other issue is that it heavily whitewashes Voldemort via AU. He is changed to a nasty but charming and benevolent dictator with an interest in pagan magic. Magical Britain under him is painted as...not that bad, honestly. Sure Voldemort is cruel, but his cruelty is almost always presented as for the greater good or against those who deserve it in some way. The democratic German Ministry of Magic is painted as significantly more racist, corrupt, and incompetent than Authoritarian Britain or the magical Monarchy of France.

This is problematic for a few reasons. First, it's taking the easy way out. Rather than explore the complex moral questions of Harry being involved in a cruel and murderous regime where he's mentored by magical Hitler, it just sort of magics those concerns away. What could be a challenging and interesting story is purposefully simplified so that the author can present Voldemort as an "evil is cool" character. Any complexity is swept under the rug.

The second big problem is the story increasingly reads like apologia for authoritarianism. Voldemort's regime is presented as efficient and well liked, making the trains run on time and keeping the masses happy and comfortable. The horrible nature of what dictatorships do to stay in power is for the most part kept well in the background or handwaved altogether. Voldemort's evil is superficial and ultimately doesn't effect his regime's effectiveness and benevolence. The French Ministry of Magic, run by a monarchy, is giving a similarly good treatment.

In comparison, the German Ministry of Magic is presented as even worse than the British Ministry in Canon. Corrupt, racist, aggressive, and self-righteous, it's pretty horrible compared to Voldemort's regime and is the main /antagonist/ of the story. The dichotomy is clear - authoritarianism is benevolent, well-liked, and efficient, democracy is corrupt, incompetent, and bigoted. That's a pretty awful message to be sending, intentionally or not.

So while I wouldn't call it an awful fic by any means, it has some /huge/ flaws both in terms of its structure and the underlying message it sends.

At the same time, you're discounting the fact that oftentimes democratic governance is equally as corrupt and incompetent as authoritarian governance.

The only difference between most democratic and authoritarian governments is the fact that the corrupt and incompetent government officials are voted in by the democracy's people, rather than the corruption and incompetence running through a certain group of individuals who are the main holders of power.

It's in human nature to want power, money, and fame. Proponents of both types of government are equally as guilty of it - and I hate to see that being discounted. Democracy is an equally as flawed system of government, especially when those who seek power through it are self serving or bad at their jobs.

***** My criticism is less that a democratic regime is presented badly and more that every authoritarian government in the story is presented without flaws or similar problems, ignoring completely the significant downsides of authoritarian regimes. Democratic regimes are sometimes corrupt and awful. Authoritarian regimes are /always/ corrupt and awful, not to mention murderous and cruel. To say they're exactly the same is a false equivalency at best and pure apologia at worst. Modern political science pretty handily shows that when you control for all other factors (GDP, population, etc) authoritarian regimes are significantly worse than their democratic counterparts, including in how corrupt they are. Here's one example: [[https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/4315-does-democracy-reduce-corruption.pdf]]

While yes corruption does occur in democratic governments, democracies have much stronger institutions and systems based on rule of law which help to limit incompetence and corruption. If a mayor is bad at his job or corrupt, he can be protested against, voted out of office, or referred to the higher authorities for prosecution. Even corrupt political machines aren't immune: in a democracy, there's always more recourse for citizens than in a dictatorship. See: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_(1946)]]

In contrast, authoritarian regimes are far more flawed because there are /no/ systems of accountability. There is no recourse for the common people when a local regime functionary is corrupt. Indeed, complaining against the local state leaders is seen as dissent and is usually punished very harshly. The result is widespread corruption, abuse by the local branches of the state police, and virtual immunity for those with access to the levels of power. Even the worst corruption in a democratic regime has something restraining it - in authoritarian regimes, /nothing/ restrains abuses.

Not to mention that authoritarian regimes involve liberal use of torture, forced disappearances, terror, murder, etc to stay in power.

In /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/, none of this is represented in Voldemort's Britain or the Monarchy in France. It's all swept under the rug, with people living as happy citizens under a benevolent authoritarian regime which has their best interests at heart and treats them well as long as they keep quiet. Meanwhile, the main democracy presented in the fic is described as having enormous flaws in every capacity. This contrasts sharply with the efficient and well-run authoritarian regimes it is opposed by and gives us a simple dichotomy - authoritarian good, democratic bad.

The point is that authoritarian regimes in the fic are given overwhelmingly positive depictions, while the democratic regime is given overwhelmingly negative depictions. This lack of nuance sends a pretty disturbing message, ignoring the worst abuses of authoritarianism while presenting it with exaggerated benefits.

I agree, but I wanted to counter something else you'd written:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Is this necessarily true? History is filled with examples of benevolent kings.

#+end_quote

There is no legal system, but often times rulers in the ancient world operated within a cultural/religious context that placed constraints on what the ruler could do. For example, the pharaoh of ancient Egypt was a king, but they were also a god and as such were expected to behave according to a series of religious mandates.

Also, just because there is no recourse doesn't mean the system can't still function better than a democracy. A dictator who holds moral (or as stated above religious) beliefs that run counter to corruption can create a system that operates better than a democracy. Or at least is widely considered a good society.

I can buy this. Authoritarian regimes tend to be more corrupt and violent, but I don't thing every authoritarian regime need be so. I can see a world where a dictator better rules a society than if it were a democracy.

Unlikely? Yes. But possible? Also yes. And Voldemort's britain in the fic is (i'm guessing)

******* Even the most benevolent and enlightened monarchs still used torture and murder to remain in power. Their regimes were still fundamentally corrupt and exploitative. Was Frederick the Great a more pleasant monarch than Ivan the Terrible? Probably. Did he still rule over a state that suppressed all forms of dissent, killed its political opponents, and kept much of the population in indentured servitude (Serfdom)? Certainly. Further, those kinds of monarchs were living in a much less developed civil society than exists today (Or in Harry Potter) where most people are politically minded and involved in many different organizations. This means that an authoritarian regime has to be much more repressive today than a monarchy in the 18th century did - there's a lot more to repress!

Basically I'm making an institutional argument that authoritarian regimes encourage the worst tendencies of the people at the top as well as their functionaries who keep the regime in power. Here are a few reasons I think why:

1. Authoritarian regimes give local officials that represent the regime significantly more power within their local communities than those in democratic regimes. The mayor of a town has significant influence over the secret police and other coercive arms of the state, as well as the mandate to repress dissent in the name of the state. But where does dissent end? Can he murder people that criticize some policies of his that were unpopular in the name of state security? Sure. Can he scrape some money off the top and not have anyone be able to object? Sure. Can he appoint his cronies under him to whatever positions he wants? Sure. Limited accountability inevitably leads to abuses.

2. All authoritarian leaders still have limited access to information. Stalin -a workaholic murderer constantly in touch with his secret police - still had to deal with endemic corruption throughout the Soviet Union. Simply put, no leader can know everything that happens in their nation. When there is limited accountability and repression of dissent, this problem increases even further. People are more than willing to lie and fake statistics to avoid dying. Authoritarian regimes are very good at keeping track of who their security services are killing and how much dissent is being repressed, but less so at rooting out corruption and inefficiency.

3. Authoritarian leaders have a limited constituency to please in order to stay in power - their inner circle, the security services, etc. They ultimately are under no obligation to meet the people's needs perfectly to stay in power - within a certain margin, obviously, starving people will still revolt. As a result, their ability to be responsive to the people's wants and needs is lacking. Is the average citizen really going to tell their dictator that his policies aren't that great when he could have them murdered, no matter how benevolent he claims to be? Of course not! Yet not doing what the people want has limited impact on whether or not the dictator is in power - he can make bad decisions and suffer no consequences. In contrast, democratic leaders are hyper-sensitive to what the electorate thinks because those are the people they rely on to stay in power. There's a very different power relationship and set of obligations.

4. An authoritarian regime /must/ commit abuses in order to stay in power. One book on the Soviet Union, /Terror by Quota/, discusses the rational calculation behind why Stalin decided to murder certain amounts of people when he did. His calculus was that in order to be able to stay in power and enact policies which he erroneously believed were for the good of the country, he needed a certain number of "traitors" and "enemies of the people" to die. That's the danger of absolute power. If you believe your policies are absolutely for the good of the people, it's perfectly acceptable to torture and kill those who get in your way. There's no limit to the number of justifiable abuses in the name of utopia.

TL:DR, authoritarian regimes are shitty by design, no matter the intentions of those on top. Sure some are better than others, but ultimately there are /significant/ downsides. /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ makes no effort to present those downsides, and just the opposite emphasizes how much better Voldemort's Britain is than its democratic enemy. This despite Voldemort not being a particularly benevolent or kind person even in a fic that whitewashes him.

******** Wait correction: by authoritarian regimes, do you mean like olden style kings and emperors? Because I don't think secret police murdering people in the night was a factor in all of them.

For context, I'm referring to someone like India's Akbar, who was heralded for listening to his subject's, increasing personal and religious freedoms, and nowadays is hailed as one of India's greatest monarchs.

I agree with (1) and (3) but note that these are just inefficiencies. They don't means that the authoritarian regime must be corrupt, just that they have a greater potential for stuff to go wrong.

I don't buy (2) or (4). For (2), many kings used to have courts and regular councils with regional leaders. Many also installed or used central beauracracies to conduct censuses. How does that limit their information more than how it would be in a democracy? Is hearing policies from 2 senators and a few representatives significantly different from speaking to the local ruler about their concerns?

I feel like you're base assumptions are that (a) the population in an authoritarian regime dislikes the state of affairs and has significant dissent or concerns and (b) the ruler is not open to said dissent and uses violence to quash it. I don't think either or those are necessary in an authoritarian nation.

I can see a nation where either through benevolence or (more likely) intense religious/cultural propoganda the people don't have an issue with the government and if they do (like "my town doesn't get enough funding") the ruler and his council is willing to hear them out.
