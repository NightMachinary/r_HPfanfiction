  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords.

** That's how my shitty crossover fanfiction ends, actually! The protagonist's regenerative powers transforms Voldemort back into an infant during the Final Battle, and Harry and Ginny adopt Tom and raise him to be good. Dumbledore acts as his godfather and spends a lot of time with him to make up for how he failed him the first go-around. Tom Potter winds up being sorted into Hufflepuff, lol

This is all in the last chapter and epilogue, btw, so I'm not linking you to it since it's not the focus of my shitty high-school story haha
