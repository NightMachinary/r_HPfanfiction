I'm really into fits that explore the Wizarding World at large, and its relationship to the muggle world. For all its flaws, thanfiction's work did a good job of this through Justin Finch-Fletchley and the fleshing-out of other DA members. (I love any good DA fic) but I'm also a huge fan of Blamebrompton's more political works than deal with interworkngs of the ministry, or Malfoy and Harry both ending up in Muggle Britain or Wizarding Australia. I'm also a huge Copperbadge fan, and he did that in later Laocoon's Children works.

Basically just anything that expands on canon culturally. No era limitations, though I have soft spots for Wolfstar, Wotcher Wolvie (R/T), Fire & Ice (D/G) Orange Crush (H/G), Guns 'n Handcuffs (Drarry) and any non Golden Trio/MWPP secondary characters (especially Ravenclaws!)

And I got my start on Fictionalley, so it's nice to find somewhere that at least references old ship names whether or not people still use them.

Two focuses are magic in the USA and Werewolves so far.

One of the major world building considerations in this story's world that haven't appeared explicated yet deal with the establishment of the Statute of Secrecy in the non-European parts of the world, especially places like Sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia, and the effects of Grindelwald's war and his intention to destroy the Statute as part of his place wizards on top plan.

  A series of one-shots in the Animagus-Verse showing the state of the magical world at the time of Voldemort's return. Some brace for war, while for others, life goes on. A bridge between The Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War.
