Basically what it says. There is a distinct lack of harry being trained by / raised by or simply just is Levi.


** Hagrid was sobbing at the scene in front of him.

"TITAN!" Harry screamed. The headless body of Grawp lied on floor, his head decapitated by Harry.

"Having him live with that Levi guy may have been a mistake. Harry might wipe out the giant population at this rate."

** So do the Titans exist in the HP universe ? Because retreading Attack on Titan with an OC named Harry Potter sounds mind numbing

****** I know but I'd read it if the protagonist wasn't Harry,Hermione,Luna or Daphne. Sick of all of them. Let Cho shine for once

******* Sally-Anne Perks!

I mean, since magic doesn't use mana in canon, it'd be pretty funny to have Harry firing reparos at the wall.

Or the killing curse at titans.

***** I didn't mean having harry in the AoT universe fighting titans. I meant for him to be trained by Levi then using the skills to kill death eaters
