I love George and Angelina, so if anyone has some recommendations, please tell me! I loved [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275244/1/Correct-Predictions][Correct Predictions]]. Any length, rating, time, subject is fine.


** I adore [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309456][With All Things]]. It alternates between George post-war and Angelina's 7th year, and it's not overtly romantic, which may or may not be to your taste, but definitely heartwarming and sweet. I love the George chapters, especially the prominence of the Weasley family.
