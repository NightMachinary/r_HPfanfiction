So i kept reading different variations of where Harry was raised instead by other people but is there one where he was raised by his parents?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/111713][Everyone Lives AU]]

If I remember correctly, everyone lives (literally). Harry is raised by his parents, Remus and Sirius are around (I don't recall what happened to Peter). It's well-written, but I have to warn you it's mostly canon rehash with a few changes (at least until OotP, I stopped reading in the middle of 5th book).

**** I loved it too, but around OotP it became too much like the books. The characters are great, the story is well-written, but I expected changes, and instead, almost everything went the same way it did in the canon. Too bad. There are so many stories where Harry is raised by goblins, McGonagall, Malfoys, Sirius, Remus and Merlin knows who else, but so few where James and Lily survive and aren't neglectful dicks.
