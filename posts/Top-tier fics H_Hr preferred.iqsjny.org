Basically just the title. To be honest, I don't mind if it isn't Harry/Hermione although they are my favorite pairing to read about. The dynamic is always really fun and interesting. I often hated that Hr and Ron ended up together in canon, as it didn't make much sense to me. However, I reasoned that JK wanted everyone to become physically connected to the Weasley's and have that be the closure everyone needed. Anyway, I started reading some fics that weren't the most well-written and I thought the justification for H/Hr didn't sit right with the way canon sets up the characters. I'm not sure, but it wasn't satisfying. Maybe they had too much Weasley bashing, but I'm not sure. Any recommendations for someone new to the fanfic world? :)
