When I say similar, I mean in the thought of Harry getting power within the school like how Harry did in Junior Inquisitor, and completely fucks over Dumbledore. Preferably bashing, as I am not a big fan of Ron and Hermione in fanfiction, but bashing isnt required.

70k+ words, thank you!


** Calculation by fringeperson has Harry become Headmaster of Hogwarts instead of being sorted into a house. He ends up fixing Hogwarts into a respectable establishment.
