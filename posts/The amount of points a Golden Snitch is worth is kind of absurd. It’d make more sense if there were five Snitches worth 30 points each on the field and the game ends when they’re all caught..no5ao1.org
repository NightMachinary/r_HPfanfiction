I don't know. I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for this but there being only one Snitch that's worth 150 points that ALSO ends the game feels like it's meant to just build Harry up or something. Now, if there was five Snitches and each was worth 30 points... for one, that would make Harry seem much more impressive if he managed to catch all of them but it'd also make the other players seem a bit more valuable.

EDIT: I'm going to change how Quidditch is played but I'm also going change it so Hogwarts plays other schools as well so it's a little more interesting and there's more games each year. How would I go about making the schedules for this?

*** Yeah exactly, I think it actually plays into American Football quite well.

Catching the snitch is like the entire essence of the sport. Having a world class seeker is similar to having a world class QB in football in the sense of winning the game.

Obviously you still need a stout defense and team overall to keep you in it, and sometimes a star isn't enough (Krum in the tournament) but I think the value of the snitch is fair. Whoever has the best seeker/QB will win unless the opposing team is so strong overall that they can overcome it.

**** Agreed.

This also ties in the fact that Quidditch is both a very dynamic game, and one where points are racked up very quickly, and one where attrition is somewhat lessened. After all, while riding on a broom does require effort, it's significantly less than getting comparative performance while running.

In football(soccer), there are many "opportunities" for scoring, but with one goal and lower speeds of each individual player making focus/perception much less significant in assembling a defense, even if there are upwards of thirty "opportunities" in a game, scores above 3 for either team are rare. Let me reiterate: even 10% scoring rate is a gosh-darn miracle.

In Quidditch, however, players move at much higher speeds and in 3D space. This means that neither defence in depth nor "covering" other players works very well. Indeed, any form of defence is difficult and mostly reliant on the beaters.

This means the game is meant to rack up a ridiculous number of points, simply because you can't always rely on an accurate bludger or your chasers being in position to do an intercept.

There being three goals for each side means the defence is further weakened: due to distance between the goals, the speeds at which the game is played... If the keeper makes a wrong prediction, they will not be able to correct their course, even as a football(soccer) keeper can maintain a position in the center of their singular goal and commit a bit later, having a good idea of the trajectory when they do.

​

All that means that unless the Seeker on either team is an absolute monster, the main purpose of the Snitch is to end the game, not to get points. The value of 150 seems quite fair to me, all told.

** The thing about Quiditch, is that (apart from the world cup) winning the game doesn't matter. The team that wins the league is the team that scores the most actual points over the course of the season. Therefore a teaming 150 - 0 every game can only get so many points. A team that loses every game 900 - 890 would finish above them and depending on other results could win the league. This helps to remove the massive advantage catching the snitch provides.

** While it is a bit silly, yes, you have to consider that the Quidditch leagues are decided on points, and not victories. It's only the World Cup that goes by elimination.

At school level, the 150 points for a catch really stands out across their tiny tournament, yes. But I guess things get really interesting over the course of a lengthy professional season, where the whole team needs to step up.

Let's suppose that the Quidditch league has, say, 30+ matchdays (or 30+ games for each team). Even if you focus on catching the Snitch and trying to win quick, you'd better have great Chasers or else you won't be getting that high of a score per game, even if you win. The Beaters also have their role to play in stopping any of their opponent players from doing their jobs properly, while the Keeper plays a noticeable role in limiting the opponent Chasers during each match.

Basically, while the Quidditch scoring-system is unbalanced, I don't think it's all that bad at the professional level.

** My headcanon is that when the rules were designed, they actually make sense. We see a clear sense of broom progression over time even in the series itself, it's not hard to believe that brooms were far slower back in the day. We know Quidditch games in the past could last for /days/, what if the reason for this was because the Snitch was just so much faster than people were on the brooms? In such a context, a 150 score bonus makes perfect sense since it'd only be a fraction of what the Chasers had accomplished.

** I would agree; initially it seemed to me that 150 points and ending the game was absurd just for the snitch. It even struck me that all you really needed to do was put up a good defence until the snitch was caught. But then in the quidditch World Cup, even catching the snitch didn't mean a win for Krum. So I think at the pro level, even 150 points doesn't decide the game.

** My "fix" for Quidditch starts with giving the game a time limit. I mean, seriously, if I save and penny pinched all year so I could afford tickets to the Qudditch world cup, only for one team's seeker to catch the snitch 30 seconds into the game, I'd be demanding my money back.

So I would have the game broken into four segments. (In American football they are called quarters, so I'll use that for ease of terminology). Each quarter, they release one snitch (which a team gets far less points for if caught, btw). If the snitch from one quarter isn't caught by the end of that quarter, it remains in play and next quarter there are two, three or even four snitches in play.

** My Quidditch fix is to give the game 3 periods 15 - 60 minutes each.

At the 15 minute mark, the snitch is released and if caught in the next 30 minutes, it gives 50 points and the period ends.

In the third period, point value is increased by 25 points for each previous period it wasn't caught. So it has the possibility of being worth 50, 75, or 100 points in the last period.

Additionally, snitch nip, or a non seeker catching the snitch is legal, the team that does it just loses the value of the snitch for doing it and the period ends.

Also, the seeker can handle the quaffle, they just can't score on the goals. So it creates interesting strategies with power plays.

It has the seeker become another chaser, and then when an individual chaser scores five goals, they become eligible to go after the snitch. The other team can take advantage of being a chaser up or send someone to interfere with the seeker. Once the snitch is caught, it is released again and the seeker returns to chasing. Every goal after that they can go after the snitch again. The reward for the snitch starts at fifty points, then goes up fifty for the same player catching it. This means that there is a lot of strategy for which of your chasers you set up to score/which of your opponents you focus on screening out.

*** But a game that seems like it revolves around that? The main focus is the Seeker. In rare circumstances, the teams don't need the Seeker to catch the Snitch to win the game but that has been implied that it's RARE. Creating a game and making one of the roles be nearly 100% guaranteed to win the team the game then give it to the main character when they've had no practice whatsoever and claim it's just because they're a complete natural? That's just poor world-building. I can understand it if he had natural instinct on a broom and good reflexes but that shouldn't have gotten Harry the streak he had from the very beginning. It's really unrealistic and the games themselves seem like a waste since the main way to win isn't even what most people can or will watch since watching them is kind of boring. He
