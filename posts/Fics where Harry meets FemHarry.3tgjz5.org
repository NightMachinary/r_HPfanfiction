from another universe or dimension or whatever.

I really like 0800-Rent-A-Hero linkffn(11160991) and I'm Still Here linkffn(9704180) and I just wondered if there were any more like them out there.

Actually I don't care if Harry meets a boy version of himself either, I'd just like them to be kinda close in age (no Harry raises Harry) and for it to be at least a semi-serious fic, not a total crackfic.

  Sarah Potter is the Girl-Who-Lived. Her life would never be normal, so a dimension travelling ex-Dark Lord version of herself wanting to help in her quest to stay alive? Par for the course, really.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

******* Right. His brain is otherwise engaged...both of them. I'm guessing we're lucky if even the word "boobies" is able to be processed. My first chance to feel a girl in various ways? I was not thinking about her breast mass. If there was an actual thought train other than OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG it was probably "touch more touch more touch more woooooooo hoooooooo."

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
