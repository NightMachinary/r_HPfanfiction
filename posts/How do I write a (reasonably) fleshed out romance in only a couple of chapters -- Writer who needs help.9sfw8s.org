The prologue of my fanfic will focus on the romance between Adrian Greengrass and A'Te-Ori -- parents of the main character, Daphne Greengrass or D'Aph-Ne.

The main issue is that I don't want the story to be bogged down by it, yet I want to develop the relationship so that the love between the two is believable. At most, I want to devote two chapters to it. How do I go about writing a believable, if not also heartbreaking romance in the span of a few chapters?

Context, if this helps: A'Te-Ori is a (relatively, I.e. 500+) young woman, from a hyper-advanced alien world. Her physical abilities -- strengh, speed, flight etc. -- rival that of Kryptonians, though they are not solar-dependent and are invulnerable to most magics.

After a brief 'scuffle' with some intergalactic warmongers, she crashes down to Earth in her ship, where she is found by Adrian Greengrass. Due to the crash and previously inflicted injuries, Adrian offers his manor for A'Te-Ori to recover and repair her ship. Over the next several months, if not a few years, they fall in love and conceive a child.

However, in the end, A'Te-Ori has little choice (for the safety of her husband and daughter) to leave Earth.


** If you need to write the romance for some reason instead of just saying it happened in the prequel, might I suggest a "moments" kind of thing? Like in Beauty and the Beast - the movie doesn't show all of their interactions, just strategic key moments.

** Heart-breaking or heart-warming are two different things entirely. You should be clear how exactly you want your readers to perceive their relationship and go from there. Generally speaking, if you don't want your story slowed down by showcasing a romance between two secondary characters, it's completely okay to just show the one defining moment that made it all possible, that got it all started. You can just slip in a few lines every now and then after that without bloating the plot while maintaining stringency.

If you want a heart-breaking romance, you should probably aim for two important scenes. One to establish their relationship and the second one to introduce the tragic element. You needn't have them in the same chapter either. You could make the first scene bittersweet, leaving the reader to guess why the characters feel so torn about it -- only to later reveal that the mother left or something.

Just keep in mind that you mustn't overdo it. Secondary/background characters hijacking whole chapters is a sure way to derail your story.

** One of my pet hates is when a FF writer uses too many words. You can say an awful lot with a few words.

Use a readers imagination more than describing ever minute detail.

Think if JK what has she really said about what Hermione looks like? Teeth hair and eyes. And yet we all have a very clear image inside our heads about what she looks like (even without Emma)

It's like with drawing. Draw what isn't there.
