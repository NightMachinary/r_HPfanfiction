I just feel like I've read everything good. If somebody wants to prove me wrong, I'll be very happy.


** I couldn't find anything I really enjoyed for awhile. Then I found linkffn(Grow Young With Me). Now I've got another fic I'm craving updates for.

Also read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Three Rules) recently. I found it to be well characterized with some great humor. The Twins were done very well, humorous, but not obnoxious.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
