Unfortunately I don't remember the title, but I do remember a fair bit of the story itself

- It was set in the year after the Battle of Hogwarts
- Kingsley was named Minister, but was extremely cautious with using his powers responsibly, and was thus ineffective
- Members of the Ministry begin listing people by House, regardless of the role they played in the War
- Harry briefly leaves the Ministry when people begin going too far in reparations
- Harry in desperation for help returns to Hogwarts
- While trying to get into Ravenclaw Tower, the knocker asks him what truth is. Harry shouts that he doesn't know, and the knocker compliments him on his honesty


** I think this is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249/chapters/391280][War is Over]] by Pitry. (Also, it's not listed as being part of a series, but it has a loose sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727][Inter Arma...]], set 20 years later.)

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.
