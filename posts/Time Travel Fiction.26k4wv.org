I'm fairly new to fanfictions in general, and I'm looking for advice from people far well read in the area than I.

I have been enjoying fanfictions over the past couple of days that involved Time Travel, however as I am oh so eagerly waiting for the new chapter to be uploaded I find myself desiring more from the similar area.

I have read over the past couple of days: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8076284/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Bonds-Of-Time]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8531904/1/Bonds-of-Time-II-Fighting-Fate]]

Any suggestions in the area are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading.

There are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue][more]], but the rest I've found to be unreadable, for some reason or other.

/Wastelands of Time/ can be considered a good one, but it didn't feel like a HP related story to me.

*** Nightmare of Future Past is not abandoned. Writer is still active in his forum, so unless he stated it's abandoned, it's not.

To Shape and Changed is heavy AU

Temporal Beacon's author is inactive, so abandonment is a possibility

Stages of Hope is more AU travel than time travel

  Nightmare of Future Past is not abandoned.

It hasn't been updated in 1.5+ years, what difference does it make whether the author is active somewhere or not? It would be nice to learn that an update had been posted, but until that happens, I'd rather not keep my hopes up and get constantly disappointed, so I just consider such stories to be abandoned. It may not be a technically correct status to assign, but practically it makes sense to use, at least to me.

  /To Shape and Change/ is [..] AU

  /Stages of Hope/ is [..] AU
#+end_quote

True. I've updated my previous comment to mention this.

** Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]]. Also, avoid In This World and the Next if you value your sanity.

Oh, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] is a classic.

*** Thank you for your suggestion. Backwards with Purpose seems to have exactly the premise I'm looking for.

Again, Thank you for responding :)

***** Wastelands of Time was amazing. Backward time-travel fics and it have almost no relation to each other. It's an epic set above the HP universe. I wish most was resolved in the first novel though. The epicness level was god level at the end, if he decided to somewhat finish it there it would've been loads more satisfying vs leaving it undone.

** One of my personal favorites here, HHr: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783428/1/The-End-and-the-Beginning][The End and the Beginning]]

Pretty dark, a fun take on time travel in the war.
