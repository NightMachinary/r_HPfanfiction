** Aurette's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454955/1/Worth-the-Wait][Worth the Wait]] is pretty funny and features a very drunk Snape and Granger. Rated M for language only.

** I really like Just Another Random Tuesday. I read it while tipsy and laughed my ass off.

I just finished a HP/Calvin and Hobbes crossover that was also fantastic!

** ...I highly recommend reading My Immortal drunk and out loud with at least one other person, taking turns, and pronouncing things as they are spelled.
