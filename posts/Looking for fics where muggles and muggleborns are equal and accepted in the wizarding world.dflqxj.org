I recently read A Different Halloween by RobSt and I loved the world where the muggleborns (and sometimes muggles) were accepted into the wizarding community. Are there any fics like it, preferably on fanfiction.net?

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

After a long 1996 year of difficult relations, wars, several catastrophic events killing thousands, and one almost-WW3, muggles and wizards finally reach a state of acceptance, and by the final chapter a near utopian state is reached.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
