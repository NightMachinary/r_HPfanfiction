It's just if Harry ever became gay I could never see him having a relationship with Draco, and definetly not with Snape. I personally see him maybe with Ron or Neville, but with an 'ex' death eater with a hard on for Lily, and an almost legendary hatred for all things James, which Harry gets his looks from, and a boy/guy he spent the last six years hating, and with them having opposite view points early on, It's just something that is doomed to fail in almost every circumstance.

Well that's my views looking forward to a discussion on the subject.


** To quote myself from a different thread on why Darry would never work:

#+begin_quote
  I am not blaming all Death Eater crimes on Draco but let's look at just one of his childhood crimes.

  He used an unforgivable curse on Katie while giving her a booby trapped necklace to kill Dumbledore. The imperius alone gives him a lifetime stay in Azkaban Resort. We also have attempted murder here, as well as high treason, something punishable by hanging in 1996. And let's not forget that he breaks the Geneva convention multiple times by not being a clearly recognizable combatant, hiding behind civilians and using them to wage war.

  Childhood crimes are stealing a bottle of vodka or getting caught with a gram of weed, not being a terrorist and high treason against the crown. I am not saying that gay pairings are wrong, I am saying that pairings between Harry and most guys make absolutely no sense because most of the male characters we see him shipped with (Draco, Snape, Lucius, Tom Riddle/Voldemort, the Lestranges...) would face at least lifetime in prison for their WAR CRIMES if not outright execution. They are not hot guys who made mistakes, they are murdering, raping scum that broke dozens of laws and supported a genocide because of their sense of racial superiority.

Because Severus was more under house-arrest than anything else. Dumbledore needed to watch him, because he is one of the only people to know that the Prophecy exists. Next, we have the fact that he's prone to the dark side, especially after losing the love of his life.

To say she was 'sucked in' greatly reduces her agency - I would even hesitate to say Draco was 'sucked in', and he actually has age and mitigating circumstances as a legitimate excuse. Unlike Draco, we never see any signs of her having morals, nor does she show any potential for redemption.

Draco would get multiple lifetimes just for his attack on Katie.

Yes, because as we know, in reality, racism is super easy to get rid of.

#+begin_quote
  He was head of the ICW
#+end_quote

So what? He represented England's wizarding UN. How many people do you think even know the name of the representatives of their nation at the UN? Why do you think this position would help him battle racism and conglomerates with such an efficiency as to eradicate them?

#+begin_quote
  the Wizengamot
#+end_quote

He was the moderator for Wizarding Parliament. So what? Other than his considerable influence, he was no more politically powerful than someone like, say, Lucius Malfoy. Lucius and Voldemort's other lackeys got off because them bribed people to let them go. How do you suppose Dumbledore could have prevented that? The followers of Voldemort who didn't have any influence were sentenced to Azkaban, and we have a fucking flashback via Pensieve that shows Dumbledore's seriousness at putting them behind bars.

#+begin_quote
  held several other positions of power
#+end_quote

You mean /one/ additional position of power. The Headmaster of Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. I know it sounds more impressive to say "several other positions of power", but let's be straightforward here.

#+begin_quote
  did nothing while several of Voldemort's elite bribed his institutions
#+end_quote

o.0 How do you suppose Dumbledore stops this?

We've /seen/ how little influence Dumbledore wielded against the corrupt Ministry for Magic. He had no power of influence over Fudge, when it came to people who were paying him money. Sure, Fudge came to Dumbledore for support, but mention anything ill about the guys lining his pockets? Get fukt, son. And that's exactly what we see happen later in the books. Hell, as early as /Prisoner of Azkaban/, we see how little Dumbledore's influence helps him convince Fudge of the correct course of events.

The people who think Dumbledore was this all-powerful political entity are cherry-picking their evidence enough to make a wonderful branch of wines.

#+begin_quote
  And Snape's intel was basically useless.
#+end_quote

Says fucking /who/? Snape single handedly saved Harry Potter on three separate occasions, including a bunch of teenagers in /Order of the Phoenix/, and then went on to help Harry Potter save the entire fucking wizarding world in the last books. All of which, need I remind you, by the extremely cunning plan created by Dumbledore which would allow Harry Potter to not only defeat Voldemort, but to /survive death a second time/.

#+begin_quote
  And his spy job does not explain his absolutely shitty treatment of the students
#+end_quote

Being an asshole doesn't make you any less of a /war hero/. When did that become a requirement? I'm not trying to save Snape's character here, but to tarnish his deeds and actions during the war because he was a right royal prick is silly.

#+begin_quote
  why he caused a shortage of people with a Potion NEWT due to his high demands.
#+end_quote

We never see any evidence that this /actually/ happens. Ever. This is a fanfiction trope. You can argue semantics all you want, but I'm going to stick with book-related facts.

#+begin_quote
  If he's supposed to be reformed then why does he favour Voldemort's house so much?
#+end_quote

"Voldemort's House". What in tarnation... You know you're talking about hundreds of children who were never involved in the war, right? Should we call Gryffindor "Pettigrew's House"?

#+begin_quote

That must be a really short list. Snape alone did more to end the war than possibly anybody else in the entire fucking series except the Golden Trio. And to say that /Dumbledore/ didn't do /the most/ work is just pure insanity.

************* I know this isn't my thread, and I don't wish to ruffle feathers too much. However I do have one thing to contest.

#+begin_quote
  "..the extremely cunning plan created by Dumbledore which would allow Harry Potter to not only defeat Voldemort, but to survive death a second time."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore did not plan for Harry to live. In fact, it is indicated in the text that the reason he insisted on Hermione and Ron knowing about Horcruxes was so that when Voldemort killed Harry, someone would be around to finish it. The fact that Harry lived was not Dumbledore's doing. And it sure as fuck wasn't Snape's. Harry lived due to a magical fluke, and a shot in the absolute dark.

Dumbledore definitely thought there was a chance that Harry could live a killing curse from Voldemort, that is clear. However he knew that it was such a long shot, and that it probably wouldn't happen that he banked on it not happening. It's why he told Snape that Harry had to die, its why he insisted on Ron and Hermione knowing about horcruxes, and why he gave Harry the resurrection stone. He knew that in the end, Harry would die. And Dumbledore accepted that.

In history, those who make the toughest decisions are often those who are either worshiped or vilified. They are the ones that make impossible choices, and depending on which side you look at them on, they are either standing tall despite the weight upon them, or they are cast in the shadow of the weight above their heads. The same is obviously true with fanfiction.

************** Hey! Thanks for taking the time to respond in a friendly way. :)

In response, however, I have to disagree.

Maybe Dumbledore accepted the fact that Harry dying was a possibility, he absolutely /did not believe Harry would die/. The situation was setup by Dumbledore so that Harry would /think/ he had to die. Certainly, Dumbledore wanted other people to be aware of the Horcruxes so that if the unlikely event of Harry's true death happened, there would be other people who could take up the mantel. However, the idea that it would be /Ron and Hermione/ and not someone like, say, /Snape/, if that was his only intention, is silly.

Snape was the obvious candidate for continuing the job after Harry died, should Harry stay dead. So why, then, would Dumbledore only tell Snape that Harry had to die?

A few points to back my theory up:

- In the /Goblet of Fire/, when Harry describes the ritual that Voldemort underwent to come back to life, and informs Dumbledore used Harry's blood, Dumbledore gets /excited/. Overwhelmingly excited. Harry remarks that he was confused at how Dumbledore, at the description, could look so triumphant.

  - It was at this point that Dumbledore knew Harry would live.
  - Why else would he be triumphant? If all Harry had to do to kill Voldemort was destroy the Horcruxes and then have someone else finish the job, why be so /exultant/ at yet another connection between Voldemort and Harry?

- Dumbledore very specifically informs Snape that Voldemort must be the one to kill Harry. Specifically. Forcefully. He says he cannot express how /imperative/ it is that Voldemort be the one to deliver the killing blow. Why?

  - We know that you don't have to be Harry/Voldemort to destroy a Horcrux. Dumbledore destroys the ring, Ron destroys the locket and Hermione Hufflepuff's cup. Neville kills Nagina (a living Horcrux, like Harry).
  - Keeping that in mind, why must Voldemort /specifically/ be the one to kill Harry? Why is it so /imperative/ - so /required/ - that Voldemort deliver the final blow?

Sure, it's a convoluted plan. But as Dumbledore says, this is a hitherto unexplored field which Voldemort has thrust himself (And Harry) into. To the best of his ability, Dumbledore tried to ensure that Harry Potter would survive the war. If Dumbledore didn't care so much about Harry's survival, there would have been many better ways to assist Harry in his quest. However, knowing he was a Horcrux, Dumbledore did what he did best. He saved Harry's life.

Now, we can argue the morality of sacrificing the lives of other's to save Harry's all you want, but the fact of the matter is, it wasn't a /guess/. Dumbledore knew what he was doing when he orchestrated those events.

I'd like to think there's an argument to be made in that Harry's life was worth more than those that were lost, even after the war, as a symbol for the light.

EDIT: TL;DR: You and I agree Dumbledore did things on purpose in the chance that Harry would live. My argument is that his plan was obviously thought out over the course of, at /minimum/ 3 years. For someone like Dumbledore to risk /so much/ on a /tiny chance/ when there were /better ways/ to get the job done (in which Harry /would not/ have survived), is something I can't believe. He thought it /very likely/ that Harry would live.

** We have some great disections here on characterizations of Harry and Draco and a few of Snape too. So I won't get into those.

For me, Harry isn't gay. In fact, the more I read Harry Potter works, the more I have the connection that Harry is asexual. I honestly don't think that after his emotional shunting at the hands of the dursley's he would crave, or enjoy, a relationship with romantic components.

However that being said, I find it really really sad that /the/ piece of contemporary fiction of the last twenty years never had an openly gay member of the world. And the excuse that Harry wouldn't care is a lie. He would, as Ron and Hermione would care and hear about it, thus he would as well.

From a character's point of view, and if I force myself to accept the in-world continuity that Harry Potter is gay, I could see him with Draco, Ron, Neville, and even Tom Riddle.

Draco and Tom both have the same reasoning. In many ways, Draco and Harry are opposites yet are errily similar. Draco is great on a broom, so is Harry. Draco excels in DADA, so does Harry. In fact, as I think of it, Draco is so much like Harry that its scary. The only difference being how they were raised.

Tom on the other hand... All it would take is a single moment where the blood protection wasn't up to par, and Harry could have been overwhelmed by the horcrux in his scar. And if that isn't a thing, do you not see Tom fucking Riddle not making someone fall in love with him, and using it so that that person never ever crossed him? Not every relationship needs to be healthy to make a good fanfiction story.

Snape, honestly I don't see for two reasons. In canon he is described as greasy and unappealing with an attitude to match. Harry, in my mind, would /never/ go near that sort of thing with his upbringing. The second reason is much more... on snape's end. Snape is a death eater. He may have turned spy, he may have changed his ways, he may have been a hero in the end... but some part of him believed that every muggleborn witch and wizard had to die. Some part of him believed that he was superior to others. If Death Eaters are modeled after Nazis then it is fair to say that they will never accept an openly gay member of the inner circle. And you don't hide such things from Voldemort easily... someone would find out.

** Since I just had an argument about this in another post, I'm a little reluctant to get involved in this again. But Draco is my favorite character because of his complexity. And I've read tons of Drarry where if you can suspend some disbelief for a while, the authors make it work. Let me see if I can break it down.

1. I did do research on the last post and found that 9 out of the top 10 Harry Potter stories (of all ratings) in AO3 are Drarry. It took until #79 to get a probable het pairing and #150 to get an actual het pairing. And the vast majority, by a lot, of the slash fics are Drarry. The top ones have roughly 9,000 Kudos. It's an incredibly popular pairing. And if all of them were built on a completely untenable premise, people wouldn't read them. So popular opinion is that Drarry has the ability to work.

2. Canon Draco is clearly obsessed with Harry. You can consider it hatred, or a quest for power, or jealousy at Harry's status, or racism, or a lot of things. But he has very strong feelings for Harry. I wouldn't be at all surprised if canon Draco was gay and that was the basis of his unnatural obsession and schoolyard bullying. He is a downright asshole to Harry. But Harry was also an asshole right back.

3. JK believed that Draco was redeemable. This is without doubt if you look at how she wrote him. He is in an inescapable situation in HBP. I know that my (civil) debate partner above says that he should have gone to Dumbledore or escaped with his mother, but I can't see how this is possible. He was living with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, who would clearly have considered him a flight risk and would have threatened him and his mom with unspeakable horrors if he moved against them. When he was at school, his mom was with them. When he was at the Manor for holidays, he wouldn't have been given any freedom. You can see how scared even Lucius is at the end. This is partly because we have to consider why Voldemort gave this task to a 16-year-old in the first place: it was a threat, vengeance, and a message aimed at Lucius. Voldemort was smart, even if batshit crazy. He never would have thought that Draco would successfully kill the greatest living wizard. No- he was punishing Lucius for losing the prophecy and getting Death Eaters imprisoned. He genuinely believed that this was a punishment- Draco would surely get himself killed. And before then, Lucius and Narcissa would never think to turn on him- Draco was effectively Voldemort'a hostage for that year. It would have been far smarter to have Draco fix the cabinet, let the Death Eaters in, and have one of them kill Dumbledore. It makes no strategic sense for Voldy to entrust it to Draco unless he's sending a message to his lieutenant.

I believe that Draco was on board with everything until he had to live with pure evil in his house. Imagine having to pee and encountering MacNair or one of his uncles? Or Bellatrix? Or Voldemort? Imagine the threats of harm, murder, and let's face it- rape. JK doesn't include rape, but let's not kid ourselves- it is the ultimate form of control and the Death Eaters are the ultimate evil. This would have been true in reality.

It's clear, so clear, in canon that Draco doesn't want to do the task he's been charged with and is trying to come up with a hands-off way of doing it. He believes there's no way out. Maybe there was. But not in his mind. He's definitely flattered- you can tell. He wants power but he's not brave like a Gryffindor. But the reality is nothing like he imagined. He's a scared 16-year-old who has no ability to do what he's been asked to do. And then he gets the opportunity and can't do it. And Dumbledore knows exactly what Draco was trying to do. He tells Snape about it. He isn't a killer. He doesn't have it in him, and that means that Voldemort will kill his mom (as far as he knows) and he still can't do it. He believes he's signing his own death warrant when he drops his wand.

Then, when given the perfect opportunity to hand over Harry to Voldemort at Easter seventh year, he doesn't do it. And it's not because he's not sure. Ron and Hermione are right there. He knows this is Harry and he doesn't turn him over. It would have been a piece of cake and taken a literal second to do it. And he doesn't. This alone is proof that being a Death Eater in reality is nothing like he imagined. But he's trapped. And his mom is trapped. And Lucius is drunk and useless. And he loves his parents. That doesn't make him evil. His character took a huge turn towards the light in the last book. And the Malfoys walk away at the Final Battle. But not before Narcissa looks the most gifted Legilimens in the world square in the eyes and lies to him and gives Harry the chance to kill Voldemort. She could have asked Harry if Draco was alive and still handed him over. And she didn't. She WANTS Harry to win because her family is more important than the madman her idiot husband signed them up to follow.

And then there's the epilogue and Cursed Child. There's no glaring at the platform between Harry and Draco. And Draco is still nicely dressed, not a pariah, and clearly still retains at least some of the family fortune. If JK believed that Draco deserved punishment for his crimes sixth year he either would have been in Azkaban or been stripped of the fortune for reparations. It's clear that this hasn't happened. Even if he did go to Azkaban, it wasn't for as long as any other Death Eater would have been. He even sends his kid on purpose to Hogwarts when he would have other options.

Cursed Child. Which, in the essence of full disclosure, I couldn't stand. However, JK approved it and says it's canon, so the Draco within is how she sees him- still rich, at least moderately powerful, not carrying wounds from years of imprisonment. And even though Harry and Draco initially have a magic brawl, by the end, it's clear that they know they can work together and have definitely come to a reconciliation.

So, as you can see, JK believes he's redeemable and not as guilty as the adult Death Eaters. He was essentially a child soldier. And we don't punish actual child soldiers in the real world. You can dislike Draco and think he's a little shit, but JK very clearly wrote him as a scared kid who doesn't see a way out. And she wrote him as not deserving of punishment.

It also should be noted that it makes a huge amount of sense that Harry would have testified on Draco and Narcissa's behalf if there were trials. He most likely would have felt some need to repay a debt to Narcissa for saving his life.

1. A lot of good Draco stories actually turn Draco before he's a Death Eater. I think these are easier to see how they might work well together before actual crimes are committed. Some of these fics channel their obsessions with one another into a pretty raw relationship, and others change things from the get-go with Harry sorted into Slytherin and/or he and Draco becoming friends early on. This usually helps change Draco's disdain into respect. Those kinds of stories are great because a lot of the really bad blood never even happens.

*** 1. There are plenty of Drarry fics that are angsty and full of years of work on both of their parts in order to channel what is initially a physical attraction into a working relationship. They learn about each other. They've both grown past childhood prejudices and they've both grown up- Harry is less impetuous and black and white about what makes someone a good person. And Draco's seen some shit. In really good fics he's spent time in Azkaban or been stripped of his wand or sent to live in the Muggle world or stripped of his fortune and/or dignity. Enter Harry and his "saving people thing" and you've got some good speculative storytelling. Or you've got a situation where their obsession with one another is changed over time.

2. I think their personalities work together. I really do. I love prickly, high-maintenance Draco and passionate, foolish Harry. I think of literally anyone in canon, Draco is most likely to keep Harry grounded and wouldn't play into the Savior thing. I think Harry would want to have a relationship where he was JUST Harry. Let's face it: Ginny was always a Harry fangirl. More in the movies, yes, but in the books some as well. There are some great fics where you can read the dynamic between them and it works. It just works.

3. There is a huge suspension of disbelief in fan fiction in general. It's necessary. I mean, even in Cursed Child you have to pretend that you don't know how Time Turners have ALWAYS worked. But fanfic literally raises characters from the dead, changes major events, sends people back in time, makes Harry become Death itself and so much more. And we roll with it. Because that's what fanfic is. And that's why I love it. Sometimes characters aren't quite right and yet sometimes it works. But I love the "what if?" factor of fanfic. What would have happened if Harry was never entered into the Triwizard Tournament? What if Minerva listened to the kids and the whole end of Sorcerer's Stone hadn't happened? What if Draco sought asylum during HBP? It's so great to read those situations. We know how it's SUPPOSED to go and fanfic gives us the chance to explore alternate plots and situations.

4. As a Drarry fan, it's not about Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton to me. It's about Harry and Draco and watching characters grow and change and admit past mistakes. It's about the challenge and the angst and conflict. It's never easy with them. And that makes for compelling stories. I would have no desire to read about Harry and Ginny. It doesn't have any appeal because it doesn't have any conflict.

5. As for Snarry, I admit that I was pretty grossed out about it when I first learned of its existence. But I've actually enjoyed some of the stories I've read. But I tend to really like stories where their relationship begins once Harry is an adult. I especially like stories where Harry is devastated by Snape's death because he finally sees the truth about everything and realizes that Snape was always protecting him. And add in his pretty obvious crush on the Half Blood Prince. The stories where Harry discovers that Snape faked his death and tried to disappear are a particular favorite of mine. Yes, I know Snape's not gay. But if we can read evil!Dumbledore stories or stories where Harry redeems Tom Riddle, we can put that past us. All I'm saying is that they aren't all underage stories and some of them actually work up a good chain of events that end with a fairly believable romance.

6. I know I've thrown a lot at you. And if you made it this far, I will say that the only way to truly "get" it is to read some and see what you think. There are really good fanfic authors out there and they make it work. Not all Drarry is cut from the same cloth. You've got to just experience it and see if it works for you. And they are all so different in theme and background and events leading to their relationship. I fully admit that I like smut. So I know that some of the things I would point you to are pretty smutty. But not all. And some of the really smutty ones also have amazing plots and excellent world building. I'm going to try to find some good examples. But if you're not sure why so many readers think it works, my advice is to read some. And don't give up right away. The first Snarry I ever read was terrible. But there ARE good ones that actually can make sense.

I think it's unfair to say that Drarry fics are popular only because of teenage girls with crushes on Dan or Tom. Some of them are GOOD stories. And I'm 39 years old.

Congratulations! This took me 90 minutes to write, but if you're seeing this, you read it!

**** So, I don't know how to link to fanfiction.net, which is where I started, but I greatly prefer Archive of our Own and read there exclusively these days.

For those that can handle smut and a hell of a lot of it, femmequixotic's series called Tales from the Special Branch is an incredible work of fiction. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise are all Aurors and are assigned to work under Harry on a case that has to do with Antonin Dolohov because of their knowledge of Death Eaters. They have been facing huge amounts of discrimination on the force and are working hard to redeem themselves. It's a fascinating police procedural with fabulous original characters, completely out of the blue plot twists, full acknowledgement of how evil Lucius is (and how Draco still loves him and kind of hates that he does) and an incredibly believable Draco who doesn't want to be attracted to Harry, who doesn't want to screw over his career, who is constantly looked at as an enemy, and who is struggling every day with his Death Eater past and who has even mutilated his own arm in an attempt to remove the Dark Mark. He's not just hot. He's complex and broken and barely holding it together. And Harry is impetuous and reactionary and he makes devastating mistakes. It's one of the best fics I've ever read. But warning: the sex is graphic and abundant. I'm sure you could skip it if smut isn't your thing. There is a ton of it, though. But I'm completely in love with this particular relationship. It's raw and real and even though they have sex right away, watching them take the very, very long journey to love is second to none. It's masterfully done. The chance to read such an incredible story that also includes some amazing sex can't be passed up.

Again, I like smut. I'm making up for lost time because of being really sexually repressed for years. So I'm sure others can give examples of good, non-smutty Drarry. But if you like smut, or can easily skip it, the following authors are good at what they do:

Birdsofshore Lomonaaeren Femmequixotic Faith Wood (faithwood) Zeitgeistic (faire_weather) Astolat Lumosed_quill Firethesound Who-la-hoop Gracerene And more.

If smut's not your deal, that's cool. You don't have to read it. But because you don't like it doesn't mean that there aren't some really talented writing in the genre. It's just not your thing. I don't care for het pairings, but I would never say that all het pairings are poorly written. There is good and bad in every kind of fanfic. I recently had to argue that not all slash pairings were "deluded" and badly written. We come to fanfic to escape reality or see things about our fandom in a different way. And we need to respect that not everyone likes what we like. Stepping off the soapbox now.

Edit: I forgot Aeternum's Leo Inter Serpentes, which isn't Drarry until later and isn't hugely smutty. Basically it's a giant mind game because it's a full rewriting of the entire series with Harry being sorted into Slytherin. It's MASSIVE. She (I'm assuming it's a she) is finishing up Book 6 at the moment. But I love it because it's so interesting to think of how things would change so much because of one little thing. Like, Snape isn't a total asshole to Harry because he takes care of his snakes. So Harry has no problem going to him about the Sorcerer's Stone. And since he becomes friends with Draco, there's no stealing the Remembrall leading to Quidditch and lots of other things like that. It's fun to see how different things are with Draco and his personality rather than Ron. And the adults (namely Snape) TELL HIM THINGS. It's kind of amazing to read.

***** Great great great response!! And I did take as it all and I love Drarry! And I'm 31 and also I've only seen the movies once each (as they were released) so it's really not about Dan and Tom for me either. I think it isn't for most ppl because if you look at any fan art, they almost always draw Harry and Draco nothing like Dan and Tom.

Also, I'm so impressed that you took the time to even write all this because anyone who uses the term "disgusting" to talk about slash pairings already has their mind made up.

**** Yeah, that's not what I said. I said he felt IMPORTANT in an organization that was important to his family for generations. He was making his family proud. And then he was tasked with murder or his mom would die. And he had to live with people that probably seemed pretty cool to him until he finally UNDERSTOOD the reality of it and then did the best he could (which never included murder.) And there was no way out for him. You all can pretend there was one, but there wasn't. And I just gave you plenty of evidence that JK Rowling herself included about not only his unwillingness to kill and his desire to get out once he truly understood, but his redemption in her eyes.

I'm confused by some of you. Have you never heard stories of teenagers who were in cults? Or were real-life child soldiers? We DON'T charge them. Because they are children and effectively brain washed. Do you all think so poorly of people who escaped Westboro Baptist Church? I actually think this is a really good example. I just saw an interview with a girl who left that church- she had been protesting funerals and delivering death threats for Westboro as a teenager. Until she met someone who introduced her to a different viewpoint and she got out.

Make NO mistake. Draco Malfoy was raised in a cult. There was never any chance for him to truly understand the impact of what his family believed until it was living in the bedroom next door, torturing him and holding him hostage. The books oh-so-clearly show him changing. But that's not enough for some of you, and I just don't get it. You all are sure that even though there are tons of pieces of evidence to the contrary, that Draco is pure evil and wasn't a scared, brain-washed teenager who redeems himself at story's end.

...I'm just so confused. And it feels like we've been reading different books.

Edit- I would also suggest reading Draco's biography section on the Harry Potter wiki. None of what I'm saying is pulled from the air- it's all in the books and clearly in the wiki for 6th year, 7th year, and his adult life. He WAS a little shit in school. But the realities of war changed him. And I'm not making that up.

** First of all, I personally think that the sexuality is a spectrum. So I don't see Harry "becoming" gay either, because I wouldn't assume someone is 100% straight even if he has only been with girls.

Second, we can't always decide who we fall in love with. Yes, it might be more likely to end up with someone who was already close to you, but it's not the only option. We fall in love with people who are interesting. Sometimes interesting can mean different, something we don't quite understand, or maybe something dangerous. Isn't there a saying about good girls and bad boys? Maybe that's true for good boys too.

Life isn't always a bed of roses even in fanfiction. Battling with (sometimes unwanted) feelings and overcoming obstacles is what makes romance stories interesting. Slightly unexpected pairings already have opening for all that, so it's easier to build a story around it. I want excitement, awkwardness, hard choices, maybe slow acceptance. I want shit to be tough and desperate, because that's what makes the eventual happy ending so much more beautiful. After all, marrying your high school sweetheart does not make a good story.

Well, that's my thoughts about Drarry. Snarry might be a different case, I don't have strong opinions about it.

** I want to start this by admitting my own bias as a Drarry reader and writer.

So I agree that Harry/Snape is a huge stretch. I don't even see that working out. That being said I read one fic that did it well, probably because the author was so good.;But the concept itself is hard to fathom.

I disgree that Drarry readers /writers are into Tom Felton x Daniel Radcliffe. Of course in Canon it is hard to imagine Harry and Draco ending up together. So, yes Drarry fics are definitely AU. However I do think that there are some compelling things about this pairing:

1) In the 6th book you can see that Draco and Harry are foils of each other. Draco has been given the task to kill Dumbledore, and Harry has to kill Voldemort. It is interesting to see them as two sides of the same coin, so in that sense they understand each other.

2) We see a tragic side to Draco in the sixth book. He is clearly struggling with what he has to do. This lets us see a softer side to him.

3) The Malfoy's do end up changing sides at the end of the series. They leave the final battle. Narcissa in particular is all about saving Draco, no matter the cost to the cause. So in that sense there is an argument to be made about the Malfoy's being more about protecting family then the cause. We can also see this in Draco's reasoning when trying to kill Dumbledore- if he fails his family will be a huge risk, it is up to him to bring back the family 'honor' after his fathers blunder.

4) What is also sometime played up in these fics is that Draco really did want Harry to be his friend in first year. He was embarrassed and angry when Harry refused him. That starts their school yard feud. So there is a time where Draco wanted Harry to be his friend.

5) There is a fun pride and prejudice kind of vibe with a fic like this. Two enemies who find out they have a lot in common and fall in love. Lots of snappy dialogue. It's fun to read when done well.

So basically, yes these fics are au- but isn't all fanfiction? As long as they are well written and done with just enough facts from canon it can be fun to suspend your disbelief for a bit and get into a snappy read.

Edit: I just wanted to add that it is a shame that there are not more fics with a Ron/Harry ship or a Neville/Harry ship etc. I think the reason that there are not as many of them is just because there is less tension. We know that Harry will always have Ron. Slash or not Harry loves Ron, so that's kinda a nonstarter. If you are looking for a romance some tension is needed. Go to a book store and find me a romance about two characters who have always liked each other and been friends falling for each other-it's hard to do. That's because Romance stories are all about the tension and the character building. They are character driven plots.

*** I agree with you. I read a lot of slash, but personally find Snarry to be distasteful, from the Lily fixation to the age difference. I could only maybe see the pairing working in a time travel fic, although I'm sure there are ones that make it work later in life.

I used to feel similarly about Drarry, that Draco was a cowardly little shit and could never work with Harry, that he didn't deserve him. Then, I read Temptation on the Warfront by alizarincrimson. Since then I've been a Drarry fan. For me, it makes their relationship plausible in canon. Being set during the seventh book really helps since in canon we see Draco stripped down to a very vulnerable place. I think that that level of terror for one's life and the gravity and horror of the situation is enough to make many people question their beliefs, so Draco turning "good" after seeing the reality of life with Voldemort makes sense. Draco even has to come to terms with his racism.

That, I think, is the failing of most Drarry stories and part of why the pairing gets scoffed at: a lot of the stories gloss over or ignore Draco's awfulness as a human being and so don't become true redemption stories. And now that Temptation has convinced me that the pairing could work, it's been easier to read and accept fics that don't handle Draco's redemption as well.

Plus, as you pointed out, there's something a bit Pride and Prejudice about the pairing. Since the fandom I read the most of before HP was JAFF (Jane Austen Fanfiction) I'm kinda a sucker for such dynamics.

He did commit war crimes instead of either simply taking his mother and running away (using magic makes this very easy) or go to Dumbledore about the whole thing. He had a choice but he chose violence. That tells us everything we need to know about him. Because forgivable childhood crimes are stealing cigarettes or buying weed and not membership in a terrorist organization, breaking the Geneva convention half a dozen times, attempted murder and use of Unforgivables. We can even throw in High Treason since the Death Eaters want to rule Britain. The latter is punishable by hanging while the other stuff sums up to multiple lifetimes in prison (or several death penalties).

Harry knows all of this so even if he'd bribe his way out of prison it wouldn't change how Harry sees Draco.

*** Yes. While some points I can agree with they still wouldn't work. I mean Dumbledore, and Voldemort are foils to each other, but can they start a relationship. No. Also Draco did not want to be his friend for the sake of being a friend explain how he would want to be a friend to someone he has never met apart from a few minutes in a clothes store in which he insulted someone who Harry was already starting to become friends with also informing harry on the type of kid he was. That right there if you stick with canon up to this point basically destroys any chance they'll ever have right there.

There views on muggles, and purebloods is also something that is another point against them. While i'm sure I could spend some time labelling more in the long run if they ever did have a relationship it wouldn't last, and would be quite a destructive relationship

Also seeing a softer side to Draco doesn't change the fact he was actively trying to kill Dumbledore, and was harming innocents on the way. Edit: wrong book, but the point still stands. Even if he was changing that does not absolve him of his sins. Also if you're sticking with canon up to this point Harry has a better chance getting with Victor Krum than Draco at this point.

In the end they do change sides, but not because they disagreed with Voldemorts views, but because they were scared of Voldemort himself. If he was kinder to the Malfoys they would never have switched sides most likely.

Also on your last point, even if their is some vibe to Pride and Prejudice it's not Pride and Prejudice. It's Harry Potter with a whole different story, and characters.

It's just setting their personalities/characters aside for a minute, they both don't have much positive contact with each other nor would they get a chance to explore possible feelings in the settings they're in.

So in the end I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, but I would love to see a story with Harry/Neville pairing, because do you see what becomes of Neville. If Harry can pull that Neville out earlier it would be a nice little story, and in my mind just as engaging when you involve his family dynamics. It's just, because you can get him as a friend easily it's ones they seem to stay away from. I mean I can imagine a scene where for Neville or Harry the pressure from his aunt(Neville) or the public(Harry) could become too much, and they find comfort in each other, or Neville talking to Harry about his parents, and Harry talking about his parents/life. There is also so much more like what will his aunts reaction(Neville's) be. How will Neville react when he finds out about Harry's home life. You can't really get that with a Drarry story.

****** No one here is trying to argue that Draco and Harry make more sense or that the pairing is more realistic than pairing Neville and Harry together. It's just that fanfiction readers prefer and find tension, enemy to friend and a redemption plot more interesting and more exciting than reading about two people who are already entirely good and are already friends. Sure, you can make tension and stuff with Ron and Neville, but that seems mild compared to bringing together two people from opposite sides who hate each other (friends to lovers is a popular trope in fiction for a reason!).

And while you can't get certain scenes with Draco than with Neville, there are lots of different ways a story can go and you can get similar ones. Draco can also be outraged by Harry's home life, he could also be pressured by his parents to become a death eater and they find comfort in that. Yes, its out of character, but writing is limitless so someone somewhere can likely make anything work if the situation is set up in a certain way.

And I don't even like slash pairings or Drarry, but I am a huge sucker for redemption arcs, tesion, bad bad characters and morality discussions so I can easily see why people prefer those pairings over the normal ones.

*** I'm baffled by all the slash and Snape and Draco haters who believe their personal disgust and absolute ignorance of slash fic make them the authorities on why people read and write slash with these characters in the first place. Please don't presume to tell me or a ton of other non-movie-fans why we write stories. And don't presume to make the phenomenon of teenage ficcers (who also spew great gobs of unreadable het) a dismissal of everyone who enjoys a Snape or Draco ship.

Also, generally speaking (I'm not just talking about slash fic here), the genres and possibilities should be judged by the best each ship or trope has to offer, not by the vast ocean of mediocrity out there. Pointing at badfic as a reason for condemning a dynamic or pairing you dislike is a piss-poor excuse, otherwise we're just back to the mainstream opinion that /all/ fanfic is rubbish.

I read and write Snape/Harry because the dynamic is WAY more interesting to me than any other Harry ship - not because I think it's more plausible or somehow superior to other ships or, God forbid, desirable in a real-world sense. I like it /because/ of the tension and messed-up history and shadowy similarities and parallels and because Harry as Snape's redemptive arc and Snape as Harry's dark mirror or grudging responsibility appeals to me in ways Ron or Neville don't. (I like Ron and Neville but am mostly indifferent to their shipping potential.)

I like dysfunctional ships, cross-gen ships, cross-class ships, power imbalances, and morally grey characters. Snape/Harry has all that.

Anyway, as someone has already pointed out, this conversation crops up here, on a sub that barely tolerates slash and has zero sympathy for Snape and Draco, and the conversation is always the same. It's not a likely forum for exploring what's interesting or appealing about the pairings themselves, and it makes it impossible for fans to discuss the dysfunctional aspects /as part of the appeal/ or as a narrative challenge or an erotic focus. The post is usually an invitation to straight male members of the sub to jump on the ships and shippers with both feet and be scornful, condescending, and outraged, and to publicly hold their noses. It's all very circular.

***** PoA was 1999. And yes, while Snape/Hermione was more popular in the early fandom, Snarry has always been a thing. And Drarry and Dramione have always been the most popular pairings.

*** Thank-you. It's disgusting the amount of stories that have harry paired up with snape or draco or even hermione paired up with them, but how few stories where harry is paired up with ron or neville or even one of the guys/girls he plays quidditch with.

** It's the poor reasoning and poorer writing that pisses me off when it comes to romance fics. I'll actually read well-written m/m. Really. I'll read any kind of pairing if it's well-written ... but most /aren't/, so I generally just lurk here and occasionally complain about stuff between whatever gen I can find.

And I really do want to complain about Snarry & Drarry.

Harry just doesn't seem like he'd get along with Snape or Draco in that way. At all. Even remotely. He hates bullies. He's literally compared Malfoy to his cousin Dudley. He hates Snape for the majority of the series, justifiably so. And, textually, you could argue that he doesn't find them attractive as they are both, in-canon, not exactly described in flattering terms by him. As far as Snape/Harry goes, writers refuse to turn Hogwarts into a college to age characters up or refuse to make the romance happen well after Harry graduates ... which, with the age gap, makes for disturbing shit that is both gross and illegal.

That's even without touching the whole "has Lily's eyes" thing. Could you imagine dating someone who had the hots for your mom? Jesus, no thank you.

But since I'm an egalitarian, just know that I also hate Snape and Malfoy paired up with Hermione too for similar reasons.

#+begin_quote
  I personally see him maybe with Ron or Neville
#+end_quote

Harry ending up with either of them would make more sense to me and ignore his personality far less. I'd rather see Harry/Viktor, Harry/Cedric (this requires AU, sadly), or maybe even Harry/Blaise if anyone could manage to write Harry like a guy and not someone's terrible idea of what a gay/bi man acts like.

Basically, I find the pairing scene for this fandom really frustrating and full of terrible attempts at romance. It's just easier for me to avoid the whole thing altogether than pick some gems out of the turds ...

(But sometimes I might frolic in the fresh, green fields that are rarepairs and f/f.)

** You know, as an avid Drarry fan, I agree. Realistically, Draco is too far gone as a criminal and his hatred and jealousy of Harry runs too deep. Not to mention that Harry would never even come close to camaraderie with a former Death Eater.

Drarry fics usually make light of this fact or change some circumstances around, which I prefer. It's been my OTP since the second book came out, and I can't seem to shake it off, even though it evidently made less sense with every successive book.

Snarry, I simply don't understand.

Edit: also, I do love the tension/redeeming this pairing brings. It's intense already, on its own, for whatever reason you choose. It's a good start to a plot, imo.
