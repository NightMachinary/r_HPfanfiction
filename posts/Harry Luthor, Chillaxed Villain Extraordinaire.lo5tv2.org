Through a convoluted set of situations, a young Harry is adopted by the Man of Steel's arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor.

However, as he grows up, Harry isn't really that interested in being a villain, despite his role-models, and he puts the bare minimum of effort in. It annoys his father, but his father still loves him.

As this goes on and on, Harry becomes frenemies-that-becomes-friends with Supergirl and Stargirl, the 'B' listers expected to take on the 'B' villain while the "A" villains and superheroes go at it.

Mostly they just chill in the background, each doing token attacks like Harry throwing a rock at Kara, or Kara trying to 'capture him'.

This exasperates the heroes and villains as while they're battling, Harry is watching funny cat videos on his phone with Kara/Courtney.

However, like most teenagers, drama occurs when Supergirl and Stargirl begin trying to one-up each other by being friends with Harry.

Villains think it's ingenious how he's "sowing discord among junior league members". The heroes, likewise, believe that he's a bad influence on them, in their self-righteous ways.

Heroes battle: sidekicks chill in the background.


** Klarion should be part of this somehow

**** I have come to really, really hate Klarion for the events in "Misplaced", so personally, I'd require the plot to happen before that to be digestible. The more AU, the better.

**** Klarion is the weird allegedly-uncle-that-has-a-human growth hormone-issue that just shows up and gives Harry gifts and advice on how to get the girls, except Harry has a weird feeling about his advice so he doesn't follow it too much. The gifts are generally just little knickknacks that are enchanted to fuck with people.

** Now the question is does he treat Superboy like a beloved brother or are they like weirdly jealous and competitive over stupid shit. I mean obviously neither one will permit any harm to come to the other unless they do it, but are they best bros or omg i hate u bros.

"I know i said you'd need to take the first step if you wanted a relationship with Superman, Dad. But, i think you missed a few steps." Harry after he first sees the plans for the Superboy, "I'm not getting bunk beds or sharing my room with my new baby brother."

That's a tautology from what I've seen.

Harry questioning Lex about his weird obsession with Superman is something I didn't know I wanted. It's even funnier when you know an very early incarnation of the character started out as Superman's fan!

** Harry can do magic. Superman is vulnerable to magic. Lex loves his boy dearly but is /super/ (puns!) frustrated he's "not living up to his potential".

** Hmm, it doesn't seem very Harry Potter-y, but I do like the 'heroes fight, sidekicks chill' concept.\\
I think I saw a fic once where Draco was snarky and grumpy as usual, but Crabbe and Goyle just got along with Harry and co. when Draco's back was turned. What was it...?

** The entire plot/premise is about the DC universe. Why did you post this here? This is about Harry Potter Fanfiction and what you described wouldn't even qualify as a crossover.

**** Because the story as described is 100% about the DC universe. Where's Hogwarts? Where is Voldemort? Where are the Horcruxes? Where are Ron and Hermione?

Even the backstory of this "Harry" is so radically different (Lex Luthor's son??) that you can't even say the character is the same.

How is this supposed to be about Harry Potter? Like how?

**** As described, the fact that the main character is Harry Potter had nothing to do with the story. You could replace Harry with literally anyone else, and nothing would be changed (and let's be honest, this Harry would almost certainly really be an OC with some superficial similarities to Harry Potter).

Now I would still love to read a story based on this premise, but that's because I enjoy reading DC stories.

*** At what point does it say Harry has moved universe? Wizards live among us in secret. The books could be set in the DC universe without us knowing.

Technically Smallville and Harry Potter could be the same universe without ever interacting or affecting each other in any way, and remaining completely cannon.

Based on the cannons, Clark Kent was guessed to be around 2 and a half when he was found by the Kents, shortly after Harry Potter's 9th birthday. With a 7 year age gap, Harry would finish hogwarts before Clark started high school/start of smallville show.

Why would wizards talk about a meteor shower in America that happened when Harry was 9? Why would Smallville residents discuss some deaths in the UK from a couple of years ago? Why would Parents be discussing American Superheroes when dropping their kids off for the Express? No reason to talk about it so it isn't mentioned in either.

Both happen in the same universe, still cannon. Boom, mike drop.

**** The DC universe and the HP universe do not even remotely take place in the same world.

This isn't about the show "Smallville", it's about the wider DC Universe. There is no way in hell these two are compatible.

So unless the story starts with a very explicit dimension travel, I'm not buying it.

***** My point was they could be the same universe, and both be cannon, and we'd never know due to the timeline. Harry is old news by the start of Smallville so he doesn't affect them, and he is 30 something when people start finding out about heroes so it can only affect the epilogue. Niether would effect the other in ANY way, even if they were the same universe. Unless the Dursleys take Harry on a vacation to Kansas for a meeting with Lionel Luthor.
