** Can I just say that I love the other two answers given. They basically go.

a) Remove smut

b) Make it only smut

** I'd improve it by removing the overwhelming majority of the smut, but the problem is, the entire damn plot is focused around Harry having sex with every single object that even twitches slightly.

So I think the best course of action here is to remove the story from existence.

** Remove 95% of the plot and world building to turn it into a pure smutfic centered around Harry's conquests. Also, he'd be a lot closer to his canon characterisation, so no of that completely unbelievable "13 year old boy dominates everyone" crap. Screw around? He's a celebrity and the star player, of course he'd have game. But definitely not in the way the author wrote it.

** Get the author to stop binge-watching bad porn, learn what a human being is, and, one hopes, pretend to be one.

Seriously.

I read the story and found it to be a cry for help from a sociopath wanting to be something less than the creepy uncle other relatives warn their children not to be around at family reunions, not fiction proper. There's so much distilled fridge horror and rape fantasy, it should be tossed into the midden heap of Kinsfire-esque shitfictions and left there to rot or burn.

** You need to completely rewrite Harrys character direction. The fic reads like a radicalisation of a young child if you remove all of the magic stuff so best way is keep world building and overall plot without all the racist, mysoginistic shit and anti religious rants in there. Maybe make Harry less of an asshole too?

*** That's because the story is a radicalization of a young child. You might as well have said don't write this story and write something else.
