I can remember portkeys that are timed (the boot that takes them to the Quidditch World Cup Final) and ones that are activated by touch (the Triwizard Cup that takes Harry to the graveyard and back), but fanfic authors frequently use portkeys that are activated by a password and I don't remember that from canon.


** In a word: no.

In slightly more words: there's no example of it in the books, but spells are generally quite flexible in how they are used (see, for example, the Freezing Charm both freezing things literally but also preventing a Burglar Alarm from going off). So it seems likely that it is possible.

*** Thanks for answering. I read fanfic much more than I reread the original works, so it's hard sometimes to separate fanon from canon. I don't have a problem with password-activated portkeys; just wanted to know which category they fell into.

That said, too many authors are crap at it. Consider this excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  Amelia held out a chain, 'I want you to send that to Harry, it's an emergency port key, it will bring him instantly into my office if he feels he is in danger, the password is sneaky. If it is after I have gone home, I will be alerted that Harry is here.'

  Sirius smiled as he took the chain, 'I was told how he snuck in extra memories, the one of me and the rat in the shrieking shack, so he was sneaky.'
#+end_quote

Both characters just said the password while holding the portkey. Plus, a portkey password should be a word that wouldn't be used in everyday speech, so as not to set it off accidentally.

****** That's the other problem with a password: anybody saying the word would set it off. It's not like the portkey can tell if the person holding it is the one talking.

That said, maybe the perfect password is Avada Kedavra. (Ha! Missed me!)

**** That could be explained as the password needs intent to work. Although if the only thing needed is intent to use the portkey, why bother with the password...

***** Now they could get around this by having the actual portkey be a pendant ON the chain, as we know that you must be have skin contact with the portkey (even if it's just a finger touching it).
