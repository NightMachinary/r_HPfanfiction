I think that with his crippling fear of death and all, it wouldn't be too unlikely for Voldemort to come back as a ghost. I know that in canon, he couldn't because of the damage he did to his soul, but nonetheless I think it's an interesting premise and I would like to see a fanfiction on it. Does anyone know of any? Thanks in advance.


** Interested parties are interested. Lol I think it would be a good read.
