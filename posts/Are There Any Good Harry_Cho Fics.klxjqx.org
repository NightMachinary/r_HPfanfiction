I feel like Cho is a character who gets treated really poorly, not just by Harry in canon, but by the fanbase. As a teen, when I read the books I didn't like Cho one bit. She seemed to be a one-dimensional character who served only as a love interest and cried too much. But as I've matured and become an adult, I've realized there's probably a whole lot more to that character than we're seeing in the limited perspective we get in the book. Her boyfriend died when she was just 15 years old. And Harry would just completely refuse to talk about him with her, as if she was still obsessed with some dead dude she should get over. Then (from her perspective), he left their date early to go see Hermione. Clearly, that relationship could've worked a lot better if Harry had just taken a moment or two to consider her perspective on everything. If he had, I think it could've worked out well. Choonly seems so one dimensional as a character, as we never got to see her personality, because Harry never really gave her a proper chance, because she was depressed because her boyfriend died. I'd love to read a fic where they both take a more mature approach to trying a relationship, and we get to see more of Cho's personality. I've yet to find any great fics for this pairing. Any recs?


** Started reading linkao3(22220911) recently and it's good so far.

  In which Harry goes to live with his godfather in the summer of 1994, Peter Pettigrew goes to Azkaban, and a lot of things change.

*** From the description, it sounds like it's almost a harem type romance (Harry x several other women). Is that the case? I usually prefer stories with one main relationship that it sticks with, but I might give it a go if it's really good

** The lack of Harry/Cho fics is stranger than the lack of Harry/Katie fics, imo. They were actually a pairing for a bit. Hope you get some good recs!

  Before there was Luna in his life, another Ravenclaw had captured Harry's heart, and he had captured hers. It was not fated to last forever, but they'd never forget each other. Two key scenes from Harry's relationship with Cho Chang.
