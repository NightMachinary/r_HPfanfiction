Recently read this biography of Snape's life, and it was brilliant. Actually brilliant. What I need now is a biography of Dumbledore's life. Anyone have any suggestions? Preferably not written by Rita Skeeter.


** I love this story so much. Like, seriously so much. The last chapter always turns me into a blubbering mess.

** I'm currently reading through the Snape Chronicles and whilst I'm enjoying it a lot I can't help but feel it tries to hard to make Snape sympathetic and misunderstood.

*** I think you're looking at it wrong; you are judging it by the source material. Think of it as a tale set in the Harry Potter universe rather than straight-up fan fiction. It's a story of a guy with clinical depression who happens to be a talented wizard. As such, it is a magnificent piece of writing. Sure, the circumstances of Snape's life as set up there are horrid, and if you compare them to canon it feels like someone drew circles around dots and said "bullseye"... so just don't.

It is a compelling narrative once you read it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. From a literary perspective, it is a solid work, and actually outdoes most published fiction... and is aimed at a more mature reader than the source.

And as to OP: AFAIK no other character has a biography nearly as well written.

**** I disagree, I feel the completely made up parts of his childhood and even his years in Hogwarts are fantastic. I feel it loses a lot of steam when it comes to the more 'canon' parts, I should have worded it a bit better. My problem isn't with him being sympathetic but I feel it tries too hard starting from when he's inducted into the Death Eaters to keep him as blameless and sympathetic as possible. When he's in the Death Eaters he just makes potions and spells and therefore isn't involved in any of their horrific acts, he's kept pretty far away from Voldermort apart from a few scenes, it all feels like the writer is trying really hard to make him naive to the bigger picture of what he's involved in so that he can still be sympathetic.

The same with the explicit canon stuff, in the books Snape is a straight up ass to Harry for seemingly no reason apart from he reminds him of James. In this Harry is bad at potions and that's the main reason why with only a little a bit of the fact he reminds him of James (so far I'm only up to CoS) in it. The author has Snape pallying up with Fred and George as well with the offer of a toe nail growing spell which just seems against his character. To me it feels like the author is trying so hard to go out of their way to rationalise behaviour to show Snape in a more favourable light instead of showing him warts and all.

I've not finished it yet as I've started to struggle a bit with it but I won't deny it's fantastic writing and one of the best bit of fanfiction I've written, I just think it's trying so hard to sanitise Snape.

***** As far as the Harry years go, the source material is told mainly from Harry's point of view. As such, the character profile we get from the books for Snape may be subject to Harry's bias or limited point of view. So we don't exactly know the nuances of Snape's personality. Sure he was an ass, but we don't exactly know what went on behind the scenes.

****** That's a fair point however I'd argue that even though the books are from Harry's POV if were to accept that they're an accurate representation of what happened then Snape is a bully plain and simple. He's horrible to Hermione, constantly belittles Neville and iirc outs Lupin as a werewolf. Now Snape does have some redeeming qualities as seen in the books but my argument here is this story seems to try so hard to warp everything that's shown in the books and before that to make Snape seem like he's not that bad of a guy. I could understand some of it because obviously everything looks different from someone elses perspective but with this story it seems like everything is downplayed or changed to make someone other than Snape look bad.

One example that springs to mind is the Slytherins practicing when Gryffindor had the pitch booked, now I could be wrong here as it's been a while since I've read CoS, but in this story Gryffindor had the pitch booked 4 weekends in a row. So this gets used to make Snape letting Slytherin practice look completely rational, now on it's own it's not that big of a deal and kind of believable but when it's constantly piled on and on with other parts so that nearly all of Snape's actions look fair it eliminates some of the allure to his character in my opinion.

******* Oh yeah I get what you're saying. Both stories have biases for sure. While TSC is a good story, it is a bit heavy handed with Saint Severus.

******** That's my only real problem with it other than that I'm enjoying it a lot. I loved the build up, especially his time at Hogwarts and the build up with the students trying to recruit him and the hushed talks about Voldermort. I thought it was building it up great to where I could totally buy why he would go to the Death Eaters. I guess I just feel a bit let down than rather having him wrestle with his conscience and showing a man who has done bad things for personal reasons it instead tried to keep him relatively clean to the point where it's kind of blunted the edge that makes his character so interesting.

********* I get where you're coming from, but I have to ask how would you suggest going about delivering an opposing view that doesn't whitewash? The reason I ask is because as far as canon goes you have racist, prejudiced, bigoted, rich, inbred, dark, twisted, torturing, killing Death Eater Pure-bloods. That is what they are, period, and on the otherside we have the unquestioned good guys- the hero of which used unforgiveables a couple of times. I don't even remember Snape doing that, but the Gryffindor Head of House Imperios someone when there were clearly other options. So the point is I feel like it is written in stone that some people are bad and some good. The only 'redeeming' feature we see of any of the bad guys is that they will turn traitor. So from my point of view they aren't people so much as "scare-crows" ie. evil straw-men who don't have a leg to stand on- who exist to be wrong thinking and acting bad people, and to then be beaten.

So the problem is that in trying to write something which expands or explains the wizarding world I run into the fact that 1/4 of it is inhuman seemingly. I mean we all know subconsciously that Walburga Black and Dolohov weren't always horrible people, or weren't horrible all the time, or to everyone. However while your reasons for disliking the portrayal are well reasoned I, in general, see a sort of resistance to portraying anyone in the pure-blood mania camp as partially good (though lots of people that just make them flat out good, which are just bad fics imo). The response I often see is essentially that of whitewashing. Of course most fanfic authors can't pull it off well, but there does seem to be a general resistance to the only two things an author can do 1) use previous events hinted at in canon to explain how things aren't always as they seem. 2) make stuff up to contrast the canon portrayal.

I guess this is mostly ranting but I I brought up (an exaggerated) thread of Hagrid being horrible. The other things were all minor (or plain dumb to bring up) but at the end of the day Hagrid, 70 year old adult, Hogwarts staff member, brave Gryffindor, OotP member (?- at least trusted implicitly by its leader), wizard does dangerous human transfiguration on a muggle child who knows nothing of magic prior, and gives him a pigs tail. Permanent (canon-wise transfiguration doesn't revert etc.)- Dudley would literally have been a pig. Hagrid was expelled /years/ before he would have had the chance to be taught this. Regardless of whether Dudley is a huge bullying prick, 'cursing' him is reprehensible. The fact that Hagrid does this after /Vernon/ angers Hagrid with an insult of Dumbledore (Dudley doesn't say a word)- that is absolutely horrible when you look at it in a 'real life' sort of way (rather than fairy tale payback). This is to a massive extent glossed over as kids book, deserved it, or just /not/ concerned over it. The point being that a proven canon incident of a good guy doing something that is objectively bad is forgiven and forgotten. Where as we don't even know any good things about the bad guys (or just really really unlikable ones ala Snape), and so I can't help but be pessimistic that any objectively decent/good thing that is created (or altered from source material) for the bad guys is going to be received as whitewashing. This I think is most starkly the case in attempts at canon-compliant or canon friendly works ie. not AU happy Voldemort/goblins etc.

Honestly I am trying to work on something which gives the bad guys /something/ to work with- ie they aren't all born evil, they aren't all stupid and enjoy torturing, there might be things that Harry is unaware of etc. that gives them half a leg to wobble on. So I guess what I am saying is I AGREE with you (pre death eater parts of Snape Chronicles are stronger, whitewashing goes too far) and yet how the bloody hell can I portray the worst of the worst of them in a way that shows them not innately evil or necessarily wrong? ie. Even if wrong/misguided- As the hero of their own story?

*TL;DR* - Do you have any recommendations on how to portray even more fucked up characters- Walburga Black, Dolohov, Voldemort in a way that fleshes them out (including admirable qualities, actions which are good in their own right, etc.) ?

********** It's difficult portraying the Death Eaters as 3 dimensional characters because like you said they are evil straw men, just henchmen that JK gave names to too flesh the world out. That said it can either be a blessing or a curse when it comes to fleshing them out because they're essentially blank canvases. Near enough any of the DE's except Lucius or Bella can be given any story you want really as their plot points are very few and minor.

As for giving them redeemable qualities or showing them as not innately evil it's difficult because the main characteristic we know of them is that they hold extremely prejudice beliefs to the point of murder. Your best bet would be to look into history, the Nazis did heinous things yet they were still humans with human qualities, Rudolf Hoss for example would spend his day job thinking up mass extermination techniques then go home to his wife and kids. I think you need to resign yourself to the fact that without some massive tinkering to DE characters that they will never be relateable characters in a story because at the end of the day the point of the group is to target and kill people who have no idea why they're being targeted (in the case of Muggles) or on the basis of pure lies (in the case of muggle borns). That will always be bigger than any good qualities that they have. If you do decide to write a story on certain Death Eater characters an interesting way to go might be to juxtapose a Death Eaters regular day to day life with their life as a Death Eater and emotional conflict that might cause, but it might be difficult to get a full story out of it.

However you can give them strong characterisations as to why they hate muggles easily. Fear would be the big one, humans/muggles can be just as destructive as Death Eaters and they out number wizards by a ridiculous amount. You could bring up the atom bomb, all the world wars, the witch trials everything violent and destructive that wizards do can be seen in the real world on a much larger scale, that might be a good thing to bring up as good motivaton as to why certain Death Eaters hate muggles.

Finally I'd recommend looking up Nazi documentaries; Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution is a six part series that goes into a little bit about some of the Nazis involveds feelings on the holocaust. Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil is a book written about Adolf Eichmann that explores a bit about how he reconciled the awful things he did with his morals. Shit even give American History X a watch, that's a good example of a terrible person but it's more of a redemption story than anything.

TL;DR An interesting story can be written about them, it's just not going to be easy if you're trying to avoid complete black/white morality and will probably have to delve more into characterisation that straight up story.

************ Again it all depends on how close to canon you want to stick. The problem with young Voldermort is everything we hear of him doing is there to show him as having a disregard for rules from an early age. I'd definitely call trying to explain those behaviours away as whitewashing because Voldermort was never created to be a deep character with deep motivations, he's just an evil person with ridculously evil motivations that can't really be logically explained away or softened. Good luck trying though I'd be interested to see what you come up with!
