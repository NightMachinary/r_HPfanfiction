Since apparently this sub only dislikes slash because of the huge quantity of Death Eater pairings,I'm looking for slash between two characters close in age on the light side

Give me Harry and Ron's secret romance starting in the Leaky Cauldron in third year

Give me Seamus working out how to tell his father he's marrying Justin Finch Fletchely

Give me Terry Boot' s angst as he falls in love with his straight best friends

Give me Cedric and Roger Davies snogging sessions after the Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw match

Anything and everything,excluding Death Eater pairings which of course the sole reason this sub dislikes slash


** I really liked the Dean/Seamus story, Before I Knew. It's a really cute story about Dean and Seamus through their Hogwarts years, living and learning and experiencing... and coming to terms with their sexuality and eventually getting together. It's a fic that's just filled with nice character moments and exploration of two secondary characters.

(There's also a companion fic, This Is Where, which is Lavender/Parvati and happens in tandem with this fic. For the best reading experience, I recommend reading both!)

** I'm pretty sure I am one of the people who "dislike" Slash since I don't read it and for some it seem enough. So I may not be the best person to point it (especially since you seem to be here to make a point), but the problem is not about "Death Eater pairing", it's about pairing the magical equivalent of a 30 to 60 Nazi to a teenage Jew. I will admit it could make an interesting read (in a messed kind of way), but from the few I tried, it just mostly either transform the nazi into a teddy bear or somehow transform the Jew into a Nazi.

​

Anyways, all I was saying is that, difference in age aside, I doubt this sub would have any problem with "dark" slash pairing :

Draco slowly exploring the Dark side of Theo

Lucius and Rodolphus bonding behind the back of their wife

The long hugging sessions of Baby Voldemort with Pettigrew

**** Yeah, it's always a bit strange how some are quick to attack or dismiss Tom/Harry (and lets be honest, the well written ones are totally AUs and showing the relationship as messed up) but I find a lot of recommanded Bella/Harry and... she's no better than Tom? Especially since it's almost always Bella as a DE whereas it's usually Tom as a teen/child when he's just a bad person and not a nazi. And the same goes for the Snape/whoever. The dude is a DE, shares the ideals, etc. (And a 30 something Snape and a 15 yo Hermione is just as bad as a 50 something LV and whoever. Also, teacher/student? Even if he wasn't... him, it's still not very healthy??)

Also, how is drarry worse than Daphne/Harry? If you can't see Draco as anything but his canon self, Daphne canon is suggesting that she's the same as him?

***** Uhh, TMR is 100% more than just "a bad person" as a teen and definitely closer to a Nazi and a psychopath.

There's no Daphne canon. She appears as a name and we're told by JKR that she's been friends with Pansy. We know Draco actively tries to kill people. Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott get the same treatment as Daphne.

****** Ah, yes, I'm not saying he's any kind of good. It was more to take into account the AUs where there is no magic/when he grows up with Harry since they're 5 yo/ when he's in modern AU where there is no nazi context. It's just that it's easy to discard the nazi context in a fic, but that, in the end he's still a morally bad/wrong/dark person. In the end, no matter what, TMR will be a bad person to Harry relatively good one. That's the whole interest of his character, I guess.

But anyway, it was not to make it OK. It was just to point out that the others are just as bad (not in the same way, obviously, but still). And that it's rarely pointed out as such. I can take an unhealthy Tom&Harry fic (or a Dumbledore/Grindelwald) but a cuty, dopey Snape/Hermione? That's... peculiar.

And there is not much in canon, sure, but when JKR and the fandom tend to paint all Slytherin as neo-nazis, it's strange to see Daphne being the only exception.

And anyway, it was just to point out the difference in their treatment. And maybe it's a question or point of view, but I sincerely found the community here a bit quick to dismiss any slash pairing.

(I'm pretty sure I'm not expressing myself properly or clearly! I'm sorry! And maybe it's a question of POV, too! Because I'm still discovering the community, and I'm still a bit shocked at seeing people constantly asking no slash or downvoting it---and, logically, I know it's not bad or wrong or anything, because in the end there is no point in suggesting ships you won't care for. Anyway, it was just a way to point what I perceive as a double standard.)

*** This argument confuses me on the subject of drarry in particular. I wouldn't really count Draco as an actual nazi since he was underage for basically the entire series except right at the end, and the only things you really see him do at the end there is refuse to ID harry and effectively run away from the battle of Hogwarts as soon as possible.

So could you explain more on that one?

**** My "problem" with Draco is that, for a good part of the story, his main characteristic is his cowardice. He also would not really count him as a "Nazi", but the problem is that the only reason he is not considered as such is because none of them respect him.

It's Draco opinions that made him take the mark and rejoin the terrorist, but it is not them that later stopped his hand. Draco couldn't kill Dumbledore because he was afraid to do it, Draco tried to flee the battle because he was too afraid to fight, hell I think at least half of the reason he didn't sell Harry was because he was too afraid (both of the consequence if it's truly Harry, and if he was wrong).

As a reminded, even after not selling Harry, Draco did try to capture him in the Room of Requirement with Crabbe and Goyle, and during the Battle, he did beg a Death Eater for mercy saying"he was on his side".

Even with people being lenient to Draco because he is the product of an education, I think he pass the point of non return during HBP with his failed murders.

​

So I really dislike the pairing Draco/ Harry, for the same reason I dislike Draco/ Hermione. Draco, at least in Canon, is a pretty terrible person and not ship material at all.

It doesn't mean that it is "impossible" to ship him with a main character, just that, in my opinion, people should "prepare" the relation and change Draco a little to make him more likable.

​

For exemple, I remember a fic (Draco/Hermione), where, after being punched by Hermione in 3rd year, Draco slowly change his view. So, the 1st chapter of the fic was a series of short scenes between Draco and Hermione during "canon" (Draco apologising to Hermione, or them having a polite conversation where nobody is around).

While the rest of this fic was honnestly not that great (and full of cliche like Weasleys bashing, Head Boy and Girl private suite, Lord Potter-Black and marriage contracts), I found this 1st chapter really interesting because it made Draco more human and likable.

***** Ah see but thats /why/ i like reading draco as a character. I find his character to be so incredibly redeemable with only minor changes to the character (which will happen to any character in any fic anyways). Cowardice or intense self preservation instincts don't ruin the character at all really. It just makes him a little more human

Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3”.

A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

** I mean I don't like most slash FFs because they are poorly written angst-fests that often seem to have no plot, or are so AU they're just using the names of HP characters.

I read a great HP/Sherlock story that was Harry/Mycroft. there was characterization that went beyond being gay, being named harry, and having magic. The relationship and plot coexisted each one moving the other forward.

Not all stories have to be like that. If i'm just going to read something to help me wank then it doesn't have to have a coherent plot or good characterization, but also then i'm going to need something that turns me on as a straight man.

When I was most active in the HP fandom (about 10-12 years ago), the slash fics were usually better written than the het, probably due to having an older average fanbase. I only read a handful of HP fics per year these days, but as far as I know, slash still has an older average fanbase than het, so I'm skeptical that the quality can have declined that much relative to het fics. Perhaps you've just had bad luck with the slash fics you attempted.

**** perhaps I really don't go looking for slash fics, if a fic turns out to be slash it doesn't turn me off but in my experience i've not made it far enough into a fic where the Slash is a major part of it before closing it because everything else about the story turns me off of it.

Maybe its because i prefer stories where romantic relationships aren't the focus of the plot, but something that happens alongside. so if it seems from the start that the romance IS the story then i'm going to close it Het or Slash
