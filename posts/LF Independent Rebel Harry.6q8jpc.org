Harry who doesn't take Snape's bullying, who decides no, he'll do what he wants over the summers, who says screw you Tri Wizard Tournament. Preferably one that doesn't just regurgitate canon with a sassy Harry, and preferably one where a girl (or guy) is the cause for his rebellion.

Slash, bashing and crossovers are fine. Please no mpreg, romance/smut-centric plots, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you!


** So essentially any and all Indy!Harry stories.

These I remember off the top of my head. My memory when it comes to bashing stories is not very reliable.

*** Not all. Some have Hermione or -shudder- Luna triggering the independence and then it's just bleh. I can't read fics like that. Where the sole reason Harry does something is for a girl.

**** I agree...that lacks substance (sure it happens in RL - especially with many teenage girls who are into assholes (supposed "bad boys" - who are anything but and are just really abusive assholes who are in need of a good beating IMHO! I don't think you should let a girl boss you around, but you in turn shouldn't be a total dipshit either! A relationship works best IMHO if the partners are true equals!) - but that doesn't make it a great plot device! Most people just don't want soap-opera or sitcom when reading Harry Potter fanfiction, me included so nope normal teenage problems can at best be a sideshow to the normal plot which revolves around Voldemort, Dumbledore, the Ministry and Harry himself (in whatever version the fanfiction writer imagines - from Dumbledore's man to fully independent and even totally unwilling to fight ("My parents decided to fight, they payed the price - I myself see no reason to follow their example! I will defend myself if attacked and that's it!"))

** linkffn(2095661) - behind blue eyes.

Harry runs away after Sirius's death and not to get revenge/study archaic magic/ escape manipulative old coot, but because he was just a kid with too much on his shoulders. It is not exactly what you asked for, since it's not really about independence and more about growing up and battling inner demons. But he does rebel against everybody, not caring for consequences.

  It's the summer after the Department of Mysteries and Harry Potter's about to do something drastic, something nobody expects, and he may not be alone. Following the lives of Harry and the Order as they battle against each other.
