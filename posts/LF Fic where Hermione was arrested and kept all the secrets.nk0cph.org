:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi my lovely Ladies, Gents and NBs (and all not falling into these categories) Once, a long time ago, I read a fic that won't leave my head... - Hermione disappeared to the Muggle world after the war - she is wanted for interrogation - for some reason she reenters the magical world and is arrested - she went away because she knew too many secrets about her friends and nobody wanted them to be known - once arrested the reader gets to know these secrets but I don't know how it plays out in the fic anymore

Does anyone maybe know which fic this is? Cheers!
