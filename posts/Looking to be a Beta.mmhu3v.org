Hello! I have recently decided that I would like to become a beta for the HP fanfiction world. I'm about to finish my Winter semester of school and will be on summer break for four months and am looking for something to do with my time. I'm willing to beta stories that are Works in Progress or already Complete, maybe even published. Recently I've read some stories that have seemed to need a second set of eyes and I hope to be that second set for you. I am comfortable with pretty much anything, but if you're writing an explicit story please let me know possible tags and warnings before I read as there are a few things I'm not entirely comfortable with.


** I am in need of a beta. The story I'm working on right now is a prequel to my other story Harry Potter and the Bored Outer God, it's called the Bored Outer God: Through the Ages and is going to cover what my main character has been up to from 180 A.D. To October 31st 1981 in short scenes.
