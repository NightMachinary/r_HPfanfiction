Fic 1: Fem Harry Au where Harry goes back in time to younger self. I remember the young fem harry was raped by Vernon. After harry took over, the soul of the younger harry passed on, because it wasn't used to kindness or something like that. I want to say the older harry ended up becoming the DADA teacher. I also think James or Lily were alive.(maybe both)

Fic 2: Harry is a seer. He ended up getting trained by blaise zabini's mom. Seer's get some king of tattoo. (Teardrop maybe?) That gets darker the more he trained? Maybe Slytherin Harry.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
