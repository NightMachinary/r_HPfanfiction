:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a story that has multiple short vignettes with the overall theme showing harsh consequences to certain story beats in the HP universe.

In one chapter Snape has Harry and Ron expelled from school because of the flying car incident, and Dumbledore instead gives Snape a potion that causes him to confess. In another an auror comes to the Burrow to tell Harry and company that his cousin died a horrible death by swollen tongue because of eating the ton tongue toffee, while Fred and George look on in horror.


** I think you mean this: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13279982]]) Chapters 4 and 8 are the individual stories you mention.

#+begin_quote
  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.
