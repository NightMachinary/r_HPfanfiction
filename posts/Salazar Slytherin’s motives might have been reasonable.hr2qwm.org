I'm in the process of writing a Founders' incarnation fanfiction, but one headcannon in my mind is that Salazar Slytherin might not be evil as one might think, that he has a reason to hate muggles.

Witch burnings has been common in the mid 17th century and while according to the Harry Potter Wiki the Founders lives in the 11th century. While it was unrecorded, maybe the Witch Burnings has been always there? And thus so, loosing many of his Muggleborn students to the burnings made him hate the muggles, and to spare the Muggleborns from the terrible fate he reused to accept them any more into the school?

Maybe a strange mob mentality has created thinking that everyone in Slytherin is evil and blood purists.

Just my honest opinion! Let me know what you think :)


** I mean. Do you need anything other than what Canon provides?

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.
#+end_quote

(CoS)

Given the times, that is a perfectly reasonable opinion to have. You can, of course, have a different opinion, but it's not "evil". The periode in question would begin the reign of King Æthelstan (924--40; the 10th century, not the 11th), who was precisely trying to root out heathens, as Christianisation had not yet reached all that far beyond towns. Among other things, he put a death penalty on people unable "to deny" they had caused deaths using witchcraft.

*Edit:* And even closer to home (Moray, Scotland):

#+begin_quote
  Outside the Forres Police Sation is a stone marking the grave of one of the three witches who bewitched King Duncan in 960 AD. The witches were rolled down Cluny Hill in spiked barrels, the barrel and its contents were then set alight.

So clearly, if you kept the knowledge of controlled use of magic within families that already /were/ magical, you ran less of a risk of exposing yourselves. That what Ron takes from Binn's story is that Slytherin "started all this pure blood stuff" is a hilarious non-sequitur, given that Binns said nothing at all about blood /or/ "purity".

*** This makes some degree of sense to me.

It always kinda seemed to me like the "blood purity" argument would have been twisted from something that would have fallen under devil's-advocate type practicality back then.

If witches were persecuted even back then, it would have been a somewhat-callous, pragmatic kind of security to not admit anyone who might be born of parents who fully supported the witch-hunts of the time - they might accidentally or deliberately let something slip about the hidden community of people that the Church would just love to bump off the mortal coil.

Over time, then, the argument got twisted among those who continued to agree with the devil's-advocate reasoning and taught such to their next-of-kin, like a game of Chinese Whispers (or Telephone), until the only thing that remained constant was "pure Wizard families good, muggleborn bad".

Whether or not Slytherin personally believed in it, he certainly started it. Blood purists, including Malfoy and Voldemort, both look to his example.

#+begin_quote

"He believed that magical learning should be kept within all magic families." That's blood, as in bloodlines. Blood purists don't believe that there's /actual/ mud in Muggleborns' veins, just that it's inferior to their own blood.

**** Given the profound importance of blood in the very literal sense in HP, I disagree that you can handwave Binns explicitly /not/ mentioning blood in relation to Slytherin. In particular, blood purists do believe the blood is dirty and tainted,

#+begin_quote
  “It's a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out.”
#+end_quote

(CoS ditto)

which is not at all what Slytherin argued, according to Binns. His were practical arguments -- they said nothing about being better wizards, for instance, they simply argued with trustworthieness. Which, I mean, the difference is obvious -- according to everything we know, purebloods aren't better wizards, so that stance is nonsense, whereas Muggleborn students back then posing a security risk is a serious argument that needs to be considered.

.

That aside, though, obviously everyone championing blood purity today points to Slytherin. It's clear by Draco's reaction to the Chamber opening. "Starting", for me, indicates an active intention, however, and I don't see that in Salazar Slytherin in Canon, at least as far as the books are concerned. If you wanted to make that case, your best bet is Pottermore. The header notes:

#+begin_quote
  The term ‘pure-blood' refers to a family or individual without Muggle (non-magic) blood. The concept is generally associated with Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, whose aversion to teaching anybody of Muggle parentage eventually led to a breach with his three fellow founders, and his resignation from the school.
#+end_quote

which is just weasely enough ("generally associated") to leave an out, and notably, again, the word blood is not repeated w.r.t. Slytherin in the main text:

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin's discrimination on the basis of parentage was considered an unusual and misguided view by the majority of wizards at the time.
#+end_quote

More relevant, IMO, is the following passage:

#+begin_quote
  Magical opinion underwent something of a shift after the International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. [...] Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers.
#+end_quote

So if I were to use the word "start", it'd be in reference to the people of the 1700s, because until then, if anyone /did/ try to start something, it apparently was a pretty big failure.

That is an insult. If I call someone a knucklehead, it doesn't mean that I literally believe that his head is a finger joint. If I call someone an asshat, I don't actually think that he perches on top of buttocks to provide shade and decoration. Ron literally says "Dirty blood, see. Common blood." He means that it's common, and they call common blood dirty as an insult. Their blood is common because their families are not wizards, the elite.

#+begin_quote

Again, families /are/ your blood when you're speaking in this context. The words are synonymous and used interchangeably.

Sure. If you want to define "start" that way, I'm just going to disagree that it's something a priori negative or something that can be held against him, as Ron clearly does. He appropriates blame -- Slytherin wouldn't be able to be blamed for it, not when it happened 700 years later, and can be argued to be a misrepresentation on top of it.

As for the rest, no, for the reasons I already stated -- not in the particular case of "blood". However,

#+begin_quote
  ...That /is/ a negative judgement, which is echoed throughout canon.
#+end_quote

When did I ever start talking about positive (or negative) judgements? o.O All I said is it wasn't "evil" -- and that it was a /reasonable opinion/. Which I define as something that comes with an argument that has merits, as opposed to something that comes with made-up nonsense arguments. The Pottermore excerpt adds a few of the latter, and OTTOMH, Lucius reprimands Draco in Borgin & Burkes for not being upset enough about getting beaten by a Muggleborn in school, which I reverse-engineer to mean purebloods (according to the doctrine) are better wizards.

And all that entirely aside, mind that Slytherin's arguments have been made less persuasive by time, so even ignoring that it wasn't (according to Pottermore, anyway) even found to be a convincing opinion back in his days, it's even less convincing now.

******** No, it's not. Let's just get Godwin's Law out of the way- is it racist for Jewish parents hiding in an attic during WWII to not let their kid's German friend come hang out with them? Because, guess what, the Muggles of the time period were attempting to kill all the Witches and Wizards they could find in much the same way. It's not racist to be cautious when you're being hunted down and killed for what you were born as.

As for how it led to the pure-blood propaganda later on, it's not the same arguments being made. Let's take his actual arguments and apply them to modern times. "Muggles are hunting down witches and wizards and trying to kill them. We shouldn't teach Muggle-borns because if their families find out they might try to kill us, or might let it slip to someone they know who wants to kill us." Due to the Statute of Secrecy, and the fact that witch-burnings and whatnot are things of the past, this argument doesn't work. Since that was Slytherin's main concern with teaching Muggle-borns, he would clearly have nothing against teaching them in the modern day when his concerns are no longer relevant. Whereas the blood purists took this and warped it into Muggle-borns being beneath them, muddying-up their bloodlines when they marry into "proper" wizarding families. It's not the same at all, even if they were initially inspired by Slytherin (or, more likely, purposefully twisted his words to fit their agenda, like so many people do in the real world).

WoG is that next to zero wizards were killed by Muggles, so not comparable at all. And /yes/, it is racist, because he wasn't barring Muggles, he was barring magical kids with Muggle parentage. If you were right about the Muggles killing wizards, then Slytherin would be dooming Muggleborns to be murdered by Muggles since they wouldn't know how to control their magic. You know, the magic that makes it basically impossible for Muggles to find or subdue a trained wizard.

Yes, which is likely why it was such a strong point of debate between himself and the other founders. He didn't want to risk any of their secrets getting out to the Muggles, at the risk of Muggle-borns being harmed by the Muggles. No one said he was 100% right, just that he doesn't seem to actually be a blood-purist and was more about calculated risks vs sacrifices.

#+begin_quote

Technically yes, but also no. Muggle are far more powerful now than they were then, that much is true. However, they also aren't actively trying to kill wizards anymore. It doesn't matter how strong a faction is, if the weaker one is actively trying to kill you and the stronger one is ignoring you/doesn't know you exist, the weaker one is much more of a threat. Keep in mind that the Statute of Secrecy and the Obliviation Spell weren't around in Slytherin's time. Wizards have made a huge amount of progress in separating the Muggle and Magical worlds, and keeping themselves hidden and unknown from the modern Muggles.

And yet, we have no idea why Slytherin left the Basilisk in the school. It could have been for that, sure. It also could have just been to protect the school in times of need. It could have been his pet that he left behind for whatever reason. He might have left it to attack the other founders when he returned to take over the school, but then he died before he returned. Hell, it could have even been placed there by one of his descendants and the only part he actually was responsible for was the creation of the Chamber (even that could have been done by a descendant and just attributed to him). Could could could. Point is we don't actually know. All we know is that Slytherin seems to have created a secret chamber, left a Basilisk there, and Voldemort decided to use that Basilisk to attack the Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. We don't have enough i formation to actually make a decision on what he's responsible for nor his reasons why.

What do you think a racist is? They all have """good""" reasons for why their culture is threatened. "Despite making up 13% of the population, black Americans commit more than 50% of violent crime" is literally a meme about such things because racists spout it so often. If Slytherin cared, there are dozens of options ranging from using magic to compel secrecy (making Hogwarts Unplottable, Muggle-Repelling Charms, using a Fidelius Charm, Hermione's curse on the Dumbledore's Army membership list, etc.) to just interviewing Muggles and figuring out which of them would be trustworthy. Hell, if you're talking options preferable to murder, just Memory Charm the kid, their parents, and the undertaker. "Oops, Timmy fell off a cliff."

The legend of the Chamber of Secrets was that he left it there to cleanse the school of Muggleborns. It's a snake that murders whatever it sees. It's pretty clear that he left it there to murder things, and the reason the legend gives for it is to kill Muggleborns. Considering that the legend was correct in its other particulars, I'm going to need strong proof that it wasn't correct in his motives before I doubt it.

If it helps you, assuming the numbers are true (I don't have your crime statistics off-hand), it's also a reasonable (in the way I defined above) argument. As opposed to asserting black Americans are less intelligent or the causes of deseases, for instance.

You are simply confusing reason and morality. Everyone should be able to agree something is True, assuming it is. Not everyone will agree it is Right. In that sense, the former is objective, and that's the advantage in discussions. Call Slytherin racist, by all means. I'm not bothered. A label and -isms should never get in the way of examining the merits of an argument. Morals do have a place in decision-making, but they're not the be-all, end-all, and I wasn't discussing them.

************* They use that statistic to make judgement about the character of all black people (or, for slightly more clever racists, about black culture), even though it's a flawed argument. We're talking about whether or not Slytherin is racist. It is absolutely a question of morals, because if Slytherin is willing to write off all Muggleborns based on the actions of a few Muggles, then that is a moral failing that makes one racist. You can appeal to flawed logic like the 13%/15% argument or the idea that Muggles were murdering wizards by the dozen - even though that is nowhere in the text, and /literally every pureblood would be talking about it if it were the case in-universe/ - but that doesn't change the fact that whether or not one is racist is a moral question, not a logical one. Purebloods think that another race is inherently inferior. They are racist. Slytherin thought Muggleborns were inherently untrustworthy and ought to be killed. He is a racist. That is /absolutely/ what we're discussing.

Salazar was a racist all right, but as a Basque, the natural target of his spite was the /Franks/. And who conquers most of Hogwarts catchment area in 1066? A Frankish Duke (Salazar doesn't care for this whole 'Norseman' distinction, it croaks like a frog and hops like a frog as far as he's concerned) and his rabble of henchmen and hirelings, who proceed to impertinently grant themselves titles of nobility and generally put on airs.

That's why he flounced: he decided to retire rather than educate Frankish brats. Including the get of one Armand Malfoy, who he /particularly/ loathed.

Merlin is reported to have been a Slytherin student of Hogwarts and the Arthurian legends are stemming from the period in time between the Roman withdrawal from Briton and the Anglo-Saxon invasions. It would make a lot of sense if the Roman wizards were conducting an island wide hunt of Briton Druids.

*** ... This is so close (although not quite) to the fic I'm writing, where the Bloody Baron is the first Norman to come to Hogwarts after the conquest. There, though, it's Godric, close friend and confidante of King Harold, who has particular feelings about the conquest - Salazar sees it as more of an opportunity for wizards to gain more political power.

** The problem here is that Slytherin wasn't really interested in Blood Purity. His problem with the other founders was over his fondness of Blood Pudding. None of the rest of them liked it, and the students wouldn't eat it, which lead to fights over the waste.

Until finally, Salazars just said "Screw you guys, I'm going home!"

** I really like the take the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of A Linear Circle]] did on Salazar. Well, on all the Founders, honestly. Mild spoilers ahead:

Salazar did not mean muggleborns weren't welcome at Hogwarts, but anyone non-magical should be banned from the school to ensure the safety of the students. This ties into the canon where the Statue of Secrecy was only enacted in 1692, if I recall the year correctly, so in the 11th century everyone knows magic and wizards are real, but people are already starting to get more wary of magic.

** It seems in canon that Voldemort and Salazar Slytherin are seem as practically identical in evilness by many of the characters. However, apart from the points already mentioned there are a couple of things we know about Slytherin which I don't think support this view. Firstly, the other three founders were perfectly willing to set up a school with him, which suggests that they must have presumably got on well with him and thought he was okay. And also, when there was that disagreement over muggleborns, Slytherin chose to leave. He did not harm the other founders or force them to do as he wanted, and after he left they allowed the school to retain Slytherin as one of its houses which suggests that despite the quarrel they did still have some level of respect for each other. When Voldemort disagrees with people then it doesn't tend to lead to him just going away!

*** I agree with you. I think despite the Founders coming from different areas across the country, they seem to be a righty knit group. While they considered Salazar to be dark, maybe that necessarily didn't meant being evil? Their friendship might have been restored later in the years, but it might not have been recorded or known among people, or one of them might have died young before the four of them got back together.

** I've never really got this sort of historical retconing for this. I think he was meant to be a pretty straightforward example of someone embodying Pureblood prejudice. He distrusted Muggles and so didn't want to accept their magical children into Hogwarts because he extended his distrust/dislike onto them. I'm not sure, realistically, that works. Banning them from Hogwarts wouldn't make their magic go away. Presumably, from what we know, they would just continue to have accidental magic, which would probably be way more obvious to muggles. I get AUs, obviously, but I think in canon he was meant to be a straightforward bigot. There's a reason Voldemort idolises him

Well, yes. But banning them from Hogwarts makes their knowledge of a school for witchcraft go away, plus avoids teaching children something that might later be used against those that taught them. When Binns mentions "trustworthiness" as Slytherin's issue, those are the points that come to my mind. It's an argument that needs to be examined on its merits, IMO (as opposed to "blood purity", in particular).

What Slytherin was /meant/ to be ... I give Rowling enough credit to be able to have created something that's ambiguous or later co-opted by others for their own purposes, personally. Binns lesson on Slytherin is aggressively neutral.

** Okay, what I'm going to say right now is something I've been thinking as of lately, so it's pretty much a rushed headcanon with no backing up whatsoever, but bear it with me.

Salazar knew muggleborns were going to slave magic with their mindset, as magic has much more freedom and power back in the day. Magic is, after all, a sentient being. It knows what wizards believe, what they feel and think. For example, the Cruciatus curse. Magic knows when it's done without a real intent, so it's doesn't work unless a wizard truly mean it. This can be applied to many things, such as the very concept of magic. What it can or not is actually dictated by wizards. Back then, you could actually make food purely by magic, until muggleborns came and thought "that shouldn't be possible" and then, it didn't.

Magic fits what wizards believe because the limitations are made by humans themselves. The more time passes, the more limitations exists for magic. Salazar, a great wizards, saw this each time big floods of muggleborns came into the wizard world. Their narrow minds and beliefs were killing magic, but the other founders didn't care. They saw it as a way to regulate things.

I could explain more but I feel like it would need to reorganize my thoughts before typing it. Again, this is my headcanon for the magic system. I believe magic is pretty much life itself, and it's shaped by the thoughts and wishes of people.

*** That sounds like an interesting idea, but instead of fellatioing Salazar as this brave defender of magic I think it'd be more reasonable to state that the Founders were sound in their decisions as well. It adds more complexity to the situation. Maybe back then due to a more limited population of magic wielders it was possible to make stuff like food through just intention, but it was also possible to use magic more destructively with lone wizards being able to wipe out entire kingdoms and being the cause behind several of the more apocalyptic events in muggle history like the Black Death.

The Founders would be open to Muggleborns because they don't believe such a small population should hold so much power without the proper checks and balances, which is what I think you meant by them using MB to regulate magic.

** I read one story involving the Founders where Slytherin was anti-muggle, but no problems with muggleborns, for the exact reason you state: witch burnings.

In the story he references muggleborns who would apprentice themselves for months, leave and then return with a mob to slaughter their master and fellow apprentides. He proposed having a separate school for muggleborns so they couldn't compromise Hogwarts. He changed his mind and welcomed them.

It's called "Strange Visitors From Another Century" and is being updated agonizingly slowly, but I like it.

** It might have something to do with the way of life the average muggle had at the time. Illiteracy, low-iq, poor hygiene, and not understanding basic sciences (like medicine) and decrying them as witchcraft. If they suddenly learned about an entire community of magicals then they were most likely to get their fellow farmers, knights, and popes to come burn them all for witchcraft.

** One story I read had it that at the time of the founders there was only one Muggleborn, not literally born of the muggles but he was called that because he hung out with them a bunch and had grown up with them. This guy was super sketchy and Slytherin didn't trust him anywhere near his students. Hence, “Slytherin didn't want to let The Muggleborn into Hogwarts.”

My headcanon is that at the time most muggleborns had been raised by their magic hating parents and thus had one of two reactions.

1) Not go to Hogwarts

2) Go to Hogwarts for nefarious purposes

If at this time they still only went to the kids at 11 then telling the kids and their parents and leaving them there (even with their magic bound) was sure to get them tortured to death.

The memory charm wasn't going to be invented for another ~500 years, so if the children weren't taken to Hogwarts they and their parents had knowledge of the magic they hated which could be used against the wizards.

Finally, suppose you and your family had the ability to fly, and as far as you know you're the only ones. Then some random guy get's it, and you don't know why. I would be very suspicious of that, how did it happen, and why?

** I just finished reading 'The Venom Peddler' which had an interesting take on Salazar.

TL;DR - the reason he disliked teaching mughleborns, was more because christian teachings made them terrified of their own powers, which was something he had to get around and deal with, before they could, or would learn. In the end, he ended up mind-blasting the knowledge out of their heads. Their families were also a risk to deal with, due to indoctrination.

Wouldn't that just condemn them to being burned alive? If muggleborns stayed with their muggle families and were found doing accidental magic, they'd be killed.

If you want to imbue Slytherin with an "extreme muggle prejudice" that doesn't involve hating muggles, you could say that he believed wizards should create something that detects magic in muggleborns (like in canon) and then have wizards go and take the kids from their families and adopt them into magical families. He left the Basilisk in the chamber, not for cleansing the school of muggleborns, but to kill the muggles if they ever breached the castle's protections.

Muggles and muggleborn really ‘were' unwashed peasants that didn't know how to read or write.

It wouldn't be until atleast the first World War that there was even a debate about who was more advanced, and the statute would remain immutable until atleast the year 2000. When you can hide an entire world from a civilization, without even really trying, you don't think that much of them and their ‘advancement'.
