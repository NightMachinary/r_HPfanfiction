I'm essentially looking for fics where either Harry or both Harry and Draco travel back in time to, like, first-year or something and they have to redo all their time at Hogwarts. I'd also prefer it if they were together, as per the use of the term "Drarry." I'm also pretty open for them going to the Marauda era or any of their years at Hogwarts.

Thank you! (And yes, I'll be posting this on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]])
