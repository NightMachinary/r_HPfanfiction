Dragon Thieves:

Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Ron slowly made their way towards the dragon reserve. Ron tossed a key forward and Harry caught it easily, sliding it into the gate quickly. It belonged to Charlie and the youngest male Weasley had borrowed it while having lunch with his brother earlier in the day.

All four, wearing black muggle clothing, slipped through the reserve's staff housing, only slowing long enough for Harry to hide the key outside one of Charlie's coworker's huts.

With the key issue dealt with, the four made their way as stealthily as possible to their target, a Hebridean Black's cage. It was to be moved back to Scotland in the morning. Harry and his allies aimed to disrupt that plan.

As they approached, Hermione began whispering instructions.

Harry nodded and began casting. He was removing his scent, lightening his body, and disillusioning himself along with a handful of other spells to help protect himself.

Neville finished assembling a kite shield and held it and the sword of Gryffindor for Harry as Ron closed his eye and beseeched every deity he could think of for this to work.

The plan was insane. Foolhardy. Most likely unworkable. But it was all they had.

An accident in Dumbledore's office in third year had Harry realize something. While holding a baby Fawkes, he had answered a question the headmaster had directed at him. Baby Fawkes had opened his mouth and the spell Harry had said hit him in the face, turning his skin completely transparent.

The Headmaster had been stupefied by the event and horrified. A week later, he told Harry that he had tried the same thing with Fawkes and found he could also use the bird to cast spells. "If you want an adult phoenix to try to scratch your eyes out, I suggest you try casting a transfiguration spell while holding one. I transfigured his beak into a banana."

That had set Harry to laughing once he was assured that Fawkes was not injured.

And he had forgotten about it until Hermione was reading the Bard's tales and mentioned a story that had an event like Harry and Dumbledore's. A snake held by wizard had worked as a wand.

He had related the story and Hermione came up with the plan: harry's 'new' wand, taken from a Snatcher and worked surprisingly well for him, had a heartstring from a Hebridean Black. Since Fawkes was unavailable and Ollivander no longer able to craft wands, it was time to attempt something that might be considered a war crime.

Hermione removed the control collar from her jacket and handed it over. Harry wore it like an oversized bangle on his shield arm as Ron opened the cage.

"Don't die," he whispered.

"Same to you."

They bumped fists then Harry made his way slowly into the cage, the kite shield expanding to help protect him should the dragon awaken too early.

Harry froze when the dragon shifted. When it didn't move, he continued forward, his wand in hand, the sword on the back of the shield, easily at hand.

He inched forward, moving only when he breathed in.

Finally he was within range of the beast's head. The control collar was grasped by his right hand and flicked open so he could remove it then he dashed forward. The collar was forced around the mandible horn of the beast, awakening it.

Harry's wand was back in his hand as he whispered, "Servum facio!"

The magic of the collar increased the power of Harry's spell, causing his mind to dominate the mind of the dragon. In for a penny, in for a pound, Harry thought. He was now at eleven events worthy of Azkaban, even if Voldemort didn't control the Ministry.

Harry dropped the shield as the dragon bowed to his will, leaning down to allow Neville and Ron to move forward with the saddles.

The four were on the dragon and away before the first light awoke the roosters that would awaken the dragon handlers who would find the night watch stunned, bound in ropes, and gagged.

~•~

Harry tugged the reins, turning the great beast Northwards, heading towards the fires burning on the horizon, set by Hermione, guiding him every closer to Hogwarts.

The blue fire came into view within an hour of flight. That was his immediate goal. Directly northward was his target.

As he flew over the flames, he felt vaguely guilty to see Ron had used the Shrieking Shack as the kindling. If anyone has the right to destroy that, it's you, Harry thought to himself.

His third cue to his target was a green aura, invisible to all but him. Neville had gotten to within fifty metres of Riddle's position, hidden by Harry's cloak.

Harry aimed the dragon towards the way Neville's aura pointed and, breathing in deeply, placed his hand on the back of the dragon's head and whispered, "Expelliarmus." ~•~

Voldemort could feel something invade the environs of Hogwarts. But the immense size and magic had him assuming another of his Giant servants had made its way to the school.

It was his last thought as a flaming expelliarmus exploded him, Nagini, and a fifty foot circle of ground along with a dozen of his followers.

~•~

Harry blinked as he caught the wand. "Shouldn't this have been destroy--holy shit, this is the Elder Wand‽"


** Now I'm thinking of a death eater trying the same thing and then getting killed as a storm of wands from the crowd he attacked are returned to him like heat seeking high speed debris and run him through.

** Out of curiosity, what are the 11 events worthy of Azkaban? Illegal spell, dragon theft, assault on several dragon handlers, illegal artifact...what are the rest?

...And, uh, what would happen if he tried casting Aguamenti using a dragon?

*** There's treason, but I'm guessing they discounted that because it's only against Volde's government. It doesn't specify the time period, so there's the use of the Unforgivables - he cast the cruciatus, and imperius twice. So, that's three more counts. Robbing Gringotts and stealing that dragon might also count. Breaking into the Ministry, attacking several Ministry workers, and stealing their identity might count.

**** Those spells were legal at the time he cast them, though his target of a death eater was likely worth a crime in that government. Also, takes place seventh year.

Besides that, though, I absolutely love it. How did the Trio get their hands on such a collar?
