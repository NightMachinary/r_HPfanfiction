[[/u/Viseryon-90][u/Viseryon-90]] had a pretty awesome thought:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9h5xw0/what_would_have_happened_if_the_marauders_and_tom/][What would have happened if the Marauders and Tom Riddle were at school together?]]

Naturally, I now need a fanfic about this, and so does [[/u/Worlds_Okayist_Wife][u/Worlds_Okayist_Wife]].

Does anyone know of one?


** This would be awesome! I would also like to read this

** So Marauders in the 40s, or Tom in the 70s?
