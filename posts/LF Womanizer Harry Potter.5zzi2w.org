Looking for a Harry that was like Sirius is portrayed in his Hogwarts years, not blushing / stuttering like a fool infront of a girl instead he's capable of bringing up witty lines.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

** linkffn(harry potter and the veela nation)

It's highly AU where there was no Voldemort and starts with Harry as an adult and his dad as the minister. It's almost good. I'm having trouble pinning it down, but something about the way it's written just isn't quite engaging. Worth checking out.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
