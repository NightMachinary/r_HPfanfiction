What you're dealing with here is a vampire!Hermione and vampire!Harry fic with both of them going down darker paths.

Since I'm about to finish chapter 5 and am already working on chapter 6, I thought I'd get some feedback and criticism, suggestions or maybe just a nice little thumbs up (or down, if this isn't your cup of tea).

Alright, have fun reading, I surely had fun writing.

  The Bloodmoon rises
#+end_quote

You may want to correct the title's capitalization--miscapitalized titles are a pretty big red flag when I'm browsing stories.

The English of the story itself seems pretty good overall. However:

#+begin_quote
  Three weeks have come and gone since the disaster at the Ministry.

  How far the Varangian Guard has fallen.
#+end_quote

Both of these should be in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_perfect][the /pluperfect/ tense,]] /not/ the perfect tense, since you're talking about something that happened /before/ the events of the story, which /already/ lives in the past and perfect tenses.

#+begin_quote
  "I know what Dumbledore said, thank you, Nymphadora." he spat back with venom.

  "I'll be down in a minute." he said before the young woman could order him once more.
#+end_quote

[[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/quotation.htm][There should be a comma, not a period, at the end of these and similar quotations.]]

The story seems very interesting as well.

*** Thank you very much.

Its always hard to get the grammar right as someone who doesn't use the language daily. Some things that German grammar allows are a no go in English and vice versa.

I'm going through it myself when I have time for it.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

** Like I said on an earlier thread, it's an interesting premise, but while I generally like fic that takes a very generous interpretation of Hermione's talents and abilities, I am not sure I like the idea of giving Hermione an "inherited" title in the first place --- she should have to earn it or fight for it. I'd much rather see Hermione be turned, become integrated into the vampire society, decides that it's too brutal and chaotic, and then decide that it's her job to bring order to it, necessitating a takeover. To have all Dark creatures instinctively obey her strikes me as clashing with the self-made ethos she has otherwise.

On Harry's side, I think that the views of Ron and Dumbledore are very uncharitable. Ron can get jealous, but he also stood between Harry and a mass-murderer (he thought) on a broken leg and proclaimed that said mass-murderer would have to kill him first. I think that Harry's journey would have been far more interesting and conflicted had Ron been a loyal friend: keeping him company (sneaking past Molly, if necessary), playing exploding snap, etc.. Similarly, while it's good that Dumbledore is shown as a very powerful wizard, having him be so ill-informed or insensitive to Harry's situation borders on bashing. Add to that that in canon, vampires are, actually, a part of wizarding society --- Slughorn invites one to one of his parties at Hogwarts --- and you're really overdoing it.

Back to Hermione, the whole "Eater" aspect seems like goriness and edginess for its own sake, and, also, where's /Hermione/ in all this? She has a fairly strong and well-defined personality, tastes, and interests. You apparently have her evading a massive manhunt while leaving behind a very easy trail. How does she manage that? We aren't shown.

Lastly, there's the whole thing with vampires treating humans --- and wizards in particular --- as prey. It's your AU, but in canon, at least, wizards with wands /are/ the apex predators, and vampires and werewolves alike exist at their sufferance. German werewolves should be afraid to offend Lupin, because if he gets back with a negative report, Dumbledore, Moody, and a few others would pay them a visit.

*** First of all, and once again: thanks for the feedback.

I'd like to respond to your comment, but that would require some *spoilers*. So, yea. Proceed with caution and all that fuzz.

It has always been my idea that the title and therefore the follower are inherited. But she still has to earn. People expect a second Vlad the Impaler and the following disappointment when they see through the initial awe will be her test. The next chapter will already hint to that.

While I'm completely with you regarding Ron, I have to say that I do have plans for Dumbledore and, as far as I can judge myself, I think I've done a good job building up for a later reveal. Just rest assured that he knew almost everything and just the bit that he didn't know came to bite him in the arse.

Ron would have been a nice addition and some sort of anchor for Harry. I have to admit, to my shame, that its probably just because of my own aversion towards the character of Ron that I didn't implement him and merely stated with a few sentences that he's out of the game. My stories tend to bash Ron Weasley, its something that just happens by itself, so I decided to get rid of him before I could start my involuntary bashfest.

Regarding Vampires in my story, I could also argue that one vampire at a Slughorn party does not represent the entire vampire community. The Black Clan is, true to its human counterpart, a bunch of fanatics and, of course, they think themselves superior and name humans prey. That the reality is that modern wizards could easily roflstomp them is a different subject, but I think I brought some good hints (Moody using the Helios curse, and Dumbledore nearly killing them all with one chant). Eventually Harry will see whats what and make his decision, but before that Isla Black will have a lot of time to corrupt him.

The reason why Hermione is a Eater is to completely shut down every possibility of integrating her into human society. While Harry could, rather easily, find himself a donor, Hermione can not. You can't just donate an arm for her to nibble on. Where Hermione is in all that? Hidden beneath a bunch of primeval dark magic trying to take control of her. Obviously, that won't happen and later chapters will show her regain her senses. But it will leave her with the knowledge of what she did and what she could do. The reason why I didn't portray the manhunt is that I didn't like the chapter and just went for the third party perspective. That was maybe - probably a mistake. But I'm not an experienced writer and until you wrote it, I didn't think it was a problem.

As for the german werewolves. No, they are not afraid and shouldn't be. British werewolves are at the mercy of wizards, but the german packs are equally, in some instances even more powerful than the wizards of germany. In addition to that, they've developed a paranoid-fascist view towards wizards, thanks to Grindelwald and the way wizards treat werewolves in other nations. They're also highly militarized with a strict sense of hirarchy - the sole reason they're so untouchable. The only one they'd see as a real threat is Dumbledore and thats the only gamble they risk when they decide to not give out anything to Lupin, knowing that Dumbledore has bigger problems than a bunch of wolves ignoring territory.

Again, thanks for the feedback, and even if it doesn't sound like it, I made notes and will see to it that I clear up some points for my readers asap.

** The story seems really interesting, but you have a tendency towards wordiness. Sometimes cutting words can really help the flow of the writing. I would suggest finding a beta to read through and check for too-long sentences and complicated structures. Hope this helps :)

*** I'm afraid any beta would go spare. You may not believe it, but this is already cut down from how "wordy" it once was. I'm a sucker for complex sentence structures, thanks to my native language German, and love to play around with them. I try to keep that in check.

** I like it so far, put a follow on it and when it finishes (if it continues at this level), I'll be sure to favorite it. I actually have been looking for a vampire Hermione story for a while now. Really looking forward to a world ruled by countess Hermione :P

Edit: Harry had to come up for breath while swimming? Do Hermione and he have a heartbeat still too? I assume not from his comment about being surrounded by pumping hearts.
