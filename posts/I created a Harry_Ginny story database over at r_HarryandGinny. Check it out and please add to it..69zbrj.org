I've read pretty much every Harry/Ginny story there is and always get confused on what I read and what type of story it is. Rather than keep asking in this sub for recommendations, I created a thread over at [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] that categorizes the pairing by various different genres. If you enjoy stories with this pairing and want to recommend a fic you particularly like or a genre of the fic not listed, please add it to the post linked below. Also if you can please provide a very brief summary as well as any thoughts on why you liked it or even any issues you had with it.

** It doesn't make sense to make a new community / subreddit just for one pairing, and it really doesn't make sense to make a constantly updated thread for fics.

You should make a wiki page at [[/r/hpfanfiction/wiki][r/hpfanfiction/wiki]]! That way others can also contribute to the page, and it is easily accessible.

*** Well, that's like, your opinion, man.

But seriously...the subreddit exists so people who really like the pairing can have discussions on it and not feel like we're constantly bombarding the main [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] or this sub with posts about them. Also, the community is for those who really like the pairing and this prevents others who aren't fans from potentially derailing the discussions or otherwise force supporters of the pairing from constantly having to defend it.

I specifically created that thread because the wiki, while great, isn't organized by genre of fics, and honestly I'm not sure how I'd go about adding that feature to the existing wiki. Perhaps once the thread I created has run its course, if it ever does, I can try to import it to the wiki. Also, anyone can add to my thread just like they can add to the wiki.

**** That's not what [[/u/Psantium_]] is saying. This sub isn't very large or overly active so it doesn't make much sense to splinter it further. Anything discussed or shared there could be done here.
