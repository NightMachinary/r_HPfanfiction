I've just posted a fic on both ff. net and ao3. So far I've got one reviews on each site. The one I've got from ff.net demands to know why a person reacted that way and I think it's fairly obvious... if you don't skip lines, that is. And berates me for an open ending. AND THIS IS A GUEST REVIEWER.

Sorry, but I had to rant. This happens far too commonly on this site, but I don't know if I'm being extra sensitive and if I'm extra aware of these reviews for some reason but it annoys the hell out of me.


** I drifted away from ff.net because the reviews were often too aggressive/obviously personal. I find there's much better feedback on ao3.

** I think people on AO3 behave themselves in reviews over FF.net as AO3 is all about giving control to the author and if you get flamed the 'delete comment' option is right there so people don't bother being mean I've found.

** As a reader, I appreciate negative reviews, because they help me decide whether or not to read a fic. Not all negative reviews are worth listening to of course, but you can usually tell the difference between a complaint like 'why do you portray Ron as a good guy, when clearly he's a buffoon pretending to be Harry's friend' and something like 'this fic is riddled with spelling/grammatical errors'. I can see why unjustified negative reviews would be frustrating for an author though.

*** I appreciate criticism as long as people don't forget I do this thing for fun. This was mostly a case of this reader expecting a fic as if they'd paid for it. I was actually preparing an explanatory response, even though it soured my mood a bit, when I realized it was as guest review. Why do you even leave that review if I can't respond to it?

** So true! I wouldn't even get phased that much by harsh reviews, especially if they're respectfully worded, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I've had a bad review on ff.net, it has been a guest review.

Like, come on, if you're gonna leave a comment like that, at least log into your account so I can reply.

Don't feel bad about it, usually there are at least 5 great reviews for one bad one, so focus on those!

** The fact that reviews can be negative (and often are) is kinda part and parcel of the definition of what a review is:

#+begin_quote

  1. a formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary.

  2. a critical appraisal of a book, play, film, etc. published in a newspaper or magazine.
#+end_quote

The purpose of a review is not to make the author feel better; it is to communicate at a critical level whether or not the work is good.

Now, there are definitely good and bad ways to do criticism. Not all reviews are equal - there's a reason why being a reviewer is a /job/ in real life.

Stuff like "please make this Harry/Hermione instead of Harry/Ginny" - the expression of a purely subjective preference - is a pretty stupid review.

But I don't think an author's vision for a story (e.g. having an open ending) is immune from criticism. Indeed, I think the most meaningful and substantive literary criticism does not relate to the execution of an idea, but rather concerns the author's choices as to content. An author's vision for their story is the most fertile ground for critical discussion.

Cadmean Victory example:

#+begin_quote
  The author of Cadmean Victory would occasionally respond to reviews and would frequently miss this point. Whenever someone criticised the content decisions he made, his response was always to point to some part of his story where that story element was "explained".

  That response fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the criticism.

  The criticism was: "why would the author choose to make that part of the story in the first place?". The criticism was not: "that doesn't make sense within the story world".

  With respect to the latter, any author can justify something within their world, because they have complete ability to arbitrarily determine characters' beliefs, knowledge, personalities, plus how magic works, etc. An in-universe explanation can always be conjured up. But that doesn't make it good writing, because good writing is about a lot more than having in-universe explanations for things.

  For example, right at the beginning of the story, Harry immediately gets a significant upgrade from his canon intelligence, bookishness, and magical skill. Yes, of course you can justify it in-universe by saying he was like that all along and this is an AU (as the author did). But that doesn't explain the out-of-universe question: "why you would choose to declare your character as more skilled than canon rather than show them developing into someone who has more skill?".

  Developing a character's traits in the story is simply better writing than declaring them to the reader ex cathedra. That way, the reader sees where those character traits have come from and thereby understands the character on a deeper level. Where those traits are going to resolve conflict, such as ability with magic, then showing their development also helps them feel earned and thus the resolution of the conflict more satisfying.

  "I intended my characterisation to be shallow" is not a defence to having shallow characters.

  One more example: let's examine the author's decision to make Hermione much less intelligent, reasonable, loyal and kind than in canon, completely reneging on her friendship with Harry because he is doing better than her in classes.

  Sure, you can justify that in-universe with sufficient events and AU changes to her character. But again the question is: why would you want to? Why would you want to turn a reasonable, relatively 3D character into an antagonism machine that doesn't act like a human?

  Again, having characters who act like real people is simply superior writing to having characters who act as plot devices. "I intended for her to be an antagonist" is not a defence to the fact that your character acts in ways the reader does not find believable.

**** I think it's a two way street. The reader should understand that people have different levels of writing and should have realistic expectations in terms of quality and also accept the writer might not have the same interpretation of a character

But at the same time. The writer is still uploading their work onto a site where it can be read and criticized so they should be prepared. The fact that's it's fanfic shouldn't make them immune from criticism

A writer should still take some pride in their work. I really don't like that mentality of “ it's just fan fiction and I'm using a popular pairing so it will get good reviews anyway so I don't need to try or put effort in”

​

I think with the guest thing. They do it because they either cant log in or because they dont want backlash from the writer

​

I wonder if they maybe think you will answer their question in the authors note of the next chapter or on your profile ?

I have seen writers do that.

******* it's a oneshot, though. It doesn't actually matter that much I suppose. I think it comes down to this: this person left a review, with questions I could answer (why is this person this shocked and it's an open ending) but left it as a guest so it sounds demanding instead of confused/curious. It's not mean, but frustrating nevertheless. I sound like a whiny bitch and I'm actually regretting posting this since I would've forgot this already if I didnt lol

Hmm. I don't often +read+ write negative reviews, but I never hide behind guest accounts.

** I feel in my personal opinion it comes down to 2 things.

1. On ao3 things are actually tagged so it's super easy to know what you are getting into. Ffnet doesnt rlly have this so if there is some aspect I really really dont want to see I dont have warning. For ffnet the author has to go out of their way to warn ppl and ppl are more likely to read tags than authors notes.

2. Honestly this is just from my own life but I used ffnet a lot more when I was younger and much prefer ao3 now that I'm older. I'm just going to assume that the average ffnet user tends to be younger than the average ao3 user. Like it's easier to find fanfiction on a site literally called fanfiction so I atleast didnt hear about ao3 for several years after reading fanfic.

I'm sure there are other things it comes down to but imo those are big ones.

** Unpopular opinion incoming.

Firstly this has not been my experience.

Secondly I totally understand the guest account. Writers often forget that readers don't love their work at the same level as the author. As such they are much less forgiving of it. Even still they leave comments to let you know where or why you lost them. Which is crazy nice of them. Of they have a main account they use then pissed off authors who can't take critique spam them back for not liking a story.

Thirdly the "dont like dont read" mantra rarely works. We end up with those "why did Noone like my fic" post when the answer is its just bad writing. Without the feedback nobody will improve. Critism is an important part of the writing process, even if you think the review was unhelpful as long as its related to the story itself then it probably isn't.

** 1: By publishing your work, you open yourself up for criticism (and hate). There will be people who will dislike your work out there simply because there are so many readers out there.

2: Guest reviewers are not invested in the fandom and often just review to spew shit and troll. Why'd you care?

3: FFN is famous for its lack of checks and balances. The staff are slow, the rules might as well not exist, and plagiarism, spam and trolling reign - but it is a simple site with a lot of storage space and long history, so it provides a wider audience for those of strong will and high self-esteem.
