i'm looking for time travel fics where, even if its not the major feature, pureblood society and customs at least play a good role in the plot. i've read way too many fics where harry becomes a lord the day after he travels back in time, near the start of the story, and then it's never brought up again unless the author wants to show that harry has more power than another pureblood. i want to see him take his responsibility as a lord seriously. i'm fine with overpowered harry and slash, but i don't like angst and tragedy. thank you very much!


** Pureblood politics and lordship are central to the plot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Bellatrix is a psychopath who's been to Azkaban and back, and who whole-heartedly supports Harry Potter's nemesis. But was she always like this? When two spells at the Battle of Hogwarts combine, Harry is sent back in time to Bellatrix's Hogwarts, and becomes a Slytherin. How will Harry's travel through time change him? How will it change her?

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
