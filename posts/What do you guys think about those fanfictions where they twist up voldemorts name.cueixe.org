For some reason it really bugs me when characters disrespect voldemort. He was supposed to be a mass murderer! Someone who would kill you for almost no reason. And yet characters from the book could still call him "moldyshorts" or similar. Its unrealistic and it feels very OOC.

On top of that what does that say about all the people he killed. Thats like saying they are pathetic for being killed by someone called "moldyshorts".

You shouldnt praise him or be in awe of him but at least dont disrespect him to his face! Thats like...wrong...and suicidal. SIs and OCs that do this bug me even more because if a character from the book cant do it then what makes you so special that you can be braver than everyone else. Mary sues and OOC thats what this comes down to.

What do you guys think?

** I think it's fine to mock him. Widespread mockery means people take him less seriously, so he and his ideology have less power. See British propaganda against Napoleon or Hitler. It didn't take them seriously and give them due respect, it belittled them. We still think of Napoleon as the stereotpyical short angry guy.

But insults like moldyshorts are pretty lame. Which is fine, if you want your characters to be throwing out lame, childish insults. But if the character is supposed to be clever and charismatic, something better is required.

** Annoying when used repetitively in all situations. It can be ok if used in a joking manner. When an official Wizengamot is underway and edgy Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell is referring to people as Dumbledork and Moldyshorts is when I stop reading your fic (although I probably stopped reading after the first mention of Hadrian).

What I'm trying to say is that using nicknames is not showing your character to be funny or clever. Rather it shows them as immature petty and childish. Voldemort is immensely powerful, a mass murderer and was terrifying enough for nobody to speak his name a decade after his alleged death. Dumbledore is a powerful and respected wizard with high political and social standing as well as many academic feats to his name.

Stupid nicknames is not how normal people interact.

#+end_quote

Are you talking about the canon books, or fanfic?

In the book, there are several levels of Voldemort Euphemisms, and each of them defines what kind of personality the characters have. Most characters are too afraid of Voldemort to use his name, even characters who have no reason to be, like Hermione, who wasn't even brought up in the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry," she said timidly, "don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... we need to know what it's r-really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort."

  It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore calls Voldemort "Tom". Harry and Shacklebolt use "Voldemort". The Death Eaters and sympathizers call him "The Dark Lord". The only people in canon who mock Voldemort with name-calling are the Twins with the "You-No-Poo" stuff, and Peeves, who's like a ghost so he doesn't care about dying. The books are pretty consistent in establishing and telling us that Voldemort is scary and powerful, to the extent where it feels like JKR has oversold him when he dies of stupidity at the end of DH.

This is probably where the "Moldyshorts" stuff from fanon comes from, especially in SI fics. Too much meta knowledge, writing a story from the perspective of knowing everything and trying to optimize, and in effect, treating everyone (including the big boss, Lord V) as disposable NPC's. These kinds of stories aren't about immersing the reader in a character's mind, so you feel like you're living their life and experiences, but about video game-style speedrunning.

*** I was talking about book characters used in fanfics.

I actually thought that Hermione calling Voldemort "You Know Who" showed the maturity of her character in the books because it showed that she researched him and understood why he wasn't called by his name.

It really bugs me when someone who isnt Harry or Dumbledore use variations of Tom when speaking to him or about him unless they knew him before. Maybe hagrid i could see using it (or people from his school days) but he was such a a scardy cat I dont think it would suit his character.

** I see your point, but I also think that is the whole point of twisting his name up. I think it is meant to be disrespectful and keep people from being too afraid because fear is such a big tool of his and the death eaters.

It has been a while since I've read the books, but most wizards and witches were so afraid of Tom and the Death Eaters that no one fought back. The Death Eaters were a relatively small group and gained so much power due to fear tactics and bribery. How much easier would it have been if people fought back? Death Eater attacks could have ended with some of them in jail or holding cells if more people sent back stunners and body binds instead of running scared. But you can't expect people to fight back when they are terrified.

I think the derogatory names are often used as a counter to the fear tactics the Death Eaters use. Making fun of the name can make someone seem more human which is a direct counter to the death eaters and their masks and black robes. Tom and the death eaters do their best to project an image of being above death or even being agents of death. Something untouchable that can't be harmed. So people will feel powerless and like fighting would be pointless.

** The Twins called him “U No Poo” in Book 6. Peeves called him “moldy” after the Final Battle.

I have no problem with Voldemort's enemies calling him names in dialogues, but “moldyshorts” is getting repetitive. How about something more creative like “Dark Lord Tom”?

Using derogatory names in narratives is a big no-no for me.

I personally dislike “You Know Who” too. I mean just call him the Dark Lord if your characters want to reverential to him.

If u call him the dark lord u sound like a death eater as its too respectful.

If u call him "You know who" then ur a "coward" but it makes the most sense for people who experenced the first war, or at least understands what mass murder is, to call him that.

If u call him Voldemort like Harry and Dumbledore then u are brave but not everyone can be brave in a story or whats the point.

They also were told in East Germany and Soviet Russia. The danger of being subversive was high in those cases and still people dealt with fear by making jokes.

Now, I think this is what Rowling went for with the "U no poo" joke and I like it even though it is only mildy funny. I think I would enjoy stories where people use similarily subversive jokes. - Now, the name twisting feels somewhat juvenile to me and often is missing the mark, but I don't believe that people would never joke about the things they fear.

Don't get me wrong. I'm fine with confrontational scenes between characters. Just because Dumbledore is the greatest doesn't change it. But I also don't think it's realistic for kid Harry to stare down Dumbledore, demand a hundred things, and victoriously walk away from the mean Dumbledore.

I've read some alright bashing fics. Just sayn it's not realistic for pushover Dumbledore to let Harry (or anyone really) steamroll all over him. We're talking about the GOAT, the political leader, yadda yadda.

** I don't mind some mocking if it's in character and suits a scene's mood. What I don't like is when they do it all the time, 24/7, from beginning to end with zero breaks in between. That's when I get annoyed and click off.

** It definitely makes me cringe, Voldemort was literally terrifying, he tortured people when he was bored and could kill hundreds easily, it just feels eh.

** It's alright if Harry says it, because they're lovers and lovers tease each other.

At least in the fics I read.

** > For some reason it really bugs me when characters disrespect voldemort. He was supposed to be a mass murderer! Someone who would kill you for almost no reason. And yet characters from the book could still call him "moldyshorts" or similar. Its unrealistic and it feels very OOC.

You need to go and read about 1940s comedians and other music hall artists and what they said about Hitler. Or earlier about Napoleon.

Unfortunately it's finished now but there was a recent exhibition at the British Museum about dissent and there were some amazing items there where people were taking the piss something rotten about their own psychopathic leaders.

I agree that calling him Mouldyshorts is childish, but remember most of the characters are, errm, children. They're allowed to be childish. And going back to that 1940s humour, a lot of it was not exactly sophisticated. Plenty of name calling and scatology.
