Warning: ABANDONED

The fanfiction linkffn(Oh, you didn't know? Yeah, he's awesome) is a hilarious Crackfic that I loved loved loved. It is only 7 chapters and abandoned, sadly, but I was laughing the entire time! Making me laugh is very hard.

I have been recommending this everywhere, but I want it to get some more luv. Highly recommended if you want a laugh! Plus, for those who dislike character bashing, there's barely any of it! Well, mild, anyways, but no Ron and Hermione bashing anyways...

I just want to warn people that it does feature a smart Harry, but not ridiculously. He's a smart-alec...Anyways. Thanks if you read it!

Discuss down below if you enjoyed it!

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.

** That recommendation killed me. I think my friends think I'm crazy for cackling to myself at random intervals now.
