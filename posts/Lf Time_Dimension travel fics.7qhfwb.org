** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh) is my favorite time-travel fic. While it's fem!Harry, it's not the typical fem!Harry. It excels in worldbuilding and creating believable characters, while also telling a story. While it isn't complete, the first arc is complete, and can be read as a standalone. You can just stop reading when the "Journey for the mind" part begins.

linkffn(Oh god not again!) is a fic that you'll probably like, if you like nonjon. While it doesn't have too much worldbuilding, character development or story, it's plain fun to read.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Harry just really doesn't want in.
