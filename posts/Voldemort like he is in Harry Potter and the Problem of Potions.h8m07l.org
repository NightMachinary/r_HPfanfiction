In problem of potions he invades Harry's mind to be sarcastic and strangely helpful. Any fics like that?

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

*** On the one hand, it's been 8 years since it updated and is almost certainly dead/abandoned.

On the other hand, Voldemort gives Harry /the talk./

  We begin, Mr. Potter, with the female genitalia. Repeat after me: vagina.

I also like Harry's Marauder nickname in this one, as cliche as the general idea is by now.

Voldemort's waging war for very different reasons than in canon, actually has good relationships with several death eaters, and is attempting to win Harry over by showing up out of nowhere to keep him company while he's at Privet Drive.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort
