Is anyone else occasionally getting ads on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] that takeover the whole page? The X button on them also doesn't work.


** Install uBlock and do away with ads

**** The app gets annoying when it doesn't save your place in a story sometimes though.

** I disable JavaScript when I use ffn. The only feature that needs it is the jump to a chapter feature if I remember correctly. The only issue is if you go to another page you might need to turn it back on. I personally don't mind the adds at the top and bottom of the page or before loading a page what I hate are the ones in the middle of the chapter...

**** Which is truly a tragedy. I tend to PM authors I like and tell them they should look into crossposting to ao3 as well as FFN, but yeah. FFN admins need to buck up.
