** I linked linkffn(Gillyflower, Heliotrope and Hemlock) in the other thread about Sirius time-travel fics, but it belongs here as well. Slash, Sirius/Harry, but it ended before it really got going.

  In another dimension, in a past that didn't quite happen, three friends are forced to flee a world of ashes and death to hunt down the only person able to save them. Will Harry Potter once again be forced to become The Boy Who Saved? Or will he sink into darkness as the atrocities of the other world crush him in despair? Slash; HP/SB. M for later sexual content. Literally AU.

** I know of only one, and it's pretty bittersweet, and not exactly finished. But it is well-written.

However, it is actually the sequel to a previous Peggy Sue fic featuring George. So, I'll link them both.
