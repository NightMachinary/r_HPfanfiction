I figure it's relevant, plus y'know, it's always fun to read about people getting justice'd.

Slash, crossovers and bashing are okay. Please no pottercest, genderbending, romance/smut driven plots, mpreg or harems (Unless it's crack)


** Partially Kissed Hero, linkffn(4240771), has a lot of "evil Dumbledore" bashing. A rather over-the-top amount, really.

*** Over-the-top, yes. Best evil dumbledore I've ever seen? Also yes. I loved just how much of an advantage Harry had to have to get even a step ahead of him, and how even dosed with bad luck, he still had way more political clout than Harry could ever hope to get in time to do anything. It was incredibly well written as a realistic struggle against a century old threat and a game changer who is honestly running mostly on luck.
