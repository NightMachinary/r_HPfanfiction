From either Harry or Severus POV, is there a fic where Dumbledore character stayed true to canon, but more explored? It doesn't matter whether it is an AU or canon compliant, I am tired of Dumbledore bashing or Dumbledore caricature.

I want to see Dumbledore as a leader he is, and as a human he is, with his own failings and mistakes.

Preferably completed or updated in 6 months.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

I think that he had a goal oriented mind. He wanted to remove Voldemort from picture and Harry was destined to cross path. He just (ab)used the fate's game. Otherwise why would master of elder wand hide like a pansy and let an 11 year old fight against darkest lord in history.

#+end_quote

You mean outside of orchestrating a series of events to happen in which Harry could SURVIVE the removal of the Horcrux?

People forget that JK alluded to Dumbledore's /triumphant/ look on his face when it was reported to him exactly what Voldemort did to Harry in the graveyard. It was /at that moment/ that Dumbledore knew Harry would come out of everything /ALIVE/.

#+begin_quote
  He had every prominent post available in Magical world.
#+end_quote

You mean he had a job as a court moderator, ambassador to what is essentially the U.N. and a school principal? He was certainly a powerful and influential individual, but people inflate those positions way too fucking much. Does anyone in this group even know the name of the U.S./U.K. ambassadors to the U.N. off the top of their heads? I sure as shit don't.

#+begin_quote
  He had minister of magic wrapped around his fingers.
#+end_quote

Very obviously not. His relationship with Cornelius was always, at best, on a thin line. He may have come to Dumbledore for advice, but the /moment/ Dumbledore said something that Cornelius didn't like, that power was used to strip Dumbledore of everything.

#+begin_quote
  Yet! He left someone rot in prison for ever.
#+end_quote

What? How much fanfiction have you been reading that makes you think Dumbledore could have changed that? The Wizengamot, while he was an important part of it, had absolutely no deference to Dumbledore. He just presided over cases - moderated them. He didn't even /get a fucking vote/. He served at the pleasure of the Wizengamot but was not, in fact, /part of it/.

#+begin_quote
  And when that man was proven innocent he still didn't do anything.
#+end_quote

You mean besides casting the Fidelius and being the secret keeper for his hideout? Sure, Sirius didn't like it, but he was /safe/.

#+begin_quote
  Instead he asked two kids to assist an officially declared criminal run away.
#+end_quote

That may have had something to do with the fact that Hermione had a /time turner/ which would /allow them to do so/ as well as /keep an alibi/ because, Oh, I dunno, Dumbledore /defending the man/ against the Minister /AND THEN THAT MAN GOING FREE/ would probably have made things a bit obvious if Dumbledore hadn't been with him to secure his own alibi.

#+begin_quote
  He wasn't even surprised when Harry told him that Sirius was innocent.
#+end_quote

Have you been reading fanfiction so long you forgot that Harry never told Dumbledore that Sirius was innocent? Harry woke up in the Hospital Wing after Dumbledore had already been informed of what happened. The narration for Dumbledore being told is never mentioned in the books or movies.

#+begin_quote
  Otherwise why would master of elder wand hide like a pansy and let an 11 year old fight against darkest lord in history.
#+end_quote

You mean besides all the shit that Dumbledore did to keep Harry safe? All the shit he did to fight against Voldemort? All the battles Dumbledore had with him to keep him at bay? Leading a resistance group against Voldemort and the Death Eaters? All that stuff?

Let's not forget that the Elder Wand isn't infallible. That's /another/ fanfiction trope that you've fallen into.

I mean, Jesus man, Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald in /single combat/ while the latter had the Elder Wand.

He was fighting against a temporarily immortal Dark Lord hampered by the fact that one of his anchors to immortality was someone that he cared greatly for.

He was fighting against a corrupt government who, in quite a few places, was also racist and supported Voldemort.

It's almost entirely fanon that half the Wizengamot is racist, but there were certainly enough people to pass discriminating legislature. People often forget, though, that people like Arthur Weasley were still able to pass positive legislature like the Muggleborn Protection Act (I think that's what it was called).

But still. He was fighting an external and internal battle. Without his scheming, the Light would have almost assuredly lost.

It is this attitude that forbids us any serene debate about more and more subjects as time goes.\\
I think it leads us to dictatorship in the end.\\
This doesn't have much to do with LGBT, except for the fact you were talking about this while doing it.

I also really don't understand what debate I'm disrupting, why intellectual benefit does the word "pansy" give us? Or does democracy die because I'm not allowing people to discuss shitty fanfiction by making homophobic points?

Yes, he did. I wasn't talking about that, however.

The attitude I'm talking about, that you show in the comment I mentioned, and is shared by a lot of people over a lot of subjects, is disrupting the debate on said subjects. You're but a small rock in a huge mountain.\\
As the years go passing by, I seem to be developing a tendency to grow berserk when I see it.

  why intellectual benefit does the word "pansy" give us? It has nothing to do with the word 'pansy'.

Something like this, yes.

2. Your attitude, when shared by enough people, do. You're sacralizing the subject. You provide a Dogma. You tell us what we have the right to say about it, how and even where. If you don't see the problem, it's gonna be difficult to explain you, as it means our premises are completely different. You obviously put the LGBT right before the freedom of speech, and I don't.

A. No. You make the discussion a lot more difficult, you attack with violence (saying that someone should die and that it would be a gain to the world is violent) those who don't share your views on the subject and you have no sense of proportions (Wishing people to die because they used a slur? What must it be when they actually do something really reprehensible) But more importantly, you sacralize the subject, which is the best way to guarantee that the debate won't be serene.

***** "Pansy" is a /slur/, not a neutral description. It's not the same as saying, "Dumbledore's gay." It's a sneering, highly offensive put-down based on equating gay men with weakness and womanliness (which also makes it misogynistic, for double the offensive points). It has nothing to do with being in the closet. It's a bigoted insult used against openly and identifiably gay men, or against men and boys judged not "masculine" enough.

Dumbledore was clearly not motivated by personal fear for his own life. Different threats require different solutions. Single combat with Voldemort wasn't the answer, in Dumbledore's opinion. Sometimes strategy and playing the long game against an opponent who can apparently rise from the dead are the only necessary options.

I have a lot of problems with the choices Dumbledore makes in the books, but this comparison is just too stupid to let stand.
