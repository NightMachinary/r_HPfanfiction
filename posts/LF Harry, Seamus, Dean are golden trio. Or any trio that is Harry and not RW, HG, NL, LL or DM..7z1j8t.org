Really looking for fics that delve into Harry having a different set of two best friends. Characters can be OOC. My thought is if Harry made friends with them in the beginning everyone would be a little OOC. Thanks!


** This would be so interesting! :) What about Harry, Parvati, and Dean? Or Harry, Lavender and someone from another House? :)

*** I remember one that had Susan Bones and Cedric Diggory. It actually got up to halfway through year 4 before it was abandoned. Harry ended up befriending all the Triwizard Champions early through various adventures.

***** Linkffn(What You Leave Behind). Sadly unfinished and likely abandoned, but it's amazing.

Edit: Reread the description and I'm not sure it is What You Leave Behind. That one is Harry/Cedric/Cho. Still worth reading if you haven't though!

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** Two things come to my mind. The first is the R-series, a 14-year-old epic which hasn't aged that well (people started using some of its concepts as tropes). The trio is Harry, Tonks (who is Harry's age) and an OC who was some sort of magical creature. Spans all seven books, and even though the first few are rather close to canon, it still stands apart from all the bad rehashes. Link to the first part: linkffn(2008185)

The other is a Slytherin Harry+Carrow twins story. One of the better Slytherin Harry fics since the "politics" are rather realistic and involve people wanting to use Harry and not bending over to the whims of an 11-year-old boy. Not sure if it will be a platonic friendship, polyamory or something else, the story hasn't ventured far into that direction. Linkffn(12031399)

** linkffn(9894129) The Price is Right has Harry, Morag, Dean, and Justin being friends so it isn't a trio but it isn't your usual cast of characters which is what I think you're asking for.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.
