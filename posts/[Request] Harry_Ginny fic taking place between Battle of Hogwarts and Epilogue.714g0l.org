Honestly I'm just looking for fics that cover the period not immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts but maybe Harry/Ginny in their early to mid-twenties? Can be any genre, but preferably canon and featuring lots of Hinny? Idk I'm so particular but terrible at finding good fic.


** Not exactly what you are looking for, but super canon compliant fic, Harry/Ginny, and the first HP Fic I ever read:

  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."
