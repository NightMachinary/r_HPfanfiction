Harry isn't forced to compete after his name comes out and the teahcers//Ministry investigate who put Harry's name in the cup among other things. Sorta want them in a style similar to Petrification Proliferation.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] by Books of Change. However, the Goblet of Fire part of the story does not start until half way through the fic. Since the story has Sherlock Holmes in the story, there are plenty of investigations. The author is really well rounded in writing mysteries.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): They did some serious investigations, even using the Marauder's Map, but without success. The adults agreed that Harry could only give minimal effort without suffering adverse effects, however, that Harry WANTED to win. Incidentally, this fic was written by the same author of "Petrification Proliferation".

** Does this make sense without an incompetent plotter? I guess it's possible they'd believe he would willingly compete. Or maybe they'd underestimate Dumbledore's willingness to take Harry at his word. Now /I/ kind of want to see this happen. Works better than I thought it would.

*** Well, Crouch Sr and Crouch Jr were both present, and Sr was imperiused, and regarded as the expert in the Goblet. With Bagman's influence, it was pretty easy to claim that it was an unbreakable contract.
