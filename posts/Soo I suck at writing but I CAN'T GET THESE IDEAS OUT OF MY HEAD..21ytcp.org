take them away, please. If you're a kick ass writer but have writers block, or can actually string two sentences together that doesn't look like a mongoose has attacked a small Emu trying to type. I propose a partnership. I'll be Idea man and you can be execution man/girl/person-type-dealy-bob. I can come up with paragraph ideas, outlines, and other things. I JUST CAN'T WRITE TO SAVE MYLIFE.

SO ANY TAKERS?

** Ideas are horribly common. I've got about twenty stories I could be writing at the moment, and if I work on any of them for ten or fifteen thousand words, I can probably get another four or five story ideas.

The ability to write well comes after writing a lot. Try writing. It will be awful. Write some more. It will still be awful. Keep writing. It'll be dreadful. But after enough time, you'll compare your first writings and your most recent and find that you've improved tremendously.

** Write part of a story, publish it and see the response. As long as the reviews are constructive, they will help you become a better writer. Also, get a beta so they can help you write things so they read well. You can usually get one after the first chapter is published.
