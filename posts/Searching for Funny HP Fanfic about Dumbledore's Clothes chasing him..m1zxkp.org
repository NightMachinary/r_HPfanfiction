:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic that had elements such as Dumbledore's clothes chasing him, him popping on himself, Draco being spanked by a chandelier and other objects, something about Snape being thrown out the window, and Petunia moving to Hogwarts to help Harry. Does anyone know what it's called? I've been wanting to find that to re-read and add to my favorites, but I can't remember the title of it to save my life.
