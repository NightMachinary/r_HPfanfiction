** Could make an interesting fallout cross-over. That Little Boy bomb happens to come attached to a power-armour-clad Brotherhood of Steel Knight - an AU Harry Potter. Kind of like that Warhammer Inquisitor series I forget the name of.

EDIT - For people who don't know fallout, it's a post nuclear-apocalypse wasteland game and there's a weapon called the Mini-Nuke that you basically fire small nuclear bombs with, rather like a grenade launcher.
