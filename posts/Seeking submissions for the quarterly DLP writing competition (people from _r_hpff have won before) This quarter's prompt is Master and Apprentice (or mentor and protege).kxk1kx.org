** Oh, I do have another question, actually. Is there a place to see what fics won any of the previous competitions? I'm kinda curious what DLP thinks is the best of the best. :)

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/1/Ice-Cream][Ice Cream]] by Andrius was also written for the same competition as BKing4's Ten Tips to Tranquility and it was a close one.

In addition to Fitz's links there's also tons of really quality fiction that the authors then, regretfully, never uploaded to AO3 or FFN as far as I can tell.

Dicra won a round with an excellent Grindelwald/Dumbledore story set in the Nurmengard, and in the round before he wrote a story about a middle-aged Aberforth Dumbledore being roped into chasing down Tom Riddle as he subverts the Vampires in Eastern Europe, and it's one of the best vampire stories I've ever read, one of the only fictions that have ever given me a jump scare, which came second.

Eilyfe, who's usually a Naruto writer, has written a pretty amazing post-canon Ron investigates murders around a travelling opera in his Auror days oneshot, in the same round as my I Open at the Close linked above (and there was only a point between us [IMO, his is the better story]).

So yeah, if you like the stuff Fitz has linked above, I'd join up and read through the round entries. There's a lot of really quick to read and fun oneshots. It's partitioned from the rest of the site basically, and, personally - from authors like Fitz and BKing and Joe and others - the criticisms that get levied at the entries can be really instructive and helpful if you're more interested in the writing side of things, too.

** DLP is a great place but pay attention to the culture of the forum. They're not going to mince words with you. Excellent opportunities for quality feedback make it worth it.

If you join don't go posting all over the place like a kid on crack. They don't like you bumping really old threads without a reason and some sections (like Politics) have stringent rules. You can and will get banned if you act like an annoying dumbass.

***** The last rule is that you have to review the other entries and vote (but not for yourself) if you submit. I'll add that to my post above, because yeah, I should definitely mention that.

Other than that, no other rules.
