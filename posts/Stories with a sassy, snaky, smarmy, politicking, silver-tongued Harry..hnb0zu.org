Stories where Harry is incredibly dangerous in a court room and talks circles around anyone and everyone. If his enemies want to play against him at his game, they'd best be prepared to be dealt from the bottom of the deck while Harry keeps all the aces and wilds for himself.


** "tricksters and Gods" by sakurademonalchemist. In which Harry Potter is Loki exiled to earth without his memories (like Thor in Thor 1) and becomes the world's best lawyer while playing jokes on shield and regaining his memory. Fair warning, as a crossover it leans more towards the marvel universe than the HP one but he still does interact with the wizarding world quite a bit. Oh, it's also unfinished but I don't think it's that big a deal because it's one of those fics without an overarching story. It's one of those their "interesting character" (Loki!Harry) does an interesting thing (interact with "X" marvel property/ facet of the wizarding world) and move on to the next chapter without an arc or any lesson learned. These fics tend to get very boring very quickly even if all the situations are 10/10, luckily it's quite short. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/]])
