** The interface between the Ministry of Magic and the nonmagical government has always fascinated me. Interactions betwen the muggle Prime Minister and Kingsley would be a great way to explore that. (A reminder: Scrimgeour tells the muggle Prime Minister that Kingsley is a wizard. His vices notwithstanding, I don't imagine that Scrimgeour is incompetent enough to not inform Kingsley that the muggle Prime Minister is in the know.)

** Knowing what we know about the political climate and wizards, KS would probably just modify the minister's memories, but I think I read a fic a few years ago with him having a muggle-born kid or something and him having a crisis with KS.
