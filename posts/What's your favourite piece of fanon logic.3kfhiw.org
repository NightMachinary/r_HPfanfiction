*** Harry was clueless and shortsighted when he told McG and Umbridge of his plans to be an Auror. He knew Voldemort was out there, and that he was doomed to have to fight. Harry figured that the best way to fight Voldemort was as an Auror, so that was what he should do as a career. Anything past that, and Harry hasn't even considered it as a possibility. He didn't expect to have a career- he thought he would die fighting Voldemort.

*** I would have found it terribly jarring had Harry been anything but an Auror in canon. The idea had been built up so much in canon (especially with McGonagall's declaration to Umbridge) that anything else would have been a letdown.

It is perfectly fine in fanfiction however. Unusual professions open up unuual premises, which is always welcome.

It explains why Quidditch is so ridiculously unbalanced (the seeker being able to win the game on their own) as back then, with slower brooms, it was much harder to catch the snitch and the other players scored much more points before the game ended.

Ancient runes feels more like the language class of the Wizarding World. A lot of books will be in ancient languages with different alphabets, so Ancient Runes kind of helps you create a fundament of all the important alphabets around the world. I think it's especially important for curse-breaking. Bill worked in the pyramids after all, and should be familiar with the hieroglyphs there.

If we can do that, we can certainly ignore her later public statements about other stuff, and this is a thread for favourite fanon interpretations.

**** Astoundingly fabulous. Now just imagine a young Lucious, flowing hair and scraggly moustache, sneaking off to a nightclub to get funky. At some point, his dance moves get mocked, reinforcing a cold hatred for muggles that the power of funk had begun to thaw.

 

Years later, a song on the Wizarding Wireless plays. A hand begins to tap along to the beat, it's owner still not aware. Following the hand, a hip moves in a way long forgotten, the owners freezes. He feels it. Lost for so many years, it has returned, a Force courses tingles up his tattooed arm and spreads into his being. Funk. A different life flashes before his eyes, where he had chosen to follow the groove. The song ends, the vision clears. A scared man is left. Standing riggidly, like he's afraid to move. A single tear hits the floor.

 

A crucio last but a few moments. But a pain a lifetime long resonates through this old man now. He lost something so long ago. And when it comes finally back, he can't hold on to it.

Metamorphs are also capable of becoming pregnant AND siring children. But only female-dominants (those who mostly stay female) are known to do the later. Male-dominants (those who mostly remain male) don't like to get pregnant.

****** I suppose from a perspective of her appearance being a matter of choice, she would have a very fluid perspective on interactions with others. She would be able to explore the social consequences of appearance in many forms and situations and therefore be less bound by tradition in her choices of affection.

Along with this is the (rather fallacious) assumption that, because she's a very extroverted and fun person that her tastes in the bedroom might be equally open and cooperative. From the perspective of a neurotic New Englander, the fact that she isn't defensive and prickly about it would lead to the assumption that she'd explored that aspect of sexuality and come out of it entirely untraumatized.

You can poke holes in the logic all over the place, but it's still an empty space in the canon that can be filled with almost anything. What we know of Tonks is that she was shapechanging nearly from birth, was Sorted Hufflepuff but got into a lot of trouble, was capably enough to qualify and complete the most arduous training in the Wizarding World and she wasn't hung up about Remus being a wishy-washy werewolf to the point that she nearly forced him to marry her.

Quite the gender-role inversion, there.

As for whether she can change that drastically, I can't point to a moment in canon when she appeared male, but she did transform her face into a pig's snout and at another time appeared as a tall, thin woman with iron-grey hair, sufficiently different that Harry didn't even know it was Tonks until she said "Wotcher, Harry."

From then on she's referred to as Natalia. Of course, this was a tip to the actress who played her (Natalia Tena) but I wanted to avoid the constant 'Don't call me Nymphadora' spiel since she was becoming a primary character in the story.
