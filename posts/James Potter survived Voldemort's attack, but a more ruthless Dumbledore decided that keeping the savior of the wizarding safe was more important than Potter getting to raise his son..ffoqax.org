So, in order to get Harry under the Dursley's blood protection and away from the magical world until he attends Hogwarts, he lies to everyone that Harry was killed alongside Lily (either Dumbledore was the first person there after the attack, or he decided to obliviate Snape to keep him quiet) and then lies to Petunia, telling her that both James and Lily died and that no one else can take him. He then places his own magic wards around the neighborhood, to alert him if anyone magical tries to approach the Dursley home.

Either Dumbledore's plan works, and no one finds out Harry is alive until he arrives at Hogwarts, or someone finds out before then and spills the truth to James that his son is still alive.

In addition to the oceancrux or mooncrux or pocketdimensioncrux, a more smart dark lord should probably have an easy method of incarnation, so he doesn't have to spend twelve years as a wraith every time he's accidentally offed.

To be honest, the most "sane" method of this I've seen in fanon was basically an entire, self-contained pocket dimension that is basically the majority of the horcruxed's soul. Every time he dies, he is drawn back, and can form himself a new body because it's basically a domain area where he is reasonably all-powerful, after which he simply apparates out again.

How do you know that? None of us know the ins an outs of high tier magical combat. Non-lethally could very well be immensely more difficult. A stunning spell may indeed be far easier to defend against. Perhaps someone like Voldemort can cast a spell on himself to make him un-stunnable. Who knows. More potent spells are more difficult to defend against seems pretty intuitive. Like the killing curse.

So you're saying:

Dumbledore did not have to put any focus into defending Harry at all. His presence in the fight did not at all impact Dumbledore's actions other than the animated statue.

Middle age Voldemort is just /too good/ for Dumbledore to have any chance of fighting/capturing/assassinating. The disparity is so great that if Dumbledore is the first to go on the offensive, Voldemort will be perfectly prepared anytime anyplace.

We see it frequently enough to draw that conclusion, there isn't a single instance in the books where someone who is hit by a spell didn't feel the effects because of a spell they used. The only times where something like that happned was either because of a natural protection like Hagrid being part giant, or Harry being protected by his mothers sacrifice and later by owning the wand Voldemort used.

I dont think you understand the magic in Harry Potter, those spells aren't inherently potent or weak, their strength depends on the strength of the caster. The difference in various spells is merely the effects they have. And Dumbledore's stunning spells are personally shown to be quite strong.

just look how it

#+begin_quote
  Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes ---

  *“Stupefy!” There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart --- Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor.*

  Harry, still staring at the place where Moody's face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.
#+end_quote

Also Voldemort was using physical shields during the fight, so the killing curse(which is specifically the only spell shown that ignores protective enchantments) wouldn't make a difference except that it takes longer to cast.

#+begin_quote
  "Gained more power"? What? I'm talking about getting more skilled. I'm talking about experience. Being used to fighting people.

As I mentioned Voldemort literally only engaged in fights with people if he was certain he was going to win and usually when he catches people off guard.

Hell, the feeling of love hurt him, actually harmed him.

Tl;dr Dumbledore doesn't say Voldemort is more powerful than him, just that he has powers that Dumbledore personally does not. Considering that in every confrontation between the two, it's usually Voldemort that runs away shows that Dumbledore is the more powerful one. Also, just to counteract your point of the AK being taken by Fawkes...well, "Dumbledore has powers that Voldemort will never have."

Also Dumbledore did not have his full attention on the duel, because Harry was there, and still in danger. Even protected by statues, unless you persoanllly think that the statues that Dumbledore created are more powerful than Voldemort, which if you do lends credence to Dumbledore being more powerful than Voldemort, if not than of course Dumbledore's attention would be split between Harry(the actual chosen one), and Voldemort.

You're missing the point of 'Tl;dr ' when you're summary is as long as the actual text.

Also Fawkes isn't a power Dumbledore doesn't have, but an outside factor which pretty much confirms that if Dumbledore were to face him alone he would very likely die.

And Voldemort didn't just run away from Dumbledore, he did it because the Aurors arrived which would have aided Dumbledore even more. The only other time we see him run from Dumbledore was in Philosophers Stone when Harry pretty much killed his host and he was significantly weakened.

****** How do you explain Voldemort never actually attacking Dumbledore at Hogwarts, but attacking Hogwarts only after Dumbledore is dead. Not to mention that it is canon that Dumbledore is the one person Voldemort ever feared. I know that Fawkes isn't apart of it, I was just tweaking your nose there with that.

Overall Dumbledore is far more knowledgable in magic. Some of the most impressive magic in HP was caused by Dumbledore. Don't get me wrong, Voldemort is beyond powerful.

Dumbledore had earned the allegiance of a Phoenix, has fought, and won against a previous dark lord while said dark lord was using the death stick. Has beaten back Voldemort again, and again before Harry even existed. His knowledge is unparalleled, his magic is second to none, and the only thing I think Voldemort truly has an advantage in is his physical capabilities. If Dumbledore were to fight Voldemort on their own, I gotta give the fight to Dumbledore more often than Voldemort. Unless you can give me a reason Voldemort would win more often beyond "his knowledge of dark magic," then my mind is made up. Dark magic is not more powerful than any other magic, it has a greater capacity to cause harm, but so does most magic if you use a little bit of imagination.

  How do you explain Voldemort never actually attacking Dumbledore at Hogwarts, but attacking Hogwarts only after Dumbledore is dead. Not to mention that it is canon that Dumbledore is the one person Voldemort ever feared. I know that Fawkes isn't apart of it, I was just tweaking your nose there with that.
#+end_quote

Oh, that's easy, Voldemort doesn't attack unless he is very certain he'll succeed, like its not enough for it to be probable that he'll win, he wants to catch them unaware with no chance of him failing. The same thing as with the Minister of Magic.

#+begin_quote
  ‘My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have -- with difficulty, and after great effort -- succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.'

  Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbour, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.

  ‘It is a start,' said Voldemort. ‘But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister's life will set me back a long way.'
#+end_quote

With Dumbledore he never had more than one man at his side, at least until Draco managed to let a bunch of Death Eaters enter Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Overall Dumbledore is far more knowledgable in magic. Some of the most impressive magic in HP was caused by Dumbledore. Don't get me wrong, Voldemort is beyond powerful. His command of wandless magic at a young age, and the truly powerful magic he developed over the years(including unassisted flight) is very impressive. I'm not underselling Voldemort here in any way, and I would go so far to say that they are pretty equal power-wise, but fights with magic, even in HP, are usually won by those who are more knowledgable in it.

Studying, and teaching for several decades in one of the best magic schools in the world.
#+end_quote

The Difference is what kind of magic they studied, Dumbledores most famous contribution to magic seem to have been in the nature of alchemy and to a smaller degree magical theory.

Voldemort on the other hand concentrated his efforts into the Darkest forms of magic and according to himself was very successful there.

#+begin_quote
  You call it 'greatness,' what you have been doing, do you?" asked Dumbledore delicately.

  "Certainly," said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. "I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed ---"

  "Of some kinds of magic," Dumbledore corrected him quietly. "Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant."

#+end_quote

Just to be clear, Voldemort was the Dark Lord, thats a title only he hold, Grindelwald was simply a dark wizard, And while Dumbledore was certainly greater that Grindelwald, Voldemort too was mentioned multiple times to have been more dangerous than him. And Voldemort himself also was able to fight off the owner of the Elder Wand(until he didn't against Harry).

There is actually no indication that they ever fought each other before the fight in the ministry.

It's not more powerful but it's certainly more well suited to harm others. Which is one of the most important factors in a fight.

******** Second time Chrome shut down while I was writing a reply. So i'm just gonna copy&paste the first answer google gave me when I asked who was more powerful. Rebuttel if you want, but i'm currently very annoyed with Chrome, and won't care unless you can offer up solid evidence on your side.

"Dumbledore was a more skillful, more powerful, modest, more knowledgeable person than Voldemort. But Voldemort feared him (but did not accept it); he knew that Dumbledore knew more magic than him, so it frightened him."

I cut out where it said it was, because the community admired him. That's stupid. I'm sorry, but in a fight of magic with power being equal, it's knowledge that wins. You can't honestly expect me to believe that Voldemort was more knowledgable that Dumbledore in magic. In an aspect of magic, sure, but in general, Dumbledore's knowledge trumps Voldemorts.

*** I think the Blood Ward is based off Lily's bloodline rather than Harry's because it's not just because they were related, whatever she did, the "power of love" or not, fed in to Harry's protection from Voldemort and others who wish him harm. I don't know for sure, it's been a while since I've read about it, especially with so little of the explanation in Canon, and fanon is certainly not helping.

***** Just now, I imagine post-goblet of fire Voldemort trying to pass the blood wards since he has 'harry's blood's but everytime he gets close enough the blood ward gets stronger and stronger since it's based on Harry's blood and it siphon magic proportional to magical strength and emotional attachment. I think obsessive hate counts as an emotional attachment. It's probably contrary to common fanon that Voldemort can waltz in due to having Harry's blood. The wards are strengthened by Harry's blood and not only Harry's family can enter.

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

  “I still don't ---”

  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you.

** Now the far more locigal thing to do, would be to house the Dursleys (and depending on how ruthless we talk about which of them) with James.

James is rich as hell and could pretty much buy the Dursleys into his home. And if all else fails, Dudley alone would probably be enough or the blood wards. So either the older Dursleys are gone or they are just oblivated to think Dudley died.

​

So the whole idea would make much more sense, if it's from Dudley's point of view. If you want to have a more caring James, you could easily make sure that he doesn't know the Dursleys are still alive and really takes in Dudley not only as a protection for Harry, but a second squip son. I mean he fought against the whole idea that magic and pureblood means more than muggle and muggleborns and when he took in Sirius as his brother he showed that to him family doesn't need to be blood
