Yeah, I'm a sucker for Mauraders or really any time travel/ dimensional travel fics. And for seeing Harry in pain lol. Also has to be in hogwarts.

Also I think that this was greatly represented (if I remember correctly) in linkffn(Timely Errors). Probably in other fics too but I've only recently started keeping track of what I'm reading. Also (I say also a lot don't I) please don't recommend Windshear bc I'm waiting for the right time to read it. Thanks

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** Sirius and the others are suspicious of Harry's connections to the Death Eaters in these two Marauder era fics:

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
