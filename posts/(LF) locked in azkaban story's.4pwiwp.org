** I really enjoyed the fic "Delenda Est".

The only thing I will say for it though, is that Azkaban doesn't play a HUGE role in the story (as in, Harry's not in Azkaban for half of it), but it does start out Harry being in Azkaban and things moving forward from there.

It's a time-travel fic, so if you're not into those, maybe give it a pass. But this is one of my all-time favorites.
