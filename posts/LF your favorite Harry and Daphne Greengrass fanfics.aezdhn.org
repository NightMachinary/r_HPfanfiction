I want to know what everyone's favorite Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass stories are, not what is the highest rated/best.

Some of these would also be highly welcome if you know any:

- Harry is taken in as a ward of the Greengrass family/adopted

- Harry and Daphne grow up together as best friends and later partners

- And yes, smut =3

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself.

** Trial is pretty good, and leans heavily to HP/DG isn't finished but still really good,

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/The-Trial]]

​

The reunion is cheesy but good

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7551173/1/The-Reunion]]

​

A Champions New Hope is one of the best

  Daphne Greengrass isn't the person that she was at Hogwarts. She's changed for the better. However, due to her lifestyle changes, her day-to-day has become a bit mundane. Work, Study, Sleep is the never-ending loop that is Daphne's life. Until one day, while at work, she comes face to face with the least boring person in Wizarding Britain. Can he spice things up a bit?
