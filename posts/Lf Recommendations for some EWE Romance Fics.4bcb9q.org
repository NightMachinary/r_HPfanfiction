I've read all of what's currently posted of Grow Young With Me as well as one or two Harry/Daphne fics and even a good unspeakable!Luna/Harry fic but I want some more. I'm looking for fics where we have an adult Harry as either an auror or doing whatever but he doesn't end up with Ginny. Either they don't get back together after the battle or have broken up again. I'm OK for any pairing but please no slash. Let me know. Thanks.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

*** "Epilogue - what epilogue?" I think, meaning non epilogue compliant fics

*** It means 'Epilogue? What epilogue?' Basically it means I am looking for fics that follow canon up to the last chapter of deathly hallows but not the 19 years later epilogue. For example me looking for romance fics where Harry ends up with someone else. If he marries someone else its no longer following the epilogue because in the epilogue he is married to Ginny.
