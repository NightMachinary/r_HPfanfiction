I just finished it tonight and I was honestly blown away. The writing, the way the characters are handled, the romance, and the plot were all superb.

I really enjoyed the ending of it, as well. It managed to be both sad and happy without being so sad as to overwhelm the fic or so happy that it felt like a cop out.

The sex scenes were also incredibly well written and erotic. It was nice to see them included, but to not have the entire story be based around them.

On a related note, does anyone know if Antosha had any more novel length stories? I have several dozen of his stories downloaded, but I haven't read any of them yet except Back to the Garden. Are there any you'd recommend?


** Can you share a link? I tried googling with no luck.
