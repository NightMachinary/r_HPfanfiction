  How different would things have been if it had been Ron who was on the other side of the rock-fall when Lockhart's spell backfired in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets?

**** Predicting based on the word count and the author's handle that this ends in Ron and Ginny dying real fast.

  EDIT: I was wrong! I'd really like to see this AU where Ron's confidence is buffed by this. He's way less of a prat in year 4, maybe confident enough to try out for quidditch earlier/ is better at it when he makes the team, in general is probably bolder/more adventurous, not sure what other consequences there might be. Also, no basilisk venom in the sword means at least one of the trio have to learn fiendfyre, which is probably a nifty tool in a few situations.

  The ending was a little goofy, there really was no reason for Fawkes to show up. Harry could probably figure out how to summon stairs if he was stuck there for a while.

***** It's more the lack of sword than venom that's the issue. They know where to find the venom after all, just gotta pour some on.

** linkffn(6050866) Its one of the last chapters, basically it was Ron who defeated the Basilisk while Harry was hiding and later took credit for it.
