I am looking for:

- fanfics (preferably with at least one of them as the main character)

- popular fanon headcanons, if there are any (except them being James' parents)

From canon, we know:

- Dorea Black died in 1977, aged 57 (Black family tree)

- Dorea Black was sorted into Slytherin (Slughorn was teaching while she attended Hogwarts)

- Charlus Potter died before October 31st, 1981 (Black family tree)

- Dorea and Charlus had a son who died before October 31st, 1981 (Black family tree)

I got inspired recently /cough/ Crimes of Grindelwald /cough/ to write a fic set in 1945, with Dorea and Charlus being aurors. Any information would be extremely helpful!


** The wording of the title made me imagine a small group of aurors sat around a pile of papers going "So. What do we have on Dorea Black and Charlus Potter?" and it being some national-level manhunt for some Bonnie and Clyde style shenanigans.

** I always thought Dorea and Charlus Potter made SO much more sense in terms of being James' parents. One, it would give Dorea (his parents) an actual familial connection to Sirius, and thus supports why they would take him in. And two, we know that James' parents died when he was young. Her dying in '77 makes a lot of sense. And they had a son? I mean, no offense JKR, but why set up such such a pairing only to come in later with Euphemia and Fleamont?

*** I disagree with the point that it would be better for James and Sirius to be related. Because for me, that would weaken not only their friendship but also the relationship between Harry and Sirius. Right now it is a glorious friendship, two man who were willing to do everything for each other and even after James death Sirius did everything he could for his friends son.

If they were related this impressiv bonding would fall down to, "well thats what family does".

**** They were definitely related. Fleamont is still a Potter, as is Charlus, whether Sirius and James were distant cousins or something akin to it, they were still related. As we can see in the wizarding world, this obviously meant quite little (especially if they weren't immediate family) In a world where there are so few purebloods, where they are most likely to be related in one way or another, they can't all go around and use the excuse that "that's what family does." In other words, your view and understanding of family is sort of altered. Sirius doesn't consider the Malfoys his family, even though he shares blood with Draco, etc.

In such an insular society, I don't think being someone's cousin once-removed counted for much. We see Molly Weasley and Arthur Weasley, who are something like fourth cousins, fall in love--- they obviously didn't view one another as family.

I have something of a soft spot for Sirius, so I think that I'll make it that Charlus is Fleamont's brother. That way, Sirius can have his great-aunt Dorea at his side, at least in secret.

**** I think 'absolutely didn't' is a little harsh in this situation. Like, why not? As someone said, they might've not known. I don't think Walburga would have cared after that point? It just doesn't make sense that you would have both Dorea, Charlus, Euphemia, and Fleamont all die within like two years of one another? Both had one son, both were pureblood marriages. They're too much alike, it's like creating the same character twice, essentially, but with different names. Dorea was also older than Walburga, I don't think Walburga or Orion got a say of whether she was disowned or not. She made a good, pureblood match to a wealthy family, she was most likely in Slytherin, and from what we know she never actually made any protest/stood against her family. We don't know enough of the pureblod society to decide what got someone disowned. Sirius got disowned because he ran away, Andromeda got disowned because she married a muggleborn. These all seemed like pre-meditated actions they took, purposefully putting distance between themselves and that lifestyle. If Dorea Potter never actually stated, saying that she was against them and wanted nothing to do with them (running away), then I don't think she would have been disowned. Like I said, these are my opinions, and we don't know enough about this society, and can only theorize, but I don't think it's that easy to be disowned.

I agree, but taking in all the facts (death dates, blood status, ages), it just seems like too much of a coincidence. I'm not grasping at straws, I'm coming up with a rational theory based off evidence. It wasn't until recently that JKR came out with Euphemia and Fleamont, and there were many people that, using the facts that had been given previously, came to the conclusion that Dorea and Charlus were James' parents. Also, Alphard was her brother, Dorea was her aunt, that's a whole different power dynamic, especially if Alphard was a younger brother. Walburga blasted her own brother from her family tree (because for all we know, Grimmauld Place may not be the only Black family property, there could be more and there could be other family trees). We don't know how disowning someone is in the Wizarding World, there were no mentions of solicitors or legal papers. All we know is that they were blasted off of the family tree and that's that.

Sirius did mention his grandparents though, yes, in passing, but they were still mentioned. It simply wasn't important enough to his story, not as much as James was. And purebloods marrying purebloods aren't weird until you factor in that they're a dwindling population, even Sirius mentions that all of them are somehow related.

I'm not saying that Euphemia and Fleamont aren't James' parents, because obviously JKR has made it so that they are-- but I don't understand why she'd create two very similar pairings. I think having Dorea and Charlus as James' parents would have added another layer to both Harry and James' story and character arc. But it's her story, and this is a fanficton subreddit where we discuss our own headcanons/theories, so everyone is welcome to their own opinion.

Edit: Also, in response to Alphard-- he left Sirius a part of the Black inheritance, that's why Walburga got upset. He had no children of his own, she most likely expected him to leave it to either her or Regulus, but he didn't, he left it to Sirius. He took a part of the family's wealth and gave it to someone who had deliberately removed himself from the family. That makes sense why Walburga would disown her own brother, if Dorea never gave her cause-- I don't see why she'd be disowned simply for taking in Sirius. it wasn't as if she'd adopted him, it was only for a couple of months out of the year (since he was at hogwarts) and he quickly got his own place after that. It wasn't anything permanent, if it had been then I'd agree, but it'd have barely even summed up to 12 months. (all in theory)

  James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born, which explains the only child, very pampered, had-him-late-in-life-so-he's-an-extra-treasure, as often happens, I think. They were old in wizarding terms, and they died.
#+end_quote

In 2006 Rowlings drawing of Black Family Tree revealed Dorea to be 57 at the time of her dead. That's definitely not "old in wizarding terms" and another proof that they were never intended to be James' parents.

  Your dad's place,' said Sirius. ‘Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold -- he's been wiped off here, too, that's probably why -- anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr and Mrs Potter's for Sunday lunch, though

No where in the books does it ever state that Harry's grandparents were old. But JKR did need a good reason to fix that plot hole, many people were wondering why Harry didn't have any grandparents.

I don't understand why you feel the need to insult anyone. No one is 'bad' at research in this case, this was what was given to the readers before JKR came up with some story for Pottermore. Euphemia and Fleamont are not canon, no where in the books are they mentioned. They are an add on that came out years after OotP. Dorea and Charlus are, however, the first other Potters we see besides Harry& James (when she came out with the Black family tree for the movie). She purposefully added Dorea and Charlus before she came out with Euphemia and Fleamont-- that's the evidence people based this theory off of, that's the information we had before Pottermore. I don't know when you came into this fandom, but this was what we had from JKR herself, not some shit we pulled from some sort of fanfic we read. Don't insult people and call them bad researchers, it doesn't make your argument any stronger.

#+begin_quote
  And tell me - why are they all closely related?
#+end_quote

They are all closely related because the British wizarding population is extremely low, they are few in numbers. Example? Remus Lupin becomes related to Sirius Black at the end of the series, not because that was planned or anything, out of pure coincidence because that's how this world works. You want to marry another witch or wizard? Good chances you're related in some way, or will become related to someone you went to school with, etc, etc. Apart from the sacred 28, we know that Victoire and Teddy are related, Molly and Arthur are related... It's not something odd, like I've stated somewhere else in this thread, the idea and definition of family in the Potterverse is completely different than the one we have in the western/european countries.

#+begin_quote
  I think it'd hurt them, I think that making Sirius closely related to James and Harry is terribly lazy writing.
#+end_quote

They wouldn't have been 'closely related' by any means. They wouldn't have even been cousins. They would have been first cousins once removed going back two generations. It wouldn't have meant anything in the wizarding world. It's not lazy writing, it only supports JKR's point that purebloods are closely related, few in numbers, and that they are going to be related either way-- which James definitely is, even if Charlus is not his father, he is somehow related to Sirius. Not lazy writing, it makes sense and fits the world she built.

Saying that someone is 'bad at research' because they have a differing opinion than you is insulting. No one is saying you're wrong, but you have no problem claiming that everyone else is because you think they're pulling ideas out of thin air, despite it having been a popular theory with strong evidence.

I never said that Charlus and Dorea were stated in the books, I said that they came before Fleamont and Euphemia, they had one son, they were also older than the others on the family tree-- thus leading to the logical conclusion, at the time, that they were James' parents.

Keep in mind that JKR herself has said she's not good at math, so when it comes to years and numbers-- take everything she says/writes with a grain of salt. She has made plenty of mistakes over the series and after in terms of birthdays, death dates, but no one really pays much mind to them since they're not important.

Do I think she initially created Dorea and Charlus as a way to connect Harry to Sirius? Yes. Do I think they were originally supposed to be James' parents? Yes. Do I think she changed it after because she not only realized that there were gaps/flaws, but also realized that maybe making Fleamont Potter into some cool potioneer would be some sort of comic relief/ironic twist? Yes.

Also, Dorea may have been 'older' when she had James, but no where does it claim she was a grandmother (which biologically would have also been impossible), having her around 40 when she had James makes sense.

Authors are not perfect. In the end, it is her story and she is allowed to claim whatever she likes.

#+begin_quote
  There was some speculation that Charlus Potter was the father of James Potter and the paternal grandfather of Harry Potter. Later, Pottermore has revealed that Fleamont Potter, not Charlus, is Harry's grandfather. In spite of this, is still more than likely that Charlus was an uncle or cousin of James Potter and his descendants.

*** I will forever reject Fleamont and Euphemia Potter as completely non-canon and completely unrelated to Harry Potter. In fact I thoroughly reject a large amount of the Pottermore writings as anything aside from authors notes added long after things are said and done. No matter what JK writes or says, they come so long after both the books and movies that I don't consider them canon at all.

Yeah, J.K. sat down with a cup of coffee and made up some shit on the spot. Not really relevant imo. At least not more relevant than than thousands of hours people been working on backstories of the potters while writing fanfiction over the years.

** Reclamation of Black Magic is a good one, with Dorea as the main character. Update is sporadic but it's not abandoned. linkao3(8374798)

She and Charlus also feature prominently in Debt of Time. They aren't the main characters, but as it's as Marauders era fic covering all seven years, you see them often enough. linkao3(10672917)
