Started out as a just-before-going-to-bed thought where Petunia still doesn't really like Harry but the Dursleys aren't as mean to him as they were in canon. When Harry is old enough to understand, she explains the existence of magic to him, and tells him that just because he has magic he shouldn't start acting like he was better than everyone else just like his mother. She proceeds to paint her sister in a negative light, saying that Lily always looked down upon her and was friends with people who were just as bad as her like Severus Snape. Of course, Harry doesn't believe her but when he goes to Hogwarts and meets Snape, he begins to wonder if his aunt was indeed telling the truth.

Going on a stretch, when he finds out about the Marauders, he really wonders just how much of a bully his mother was also, for her to have ended up with James.

Given this kind of situation, what kind of changes would there be in Harry and how would it affect the story? Some ideas I'm having right now is that he'd try very hard not to be out of touch with the nonmagical world and perhaps join or start a club with the other Muggleborns.


** People would be constantly heaping praise on two people, his parents, that he was raised to loathe. This could be a huge stumbling block for this Harry, as unless he was more cunning he'd be constantly in conflict with people who praise them. Harry's parents literally died for him, and I expect many people would tell him so. What Petunia presumably filled his mind with in this scenario are lies, and all lies are vulnerable to the truth.

While Snape would be glad to find that Harry thinks ill of his father, I doubt he'd be sanguine about Harry hating his mother, +the love of his life+ the woman that died for Harry. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black also present opportunities for the lies to be revealed, and a huge teen angst filled blowup with Petunia soon after. If this is not resolved early on in the story, he may be more vulnerable to Peter Pettigrew lying to him as well.

*** Ah, but you underestimate how cemented hatred and anger can be in youth, especially when it is constantly reinforced. If you want to brainwash and convince people, you do it when they are young. I have seen children turn on one parent because the other has filled their head with lies and nothing, not even evidence in their face, was able to change their mind.

This is why Voldemort getting a hold on a young Harry works because it could actually work. There are flaws, yes, but if it is done right, nothing would ever be questioned and anything would be a coincidence or a fabrication.

Poison the minds of the youth, control them when they are adults.

** I wonder if there are any stories like this.\\
I wonder what would happen if petunia and vernon were actually cunning and used harry instead of just hurting him. Like doing what you mentioned or maybe telling that he was a wizards, caring for him, and using him to help their lives (E.g, Vernon could ask for pepper up, luck, truth, healing, love, etc potions and Harry would happily brew them for him )

*** I think there is one. Petunia and Vernon treat him a tad bit better, and educate him to make him more aware of his status as a noble, but are emotionally distant from him, and let make it business like in the fact that he must "support" them to social climb when possible in the muggle world...I just don't remember it's name

** I think it's more likely that she'd poison him against magic. Possibly also neutering accidental magic by residual knowledge from her childhood to minimize emotional bursts.

Also, a Snape confronted with a Harry despising Lily would probably for once forego his bias for a bit in order to try to set him straight. When /everyone/, even the "hates everyone" guy is treating Lily as a saint, it'll probably eventually reset Harry's worldview.

*** There are plenty of stories where teen Harry has endless orgies with older men, gets raped, tortured, or otherwise goes through myriads of hellish depravity and yet /this/, a simple character study, is what's making you go "yikes"? Now *that* is a perspective I do not understand.

And I didn't go "yikes." I pretty much had the opposite reaction.

So is delving into the psychology of characters in a story, given that it's one of the most prominent catalysts for drama in many different mediums---the HP series itself does it many times throughout the books; OP suggests a prompt that tackles something like this (Harry's psychology through a different lens) and somehow you fail to see why anyone would find it interesting? In a subreddit full of people who read stories based on ideas like this one? Now it's /my/ turn to go "yikes".

That is accurate. The prompt just seems so arbitrary and unnecessary.

And again, I did not say or mean to imply "yikes." That was your word. Take as many turns with it as you want.
