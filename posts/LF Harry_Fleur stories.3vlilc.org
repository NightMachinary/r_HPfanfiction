** Try /The Lie I've Lived/. It's a complete story, but the sequel was never written. Features Harry/Fleur. (I was going to recommend /What You Leave Behind/ but then I saw your last sentence. Really hope the author doesn't abandon it.)

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** /Harry Potter and a Flower/, a pretty good story with an interesting Fleur. Better than a lot of the other stories i've read with this pairing. not updated since July.

/Deprived/, a great story but all signs point towards abandoned.

/Allure Immune Harry/, a nice short oneshot that is funny, fluffy, and well written.

/A Cadmean Victory/, a frequently updated story, littered with cliches and bashing. A summer of studying gives Harry ~2 years of magical experience and makes him smarter than Hermione. The authors disdain for certain characters is obvious at points. Nice writing, easy to read as long as you push through the first few chapters, and updates frequently with long chapters so it's popular at the moment.

/His Angel/, basically a worse /A Cadmean Victory/. Worse on all acounts. The relationship between Fleur and Harry is instantaneous and boring, the bashing is absurd, the OCs aren't interesting, a weird sideplot that goes nowhere, mostly because the Author discontinued it after some IRL events. Very fluffy and the actual writing is decent even if the story isn't great. Durararaaa has 4 other Harry/Fleur stories as well.

/In Spite of Obstinate Men/, don't know much about this. Started it got a few chapters in and got distracted by other stuff. Might give it a read. Story is complete and sequel is released I think and the author updates fairly frequently. Third year, Harry meets the Delacours. Mr Delacour is inspired by Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

When a Veela Cries is fantastic, has a confident and competent Fleur.

Additionally, Agents of Attor is a good one as well, however it is a H/F/D. But it is well written and fun to read.

*** So I'm currently giving Agents of Attor a try. It's a real struggle. A couple of big you're/your mistakes, Bouxbatons/Beauxbatons for a chapter, the pov changes erratically and the exposition is fairly dreadful.

But I was honestly ignoring most of it because there are a few characters that seemed /slightly/ interesting.

And then I found it. The most poorly structured sentence I've ever read.

  It meant she came by a lot of information, although none of it was really that useful, occasionally there was always something.

This is the equivalent of "Sixty percent of the time it works every time" except somehow more wrong.

  Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire but no one could have foreseen that written on that same slip of paper was Draco Malfoy. Forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament together, resented by their houses the two once rivals form a grudging alliance in their fight to survive the trials ahead. Rated M.
