So I'm trying to expand and build the world a bit beyond what is there in canon, wanted to introduce a few more places, but I'm struggling with names.

I can't come up with any clever word-play names, or any names that fit the theme and aesthetic of HP in general.

Could you guys please help out and list out your suggestions? It would be really helpful and I'd really appreciate it!

Thank you!! :)

** Check how streets are named in the city/region you're placing these districts in. For example, alleys in Edinburgh, Scotland, are called "closes" and they are usually named; there are also streets that end with "-gate" (Cowgate, for example), which comes from a Scots word for way or road. I'm using something like that for my Scots magical district. There are also short straight streets called wynds as well (contrarily pronounced with the long I sound).

** I would say they are both puns but also related to type of shops.

While Diago Ally is more just a pun it could be a discription of the actual street (that it runs diagonally).

But Knocturn Ally is a clear pun and obviously refers to the dark shops and the more seedy unbelly types that frequent it (a shop that sells cursed items and a scary old lady in the street selling finger nails).

So I would start with what shops the street will have or where you enter it from in the muggle word, or what the actual street looks like.

Something like

Muse-ilk Ally : An assortment of music shops wiyh a theater that is located in an area historically connected to muses.

**** Well it was a French word first, there was this whole thing with William the Conqueror and it just permanently made English into a mutt tongue.

*** I don't think that's the best choice, unfortunately - vertique is not a common word in french (I actually had to look it up to see if it was a thing lol), and Allee would first.

Fantastic Beasts went with 'Place Cachee' ('Hidden Place' or 'Hidden Square'), though it doesn't really hit the same pun-y vibe. For that, I'd probably go with 'Rue X', depending on how dumb to make them lol. Like 'Rue Barbe' (Beard Road) sounds like rhubarbe (Rhubarb), off the top of my head. But unfortunately, the type of location coming first in french makes it tough/impossible to keep up the same type of wordplay.

Not easy to make puns in different languages - and I suppose it's not a big deal except for people from those areas, that might cringe or be unhappy at the choice of words not fitting.

*** Well I really want to expand the wizarding world. My fic is more of exploring things, looking at other species, cultures and so on.

Diagon Alley is only one place.

I'm imagining a wizarding Britain with a significantly larger magical population, so it doesn't work with my story to have only one commercial district. Even in the olden days Britain had multiple ports and cities.

I don't see every magical being welcome at Diagon, neither do I see how one alley would fit a large population. Plus it wouldn't be good from an economic standpoint either.

** I like to google old english words for creating places/names for shops because there are always some odd ones there which fit the bill. For example darbies is an old word for handcuffs.

You could make a place Darbies District and throw in some fictional lore about how this was once a rather seedy part of town or something.

Here some example words which might be of use.

Bedlam - an old woman Bibliopole - a dealer in books Bijoux - jewellery, trinkets Gadzooks - an expression of surprise or annoyance Grimalkin - a cat Quaggy - marshy or boggy Quidnunc - an inrusive/gossipy person

** Under alley can be underground maybe no humans used more it can be like an extension of knockturn or something completely different. Cloudy alley is above diagon and the streets can be clouds that you can walk on. You can go up there climbing a giant beanstalk.

** In one of my fics I disregarded the cutesy puns and went with the traditional mideval streets that were named after whatever economic function or service they provided.

Lobourne Row - shopping area that only had shops owned by half-bloods and muggleborns.

** Mortal Alley where so call "real"wizards scorn to go even more than Nocturne Alley - because thats where the actual down to earth muggleborn wizards set up shop and do services that other muggleborns use... sell pen and paper and typewriters instead of parchment and quills.. offer electronics that work despite the big lie that they dont in the middle of Freaking London... offer clothing that make you not look like a Victorian cosplayer at best and a loony fresh from the bin at worst... job agencies and travel agents.
