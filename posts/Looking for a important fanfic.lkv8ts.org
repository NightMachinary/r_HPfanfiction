:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically its when snape marries a muggle from america and has 2 sons both are muggles and one of his sons the younger one has cancer and him and his wife get divorced so snape is forced to secretly live in grimmauld place until sirius catches them Towards the end snapes older son gets shipped with hermione. Sounds weird i know but its a really good fic and i hate myself for losing sight of it
