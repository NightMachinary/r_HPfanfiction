** If muggles found out about wizards in 1941, than by 1942 people would be ragging on their friends for believing the magic 'hoax'. Also they were involved in WWII, in only tangentially.

** Muggles still develop nukes, but designed to be portkeyed to the target. The cold war either gets very hot or, if it stays cold, the space race with access to magic goes way beyond what muggle technology can do. Imagine NASA working with enchanted rocket engines that don't need rocket fuel. Moon landing after a few months. Mars after a year or two. By the 70s people would be exploring the outer solar system. By the 90s we'd have space odysseys in other solar systems. Imagine Voldemort researching all kinds of ancient magic and by the time he gets back to Britain it's "oh right, we got spaceships now".

*** Passenger planes no longer have a use due to portkeys (can muggles use portkeys btw?)

Imagine Voldemort in a star destroyer armadas head ship looking down at a planet and laughing evilly
