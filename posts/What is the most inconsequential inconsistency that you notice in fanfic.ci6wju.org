Mine is stories where kids in years 1-4 talk about getting an O or an E in class. That lettering system wasn't introduced until year five, and before that the students where graded using percents.

It's completely inconsequential and doesn't affect anything about the story but I always still notice it.

Meaning he would have been in his seventh year during Philosophers stone, the same book where multiple people mention that Gryffindor didn't win the Qudditch Cup since Charlie left, and act like its been years since they saw a seeker as good as him.

edit: Rowling retconned his age to being 3 years older, which still doesn't explain Gryffindor loosing in his absence.

However, in the early books, especially Book 3, there are multiple statements that indicate he should be 11 years older than Harry.

That's a very clever idea for a realistic take, even if I find it much funnier to take Crouch-Moody's word that there really is no earthly way to tell if someone has been under the Imperius or not and therefore Malfoy could just throw up his hands and go "I was Imperiused", and with a few generous donations to St. Mungo's and other wizarding charities to cement the idea that Lucius Malfoy is a good person and probably not lying in the jury's mind, he was free.

Yes, but strikingly, those are unusual applications of /magic/, and are reliant upon it. When Voldemort has a magical advantage, he knows how to use it to its full potential --- I'd also throw in, in the same ballpark, his getting Harry's blood for his resurrection to insure himself agains the Love Protection, even if it does eventually backfire somewhat.

But having the odd very very clever idea for how to apply an arcane ritual is not the same as having actual practicality and common sense.

Which is, in a strategic sense, one of the causes of the Death Eaters' downfall --- Lord Voldemort gets so very excited about having figured out (or so he thinks) how to become the master of the Elder Wand, and by the possibilities this awards him, that he does utterly stupid things like gather /all of his forces/ in one place for the good guys to defeat, and this in the process of trying to take the Castle Hogwarts through the clever tactic of just throwing all his firepower at it to see if that will work.

He caught or almost caught his most vocal enemies using something Dumbledore ingrained in his followers.

He's definitely insane. But you see hints of his underlying brilliance you can't help but be disappointed by some of his stupid mistakes.

I've always wanted to read a just as evil, sane Voldemort. Especially one that manages to win the Elder Wand's loyalty. That's a villain that'd be terrifying.

But I digress. You do have evidence both for and against ministry competence, but I lean towards against in the books.

It's just sometimes Rowling teases deeper issues in her books such as summary execution, bribery state-sponsored media, and the suspension of the British equivalent of Habeus Corpus you can't help but want a fic that addresses those issues in an entertaining, compelling way.

I'm actually fairly sure that there are more levels of recursion at play here; I think that Voldemort wanted to be able to use the Taboo someday, and so started the "don't speak my name if you are loyal to me" routine way back when. Which Dumbledore realized was the reason Voldemort was bothering to cover up his assumed name like so; and /that/ is the reason Dumbledore was so vocal about people not buying the "saying Voldemort's name is dangerous" superstition, so as to make sure that the Taboo would become useless.

His downfall was hubris and his obsession with the prophecy.

Honestly, I too dislike unintentional mixing of canons out of ignorance (although I respect people who intentionally set out to write the movie universe because they prefer it to the books)...

...but this particular issues is one of the cases where I think the movie version of events is better than the books' --- and Merlin's beard, there's one thing you don't say often about /Goblet of Fire/. I mean, if Karkaroff got off by blabbing about Death Eaters, and you also introduce, in the same book, a secret Death Eater the reveal of whose identity caused a scandal, it's self-evidently correct to connect the dots that way.

And it works up the threat of Crouch by stressing that he was cunning enough not to make the same stupid mistake as crazed Bellatrix and the Lestrange brothers, and that it is only because Karkaroff talked that the authorities even ever suspected a thing.

The book version is just far more believable for me.

And there are many reasons to prefer the movies over the books, though I don't personally: nostalgia can play a major part, of course --- if you grew up with them, and only read the books later, it's quite understandable to be fonder of them and put off by the differences in characterization --- and beyond that, I know there are film critics who think the later movies just about heroically managed to hack together a working storyline out of a meandering mess of a book series. I personally think they did so inelegantly, and that the last three or four movies are outright bad flicks on their own terms, never mind their failings as adaptations. But there is certainly an argument to be made that simplicity is their strength and one that Rowling's books do not, cannot share.

Plus, there is the argument that a story set in a magical castle with eccentric wizard Professors and evil sorcerous baddies, all else being equals, works better as a John Williams-aided high-budget special-effects extravaganza starring a smorgasbord of famous British actors, compared to just /reading/ about those things.

** On the one hand, I do genuinely try not to be that one pedantic asshole who posts an "um actually" comment on every fic I see, but on the other hand, I have a million pet peeves like this. For instance, every time I see someone blending book and movie canon, a little piece of my soul dies. That said, if I were to pick just one thing, and it's honestly not even an inconsistency, just nonsensical, it's the idea that horcruxes split the soul into precise halves. I honestly have no idea where this even came from (MatPat popularised it, but it definitely predates his (very bad (I'm not even an anti MatPatter, or whatever they're called; I generally like his content, but his HP videos suuuck! The other "theory" he put out is literally just an explicit part of canon)) video on the subject), but the whole thing just makes no sense to me and has no basis in canon.

Let's look at the evidence:

1. Voldemort 100% knew he wanted to make multiple horcruxes, so if he had any control over how much of his soul the broke off, he certainly wouldn't be doing it in even halves; he's got five more to make!

2. Think about how Slughorn describes the process of making a horcrux: he says that "the soul is meant to remain whole," that splitting it is "against nature," and that "killing rips the soul apart," operative word being "rips," none of which makes it sound like the soul is being neatly cut down the middle. It in fact sounds distinctly haphazard.

3. It . . . It's a /soul./ Like, I'm not looking to get into or to start any debates regarding the existence or lack of existence of souls in real life, since whatever you believe on the subject, it's not what we're discussing here, but, y'know, it's worth mentioning. Souls (in the fiction of the Harry Potter universe where they are very definitely real things) are /weird/: Harry being a human horcrux creates an utterly connection between him and Voldemort that even Dumbledore doesn't really understand. So why would some esoteric, weird /thing,/ that may or may not physically exist but which can, through magic, be interacted with, be evenly divided into perfect halves? Why are we even assuming that concepts like size and volume mean /anything/ when discussing a metaphysical non-object about which we know virtually nothing?

4. The numbers get, like, /really/ small. By their math, Voldemort and Nagini each have 0.0078125% of his original soul. That's less than four fifths /of a single percent/ of the whole thing! It's a /very/ stupid number, is basically what I'm getting at. But more than that, it's a very /specific/ number, one which carries with it the implicit statement of "yeah, we can totally track/calculate how much of his soul Voldemort's retained after making seven horcruxes /down to the ten-millionths place./" Fuck outta here with that.

So, yeah. That's what I have to say about that, I guess.

*** I don't think the idea sprung up from anywhere in particular. It's just that without a specific modifier, the verb "split" generally connotes splitting in halves, or roughly so. That obviously doesn't make much sense for the reasons you mention (mostly #4; I think you're overstating your case with #3, because ghosts and the Resurrection Stone's Shades show that /HP/ souls /are/ physical to some extent).

Plus, there is a fair argument that the intended reading is that it is how /mangled/ the soul is that causes this, but the fact that Voldemort gets less and less human (both in mind and body) the more Horcruxes he makes is easily red as him having less and less humanity, which scales neatly into his having less and less soul.

** I hate when everyone and their sister know about horcruxes, because ancient Egyptians made them by the boatload.\\
First, in canon, the first was created by Herpo, a Greek.\\
Second, as magical and non-magical were not separated in antiquity, we can guess that they had identical, or at least similar, religious belief: harming one's soul, in the cultural and religious context of ancient Egypt, would have been absolutely unthinkable. Among indo-europeans, it would probably been seen as wrong and disgusting, maybe even taboo. Hell, had the wizards of ancient Egypt learnt about Herpo, it wouldn't be astonishing for them to launch into a crusade to destroy him (kill the Abomination).\\
Last, for no one to try and seek to know whether Voldemort made one, for Slughorn to delusion itself into thinking that not even Voldemort would do one, for Dumbledore not to jump into em years before Harry's birth, it cannot be common knowledge. At best, it is a curiosity of Dark magic that is deep in the taboo domain.

*** If he sees himself as a girl (so probably not when he's just jinxed but when he does it on purpose) I could see his hair changing to accommodate his self-image. Or maybe the jinx works based on how the caster imagines the target as a girl, and it overpowers his magical hair (I don't think his hair was ever mentioned to be spell-resistant but I might be wrong).

I think this is just people reading too much into the bout of accidental magic Harry did when he had all his hair essentially shaved off and regrew it overnight.

Edit: though that does remind me that I don't think it's ever mentioned if anyone gets a haircut during their time at Hogwarts, or if their hair even grows during their time in the castle.

***** I like the idea that Harry's (and his paternal ancestors') hair is somehow magical because that ties in nicely with the sleakeazy thing. Everyone else probably uses spells and/or potions on their hair all the time but Harry doesn't so we never find out about it.

I think the simplest answer is that there are probably easy hair-care charms that are taught in First Year, and the students are thus expected to take care of it themselves. (Or not, at their leisure: consider Snape. And Dumbledore.)

***** It would make a lot of sense, but what I found were mostly different kinid of stories:

- linkao3(4876630) leads to Harry/Snape's son pairing (both Snape and Draco are straight and friendly, but neither of them pairs with Harry); I don't know the proper motivation of the author, there is plenty of smut involved, and I guess his fantasies are on the receiving/submissive side (there is a reasonable amount of BDSM involved). Actually, his universe is rather homophobic, so THAT is definitively not part of his fantasies. The world is quite patriarchal in the ugly and nasty meaning of the word, so there is a bit of of guy's surprise “Oh, this is what Hermione was always ranting about!” present, but not enough to make it main plot of the story.
- just contrary to yours (and my) expectations, I found more lesbian stories in the sex-change world. linkffn(11396276) is a pure porn (so, if you look for a plot, don't bother), and I found one (rather decently written) story where Harry is so unhappy with his life he in desperation wants anything to be different ... which turns into a bout of the accidental magic changing him into a girl and consequently into relationship with Susan Bones and femslash. Ahh, it is linkffn(11862560).
