Fics where harry is a reality warper would prefer it to be a harem but if not im fine just as long as its not slash with harry im fine if other chars are in an m/m relationship as long as its not harry


** Mm, I once came up with the idea of Harry receiving a set of enchanted quills; originally designed to work in conjunction with an early Room of Requirement (you write down what you want to happen in the room, and presto, it happens), the high magical energy present throughout Hogwarts causes anything written by the magical quills to become 'real' in a holodeck sense.

Hilarity would ensue as Harry, Ron and Hermione write bad fanfiction about their own lives, only for the horrible cliches they use to come to life; Dumbledore would have an incompetent goatee-wearing evil twin start wandering around, Draco Malfoy would repeatedly be kidnapped and herded away by goblins, dozens of clones of Umbridge would run around getting themselves blown up, doppelgangers of Hedwig would fly in every morning to announce X character's new titles and places in the Wizengamot...

That could be played more seriously, too, actually; Harry, blessed by the ancient god of wisdom Thoth, possesses an enchanted quill which he can use to literally overwrite the narrative and impose his wishes on the world.

** Linkffn(Lily and the art of being Sisyphus) fem Harry warps reality to pull a rabbit out of a hat. This causes problems as a creature from the abyss cannot be reasoned with.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
