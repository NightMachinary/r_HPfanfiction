** It does in canon. Newt casts alohamora on a bank vault which opens as a result. Even if you don't consider fantastic beasts canon (which I used to not), magic in Harry Potter operates conceptually and in a very versatile fashion. Magic knows what an intruder is. It doesn't test whether someone is in a database or not. Magic knows what a secret is. Unplottability means untraceability. You can confund people and objects. A freezing charm stops muggle alarms and pixies.

I don't quite think I find the concept inherently funny though. It's simply a means to an end and I would hope the wizards have good reasons for doing so, lest it simply just be wizards abusing muggles.

** Locks, yes, more or less regardless of type. Credit card readers, no.

The spell doesn't need to care about passwords or retinal scans or whatever for the same reason it doesn't conjure a physical key. It's directly manipulating the internal mechanisms of the lock. If there's a lock, and it's not charmed to resist, alohamora can probably solve it unless it's either absurdly complex or broken...and a quick reparo might get you through the latter case.

The fact that a lock uses an electronic password or retinal scanner or whatever you want doesn't change the actual bolting mechanism very much other than that a few bits and bobs get electromagnets wrapped around them instead of having a pin tumbler. All a spell has to do is move the bolt plus any bits and bobs like tumbler pins that might be blocking it from moving.

A card reader or an encrypted message doesn't have a lock mechanism, so there's no reason to expect alohamora to be useful (unless you're trying to destroy electronics and give no shits which spell you hit it with). But if you used enough finesse to avoid overloading its circuits and creating a pop fizz reaction, you could probably confund a card reader. And there are probably spells for approximating an oracle machine or a quantum computer or whatever if you wanted to do bad things to computer cryptography.

**** Something like a keypad or a retinal scanner is less part of the lock than it is a replacement for a key that can activate magnets to manipulate the lock. Keypads aren't locks, they're a thing that opens locks.

The lock is still a normal mechanical lock. You can't block a door shut with electrons, you need to use a bolt.

The spell doesn't care about keys. It opens locks.

** Quick prompt that struck me from the comments by [[/u/brassbirch][u/brassbirch]] and [[/u/copenhagem_bram][u/copenhagem_bram]]

*Prompt Start*

Harry thought back to that night. Not just the huge dog, though he wasn't forgetting that anytime soon. It was the spell Hermione had used. He hadn't seen that spell before but wow! If he could learn that he would never be locked up again!

He had asked Hermiome were she had learned that spell and she had said it was in their History of Magic book. Witches and wizards had used it in years gone by to escape from muggles it seemed.

He had spent a few hours off and on in the library before he found a book with a far more detailed explanation of the spell.

It unlocked anything! There was literally nothing you couldn't unlock with the spell! The only known way to enchant against it was through the a spell making things immobile.

A common work around for the unlocking spell was to literally key a key into an immobilization charm. So the key released the spell and the door could be opened.

The book was filled with some other dodgy information, which is likely why it was in the travelog section.

Someone had written in the margins of the book the word accio and a question mark.

That search had lead him to his next find. Accio was a summoning spell. That's all it did, summon anything. You didn't even need to technically know what it looked like or where it was.

Though a firmer image in your head helped it seemed. He practiced the spell several for days until he got it right.

He paced the hallway outside the library in his invisibility cloak ready to go inside and try his newest idea.

Summoning up the courage he froze as another simply stupid idea crossed his thoughts. Figuring it would be worth a laugh he cast the spell point while thinking of himself as a brave and glorious wizard like Godric Gryffindor had been.

"Accio Courage"

He felt his worries and fear melt away. They were replaced with a pounding of his heartbeat. The strong heartbeat of a hero among men!

"Accio Self-Worth"

Suddenly he realized what the death of his parents meant. It was a sacrifice so that he may carry on. As a dutiful son he had to do just that! He was the son of James and Lily Potter!

"Accio Honor"

No longer would he let the weight of others, the low ones, drag him down! He was a man of honor, someone who by his nature had to be better than the rest. The tip of the spear from which the rest of society rested on.

Then he realized he had been locking away his potential in fear of being seen as a freak or loosing his friends.

No more!

"Alohamora"

He felt his mind clear after his head split open in pain. Taking off his glasses he could see clearly now. He could see it all.

The sights of magic danced before his eyes as he said his final spell for the night.

"Accio potential"

A new lord of magic had been born this night, how would the world fair?

*** Harry marveled as he watched the magic of his latest spell washed over him. He could see the spell drive deep into his body as it drug his potential out. He could see his magic flowing through his body as it made his body become more.

He needed time now to think over the changes that had happened, to set about doing this properly. No longer was he going to simply bounce from event to event in his life. Now he was captain of his vessel, setting the course with clear direction and purpose!

Heading away from the library he made his way to an empty class room and looked it over. This would do for this night at least. He cast a simple lumos from his wand and stared at the magic as it pooled at the tip of his wand.

"Nox" Darkness returned to the room.

"Lumos" A bright shining light grew from his wand.

"Nox" Darkness returned to the room.

"Lumos" A bright shining light grew from his wand.

"Nox" Darkness returned to the room.

He found himself entranced with the simple magic. He could see and feel the magic gather going about it's intended purpose. That was the key he realized, the intent, his intent. His will controlling his magic, bending the universe around his will. He had this power, power focused, harnessed, and solely restrained by his will.

"Accio Will"

He could feel the magic course through his soul and mind. Repairing that which was damaged and enhancing that which was weak into something strong.

He understood even more now. From weakness grows strength, even the most mighty of objects forged started out billions of years ago as stellar matter. Through the forging, reforging, time, pressure, and final forging simple gas in space had grown to become something wondrous. Everything in fact had grown from such humble beginnings.

It was will that had shaped it all, that had shaped him into being. The will of his parents to have a child, to raise that child, to love that child and protect it regardless of the personal cost to themselves.

Will was the ultimate refiner of the universe. That which gave the unshaped, the poorly refined, the cosmos themselves purpose.

He now would find that purpose in himself. He could summon it once again but felt that would be a poorly refined one. It had to be his will alone that shaped his new purpose, to bring the ingot of iron to the spearhead cutting forth with bright edges.

Reaching out with his magic he wrapped his everything with it. His body, mind, and soul were suffused with his will driven magic. Will that he would use to hammer out a new purpose.

It struck him clearly, like a clarion call from the heavens, like the first cry of a newborn announcing to the world 'I am here, I live'.

His voice tolled across the castle deep like a tsunami break on the shore, unstoppable as a hurricane, implacable as an earthquake, and clear as the first rays of spring breaking through the winter cold.

"I am Magic! I am Will Incarnate! I am Harry James Potter Child of James and Lily Potter! I am the Spear of Destiny! From This Moment I Decree My Purpose!"

Every being within the castle for miles around woke from the wash of magic as the voice of the soon to be crowned Lord of Magic made his First Decree.

Dumbledore felt his eyes widen as he realized somehow the boy had slipped through the backdoor into true power. The realm of Grand Sorcerer's and Lords of Magic. He rushed from his room as the magic of the Decree washed over him. Marshaling himself he looked over to where Fawkes was perched. The phoenix was singing with magic as a Lord of Magic made his First Decree.

What little hope Dumbledore had that he was mistaken washed away with the waves of the Decree as he saw Fawkes. Beings of true magic, now the simple tricks that nearly all witches and wizards used, phoenix's were especially attune to such events.

He could only pray that Harry's First Decree would not be something he would grow to regret. There was a reason that the Lords had scoured and removed of the few shortcuts to becoming a Lord. Only time and experience were available now to others.

It was these things that gave them the needed thoughts to avoid making a First Decree that would set them on a path of regret. Many newly born Lords had to be brought down due to their poorly made First Decree.

Across the castle Quirrell trembled in fear as his Voldemort raged in his head. For all his self titling he was not a true Lord of Magic. No Lord Voldemort was nothing more than a, fake, lord in the sense of titles of nobility.

That his most hated of enemies had somehow stepped onto the stage of Lords at the age of 11 worried him greatly. Even compared to the least of Lords of Magic he knew he at best he could fight them off long enough to flee. He may have not been a true Grand Sorcerer yet he had the raw power, afforded through his many rituals, to contend with one. Well only if you took into account his willingness to use soul twisting dark magics best never used.

At that moment the world stilled and seemed to pause before the final words were spoken.

"My Purpose is Freedom!"

With this the world seemed to call out his name and he found the next words seeming to be spoken by his will itself, channeled through the world itself.

"I am Harry James Potter, Breaker of Chains!"

He felt lifted and free with that statement and the world resumed. All within the call now felt a wild sense of freedom fill their souls. They were alive, hear them call it forth!

The area was filled with the roars, yells, cheers and cry's of triumph as everything capable of expressing themselves celebrated being alive at that moment.

Tears streamed down faces wildly as the relished the feeling of being alive and free! Free to find themselves and that which made them shine in the infinite sky!

Dumbledore found himself letting out a cheer in excitement and overwhelming joy as he heard the First Decree.

Harry Potter would be far from the first Breaker of Chains among the Lords. They were rather easy going for the most part, you just had to point them in the direction of a long term project that would help others and it keep an eye on it. He walked over to one of his many artifacts and cast a series of spells. Well Harry's sphere of influence, his Lordly Domain, the area in which a Lord exerted their Will, was rather large. Large enough that he would hit High Lord status before turning 20.

Looking over the effects of his Lordly Domain it was a rather positive change for the school. It would free the students of their bigotry, hatred, and boredom. They would seek out change, crave to make themselves more, to become someone able to break free from the chains that tied them down.

He expected the 7th years would do quite well this year. As for the 1st years, if Harry stayed here all 7 years, they would likely all reach Sorcerer status and more than a few of them Grand Sorcerer. He expected more than a few Sorcerers and High Wizards to apply here at the school to take advantage of Harry's Lordly Domain.

Once word got out about this he would be swamped with missives of aspiring witches and wizards. Shaking his head he got to writing a quick letter for Fawkes to send off to the Lords Assembly. Handing it off to Fawkes with a smile he made his way to where he felt Harry was.

As the First Decree rolled across the land Quirrell felt himself lighten as he had not in many months as Voldemort was expelled from his head. Voldemort fled as fast as he could even as he felt the anchor in the castle tied to the Diadem of Ravenclaw snap. He rushed with a wild reckless abandon fleeing from the Lordly Domain that threatened to break all of his anchors.

He flee for days without stop crossing the ocean itself in a desperate bid to get far as possible from Harry Potter. It would take more days before his mutilated soul calmed down enough to begin planning. After all the prophecy was still in the air.

Harry stood there relishing the feeling of freedom for several minutes before he calmed down from the amazing feeling. Opening his eyes he saw Dumbledore standing there smiling in joy at the young man.

"I could use a nice hot chocolate right now, would you care to join me in the kitchens for some as well?"

He could see the Headmasters magic open and relaxing in the waves of freedom that seemed to wash from Harry.

"That sounds excellent Headmaster. I have so much to ask and I hope you could help me out."

Dumbledore noticed that Harry was no longer the timid young boy he had been. There was strength and steel in his voice. It was not harsh though, it was a reassuring voice that seemed to say 'It's okay, I understand, you are alive, I am alive, we live'. It was a sure sign of his Lordship, that every part of his being, even his voice, was infused with his will.

That he wished to proclaim his freedom was through life itself set Dumbledore even more at ease. Yes, tonight had already been long and would likely be longer.

The various heads of the houses had already tracked him down on his way to Harry. He had sent them off to explain the basics of a Lord of Magic, something he had not thought he would need to ever do in his school, to the students. He would address the whole school tomorrow at breakfast.

******* The runes fic for instance, I am almost done with the sequel for it.

It's by putting other equally as strong people beside him, then throwing them into something that should kill them even with that much of a power up.

This ficlet for a better example.

Right now Dumbledore could take him down hard and fast even if he outclasses Dumbledore.

Dumbledore has the experience in handling shit at this level so he simply knows how to handle that level.

Harry hasn't even finished his first year of school.

He simply doesn't have the wealth of knowledge, creativity, or experience yet to really express his power level.

If I continued this fic he would be drawn into the world of politics, sorta.

What do you do with a newly minted weapon of possible mass destruction that is labeled Breaker of Chain?

Point it at some shithole that's low level but corrupt as hell. Something he would have to spend time rooting out all the corruption. A nice summer project each year.

Give him a mentor to help keep him from going full destroy all evil, slippery slope that is.

After a few years of being a point and shoot WMD he realizes what is going on. That he has become aware enough is proof that he is no at least able to handle himself at the lower level of the politics of Lords.

His time in Hogwarts would be far less of a life harrowing adventure story and more of him growing into his full strength.

Of him realizing the ever widening gap between him and them.

Of self doubt as he had essentially cheated his way into power.

Of realizing the dangerously sweet seduction of having so much power.

After all if Malfoy and the whole of Slytherin have essentially reformed out of fear of him why shouldn't he use his powers to help everyone?

Then you know figuring out he is not a god and it's probably best to not try set himself up as one.

That first summer would be him going to Georgia üá¨üá™, the country, and tearing down a rising dark wizard.

He would be learning how much more powerful his magic is now. Also dealing with the moral choices of whether to kill others or not.

Second summer would be him heading to Somalia, to fight actual mother fucking pirates! Which is a thing, Somalian Pirates, in the real world, crazy.

So second summer would be tracking down secret hidden islands, wizarding slave trading, and finally an epic sea battle fighting an enchanted pirate ship with a crew of magical warriors. It would take longer than expected and he would finish up in November.

Which is where he would truly understand what his First Decree meant. The thought of leaving and coming back made him physically ill.

He had to stay on, to clean up this mess of slavery and vileness. His First Decree literally made anything trying to go against setting the people free and destroying the tyrants hurt him.

All of that school year would be dealing with that aftershock. As well as an extremely unpleasant day as he flips his shit over the bullying of Luna Lovegood.

He planned to stay at Hogwarts that summer but he really had an itch to go out and help.

So he walks around Hogsmeade and realizes that the war may have been over but they hadn't really won.

Queue investigation mode Harry. To know how to set them free from having so little to look forward to daily he has to learn about it all.

Third summer going into his 4th year is a summer of growth for him.

Not all problems can be solved by just going in and smashing the shit out of stuff until problem solved.

He does not get tied up in the triwiz at all. He does have something similar to "Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament" going on with some other similar stories as general reference.

Pretty much Fleur, and most girls/young women, are chasing the hottest teenage bachelor in the world right now.

This isn't some fan wank harem shit. This is lots of confusing, for him, stuff as tons of politics he is, rather slowly, getting a clue about.

Then someone, likely a ministry stooge, steps out of line to far. Harry isn't used to playing word games or understanding an enemy now can be a useful ally later.

Nope, he goes full Leroy Jenkins and clean house. Which leads into his next summer. He has smashed the entirety of Magical Britian to bits. Huge chunks of the ministry, 'reformed' death eaters, and a few collateral deaths, have been left for others to pick up the pieces.

As he is currently hammer smashing the fuck out of North Korea.

He cools down after essentially leveling North Korea, fighting their one Lord and comes back to help clean up his mess.

/That is a nice outline actually, may have to bring this to life sometime next month/

Just an idea, on how to handle overpowered people. Bog them down with character growth, life happening, and force them to do research/investigation stuff. That can really slow them down and let your few battles at that level be the special thing they should be.

Afterall if you have someone capable of wrecking a small city with relative ease, fighting near daily, well, you would have a really beat the hell up world rather quickly.
