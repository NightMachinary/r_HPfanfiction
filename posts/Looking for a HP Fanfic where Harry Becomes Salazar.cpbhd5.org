I read the story a little while ago and can't seem to find it among my bookmarks now, but I'd really like to find it since its been stuck in my head recently.

I can't remember the how or why but Harry is somehow back in time and effectively immortal if I remember it right. He lives through time, has children, learns different styles of magic's and basically lives as others do in those times, and eventually he lives into the Founders Era where he goes on to become Salazar Slytherin.

Though its not the name he's been living under, Godric I believe bestows the name Slytherin on him as a nickname for something.

If anyone can recall the fic's name I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.
