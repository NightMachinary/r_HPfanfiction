I've developed a fascination with Professor Flitwick in the last few months. However, I got the impression that almost all fics which feature him in a more important role are either badly written or abandoned. So now I'm searching for good and completed fics with him as a major character. I would prefer if it mostly focused on the interactions with his students (e.g. the choir or his head of house duties). Thanks in advance!


** Well this is Flitwick-centered, and while he isn't a professor, he is teaching Tom to duel in the There is Nothing (to fear) series, which centers on a Tom Riddle who was sorted into Gryffindor. It's neither poorly written, nor abandoned.

The whole series is rather short (23.4k words in total), but if you only want to read the parts with Flitwick you'd only need Part 2, Men who are Resolved, followed by Part 5, According to his Own Nature.

** I wish I knew more fics of what you're looking for. The only ones that are semi close are goblin raised Harry fics.

I read linkffn(Harry Potter and The Labyrinth (Year one)) about a week ago and it was a decent read. You get some Flitwick but he's not a main character. Interesting read though.

A year ago I read Harry Crow by RobSt. Can't really remember much of it but I'm pretty sure Flitwick is in there since it's about goblins. I don't know if I actually finished reading this one.

  What if Dudley made a wish but then didn't follow through? what if the King of the Goblins knew who Harry Potter was and how important he was? What if he adopted him to be his Son and Heir? how would this affect Harry's life and fate? some Dumbledore bashing and slight Weasley bashing

** I don't remember if it's finished but linkffn(easier than falling asleep) might be something you're interested in. Flitwick is a prominent character.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.

** Linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) is a four part Fem!Harry story in which Flitwick plays a much bigger role than you usually see. He isn't a main character but he interacts with the main character a lot.

The story is complete, but be warned this story triggers a lot of people. The worst triggers are in the first four chapters. If you can survive that you can read the whole series.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. Unfortunately, the last time I attempted to read it I started having flashbacks again. So it wasn't really for me. But the part I did read seemed well-written so maybe someone else is able to handle it better than I can and is able to enjoy the story :)

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
