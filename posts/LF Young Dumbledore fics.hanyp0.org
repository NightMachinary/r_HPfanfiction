I think a fic about Albus Dumbledore as a young man could be really interesting. Aberforth's conversation with Harry & co about Albus always fascinated me.

#+begin_quote
  “I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural.”

  ...

  “I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth's wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,' ” Aberforth sneered. “He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.

  ...

  “Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?
#+end_quote

The window into Albus' childhood (from Aberforth's biased perspective) raises so many tantalizing questions. What was Albus' relationship with his family? What exactly did Aberforth mean by his 'secrets and lies' line? What was Albus' relationship with Grindlewald really like, and what attracted him to Grindlewald's ideology? Why was he so interested in the Hallows--to bring his parents back to life as 'Master of Death'? I'd love to read a fanfic that explores this part of Albus' life, but I've never come across one.

**** Yes! And they can be quite good actually. Most deal with Harry getting over whatever Dumbledore did to him, and explore a relationship based on mutual respect and admiration. Plus a lot of flirty magic which I love. A lot of the time I find that a lot of fics forget how much adults would play around with magic in relationships, or even in dating.

happy reading! I hope you'll like it. I think one or two in this list are gen fics, but they're pretty Dumbledore centric and depict him as young.

#+begin_quote
  The year was 1943; Dumbledore really didn't like these political parties that the Ministry organised every summer, not when Hitler and Grindelwald were out there, destroying the world as they knew it. Bored out of his mind, with Minerva on his arm, he really wasn't expecting to bump into Harry Jones, much less, that this man might turn the tide in the war... HP!Time-Travel

  With nothing left to lose, Harry sends himself as far back into the past as his death will allow him. Tom Riddle is easy enough to take care of, but there are more threats than just the teenage Dark Lord. HP/AD slash. Time Travel

  Albus was the only one awake in the castle. It was late at night, and he was stalling for time, not really up for more paperwork. Suddenly, a ripple in the wards sent him hurrying towards the source of the disturbance. Nothing could have prepared him for what he would find. And with Harry's luck, is anyone really surprised? Time-Travel fic.

  Harry wasn't expecting romance or a fresh start, not after all the people he's killed. Then he gets thrown into a dimension with a certain Headmaster who coudln't possibly be flirting with him... right? Warnings: SLASH, MATURE, VIOLENCE, AU, ADHP. No underage relationships.
