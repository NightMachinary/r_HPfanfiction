When I started reading FanFiction ages ago I read a Harry slash story. Think it was a George pairing. It was all AH, they were poor and Harry was dancing ballet I think. Also believe he might have lived on the street for a while.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.
