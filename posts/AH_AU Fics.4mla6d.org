I used to be into the Southern Vampire Mysteries series years ago and there was a lot of all human/alternate universe fics. All human was especially appealing since it quite literally made the characters human, without supernatural powers. I've been wondering if this is a thing in the HP fanfic world? I would love to read a lame coffee shop meet-cute fic or a boarding school without magic but Harry still manages to get into weird predicaments fic. Or is this just not a thing for HP fic?


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Check "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. No Magic, but James Bond technology. Hogwarts is a school for spies and commandos. It's very good, and it portrays the growing crush and love Hermione has on and for Ron nicely from early on. It also avoids a number of plotholes, and doesn't strictly follow the stations of canon.

** AH/AU is not something I've come across within the HP fandom - in fact its usually the reverse with characters being reinvented as Vampires, Werewolves, Fae . etc.

Just the other day in [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] someone posted a fascinating breakdown of how FSOG developed from the AH/AU community within the Twilight fandom (and why it made people so angry) but also gave a fascinating commentary on how the AH/AU trope developed there. I'm sorry I don't remember what thread it was in.

  When Crown Prince James Potter goes in disguise amongst his people to uncover why his flourishing kingdom is under economic crisis, he doesn't know what he'll discover. He certainly doesn't expect corruption amongst the Lords, nor an underground Revolution. He definitely doesn't expect to be bested, and fall for the clever blind bandit, Regulus Black.

** If you're cool with slash and like YA fiction, Text Talk by MerlyWhirls is great.

This is a GREAT non-magic modern MWPP AU where Remus isn't at hogwarts. He is homeschooled and has a chronic illness (it starts a little "a fault in our stars" like). Sirius and Remus text back and forth and slowly start a friendship and then a relationship.

I LOVED this fic. It gave me butterflies about 1000 times and I was just rooting for Sirius and Remus so much I couldn't put this down.

Also, this is unrated by the author, but it's firmly T. Linkao3(1651109)

**** Awful. The issue is that with the potterverse, taking away their magic doesn't really change much. They're still humans. They still interact. They can still have idiotic prejudices. The only difference is they no longer carry a wand.

***** I'm going to have to disagree there; magic is a pillar, if not the one and only pillar, holding up the HPverse. Without magic, we lose all context of the conflict that occurs in the series, and how it affects the major players in the series.

Without magic, they're still human, yes, but unexceptional, mundane humans with nothing to separate themselves from others. And of course they'll still interact, but, again, context is lost: Draco can't insult Hermione for being a muggleborn if everyone is a muggle. And they'll still probably have prejudices, like a Malfoy's typical classist sneering at Ron, but the major reason for why a pureblood discriminates--magical inclination and heredity, or not--is lost because there is /no such thing/ as magic in this world. In fact, I'd argue it's much more important than the characters simply not carrying a wand. Without magic, all of the villains in the series have no platform to stand on: Tom Riddle is now a mortal man who hasn't the means to outrun death in any way, and has to accept he'll die because he can't make a horcrux; The Malfoys are now just poncey effete arseholes, rather than fanatics of a madman; Bellatrix no longer has rhyme or reason as to why she kills... et cetera.

These villains lose all sense and purpose without magic; you'd have to completely reinvent their motivations and prejudices for their actions to make any sense. I think this is why these fics are terrible, because writers are quick to nix magic, without really understanding the narrative ramifications of removing it from the series.

****** Well, I guess you haven't read *[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]* yet. This fic has done a great job transplanting HP characters to a non-magical setting.

For example, Riddle's ideology changed from blood purity to aristocratic elitism and totalitarianism. Malfoys were rich and bigoted aristocrats who looked down on anyone sympathetic to commoners.

Riddle's horcruxes became memory capsules, which were produced by even more horrific procedures than in canon (each memory capsule required killing dozen of victims and extracting their brain parts and spinal cord fluids). Riddle also manufactured many clones, hidden in his underground bases.

So, it always comes down to writer's ability. Yes, it's very very difficult to write a good HP fic with no magic, but it can be done.

** One I enjoyed but can't locate was a streets/elite dancing school mix. It was odd and there were stuff that I would have tweaked but it had moments where it really worked. Basic premise was that Harry kind of lived with Vernon but also roamed the streets with a bit of a gang with his friends. He applies and gets accepted into this elite dancing school. I think it was leaning towards a Harry/Draco thing, but there was some mobster Tom Riddle stuff going on too.
