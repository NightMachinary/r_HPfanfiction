:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello I'm looking for a specific fanfic where Sirius Black ends up in a pairing with a veela who turns out to be Fleur's aunt. Fleur does not know that her aunt's suitor is in any way connected to Harry Potter until the Yule ball at Hogwarts where she refers to Harry as her favourite nephew.

Thanks for any help.


** Was the OFC Veela named Kalina? If so, it might be Weres Harry. She's Fleur's cousin in that fic though. That exact exchange with Harry happens at the Yule Ball though. It's in Chapter 11.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
