** Aight, first, [[/u/Psantium]]? You're knocking this Wiki out of the goddamn park.

So, my favorite crossover is linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao). This is a Harry Potter/The Mummy (1999 movie) crossover, centered on Bill Weasly It's short, and still incomplete, but damn near every word in it is perfectly placed. The prose is amazing. The worldbuilding is damn good. The magic is wonderful. Go read this, and hopefully Zenzao will get more words of it out.

Fun fact: I always have to look up the name of this fic, because I spell Hamunaptra as Harmunaptra and I know that isn't right, but my brain can never recall the correct spelling.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

Even without much knowledge of Avatar or the sequel, I thought it was a pretty nice fic.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** linkffn(4183715) Awaken Sleeper is rather good. It's a Dresden crossover.

linffn(11132888), The Dementor and the Mind Game, is an Ender's Game crossover that I'd like to recommend, though it's unfortunately abandoned. It's pretty short, unfortunately.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land. But all the obstacles he has faced pale in comparison to the Cylon menace. Starts in the middle of Harry's fifth year and roughly eleven years before the fall of the Twelve Colonies.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
