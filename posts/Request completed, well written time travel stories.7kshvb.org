No character bashing

Harry doesn't have to be the only one to time travel, others can as well.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione pairings but any other pairings are fine.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** Huh. I'm interested in your opinion that Backward With Purposes sequels are unneeded, because in my mind (or at least my recollection thereof; I haven't read it in a few years) the story as a whole was really made by its sequel. Backwards With Purpose and The Book Of Albus felt more like companion novels than a book and its follow-up to me, with the BWP being incomplete/having a whole bunch of loose ends/not being as powerful or interesting without the Book Of Albus.

But! As I said, I'm really interested to hear what you think. What to you made the sequel feel unnecessary? Or I guess a better question may be: what was it you valued about the original that the sequel didn't expound upon?

***** Luckily I happened to stop by this thread again, but you replied to the bot my friend.

I couldn't really bring myself to care about Albus all that much. The conflicts facing the people I /did/ care about (Harry, Ginny, Ron) had already been resolved. Yes it solved a couple plot holes and help fill-in the blanks of the moments where Harry magically gets the help of a random stranger during the main adventure. I just didn't feel like it was necessary to get all the details, given that the end of part one essentially gives us a basic rundown and reveals who Merlin is. I was happy with the way the first part ended, and it could have stayed a lone novel as far as I'm concerned.

I guess I didn't need to know the details. I was more attached to the main trio than I was to Albus, and the incredible amount of angst (which I enjoyed, at the time) wasn't really as significant since the main events had already happened.
