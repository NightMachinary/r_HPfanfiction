Essentially, I'm looking for a fic that focuses upon the (contrived) family drama of the WBWL trope, without bypassing its deleterious effects upon Harry by making him the smartest or most powerful wizard of them all. Something like /Harry's Decision/, perhaps, which, despite a truly horrible title, is a reasonable look at family dynamic where the parents were forced to abandon Harry at the Dursley's. And interestingly, in this story the abandonment created problems for the remaining kids, because the Potters were reasonable people and mourned the necessity of being away from their child - which is something you rarely see in this trope.

linkffn(5459861)

Ps. Another fic that stands out in this regard is linkffn(5757945). Too far from home is an alt. universe travel fic where the Potter family and co. despite empathizing within him greatly, has issues with taking him in because of the dangers he represents. Some of them are staunchly on his side; others, are dead set against him, for good reason, while one or two straddle the line. The story features an astounding betrayal, interesting discussions, a well done alt. universe sibling pair, and while it has a bit too much of melodrama and it is easily on one the best of its type. Canon Harry isn't the WBWL exactly, but he is definitely the less wanted child, so it sorts of fits into the thematic concerns of the WBWL trope.

** Not sure if this is too "super Harry" for you (personally I don't find it to be bad in that regard what so ever -- Harry is a lot more resourceful than in canon, but not to an absurd degree)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
