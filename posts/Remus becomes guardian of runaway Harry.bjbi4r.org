:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a completed fic with a sequel. Remus takes care of an exploited run away Harry when he is found at 13. Harry has a lot of baggage from his time on the streets and is worried he killed a man on the streets. The Ministry doesn't want Remus to have custody but they can't separate the two. An escaped Sirius deliriously attacks them but it later becomes a Remus/Sirius fic in the sequel. Thank you for the help.
