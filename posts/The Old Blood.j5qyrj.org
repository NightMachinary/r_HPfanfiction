Cold, pitiless green eyes bored into Dumbledore's own: an unnatural chill began to slowly creep up his spine and he heard, however distantly, the indistinct whispers of /things/ promising forbidden secrets and tales of the world.

"The boy is ours, little human. No matter how diluted his blood is, the bonds of kinship remain unbroken." It tilted its head at him, and he swore it would have been in condescension, if it thought like a person. "His life now is fleeting. One day, a hundred years, it matters not. We will wait. And he will take his rightful place in our Court."

And then it was gone, as thought it had never been.

Much to Harry's frustration, Dumbledore had another, more important reason not to look Harry in the eyes his Fifth year.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU
