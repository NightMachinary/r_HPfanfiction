Are there any recommended fics that have well written villains? As opposed to Tom handing out cruciatus curses like candy, or Dumbledore forgetting the 'master manipulator' part in his frenzy to control Harry's every waking second.

A good example being Quirrel from HPMOR's earlier chapters or even in canon's book 1. If you don't already know they're bad news, theres nothing obvious to give it away, but once you figure it out theres a lot of "ohhhh... ... crap" fridge horror about some of their actions.


** Other than my stock recommendations of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] by Wildbow (not at all HP) and The Alexandra Quick Series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]] (only the slightest bit HP) , both of which feature wonderfully complex villains, Harry Potter is difficult in this regard because JK Rowling kind of sucks at writing villains. Any good villains in the HP universe have to be either OCs or wildly AU. That said, I would say that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquise Black and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] by AngelaStarCat all do a decent job at making their villains mysterious, ominous, or menacing.

Edit: I want to clarify what I meant by 'sucks at writing villains', because it bothered me when I re-read it. Rowling is very good at setting up the surprise reveal: Quirell is Quirellmort! Moody is Crouch Jr! What she isn't good at is building multidimensional villains. Once you're aware of those surprises (as everybody who reads fanfiction is) there is very little of interest left. Voldemort, Pettigrew, Crouch Jr, Umbridge, they are all not only evil, they are horribly unpleasant people. She not only doesn't explore their varying pathos much at all, the characters as written are so unpleasant that it is AU to write them as anything other than purely evil. There are interesting concepts there to be sure, but its really up to the fandom to do the heavy lifting of developing those villains. /rant.

*** Regarding your rant... YES! That's what I was trying get at when I posted this. Though I would point out that in addition to the surprise reveal, JKR is also very good at (accidentally or on purpose? I don't know) weaving fridge horror into the stories.

**** Indeed, those moments in GoF where Neville is unknowingly having heart to heart chats with the psychopath who tortured his parents into insanity are deeply creepy.

***** And that's where JKR shines. She writes minor villains well. Umbridge because of the way we identify with her character. Same with the Dursleys.

Crouch because of the scenes with Neville (even under the poly juice).

Lockhart is a buffoon but is generally well received in Wizarding world.

Peter is a wonderfully written sniveling coward, Lucius is the perfect smarm.

She just has issues with the Big Bads.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]] has a fascinating take on Voldemort and his relationship to Harry. Voldemort essentially ends up mentoring Harry, yet Harry is still recognisably the Hero we expect and him to be, and Voldemort is still quite Villainous, or at least, power-hungry and competent. Their relationship is very complex, abusive, even. Added bonus: it has a well imagined Britain where Voldemort won the first war, and a pretty decent Snape.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]] has an OC called Gallowbraid as its major villain. he is introduced as Moody's sworn enemy, and generally makes for a better villain than most versions of Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  /"For the Aurors, the name Gallowbraid was an in-joke---it meant a non-existent person, a red herring. The phrase 'to chase a gallowbraid' meant to pursue a figment of one's imagination. This phrase originated from Alastor Moody's allegations that a Dark Wizard called 'Andros Gallowbraid' was the perpetrator of certain crimes during and after the first reign of the Dark Lord. Having no records of such a man or any proof of his existence, however, it was widely believed that the aging Auror was steadily going senile, that Gallowbraid was simply a concoction of some of the worst Dark Wizards he had sent to Azkaban, and a convenient villain to blame for the cases he could not solve./

  /Now, of course, we know better. Sadly, that knowledge came after the damage had been done."/
