** Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

Sometimes it's the other way around. Like, I have a rotten spell and every fic I try reading ends up sucking for a few weeks. Then I revisit the canon series and it feels like a breath of fresh air.

If you ever get sick of Ginny slipping Harry love potions, all Slytherins secretly being misunderstood saints, Harry inheriting half of london because his great great grandpa was Godric Gryffindor or eleven year old children speaking with each other like they're in parliament --- reading the actual books can be a good palate cleanser to set your head straight.

Something that I've rarely seen fanfic do right (outside of crackfics) is a serious Harry who lashes out with moments of snarkiness. That situational humor that fits the context and characters involved is one of the best parts of Harry's character, and makes him loveable even when he is being angsty or powerless, the most frustrating parts of his character. This is how the books remind me why I love Harry Potter all over again. And humor like this is timeless, so it's still good in re-reads, unlike OOC character humor exaggerating traits for laughs, eg "Ron stuffs his face like a glutton" or "Dumbledore laces his lemon drops with loyalty potions". Nor does it age as poorly as referential or "punching down" humor. (See: A Black Comedy and the midget parts.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry's Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked round and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes," said Harry stiffly.

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.
#+end_quote

And this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Why were you lurking under our window?"

  "Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice.

  His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. "Listening to the news! Again?"

  "Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.

**** This is why I really don't like the humour in the Black Comedy and don't understand why it's so popular. There are some fics that capture Harry's sassy humour though, they are just rare in fanfiction. Some examples I can think of that do include some of Harry's sassyness and sarcasm are linkao3(Harry potter and the problem of potions) and linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom)

  “You are unlikely to poison yourself. No more than two doses a day, do not use stale frogspawn, and do not share. I will not have another amateur apothecary set up behind my back.”

  “...does that happen a lot, professor?” Harry said, grabbing his jar back before Professor Snape could change his mind.

  “Students are my punishments for my sins.”

  “You must have an awful lot of sins, then,” Harry said, and froze as he saw Professor Snape's expression

It has the "popcorn humor" of a frathouse comedy. Like the fanfic equivalent of Zoolander, it features zany character antics, which, due to the suspension of disbelief in crackfics, don't have to follow the rules of OOC that more serious fics are expected to adhere. Memorable, quotable zinger one-liners, like Zoolander's "But why male models?" or "Is this a house for ants?".

But just like Zoolander, it's very obviously a fic of its times. The social attitudes of the early 2000's were far less thoughtful and diplomatic than today's sensibilities. A house elf named Nappy and "teehee, no homo" jokes aren't that funny in this day and age.

Before then it's all fratboy hijinks with Sirius, but then Voldemort and That Fucker start taking prominence and there's the twist over That Fucker's identity at the end.

I agree the exact humor and jokes used haven't aged well, but the bones of a good story are still there.

Is this humour not still popular with certain groups of people though? I always thought it was due to me not being a guy and disliking 'frat boy' type humour in general. There are still a lot of comedy shows and movies I avoid today because I find them not funny and distasteful just like this fic.

** I wouldn't say that reading fanfiction /ruined/ canon for me, but it did cause me to look at the original books in a different light. Then again, rereading the books with my adult perspective probably would have caused me to be more critical of them regardless of any fanfic I read. In particular, I'm less forgiving of some of the character flaws that were played for laughs in the books but in retrospect are egregious.

I still love what JKR made, and I love the fact that she created such beautifully fertile ground for others to build upon. I can examine the flaws in the things I love without losing my love for the work overall.

What are these character flaws, out of curiosity?

The one that stood out for me, re-reading the books in a post-social media era, was Hermione's textbook "Not Like the Other Girls" personality. Her closest friends are boys, she has no girl friends even after living with a bunch of girls for 6 years, is proud of her low-maintenance appearance, and is disparaging toward other girls for having girly or feminine interests. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, because Hermione was held up for a long time (in my mind, and in other people's) as an example of a great female character/protagonist/deuteragonist.

**** Discussions on this sub led me to realize more of Hermione's flaws, including the one you mentioned, but when I re-read the first five books, what stood out most for me is Ron's flaws and the black-and-white way the narative treats bullies.

Regarding Ron, during my re-read I noticed things like what he had to say about his Squib relative, his complete lack of caring about the topic of slavery, his gawking at Neville's parents as if they were an entertaining spectacle, etc. As a kid I just glossed over that, but I'm less forgiving now.

Regarding bullies, until book 6 the Harry Potter series follows the same narrative trend of other YA novels such as /Ender's Game/: When the main character is tormented by a bully the MC chooses to take matters into their own hands rather than get help from an adult. The MC retaliates with even greater force than the bully used, giving worse than they got, and the narative congratulates them for this eye-for-an-eye win. Looking back, I recognise how I internalized that message from this and other books, and realise it's not a good message to give preteens. Attempting to resolve conflicts that way in reality creates a whole mess of worse problems.

***** I think Ron's character, and his character flaws, fit in with how the rest of the Weasleys are portrayed. Namely, the narrative tells us they're great, the Burrow is Harry's home away from "home", but when you look closer, the shine comes off them. Some readers handwave it with "Oh, all families have their troubles and flaws", but goddamn, sometimes this family gets real toxic.

Here's how the story tells you that the Weasleys are meant to be good and heroic to our plucky orphan eyes:

#+begin_quote
  Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.

  The end of the summer holidays came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at The Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up in Privet Drive.
#+end_quote

.

In reality, the Weasley parents buy Percy a new owl for making prefect, while Ron gets a secondhand junk wand. Fred and George bully Percy and change his badge to read "Bighead Boy", and scar Ron for life with the spider teddy bear prank, while Molly is too busy doing something else to enforce discipline. The term "scarlet woman" gets tossed around the house and Ron ends up bringing it to school, a parallel to the Malfoy family teaching Draco to throw slurs like "mudblood" around at school. Mrs. Weasley says "That's everyone in the family" when Ron gets his prefect badge, leading to Fred and George's "What are we, next door neighbors" line.

#+begin_quote
  "I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"

  "What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.
#+end_quote

.

Though just like the narrative treatment of bullying that you mentioned, in this case, the narrative is incredibly tolerant and accepting of people deemed "heroic", to the ridiculous extreme of Harry naming his son after Snape and Dumbledore.

*** Individual fics may not be better than canon but they often give a lot more depth to certain characters and groups than canon. Slytherins in the books are mostly a one dimensional group of bad guys. The better members include Andromeda who we know almost nothing about, Slughorn who plays favorites and ignores non important students and Snape who may as well be a villain. At least fanfiction tries to portray slytherins as a more balanced group. Voldemort/Tom Riddle are also given way more depth in fanfiction than canon.

As a whole I do agree that no fanfiction comes close to being as good and complete worldbuilding wise as the original Harry Potter books. The fact that all of us here are still reading and writing HP fanfiction based on the books and not on some random fanfic speaks for itself.

Many fanfics have started off brilliantly, and then have been completely derailed later on, while others read like trash initially, but later chapters elevate the quality. Also, while I've never read a fic of higher quality than canon, I've certainly read fics that I've enjoyed more than canon, weirdly.

  To be fair, with GoT, the ending wasn't the problem, it was the way they executed it. The ending was rushed as hell, and entire plot threads were thrown out to get there, which is what makes it bad. The ending is almost certainly going to the the ending GRRM gives us in the books, it's just that it won't be as badly executed.
#+end_quote

GRRM said that the show was killing off people he wasn't planning to kill off (or straight up not casting characters he'd planned things for), and it was creating an alternate timeline as the narrative consequences of those deaths and absences made it diverge from his plans for the books. I agree that we'll largely see the same ending, but there could be twists we weren't expecting.

My absolute favourite Harry Potter fanfic right now is The Dogfather by Hollimichele. It's an incredibly touching kidfic that makes me smile every time I re-read it. But I know it doesn't even touch canon in terms of quality.

The books were such a staple of my childhood, and I read them over and over, but after a while I grew out of them a bit. By the time the 6th and 7th books were released I only read them once apiece and then continued on my merry way with fan fiction. By that point I enjoyed the fics that had dynamic plots and interesting world building (grown from the world I already loved), more than I enjoyed the books themselves.

Canon ruined it for me, but when I found out what fanfiction was, it truly gave me pleasure in the series. Because it explored different routes, or expanded in some areas where the book didn't. Or perhaps it took a different route, leading to a completely different story. It wasn't just simply Harry surviving, or the plot giving him just enough to get through the task that it had in store. Rather, it was and is Harry learning and exploring more of the wizarding world and not just Harry using the bare minimum to get through.

I don't want to say I've outgrown it, but I was never really in love with/nostalgic for HP in the same way that I love(d) a lot of my childhood favourites. In that sense I've found a lot more satisfaction in fix-its and other fanfic than I have in the original canon, purely because they tick my “This is what I wanted to read” and “Shiny new story is shiny” boxes. A lot of what I read is divergent to the point of almost being origfic.

With a couple of my fandoms, the world feels very wide to me. There's more of a sandbox, although the canon itself is more ‘closed'. I could cheerfully read six novels' worth of slice of life in those fandoms. This is hard to explain well, sorry.

A problem I have with fanfiction though, is how so many fanfics try to address these problems rather than just write a completely different story. Sometimes people write a fanfic /just/ to try and fix something, rather than write an actually interesting story. People go the manipulative Dumbledore route because of him leaving Harry on a doorstep etc., but that's usually just substituting a plot hole for a boring, one-dimensional antagonist.

Also I take the books as they are - stories for kids, yes, but stories more specifically /aimed at British kids, mainly boys, in the 1990s/.

(I tried some different synonyms of awesome, but really, to me that is the word that defines him. Definition of awesome: extremely *impressive* or *daunting*; inspiring great admiration, *apprehension*, or *fear.*)

**** Canon feels like a first graders fingerpainting. While fanfiction feels more like an oil painting done with more intricate detail

** Well a little I guess, although I spend most of my time reading fanfiction because they're interesting and well written

** Not really, no.

Book Harry and I guess Movie Harry are just really interesting to me along with Luna, Ron, Neville etc, I enjoy rereading the books a lot.

There fanfics I consider hilarious but none that have surpassed canon story-wise.

I can understand why it would for some people though.

** I wouldn't say that it “ruined” the canon series for me. Though I can now say that I hate Hermione, Snape, and Ginny so much more now. The characterizations that are used in the fanfics are so imprinted on me that I can't stand them in canon.

** I read the books 3 Christmas as ago for the first time and immediately dove into the fanfic world, looking for /more/. I read little else anymore, and I've tried to start a reread of the books a few times and just can't get into the first one.

**** It's really true. My husband teases me all the time. I actually have a stack of books from the library that every time I get a few pages in, I go back to my fanfic fix. There's so much /good/ writing out there (there's a lot of bad too) that I don't want to miss any of it

** Nah. Most ff just make me hate to be part of this community.

The amount of bashing and gayshit(the bad stuff) is absurd and the quality is so depressing low. What do I expect from fanfiction but come on, why the fuck is it the top 10 HP ff of all time. Do we have no taste at all?
