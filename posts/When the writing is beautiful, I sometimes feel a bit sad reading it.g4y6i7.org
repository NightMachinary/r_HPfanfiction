Mostly when it's well written bittersweet or heartbreaking scenes, but sometimes even a super large dose of fluffiness can do that. Has anyone ever feel the same? I guess people say so beautiful it hurts for a reason lol.


** Yes, I feel this! I'm a sucker for beautiful prose; it can really immerse you in the emotions of a character and have you feel what they're feeling along with them.

This is one of my favourite passages from any Harry Potter fic and it always gives me the Feelsâ„¢.

  He missed Potter. He missed him like a fire in winter, melting the snow off soaked robes and the chill from his bones. He missed him like a thunderstorm in summer, wild and terrifying and beautiful, bringing the clean wash of rain to parched earth. He missed him like a hunger, like the taste of fresh fruit, the first trickle of water after starvation. He missed him like life; he missed him like death.

  He missed him like the heart he did not possess.
