Just wanted to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-2ZxldMO-M][share this.]] Key and Peele did a fun inner-city wizard school sketch.

And amazingly, there's fanfiction out: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5471486]]


** Thanks, great sketch, as always from Key & Peele. And with linking a relevant fic you even kept the post on-topic for this sub, kudos ;)

*** Honestly, I ran across the fanfic and thought it needed some more eyeballs, and they didn't post it under Harry Potter.

*** The name of the youtube channel, which is run by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. The latter is pretty well known, he has after all won an Academy Award and was nominated for more for a movie he wrote, directed, produced and acted in. "Get Out" is the name of the movie, its great. And he has acted in a ton of other pretty good movies and shows. Also a great voice actor.

**** Oh okay, thank you Blubbery! I have never heard of them before though, and I haven't ever seen a movie called Get Out before either. I do not really pay attention to who made a movie or not anyway, yes I just watch them and like them. :)
