:END:
Okay. So, lately, I have been trying to find one very good one-shot that hasn't left my head. It's about a recently freed Sirius and his friend Remus listening Dumbledore on the Wireless about forgiveness and second chances for members of the Dark Faction. They think, after everything lost, that the Death Eaters shouldn't let free to keep causing suffering as they please, especially after the war and the deaths of the Potters. So, after taking back a young Harry from the Dursleys, they fight the Wizengamot using the traditional rules (with the help of people like Augusta Longbottom) to make sure that not a single more person is lost, against the wishes of the Headmaster. If there is anybody who knows where can I find this work of Fanfiction, I would be very grateful for any kind of help.

#+begin_quote
  A collection of drabbles, test-of-concept chapters, and initital chapters of story bunnies I may write someday. Either that or I've written them down to get them out of my head so I can focus on my current stories. Many are cross-overs. Note: This is listed as Harry Potter Characters but that's not always the case.
