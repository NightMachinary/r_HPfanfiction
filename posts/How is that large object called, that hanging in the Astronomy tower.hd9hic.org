[solved]

It's some kind of model that shows orbits, but what would I need to enter into the google search bar in order to find more of its kind?

I don't know how to call it in my first language, let alone English. Plz help.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe][Astrolabe]] is usually flat, not three-dimensional. Or it could be other of many [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomical_instruments][astronomical instruments]].

*** Thank you! It's an Armillary sphere I was looking for!

For anybody else interested:

  By moving the armillary rings, you could theoretically demonstrate how the stars and other celestial objects [[https://www.thoughtco.com/stargazing-through-the-year-4064509][moved in the sky]]. However, these armillary spheres reflected early misconceptions of astronomy. The spheres depicted the Earth at the center of the universe, with interlocking rings illustrating the circles of the sun, moon, known planets, and important stars (as well as the signs of the zodiac). This makes them a model of the inaccurate [[https://www.thoughtco.com/claudius-ptolemy-3071076][Ptolemaic]] (or Earth-centered) cosmic system (as opposed to the way things actually work, by the [[https://www.thoughtco.com/nicolau-copernicus-profile-1788688][Copernican System]], with the sun as the center of the solar system.) Armillary spheres often got geography wrong, too---Caspar Vopel's sphere, for instance, depicts North America and Asia as one land mass, a common misconception of the time.
