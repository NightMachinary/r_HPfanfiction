Could be a crackfic, could be fics where dumbledore and harry are just good friends.

Complete and over 60k words preferred. Thanks :)


** Let's get these out of the way just because they get recommended here a /lot/. Both are great stories, both are quite cracky.

Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)\\
The premise is exactly what it says on the tin. Harry's a dragon, and that's pretty much the /least/ of the changes in this fic. Dumbledore is goofy-but-supercompetent, which means Voldemort is barely a problem at any point.

Albus And Harry's World Trip: linkffn(13388022)\\
Harry gets expelled after the Chamber incident. Albus, not having been re-instated as Headmaster, takes him on a world trip.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Ingenio Ab Artifex is a fun one where Harry and Dumbledore are very close, with a very familial-esque relationship. I can't link directly due to rule 8 (to clarify, the older person doesn't know their partner is a minor - age fourteen or fifteen, I think? - and it's completely non-graphic and basically just 'we went upstairs and had a great half an hour' but that's semi-suggestive and better safe than banned :D), but here's a link to the author profile.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
