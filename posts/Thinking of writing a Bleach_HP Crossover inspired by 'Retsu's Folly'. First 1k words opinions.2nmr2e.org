Harry Potter lay resting in his queen sized bed, surrounded by family and friends alike. Faces, young and old, stared down at him, an array of emotions framing their expressions. Fear, sadness, resignation, glee... He had lived a good life. Fulfilling that blasted prophesy at the mere age of 17, his life went by uninhibited by great threats for a long while. He quickly rose in the Auror ranks, claiming Head of Magical Law Enforcement by the young age of 30. He became a political force to rival even old man Dumbledore in his glory days, retiring from active duty at the age of 40 to teach his passion -- Defence against the Dark Arts.

His children, James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter prospered. Carrying the highly praised Potter name, his eldest son took the position of Minister of Magic at the age of 20, solidifying his power base with significant magical power and apparent sense of righteousness.

His other son, Albus, followed in the footsteps of his namesake -- becoming a famed Transfiguration Master and making several breakthroughs that changed the art forever.

And finally his daughter, who carried the unexpected abilities of a Seer. She became an Unspeakable, the Matron of the Hall of Prophecy. Her work, of course, was highly classified.

But this meant little to Harry Potter, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as he was claimed by Death amidst the tears of his family. He was not sad, though. He would be reunited with all those he had lost -- Dumbledore, his parents, Sirius, Remus, Tonks and most of all his dearly departed Ginny.

And yet Death did not greet him with the sight of his loved ones. Nor was he greeted with eternal damnation, or even complete nonexistence. He awoke to find himself in a sea of oriental buildings, the solitary denizens shuffling hastily through the sand.

“What the fuck?” he muttered, noticing with great surprise that the scratchiness of his voice that accompanied old age was absent.

He stood, uninhibited by his shattered knee or his aching back. No, in fact, he didn't feel a single twinge of pain at all, the only evidence of his senses being the slightly dusting of the wind against his cheek. He inspected his arms carefully, and then his legs, and finally he removed his crisp shirt and gave his torso a once over. Vicious wounds and scars, injuries that accompanied his timeworn body were gone. Raising his hand to his forehead, he felt around for his scar, daring to believe that the ancient mark had disappeared. It had not.

Sighing, Harry began moving his body, working through the diagnostic exercises that had been drilled into him in Basic Training, meant for checking to see if you had any hidden injuries. He found his body was as spry as it had been when he was a youngster, and felt a tremendous grin spread across his face.

He felt young again. Not only that, he felt free...he felt...alive. But wait a minute, wasn't he dead? He remembered a persistent drowsiness, a call for him to submit to Death...and then he was here.

But where...was here? Where in Merlin's name had he been taken? He couldn't be on Earth, no, this sand was definitely unlike anything he had ever seen before. Still, he knew he had to be somewhere, and looked around for the nearest public gathering place.

Finding none, he shrugged, and set off down the road analysing his surroundings as he went. The architecture of this place seemed similar to that he saw when he visited Japan on ministry duty to crush an uprising of Dark Wizards.

Maybe he had found himself in Japan? But that didn't make any sense either, why would Japan be covered in sand? And what was this...presence that he felt in the air. Muttering to himself, he completely missed the small group of men turn to look at him, eyes' regarding him like a predator does his prey.

He did, however, notice when the small group of men began to follow him. He cast a subtle glance back, counting four figures dressed in the same style of clothing as he was. Fumbling for his wand in his pocket, he grunted. It wasn't there. The comfortable eleven-and-a-half inches of wood completely missing. He felt one of the men speed up, if only slightly, and apprehension filled his body as he realised the man was trying to catch up to him.

But wait, wasn't he dead anyway? These men weren't a threat to a dead man, and all he needed to do was ask them a few questions anyway. Making his decision, he turned around to face the group before promptly taking a knife to the gut.

Pain exploded in his stomach, the hilt protruding from him menacingly. He cringed, tears stinging his eyes as he dropped to his knees, the blood leaking from the wound only serving to make him more aware of his blinding mortality.

Why did this hurt so much? He was supposed to be dead, for Merlin's sake! How can a dead man feel this much pain! And why would you stab a dead man?

Smirking, his assailant pulled the hilt from his stomach, landing a kick across his face sending Harry rocketing to the ground, kissing the sand. Harry cried, the swift actions inflaming his wound even more as the sand found its way through the unnatural hole. He tried to grab at his thoughts, not allowing himself to flee into unconsciousness. He had no idea who these men were or what they wanted with him, but Harry Potter did not send a fucking Dark Lord and hundreds of wannabees to the grave just to die at the hands of a street urchin.

“Fuckin' punk, walkin' ‘round my district like nobodies business. This is Defoe' land, bitch!”

‘Defoe Land'? A gang, then, Harry concluded. He had walked right into the middle of gang territory, and apparently the price for that was a stabbing. Driven to hysteria from his growing wound, Harry laughed madly, although calling it a howl would have been more accurate.

Standing on shaky legs, Harry glanced up at the man who stabbed him. He stood average height, with a mop of blonde hair sitting atop his head and a mischievous glint in his eyes. Grinning hysterically, Harry widened his eyes in a display of true panic.

“So you fucking stab me, huh? For walking through your street? Well fuck you!” Harry breathed, laughing throughout.

At this, the mischievous glint in the man's eyes died, and they narrowed to the point of almost being closed.

“You fuckin' what? What the fuck did you just say to me?”

Harry only grinned, and stretched out his arm, pointing it at the man stood in the centre of the street. “Reducto!”

A streak of white light shot from Harry's hand, accompanied by a huge increase in the presence in the air. This time, however, Harry didn't notice it, as the white light struck the street urchin and blew a hole straight through him, completely obliterating his entire torso.


** 1. Easy on the happily ever after thing. It's a bit over the top with the "everything was super-awesome". What is important was that he was happy. The moment everyone is perfect, the happiness becomes meaningless and contrite. Harry missing his wife but still being proud of his children has more emotionally impact than "he had the perfect everything".

2. Unless the family becomes relevant later on in this story, you don't need to explain about them specifically. There is the literary concept of Chekov's Gun: do not add to the story something which will not be relevant later on. You add in a red herring or two, and you've got JKR's writing style (every book contains with a form of magic which is new to Harry but will later be crucial to the plot). This holds true for both characters and forms of magic.

3. Dropping the use of a wand, the swearing, and blowing a hole through a torso is a huge turn away from the HP source material. The purpose of fan fiction is to build on an established universe and to use its strengths. There is nothing here which makes Harry Potter the actual Harry Potter except his history. The lead character may as well be an original one and people wouldn't recognize Harry there without mention of the prophecy.

The actions of swearing and killing would feel more right with a character like Draco Malfoy. Harry would just disarm people and ask them what the hell is going on. This is a Bleach story which happens to contain a wizard called Harry Potter; in itself, rather cool. But if you want to bring the HP-verse into it, don't overcomplicate it with history, or make the history relevant.

Overall, this story has potential, and your writing shows promise. Keep writing and developing this story, and it may very well be awesome stuff.
