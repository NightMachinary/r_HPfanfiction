I have never read a Harry Potter fan fiction and really want to change that.

Are there any good fan fictions you would recommend?


** Unless you hate canon pairings, I always strongly recommend reading canon compliant fics first, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] depicts Year 6 from Ginny's POV. It's very well written and also my entry fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] is an excellent Year 7 fic from Ginny's POV and shows the horror at Hogwarts during that year. Its author [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] is active here and has written [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum/works?fandom_id=136512][many great canon compliant fics]].

Author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has written a massive postwar series of 85+ fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], set in 2009 and depicting Harry and Ginny's work/life, is likely his best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]] is a little self promotion. I wrote this one shot for the occasion of Battle of Hogwarts' 20th anniversary.

*** Seconded; canon-compliant post-war stories are a good place to start. Northumbrian's work is probably my favourite out of these suggestions.

I'll also throw in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4495536/1/Chapter-37]]), which is a chapter that one author felt was missing from the end of Deathly Hallows, and linkffn(The First Day by little0bird) if you want to read a rockier (re)start to Harry and Ginny's relationship.

  Like many Potter fans, I enjoyed book 7, but was perplexed by how there seemed to be a chapter missing at the end. You know, right after the climax and before the epilogue. This was my solution. I'm a year late in posting this.

*** I would not read this if you're looking for a good story, especially if you're new to fanfic. As I've said before:

#+begin_quote
  De-rec, for the original. It is simply not good. That's expected, as it was apparently the author's first story, but on a level higher than spelling and grammar the quality is severely lacking. Characterization is out of whack, events are tenuously strung together like a bunch of Christmas lights haphazardly flung over the front porch, and the prose is ... well, it tries to be a clear window into events, no accessories, no dross. And that style can be done very well---Brandon Sanderson is an example of an author who's famous for it. But this isn't that. The POV shoots around like an amateur filmmaker who just discovered angles exist, and it is not pretty. The writer of this fic had a vision for what they wanted, and their skill just wasn't up to seeing it realized.

  I have not read the remastered version, which is why my de-rec is only for the original. I can't say if the author improved on the flawed elements. However, given that these flaws are pretty core to the plot of the story, the fact that the author stated all the plot elements are left unchanged is not a good sign.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

**** I suggested it as a contrast to /Sing a requiem/. Both stories deal with child soldiers/martyrs but in different ways. The darkness of /Stages of Hope/ is essential to what makes it a great story, especially in a fandom that seems to fetishize child soldiers and martyrdom.

** Are there any parings you think you would be interested in, or do you want a general find that focuses on Harry?

There are quite a few popular tropes out there one of which is Slytherin Harry. I personally liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] (5th year is continued on the author's new account): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513]]

This is fairly canon compliant in the first couple years, but things really start to pick up afterwards.

I don't know if you would be interested in fem!Harry (I definitely was not before reading this fic) but Harry's character is significantly different from canon, so she's essentially an original character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense Series]] features a fem!Harry who aspires to be a potions mistress at all costs. Hogwarts only lets in purebloods in this new society, so she switches places with her cousin Archie Black and pretends to be him. I think it has really cool world building and Tom Riddle is quite an interesting character here.

** Depends on what you like ... Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) - is really good but it's very long. linkffn(Isolation) is the most favourited Harry Potter fanfic on the website. I like linkffn(Democracy), and linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist).

linkffn(Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You) is pretty hilarious.

*** Hey [[/u/weiland123][u/weiland123]] just a disclaimer, HPMOR is a highly divisive fic, some (like me) absolutely love it to the point that it sparked an entirely new genre of fic called "rationalist fanfiction" and others (like my sister in law) absolutely hated and could not even bring themselves to go more than a few chapters. If you don't like it that's ok and it just means that it isn't your style. There is however a genre called crack which I assume is so named because either the characters, or the author must have been on crack at the time of writing and afaik everyone enjoys some crack sometimes. The gold standard for this is linkffn( seventh horcrux by emerald ashes)

If you do decide to try it out, I'd advise trying to read at least to chapter 2 (according to the AO3 page listings that is) since a lot of people don't like the prologue.\\

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura.

#+begin_quote
  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.
