are there any fics where harry gets a snake familiar or pet snake that plays at least a Hedwig sized role i.e not mentioned once then thrown away.


** Harry and a couple other characters have pet snakes in linkffn(magical relations)! The conversations with said snakes are some of the best parts of that story, in my opinion!

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** There was one where Snape went back in time to change things for Harry so that they would win the war. One way is that Harry gets a snake and starts practicing parselmagic and heals people. It's AU in that Harry didn't win the war, which is what caused Snape to have to go back in time. It goes through a few years of Harry in Hogwarts with Snape guiding him.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
