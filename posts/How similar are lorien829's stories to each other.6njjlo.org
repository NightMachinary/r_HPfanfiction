I just read Harry Potter and the Isle of Mists. While well written on a technical level, there were a lot of cliches and tropes that I really didn't like, such as (SPOILERS):

Harry is the heir of Gryffindor

Harry and Hermione are soul bonded

Said soul bond leads to them being married, which they are thrilled about at age 16

Draco becomes spy for the light at the drop of a dime

Luna is a powerful....something. Keeper of Avalon? She borders on being Mary Sue in this fic; she is never wrong, has no visible flaws, and appears to be present just to explain things to other characters

There was an awful lot of "I don't need to explain this, because the rule of cool is more important." For example, the Claviomnis just appears in Hermione's hands by thinking about it for a fraction of a second. Harry and Hermione are also able to somehow transfer magical power to Ginny just by touching her, allowing her to cast magic again after a curse had rendered her uselss for seceral hours.

I was thinking about reading Cataclysm next. Are these tropes, or ones like them, prevalent in all of Lorien829's stories?


** Not at all, but Hermione and Luna tend to be really powerful in her stories, and paired with Harry and Ron respectively.

*** Oh, well that's fine. Hermione is my favourite character so I have a bit of a blind spot for powerful Hermione, and I don't necessarily mind a powerful Luna so long as she isn't just a typical Mary Sue to go along with her power.
