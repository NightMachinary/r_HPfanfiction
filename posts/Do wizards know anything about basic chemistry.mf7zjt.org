I mean do they know the periodic table, subatomic particles, bonds and whatnot? Imagine the combat potential of transfiguring all the nitrogen around your target into hydrogen and instantly igniting it, going all Mustang on the poor fools. Or conjuring mustard gas, or any other dangerous chemicals?


** Outside of some "odd ones" (a Muggleborn who kept studying the subject, or a passionate Pure Blood similar to Arthur Weasley), it is same to assume that the vast majority of the Wizards don't know anything about basic chemistry, mainly because they have absolutely no need for it.

In Canon, "Magic" is mainly conceptual and completely ignore "Muggle Science". So why bother learning about the Periodic Table when you can transfigure an item into anything you could want. Why bother transfiguring the air around your target into something flamable, when you have spell able to ignite absolutely everything (including your target). Why bother trying to conjure "mustard gas" when there is probably a "poisonous gas" spell around which is times easier to learn for similar effects.

In the end, Wizards probably already have spell able to reach a similar effect to any chemical reaction you could think of. Which make Science pretty much useless in the Magical world outside of some very specific scenario.

There is also the problem of "Magic" following a different set of rules compared to science. As an example, a simple "Shield Charm" can block a thrown rock just as easily as it can stop a bullet. A fire started with Transfigured Hydrogen would still be a "Muggle Fire" without any magic behind it, which means that it can be easily controled with an appropriate spell, contrary to something like "Fiendfyre" which is basically instoppable.

** Magic exist, and muggle cannot comprehend magic, and magic override mundane nature by WOG.

Wizards know and study the right explanation of universe, Alchemy.

In HPverse, Alchemy is right and chemistry is wrong. Why bother study the limited and wrong explanation of the nature?

Wizards do not need to understand mundane nature to transfigure or charm. 11 years old don't know the component of wood or needle but the can transfigure matchstick to needle. What they need to understand is the law of magic.

** Based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemistry]] if we assume that the wizarding world as a whole largely ignores the non-magical sciences; then it's likely that most wix would have less than primary school (that being, under 11 years old) knowledge of chemistry.

The only exceptions to that likely being Potioneers and Alchemists.

Of course that wouldn't stop any particular magical from learning this stuff, and it'd make sense that at least some will have used this in ways you and others have mentioned. But as a whole, no, most wix (particularly magically raised ones) will likely not think to exploit basic physics and chemistry to their advantage.

**** It's a gender neutral term for magical humans that I've seen occasionally here.

When I talk about magicals I tend to prefer to just use that term, 'magicals', to refer to any being capable of magic. But sometimes, as is the case here, I was specifically referring to magical humans; and while I could use that term instead of wix, using it feels more cumbersome. If nothing else it is far less cumbersome than using 'Witch/Wizard' (or the inverse).

** linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) does this but he uses sodium and the water conjuring charm. He also transfigures chilli powder and blows it into enemies eyes.
