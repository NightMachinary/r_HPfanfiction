This guy popped up out of nowhere, dropped the darkest saga the fandom has seen in years, and then disappeared.

I haven't really been reading any fics for a while now. I picked up Prince of Slytherin after a three or four year absence, and year three is finally over.

Shit got a LOT darker, and it made me think, "hey what's new in the fandom that's also not on DLP?"

I prefer Harry-centric and gen (i.e, not romance-driven) fics, but I'm open to read any character, provided they're proactive and ... dark.

Snape works, dude's a right bastard. Dark!Marauders would be cool; like a more fleshed out version of that old BajaB story. So would a dark!Ron (pls not that >1mil word story where Ron is cursed by fate or some shit) or dark!Hermione (something like Applied Cultural Anthropology; NO starfox pls).

Just really out of the loop, and hoping that some new stories popped up after quarantine or old stories got revived.

Thanks!

  She had fallen through the veil of death, unaware of the path she was doomed to walk. It all seemed like fun and games at the start - another chance. She'd never been so wrong. OOC. fem!Harry. Lovecraftian Horror. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, extreme violence, and mature topics.

** I will never pass up the opportunity to recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series! It's a lot like Prince of Slytherin (but I personally think it's much better) and the writing's amazing. If you liked PoS, you will definitely like this.

And since the old account's been abandoned, the author has picked it up [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513][here]], on book 6.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** Linkao3(Dying is a Delicate moment) Watch as Hermione slowly loses her moral center in the face of Tom Riddle and greater good style pragmatism until she does something unforgivable. It gets worse before it gets better.

  Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.
