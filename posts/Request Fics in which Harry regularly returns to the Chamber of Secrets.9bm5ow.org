There are plenty of times after 2nd year when Harry could use a place to be totally along, between half the school hating him in 4th year to Umbridge being her awful self in 5th etc. The CoS is not cozy, but it is a place only he can access. I'm looking for stories where he makes use of that.

*** In some fics Harry finds alternate entrances to the Chamber. It would make sense for Slytherin to have had an easily accessible entrance for his personal use.

**** According to Pottermore, there used to be different entrances, but past generations of Gaunt family members removed them when Hogwarts was adding a plumbing system.

***** This is off-topic, but its always bothered me that Hogwarts had a plumbing system /at all/. Toilets and taps and baths could still be used, of course, but there's absolutely no reason for them to work like the Muggle versions do.

****** As my post implies, Pottermore says they were added after Muggles invented it. Hogwarts (and wizards in general) did not always have plumbing, they used to just go on the spot and vanish it away, lol.

******* Yeah, that whole "they used to Vanish waste away" is actually one of the reasons that a plumbing system makes even less sense to me. There are magical means for the same thing, so why bother going through all the fuss?

Just one of those little things that bugs me. Stupid, but it does.

** Returning to the Chamber is a common trope in Slytherin!Harry, Dark!Harry and indie!Harry fics. The most common reasons for returning are a) to break down the Basilisk into lucrative black market ingredients or b) to talk to the basilisk if it wasn't killed in the story, c) to practice Dark magic in a place not detectable by the Hogwarts wards, and d) to learn the true "secrets" of the Chamber of Secrets, which is usually Slytherin's personal library.

A few examples:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL/Slytherin/Independent Harry fic starting in year 1.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/36393336][Antithesis]] - A WBWL/Dark Harry fic starting before Harry gets left with the Dursleys. Lots of Stockholm syndrome.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/15/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] - An independant!Harry fic starting at the end of year 5.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] - A dark!Harry fic starting in 4th year. Turns into slash pretty quickly.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12405748/1/Harry-Potter-The-Curse-of-Undeath][Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath]] - A necromancer!Harry fic starting in year 4.

**** Currently there are no pairings. Harry is not a romantic person in the story, for various reasons. In year 4 he briefly dates one of his female classmates, but similar to real life teens, it doesn't last. The relationship is not a focus of the year 4 plot.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
