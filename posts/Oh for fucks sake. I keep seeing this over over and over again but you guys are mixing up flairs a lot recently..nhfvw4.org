** This gets pointed out every month or so. And it's in the sidebar. And the post submission page. People just don't care or don't pay attention.

I do sometimes downvote posts just for being flaired incorrectly, but I doubt that helps much either.

*** Not on mobile. I read the rules and I couldn't find anything about the distinction there. I think that's the reason. You can't see any writing about the distinction on mobile and the it's unclear which of the two flairs is for what just from the names. They're easy to get mixed up.

**** There's something about request thread vs what's that fic but nothing about recommendation vs request

** Recommendation is clearly me asking for someone to recommend a good fic to me based on the guidelines I list in my post.

Promotion is to tell people about a great fic I just read

Request is to request someone tell me the name of a fic I forgot.

Suggestion is me suggesting new ideas for authors to use.

What's that fic is clearly to many words to be a real flair.
