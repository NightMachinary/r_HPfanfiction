Has anyone else strayed so far away from the bools by reading so many other fics? I kinda like it because I'm experiencing something different every time even though it's the same world.


** Yeah. I have a small list of things that aren't canon but fanon but there's two that always get me.

A) Sirius doesn't have a middle name. I was so used to people calling him 'Sirius Orion Black'!

And

B) Snape isn't Draco's godfather. This is such a widely accepted fanfic thing that I just sorta forgot it wasn't canon.

Tom and Regulus are the only characters who mention their own middle names outside of official hearings or documents. So it's not something that can easily be brought up in canon but considering Regulus has a middle name, it's highly likely that Sirius has one as well.

What's fanon here is characters shouting each others middle names, that doesn't happen at all.

***** Come on, he obviously did not deliberately set out to put Harry in an abusive household. It was the best course of action, at the time. You have to put context in mind: dude was born in freaking 1881 (they probably still disciplined children with corporal punishment then), and hardly had any good understanding of a healthy, loving family himself. Plus he had no reason to think Harry was still under threat, and was probably too busy rebuilding a Wizarding Britain still in tatters from Voldemort's violent rise to power to pay attention to Harry, who to all appearances was living in an affluent household, with seemingly respectable, family-oriented, non-violent muggles. After the war, families were torn apart, a shit ton of people were killed or mutilated (Neville's parents), and between his responsibilities as a Headmaster, as Supreme Mugwump, and as this major political figurehead of Wizarding Britain, I just don't think Dumbledore had the space of mind to worry overmuch about Harry.

...in which case, why did he get involved at all in where Harry stayed?

Rhetorical question, we know why he did, because Harry was a very important asset one way or another seeing as Dumbledore from the start didn't think Voldemort was dead. In which case, some investment on his part in making sure Harry is okay can be expected. (And no, I don't consider crazy cat lady an appropriate measure towards that, and neither should anybody else, Dumbledore included.)

I think the most benign explanation with regards to Dumbledore keeping Harry in an abusive household (what, did he think Harry asked to stay the summer at Hogwarts because he likes the lake that much??) is neglect. Even if it were true that Harry wouldn't be safe anywhere else (which, how are muggles going to defend him from a magical attack? Not like whatever protection Lily gave travelled with him, so we can presuppose it applies only to the house, which Harry left regularly... and if it did travel with him there was no need at all to stay with the Dursleys), there are still things he could've done to ensure Harry's well-being and better treatment.

When Dumbledore took Harry from the ruins of his home and hid him in the muggle world, he took on the responsibility of ensuring his well-being. And failed miserably. And, born in 1881 or not, I don't see how anybody could consider "locked up in a cupboard and withheld food from regularly while being forced to do chores the whole day" not a bad thing to do, particularly when compared to how Dudley is treated.

******* 1) It's an age old arguments but the Dursleys were not /that/ bad? Sure Harry childhood sucked but :

- He was not " /withheld food from regularly/ ". In PS, Harry say that the Dursley never denied food. There are like 3 instances in Canon where Harry is not well fed, and all of them are due to special circunstances and not a "normal" Dursley treatment.
- Same thing with " being forced to do chores the whole day ". He had to "watch the egg" (and not cook the whole meal) during Dudley 11th birthday because Petunia was busy spoiling him, and had chores as a punishment in CoS. The rest of the time, he and the Dursley are happy to ignore each other.

I'll say it once again, the Dursley were bad, but also obessed with normality. Vernon could sometimes be rough with Harry, but also Dursley (like when he wrestle them both for Hogwarts' acceptance letter in PS), and Petunia "swing with a pan" was not a murder attempt, had it reached he would have had a bump at worst.\\
Honestly, considering the 1980's standards, the Dursley could have probably easily passed a social service inspection if not for the "sleeping in a cupboard" thing.

‚Äã

2) Why can't people accept Dumbledore explanations from OotP? "/I know your childhood would suck, but I needed you safe and no other place was safer than under your mother protections, hence with some blood relatives/".\\
Since no Death Eater managed to kill or kidnap Harry during his childhood, and that no Minister used him as a poster child, not to mention that said protections litterally saved his life in PS, I consider that Dumbledore made the right call.

Also, his blood protection didn't need to be recharged with "love". Lily took care of the Love part with her death and the spell only needed Petunia acceptance and Harry physical presence for around 4 weeks to keep Harry safe for a year. The treatment from the Dursley didn't affect the strenght of the spell as long as they let him stay under their roof.

Sure, they woult probably have bought him new clothes rather than Dudley cast off, and maybe even some birthday and Christmas gift, but that's all. No amount of money would have made them discipline Dudley (so still friendless Harry), or genuinely care for him. At best he would have grown up with completely fake interaction where they give him a gift with a smile before ignoring him.

As for the rest of the subjections. Dumbledore needed Harry to live with the Dursley to be under his mother protection, the Dursley didn't need anything from Harry or Dumbledore. He was not in a position to make any demand, in fear that it make them push Harry out.

Also I never said anything about recharging with love being necessary or no etc but it seems like you consider that an argument in Dumbledore's favour? "The protection was fine no matter what they did so it doesn't matter how the Dursleys treated Harry"? That's an interesting argument lmao.

Following the laws is suuuuuuch a good idea.\\
You have a Godfather who is thought to be Voldemort Right Hand Mand and betrayer of the Potter, and who would be arrested and sent to Azkaban 5 days later.\\
Then you have the closest blood relative, the Dursleys, who can give him the best protections but don't care about Harry and would not make any effort to become his guardians.\\
Finally you have the rest of the Magical World (since pureblood are all pretty inbred) where everyone would love to take care of Harry except some want to kill him to avenge their Master, other want to raise him as the next Dark Lord, and the last one can't protect him from the previous one, not to mention that they risk to spoil him, making Harry a Malfoy 2.0. And let's not forget the Minister who would love nothing more than to take Harry in to make him some kind of political tool and a Ministry Poster Child.\\
But aside from that Dumbledore is such a monster to not have followed the laaaaaaaw.

Also, he did ensure Harry well being, just with different standards. As long as Harry was alive, and pretty well adjusted, and didn't want to risk the statut quo. Because he had no "safe" place to raise him outside of there.

As for the last arguments, I lost count of how many Indy! Harry fic had Harry yell at Voldemort something along the lines of "/You Manipulative old Coot, I never knew love at the Dursley so the blood protection was useless, you are an idiot to have put me there/". So I think it's better to specify that yes, even without being loved by them, Harry was protected by the Dursleys.

Like it or not, the Harry Potter universe has canon beyond those seven books. You can personally choose to reject that canon, if you like, but it remains canon. FFS, if J.K. decided tomorrow to outright write another book, are you going to say that's not canon, too? ... Secondly, there is no evidence of Dumbledore's heterosexuality in the books, and there /is/ evidence he is gay. Informing you after you read it that he's gay is not /retroactively changing/ the work, so much as just pointing out something you may have missed. It was there all along. You just didn't see it.

Since "aimer" can either be translated by "like" or "love", Dumbledore could either admit that Grinderwald was a friend once, or that they loved each other. Anyways, in my opinion, their relation is hinted enough that writers can write Dumbledore as gay without making him OOC (though, during the canon events at least, I can't imagine Dumbledore in any romantic relation).

** I haven't watched any of the movies in about... 6 years or so, Except for PoA, And I haven't re-read any of the books in 7 years. There are fanfics that I like way more than Canon, And that's what I re-read when I need a little bit of 'magic' in my life

** Yes. There's so many things that I forget aren't cannon. It makes it interesting when trying to purposely remember what it

** Absolutely.

And I like it too, because from 5th book onwards there are things in canon that I dislike on the basis of craft (worldbuilding, characterisations, and especially consistency), so I don't mind at all that that canon is fading from my mind lol.

(On the flip side, Harry's ~golden polyjuice still has me vaguely hysterical half with laughter, half with incredulity, because /what/. It took me so long to internalise the fact that that wasn't a fever dream or from a fanfic but genuine canon. Nowadays I feel like that was foreshadowing for Cursed Child lmao.)

Also I've read so many fanfics retelling canon up to a point and then veering off that I can't really read the books anymore because I feel like I've read them a thousand times by this point, even though I haven't, and appreciation for JKR's wit aside I just get bored.

** One word: Wards. They are not mentioned anywhere in canon.. but after many years of fanfic, i am convinced they can protect anything and everything..

*** Saphroneth took an interesting approach, via Professor Quirrell, in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/page-83#post-56205574][Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay]]. Everything that people might refer to as a ward actually belongs in some other category, eg hex or jinx, except for Goblin wards ‚ÄúAnd t-that is b-because they can c-call them that if they w-want."
