:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Pretty sure this is a Draco bash fanfic... After the war, Harry opens up a shop selling wards. Augusta along bottom asks for a potion, which Harry doesn't sell and so he finds someone who can brew the potions. Harry found Severus alive, and starts venturing into his store, growing a crush. Halfway through their talks, Draco comes in and disrupts the talk and dashes Harry's hopes. Harry begins to avoid Severus, sending owls for requests and payments. At the end, they got together? I'm not quite sure about the ending but I hope somebody is able to figure where this is! Thank you so much in advance!!

  HPSS, one-sided SSDM. Harry never really expected Severus to choose him as his lover. But being rejected for Draco Malfoy still stung. COMPLETE.
