TL;DR Harry and Ron have a drunken misadventure involving a Felix Felicis-laced drink. They may or may not remember much of it, but given Liquid Luck was involved...

Rules:

- It's post-Hogwarts.
- Ron's getting married, so a stag party is the thing-to-do.
- Harry and Ron decide to try an experimental drink laced with Liquid Luck.
- They don't remember what happened afterwards.
- The plot hinges around piecing together the misadventures they had.
- The crackier the better.


** Reminds me of a certain quest from skyrim or The Hangover. 10/10 would definitely read.
