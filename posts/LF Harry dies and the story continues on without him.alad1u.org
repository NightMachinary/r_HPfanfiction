So many stories that have Harry dying, have him end up in the past; or in an alternate reality or whatever, any stories where Harry actually dies, and the story continues on without him?

Are they able to locate and destroy the other Horcruxes and defeat Voldemort without Harry? I mean technically speaking, Harry had a Horcrux inside of him; without Harry, they could potentially destroy Voldemort on their own, if need be.

Some stories that have Harry dying; often have the Light side losing the war; I'd just find it interesting if they actually won the war without Harry there somehow.

How they win the war is unimportant, when and how Harry dies is also unimportant; as long as he stays dead and doesn't come back in some way. (As morbid as it is, I'm kind of interested in a story like that).

Would love for it to be completed.

Would love for the good guys to still win the war; even without Harry. (Other people can die as well; I don't care, I just want the good guys to win even after Harry dies).

No Weasley bashing please.

Other than that go nuts with it.

If there aren't any stories like that, maybe someone can write one


** I read a one shot that's something like this a while ago on the premises Voldemort kills both harry and Neville as babies.

Couldn't tell you that it's called though

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
