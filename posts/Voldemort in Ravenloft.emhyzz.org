**** A bunch of weird-evil god-things pulled together some nightmares to create a Gothic-horror land (called Ravenloft) filled with monsters and ruled by a vampire called Strahd. If it means anything to you, it's sort of like Transylvania from Van Helsing (specifically the cheesy action movie) and the Manor grounds from Darkest Dungeon all rolled up into one.
