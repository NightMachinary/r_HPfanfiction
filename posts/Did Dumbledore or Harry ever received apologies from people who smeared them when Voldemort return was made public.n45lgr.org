** Dumbledore got back all of his previous positions, and Harry went from "The-Boy-Who-Lied" to "The-Chosen-One" in the Daily Prophet, which may be considered as some kind of apology I guess.

But no, nobody ever went to Dumbledore or Harry and told them "Sorry I smeared your reputation all last year and ignored the return of You-Know-Who", or if it ever happened, it was never mentioned in the books.

From what we saw, the Ministry tactic's, along with the rest of the population, had been to act as if nothing ever happened and hope Harry and Dumbledore didn't hold grudges.

**** Well, the middle of the war may not be the best time to deal with idiots and cowards. The people who had the most responsabilities in the smear campagn (at least in the Ministry) all got removed from their position, and I'm pretty sure the Daily Prophet lost a good deal of trust / clients (who went to the Squibbler).

***** Also its true to real life.

Massive media companies can do massive smears on people and then print small retractions on page 4

but it doesnt matter, the smear sticks in peoples minds

**** To be fair, that was clearly a good move to make. Trust from the population was one of the thing the Ministry needed the most (especially after one year of Fudge fucking things up), and nothing would have brought them more trust than the collaboration of Magical Jesus.

Hell, I'm pretty sure Harry's support would have been worth to free the obviously innocent people previously arrested by the Ministry (such as Stan Shunpike). But well, plot needed the Ministry to be useless.

***** problem with that is that the place were still infected with Fudge appointed staff and they didnt do a purge to remove his entire support to clean house before going to a teenager you have attacked for a year.

Really if they wanted Harrys help, they should of atleast gone after Umbridge

****** Even if we ignore all the things she may have done under Fudge direct's orgers (pretty much all the Educational Decree). Umbrige litteraly admitted being the one who sent Dementors after Harry and was second away of using an Unforgiveable on him. Not to mention that her Black Quill can't be legal, even if it's not directly mentioned as a "Dark Artifact" because she is the one who created the quill and nobody know about it, that's an item that suck the blood of the user and leave a scar on his hand, it should fall into some kind of blancket ban (like: if it use your blood = dark).

Anyways, the first time I read HBP, I was surprised that Umbridge was not in jail, let alone still working for the Ministry.

** I think one of the reasons they didn't get apologized to is because the main antagonizers were Fudge ans Umbridge. One was unstable by the end of the year and the other quit/got fired so them being out of office meant they didn't have to do damage control or make statements. From what I remember, Scrimgeour took over as Minister like right away and because of his ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù he didn't have to exactly apologize to Harry or Dumbledore in the way that we would have expected Fudge to, in the way they deserved. I think it was all brushed under the rug. It's really infuriating I get so mad that Fudge was able to just walk away from the situation after putting the entire wizarding world at risk for no reason.

*** Yeah i kinda wished He got smeared and lost everything.

I mean imagine if before Voldemort disappeared he thanked Fudge for antagonizing Dumbledore and Harry and for turning the Wizarding World against them and that without him he never would have gathered his followers.

Fudge would be ruined for the rest of his life. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if he was named as The Minister who started the 2nd wizarding world in the history books

**** Right!!! Exactly.

I want justice especially because when you think about it, Dumbledore aside, they tried to ruin Harry's life???

Expelling him before his fifth year means he wouldn't have been able to take his OWLs and not taking your OWLs means you can't practise magic because you don't have the necessary education/qualifications to. They SAID someone was going to come destroy his wand that night. He would have ended up like Hagrid, it would be illegal for him to perform magic---and this is the boy who lost his whole family to the wizarding world and was constantly being pushed around by their rules. They were gonna ruin his life further just because they didn't like what he was saying üò≠

Now I don't know what the rules are like or if he would have been able to transfer to Beauxbaton or Durmstrang because if he could then this theory doesn't hold since he could complete his education there because his ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù weren't as severe as Hagrids. But the Ministry destroying his wand implies to me that it wouldn't have been like that and he wouldn't be allowed to do magic. Just another thing that makes me so mad about Fudge/Umbridge.

** Harry is pretty much screwed over by everyone from the beginning including Dumbledore and never gets an apology, The chamber incident where everyone was accusing him. Dumbledore didn't even apologise to Harry for letting him suffer 10 dark years of neglect and abuse, he just came up with excuses.
