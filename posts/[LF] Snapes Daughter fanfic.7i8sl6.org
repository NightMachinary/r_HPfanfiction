Does anyone know of any good Snapes' daughter fanfic? Or Snapes' relatives.

-Snape has to be as he is in the series -None of this “blonde Gryffindor” stuff -DOESN'T alter the storyline (ideally)

It sounds strict, but I've read far too many fanfics that don't relate to Snape at all, and are WAY out of character.

This is my first post, apologies if I get it wrong.


** There's a fic I like for its noir-ish sensibility that's only available on the Wayback Machine. The author said she would re-post it to AO3 after her website went down, but she never got around to it. The focus is on Harry as a cynical Auror attracted to Snape's teenage daughter Lilith, but the characterization of Snape is also quite good, although he's more of a side character.

** I think I replied to you already in another comment, but here are the ones I like:

linkao3(Surprise, Bitches! by OfHealingLove) Hermione is his adopted daughter and he is well portrayed here. It is quite short and unfinished though.

linkffn(Red Sorrow) Snape and Lily had a daughter before Harry so he ended up raising her after Lily's death. Everyone believes that she and Harry are full siblings though and they are both marked by Voldemort and famous. The fic can be a bit angsty sometimes but I thought the author did a good job of keeping Snape in character.

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

  AU. Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, and Severus Snape is given redemption in a form he least expected. A Sibling!Addition story beginning pre Philosopher's Stone through Prisoner of Azkaban. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix will continue in a separate installment.

** linkff(4294544) - this starts a few years before Harry goes to Hogwarts so it does not alter the storyline at first. I liked Snape here and Calista (his daughter) was a good OC character with her flaws and straights.

linkffn(2183302) - Snape has a family in this one, I think he has even a daughter but the story is mainly about his son who is admitted to Hogwarts. It is very old so it is not HBP compliant.

  When Snape's son comes to Hogwarts, Harry discovers secrets about his Potions Master that he never imagined and Snape learns a few things about Harry as well. NOT HBP COMPLIANT. Complete!

  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

** linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean) is centered on Snape's daughter. Their relationship is one of the major plot points.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.
