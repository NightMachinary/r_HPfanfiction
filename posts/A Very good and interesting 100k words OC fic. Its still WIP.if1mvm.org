Hello people! Very recently I've found a really good OC fanfic and it seems no one else has recommended it in this sub-reddit before. Let me do the honors

Its called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13640390/1/Magical-Creatures-Will-Get-Me-Killed-Again][Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again)]].

The OC is a veterinarian doctor who absolutely loves animals. He gets transported to HP universe and becomes the son of some magical creatures caretaker. The OC is called Nox sterling and is an absolute sweetheart.

I don't want to spoil too much, but the pairing is OC x Hermoine, Harry and Ron still don't have any pairings yet. The dumbledore in this fic happens to be a good guy.

I hope you guys like it. Just a warning that the author of this fic likes to be very harsh with his OC's.

  I'd spent seventeen years in my past life as a veterinarian and now, as they say, I was a wizard. Or, well, I would be if I could use magic without possibly dying. Oh, and let's not forget how my fondness of animals was about to get me into a load of trouble. "W-Why'd you just stand there!" "It was a three-headed dog." "He tried to eat us!" "...H-He was cute..."

** The summary is a bit complicated to understand, can he perform magic normally or is it just a reference to their (I assume) Hagrid-like interest in Magizoology?

*** During the start of his first year, he is an obscurus and is very sensitive to magic. But he does get better at magic as the series goes on

**** An obscurus... you mean those who die as children and have no control whatsoever on their magic and are considered to be massively dangerous?

***** I don't know much about obscurus myself, but from what I know, they are generally magical children who are abused and try to hid away their magic.
