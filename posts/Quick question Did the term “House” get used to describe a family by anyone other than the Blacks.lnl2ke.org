It is just such a widespread terminology, and not just in Indy!Harry stories, even in those without all the nobility things the term shows up quite frequently. Thing is, the only instance I can remember of it being used was on the Black tapestry, other than that I can only remember the use of the word family.


** Chapter 10 of Half-Blood Prince is named "The House of Gaunt".

It's probably just a pretentious title some purebloods gave themselves. More specifically, the insane ones.

*** I remember reading a fic where the "Ancient and Most Noble House of Black" thing was actually embarrassing to everyone in the family, but some ancestor of theirs had ordered /way/ too much parchment with it emblazoned on the top or whatever and they had no real choice but to pretend they liked it. It was an amusing take.

** My head canon is that it predates the Statute of Secrecy, back when some of the magical were legitimate nobility. The statute led to most abandoning those titles, but some of the family heirlooms survive.

*** Could actually fit rather nicely. The families don't actually have the lands or political power characteristic of the nobility of the middle age and the first part of the modern one, but they /used/ to have both just like all other lords, but since the Statute separated Britain into magical and muggle and the title and power were more of an allowance from the royal family they had to hand it over because of political reasons.

Dippet supposedly lived for around three hundred years if I am not mistaken, Dumbledore almost 200 and he didn't die from natural causes, the teacher who administered his OWLS was still alive (unless she died off-screen) by the end of the seventh book and the founders of Ilvermory supposedly also got to more than a century of life, so in a rough and kind of arbitrary estimate I would put the average life-span of a magi at around 150-200 years. The Statute was officiated at 1692, so roughly just two generations (disregarding the deaths caused by Voldemort and Grindewald shortening those generations to the point that in practice there are more) from Cannon, a small enough generational gap for bitterness at the viewed injustice and longing for the “good old days” to still persist, then comes along Voldemort calling himself a Lord and viewing to overthrow the ministry, many families that had to give up their titles would definitely jump at the chance of regaining them even disregarding the whole “ruling over the world” part.

Don't think it will ever be either confirmed or denied by cannon, but it is definitely an interesting take on the subject and really brings home the whole concept that it used to be a single world before the separation.

*** Eh, it's fine. Though wouldn't the name of the chapter be more meta rather than part of the story itself? Or did the Gaunt family outright say to the ministry worker that they were members of the “house of Gaunt”? Judging by what I remember of the Gaunts it would be quite in-character for either Marvolo or the other whose name I forgot to do it.

To a degree, yes, but IMO, so is the question itself. What you are truly asking is, "did Rowling call families Houses in Canon?", isn't it? And to that, the answer is the above. The chapter title corresponds to the one from OotP ("The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black"). Additionally, the usage of "House" in this context ("family, including ancestors and descendents, especially noble") is pretentious enough that it makes sense for the Gaunts and their inflated sense of importance what with Slytherin and all; as you note. But yeah, it doesn't appear /in/ the chapter.

Incidentally, the entire concept is one of the more curious ones. House is old English, not Norman. Yet House of ... clearly only works with surnames, and those only arrived in England with the Norman conquest. Before that, even noble families had no surnames; just like all the other Germanic people, they referred to important people by whose sons they were. So Alfred Cuthbert's son, and Cuthbert Aethelstan's son etc., and that way, you traced lineage. I haven't yet found an account of why the term "house" was chosen, or if it somehow was in use that way before 1066. Maybe it's one of those oddities in language.

.

Anyway, as far as FF goes, there are enough families around that are just as convinced of their own importance as the Blacks and Gaunts were, so you can make a decent case that "House of ..." is a reasonably common way to refer to very old magical families. The biggest point against probably is that it never pops up in the context of the Malfoys (well, that and that it's overused in FF).

***** Kind of? What I was wondering wasn't actually if JKR used the term herself in her writing, but rather if it ever was used as part of the story. The difference is that in the first case it can be just the author's personal preference of which word to use when there are many that could fit, but if it is something that the characters used then chances are that it is either a somewhat accepted cultural norm or even part of some existing institution (not necessarily in the government, it could be in the same way as it is today where the House of Lords is still around and the families are generally relatively wealthy but don't really get a direct say in the government; or alternatively just some kind of social club where the members are really only blowing their own horns). Though in hindsight I can see how my post left it too open.

Thanks for explaining about the origins of surnames in the UK by the way, I didn't know they were brought by the Normans. No idea how the term /house of/ fits in though, maybe Roman influence? They conquered both where today is France and the UK, so maybe they had some kind of term with this general meaning in their language and the term changed with the changes in the language? Alternatively it could have been used differently in other parts of the UK, if I am not mistaken the whole “son of” was more prominent at Scotland as the prefix “Mac” in the names, so maybe there were cultural differences in the naming tradition in the other countries.

*** Isn't this just fandom? As far as I remember JKR only made up the whole sacred 28 crap later in Pottermore and even that was more along the lines of a self-conceited pureblood blowing his own horn and his buddies' instead of either an accepted social convention or an actual title of nobility. Plus the whole division between noble/ancient/most was only shown by the Black family private tapestry if I am not mistaken (also the name of a chapter of HBP, but this is more meta rather than actual part of the book). Plus, in Pottermore it was said that the Potters never actually made it into the “sacred 28” because their name was too common and they married muggleborns from time to time.

***** Petty sure the squibs thing is fannom, unless JKR said something about it in an interview, I think there is no actual answer about where muggleborns come from... though to be fair this one is petty probable, the Creevey brothers are both muggleborns and have a two years age gap (Colin showed up in CoS while Dennis was sorted in GoF if I am not mistaken), so the chances of it being a coincidence are petty slim.
