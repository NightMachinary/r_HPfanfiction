I've been thinking about my favourite fics and they all have fantastic battle scenes. Bungle in the Jungle and it's sequel, old and new world, to fight the coming darkness ect. I enjoy it when more than four spells are used in a duel as well.


** I like your taste in fic. JBern is really imaginative.

Have you read any of Bobmin's stories? Sunset Over Britain and Sunrise over Britain have some pretty epic battles and some brilliant use of magical theory.

*** I like it too. I've read both of them and I've read one or two of their others, have you read the Queen who fell series? If so is it worth a read to those who have no idea what the dragonriders of pern is?

**** Hmm. Hard to tell. I think he has the potential to write a couple more arcs, so I don't think it's ending soon.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] has a couple I really liked. Very first chapter/prelude has a pretty good one but if memory serves the one I really liked was the fight in the 15th movement.

The fights are more sparse though so for constant action there is, of course, the Denarian Renegade etc. series.

*** I'm waiting for Sitra Ahra to be finished before I get caught up in it. I've not actually read through the Denarian series, I didn't like the first couple of chapters. Does it get better?
