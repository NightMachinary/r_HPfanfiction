Not a literal shower thought. I was just working on something regarding wands, and realized something interesting. Magic cores may have a logical basis to exist.

Wands have cores. Some cores are more powerful than others. Some have distinct magical effects. Some magic cores can get so depressed that they become incapable of using magic. They can even die, leaving a wand nothing more than a complicated stick. The core of the wand seems to be where the real heavy lifting is done by the wand, while the wood is just there to add flavor.

Which brings us to wizards. If wizards can cast spells without wands, and wands need a core to cast spells, that suggests that something equivalent to a magical core is what's allowing the wizard to cast spells. Maybe physical, maybe not. The body could be equivalent to the wand wood.

If so, all the tropes surrounding magical cores may be reasonably close to canon. The existence of cores that are just naturally stronger than others, cores burning themselves out, even cores being linked somehow. It's all been right there, the entire time.

I just thought I'd share an observation I made with the people who would hate it the most, as payback for all the threads about hated tropes.

The deduction you make is over-the-top. Many of those (magical exhaustion, ...) don't have much basis in canon, regardless of the existence of cores.

Fleur's wand for example has hair of her grandmother. Indeed, it seems that a lot of materials are useful, such as phoenix feathers, dragon heartstring, troll-whiskers, ...

It seems more likely that /every single fiber/ - including hair and whiskers! - of a magical being can channel magic, making an argument for the absence of any physical core.

** The obvious rebuttal is that a wizard is not a wand. The idea that they would share similar construction/structure is kinda baseless.

Right now I'm just imagining Hagrid waving Ron around, trying to cast magic with him.

**** Actually, my new headcanon is that the reason wizards and witches wear pointy hats and long robes is to make themselves more wand-shaped, so they can focus their magic easier.

** The wand cores are just a part of magical creatures though and not some specialised organ. Also both unicorns and phoenixes have multiple hairs/feathers, can live without them and they have different materials with magical properties like blood for unicorns and tears for phoenixes. So it's not in any way similar to magical cores.

** Here's the way I would use magical cores if I decided too.

Core Magic is the most developed system of magic with the most spells made and so that is what is taught in schools. Generations of wizards have contributed to this system and it is the most widely understood way to use magic. It's like Windows is for computers.

However cores only exist because you're looking for them. You're expecting them to be there and so they show up when you look. You can develop spells for them, you can measure their output, etc... but ultimately this is all an illusion. Cores don't actually exist. Wizards are aware of this but practicality trumps uncertainty. The system works so they use it.

In this way there can also be other spells that are still mysteriously magical.

** I would like to argue that Wands and Staves DO NOT /need/ cores in order to work, the cores, however, do amplify the Magic a user out puts and probably acts as a better focus. I assume that you can widdle a piece of wood finely and it could act as a channel for Magic just as well. Wands in the Potterverse have probably become more personalised and are no longer a tool and more of a companion for Wizards.

As for your argument, I dislike the idea of a Magical 'core' tbh. I think Magic just flowing through the Wizards body at a constant rate and when you use a spell it generates more is a much better idea. Because the size of the Magical Core automatically means the Power of the Wizard, but when Magic flows through your body, it's more of the quality of the Magic that decides how powerful it is, though there are some people who naturally have a higher capacity for storage etc....

I'm surprised no one has actually asked Rowling about this on Twitter.

** People just hate the fact that magic is in fact genetic and there is a biological interaction. It makes magic less "magic" to them. I love magical cores as it clarifies and quantifies the magic system in the series.

*** Except that they aren't canon and I can imagine my magical world how I want, thank you.

I can even ignore (gasp!) that Rowling said that magic is genetic, and just roll my own for my fanfiction. Because my fanfiction is /my/ story, and I dictate the rules.

However, when we are discussing how canon is interpreted we should stick to the text - and not our imaginations. And in the text there isn't much argument for magical cores.

**** I think you're right. The horcrux really was limiting Harry's magical core. However when he casts heavy light spells like the pertronus, the light magic temporarily pushes back the dark magic of the horcrux. It explains why he was able to fight back 100 dementors. Harry must have an insane magical core... probably on the same level as voldy and dumbledore...

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
