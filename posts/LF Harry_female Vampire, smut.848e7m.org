I was thinking about Harry gets in a team with a Vampire to do business in a different Country. The Vampire gets attracted to him and flirts with him (in an attempt of seduction). But Harry is only focused on their Business (maybe also afraid that she might bite him). As Vampires as known as the "Masters of seduction", she can bring him under her influence at a later Point, by taking him Off-guard (influence is the wrong word, but maybe she does something like that) and they have a Night Session. However, if there are Lovebites, he doesnt get infected....because of whatever reason (maybe she can decide, who she infest).

If there is no Order from the Ministry, he has a High Mental defense to block her approaches.
