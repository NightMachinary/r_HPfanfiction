She was sufficiently surprised when Harry's grades got even better without the book. Turns out instructions in the book were actually subpar and Harry just did better without Snape hovering behind him. Enough to compensate for the books inferior methods.


** It isn't so far removed from canon. He got an 'E' in his Potions O.W.L.S. He was also doing good in class when Snape wasn't berating him after he saw Snape's memories. His Potion was good enough, but then Snape broke the vial "on accident".

** "Surely, Potter, you didn't think that I would fill a book with all of my best ideas and advice and just leave it for any dunderhead to find and use? Yes, of course, some improvements---particularly the first few---were genuine. Those after that? The very fact that you are standing here, with both eyes seeing and all limbs intact, tells me that you are either a far more talented a wizard and potioneer than I had imagined, or that you possess a special gland that secretes Felix Felicis."

**** Harry was conceived when Lily and James both decided to take some Felix Felicis independently and without the other's knowledge. Lily took it because she was having trouble getting pregnant and wanted a bit of extra help. James took it because he just wanted to "get lucky."

***** If you take in consideration that Lily was only 19 when she got pregnant with Harry (only a little more than one year after she graduated from Hogwarts) I think we can rule out that they had trouble getting pregnant. I wouldn't be surprised if Harry was an accident.

Other than that, I love the idea of both of them taking Felix Felicis while conceiving Harry.

****** You make a good point, but it's still not impossible. Maybe fertility issues run in her family. Maybe she was hit by a curse or was in some sort of magical accident that healers said would make it hard for her to get pregnant. Maybe a muggle doctor told her it would be difficult for her to get pregnant for some reason, so she looked for a magical solution.

Or maybe Lily just also wanted to "get lucky."

Or maybe they were into some really weird kinks, so they decided to take Felix Felicis beforehand to make sure no one got hurt.

But I guess those last two would make Harry probably an accident.

******* Could be that the war was going on and neither had seen each other for longer than a few hours to sleep. Both took the Potion to hopefully have a good day, and they did... Along with lots and lots of sex. But due to the way the potion completely penetrates your entire being to give you luck, Lily drops a Luck imbued egg, James is shoot luck Infused sperm and Harry is naturally lucky

******** So? I know a woman who has two children, but has also had at least three miscarriages and has been unsuccessfully trying to even get pregnant again for years. Fertility is complicated, and there are more possibilities than just "you can't have kids," "you're lucky to have one kid," and "you can have as many kids as you want."

Maybe her parents wanted more kids, but were only able to have two. We don't actually know what the gap between Petunia and Lily's ages, so there could have even been several years of failing to get pregnant between their births.

******* Of course not. That's not what I meant.

I mean that 19 is very young to have children. And because it was only one year after Hogwarts she must have gotten pregnant pretty quickly after their wedding.
