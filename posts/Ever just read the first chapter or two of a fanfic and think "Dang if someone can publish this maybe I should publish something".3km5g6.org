Seriously, sometimes it's like, maybe I should stop being a perfectionist and just go for it! If some of these idiots can post them and get good reviews than so can I!


** That's basically why I started writing- the 'I can do better than /that/' challenge. It's not about being the best writer; it's about writing something that others enjoy and then improving as you get the encouragement.

The first time I posted a chapter I was giddy to see the read count go up. When I got a review (a positive one, thankfully), well, it was like a taste of fine chocolate. Or heroin.

*** I think a lot of people start out writing fanfiction as a reaction to stories they've read that just weren't /quite/ right. I know I certainly did. My first thing, which admittedly never really went very far, was a pretty vanilla time-travel story that was meant to 'fix' all the problems I kept seeing in other mediocre time-travel stories.

I posted it on DLP and the response was... almost non-existent. I took the hint and it was a while before I made another attempt. My next attempt also wasn't especially interesting but it was, at least, an unusual combination. That got a bit more interest.

**** Getting a following of fans is a huge milestone, but DLP evaluates at a different level of criticism- not whether something might be entertaining but whether the writing is reaching the publishable stage.

For the new writer I would avoid asking for their attention until you're looking for true critical guidance. They evaluate against a stricter standard than 'this story is better than most'.

** As others said here too: I often think "I can do better than that" and then write my own fic.

But also remember this: those people who write shitty stories and publish them still have the guts to actually publish their work. It could also be that they're delusional and have an image of fame and fortune in their heads, but there are a lot of very inexperienced writers out there who, despite probably feeling unsatisfied about their fic, still publish it.

I won't congratulate them on fantastic writing, but I will commend them for publishing it.

** Yes. Then I wrote a fanfic. And it sucked. But it got loads of likes.

** This was me for like 8 years. I mulled around a story idea for so long, and eventually I just started it in January. Thankfully I've gotten good reviews, and only one bad review( I called Tonks 'Mrs. Tonks' once whoops). That said, as I approach the 60k mark, I can tell me writing is drastically improved over my earlier writing and I want to go back and redo the first few chapters.

** The most important reason why I dont write any fanfics myself is that I dont trust my (english) grammatic skills enought for that long textes.

** That's exactly how I started writing. I figured, well, my story might be crap, but at least there's so many bad stories out there that I won't have to feel embarrassed about it.
