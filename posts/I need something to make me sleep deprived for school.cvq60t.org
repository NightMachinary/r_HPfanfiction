I want stories I can binge read. So long fics, well written, no slash and absolutely, under no circumstances is there to be Severitus.

Thanks


** You should concentrate at school.

However, I understand putting fanfiction first. I was reading hp fanfiction throughout my entire last year of sixth form. Would even read during ALL my classes - exasperated my teachers.

Anyway, a fic I really like and one that you probably haven't read as it is quite niche is linkffn(Hypocrisy) by Sachita. It's a beautiful TMR/Minerva fic.

*** Snape is Harry's father. The term was originally for biological, but i have seen it used for adopted here and there.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) is long, no slash, I like how it's written, it teaches you some math and Hermione is struggling with being sleep deprived and she's constantly only awake because of Pepper-Up potions.

** linkffn(A Difference In The Family)

even with a 24/7 binge this will take you at least a week to get through.

Author also has several Prequels, so you can continue your binge.
