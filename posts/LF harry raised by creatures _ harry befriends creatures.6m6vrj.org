I've stumbled upon a few fics during my years reading fanfics, of a certain kind that got me hooked on that specific genre. Lately I've tried google to help me find more, but i never seem to be able to find any. So now i hope reddit can help!

Are there any good (and long?) Fics where harry is raised by animals/magical creatures? It can be human harry (raised by unicorns in one fic i saw) Or i can be animagus harry raised by his new species (snake harry I've seen before) Those fics tend to have harry found/rescured around hogwarts time, which is fine with me, as long as the fic has some good incorporation of interaction between harry and the animals/creatures Can also be sentient species for wizardbashing for funsies.

And are there any good long fics where harry befriends magical/sentient creatures? I read a fic where harry is saved and then befriends a fairy/snow nymph (cant remember, only she was tiny, and could turn into mist)

Bonus for fics where harry escapes the dursleys early on, and survives on his own in nature while meeting all sorts of strange creatures.

Bonus if he runs into luna while beeing raised/being animagus in the forest and hilarity ensues

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Linkffn(basilisk born) may fit the criteria. It has two time lines to follow: the 1990s time line and merlin up to present time line. It is a pretty fun read though it gets draggy sometimes when the author is world building.

** linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild): Harry is raised by Shakespeared-style Fairies. It's a pretty good story. Don't let the Harry/Voldemort pairing spook you, the fic was abandoned before it got to that to any meaningful degrees and apparently the pairing would have been with a progressively-redeemed Scardemort as opposed to the main Voldie.
