Maybe just generally where the court gets schooled, for both his under-age magic trial, and for a possible Sirius trial.


** Try this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144149/37/Not-Normal][Not Normal Ch37-40]].

I highly recommend not reading the rest of the story. I just enjoy the court proceedings in this fic.

Edit: Start reading like mid-chapter 36. Where Dumbledore reads his invitation to the manor court.

*** Can you clarify why you would recommend not reading the rest of the story? And please be detailed.. not just say "its bad". Heh.. I am honestly curious. Highly unusual to recommend a few chapters of a story but not the rest.

**** It's a "Harry Potter gets forced into a Harem, lives in a massive magical trunk estate with time compression." type of fic. Where the girls in the fic have to have "girlsex" to help regulate their magic and Harry feels noting sexual because of the "bonding". Throw in some soul-bonding and marriage contracts.. and it's just filled with so many bad tropes that I really can't recommend the story normally. But god damn is the Manor Court done REALLY, REALLY well. And I started re-reading those chapters because of my recommendation, so it should be amended to be from mid Chapter 36 to Chapter 40.
