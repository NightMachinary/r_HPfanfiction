Hi! This is my first post here and I wanted to promote my Percy/Oliver fic over on AO3. It's really smutty, so if that's not your thing, then I'd avoid it, but I worked pretty hard on it (and continue to do so). It's set around HBP-era, so (obviously) before the Battle of Hogwarts. The title is kind of crap, but...

** I'm adding it to my to-read list! You should share it over on [[/r/hpslashfic]] too. :)

And - do you have a tumblr? If you make a post and tag the hprarepairnet they'll reblog it for you and you'll probably get some more interest there! Not often such a tiny rare pair gets a long fic so I'm sure there'd be some good interest.

Good luck with the rest! I'm looking forward to reading it. :)

*** I just xposted it on [[/r/hpslashfic]]. I LOVE Percy/Oliver - Percy was one of my first RP characters and I always looked for an Oliver to pair him with. Thanks for the info on tumblr; I'll do that!

**** No problem! I adore both of them myself (though I tend to ship Oliver/Marcus Flint, and lately am in the midst of a really big Percy/Pansy thing?) and there isn't NEARLY enough with these two.
