What do you consider to be the very best of HP fanfic? You can have different “bests” for different types of fic.

For me, the best Voldemort is in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]] .

The best worldbuilding is in lightningonthewave's Saving Connor series (which is m/m,beware those that avoid it) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

And the best time travel fic is the sadly unfinished Nightmares of Futures Past. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]


** The Sum of Their Parts is up there for me.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
