Quidditch is a game. A game in universe that most fanfiction writers cast aside for something alot more flashy, i.e. dueling or whatever the hell else.

But, like most things JustKidding Rowling put into her story, there's a bit of a hidden meaning. The arbitrary point values, the stupid value of the snitch? All components of this hidden meaning.

That hidden meaning being, that even if the peons, even when the proles (The Keeper, The Chasers and The Beaters) make massive amounts of points, it will always be overshadowed by a bigger fish, doing what seems to be a small act (The Seeker catching the snitch).

And this motif is shown all over rowling's work. The Death Eaters toppling the ministry of magic, the Death Eaters gaining a complete stranglehold over wizarding society, only for all of their work to be nullified by Harry killing Voldemort. Guess they should've scored 160 points instead of 150.

Either way, that's my own particular flavor of fanon. What does quidditch mean in your guy's head cannons?

*** Yes, a cursory Google search brings up this Rowling quote about her inventing Quidditch after a row with her then boyfriend

#+begin_quote
  “It infuriates men, in my experience (why is the Snitch so valuable etc), which is quite satisfying given my state of mind when I invented it.”

** Honestly, quidditch doesn't even seen that unreasonable of game. Games can take days and weeks so the 150 points can barely be a blip, at the end of a lengthy game. Even in shorter games, the point totals are very important for league placements.

Now, it is pretty unreasonable for people to watch a sport for days, but then again people watch people kick a ball around on a field in real life so who am I to judge?

*** It always peeved me that people don't tend to realize quidditch is a very tournament based game. The outcome of the singular game isnt as important as the points. The 150 points is a ludicrous amount because it incentives winning and stopping the game before the opposing team racks up more points to do better in the leaderboard via goals. The chasers while not drastically affecting the sway of the match, possibly play a more deterministic role in points especially in games that go long. A good example is that of the quidditch world cup. While it was the final match, the strategy of catching the snitch even when down is still valid to prevent your opponents from racking up more points.

**** Thank you, yes. I mean, having the weasley twins make the bet they did was a pretty blatant way for Rowling to say "yes, guys, the other players still matter."

*** Can you imagine living in a wizard society with permissive drug laws and actual magic, and attending a World Cup that lasts for weeks and partying the whole time? Wizards would be /wild/, man.
