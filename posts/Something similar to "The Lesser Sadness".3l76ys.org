** There should be an extra chapter/interlude for this fic on the Work by Author section of DLP.

Paging [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]]. Update plz.

*** Thinking about it. I don't have The Lesser Sadness plotted out - I just know where it's going and a few scenes along the way. It's really not a fic that lends itself to "grinding it out"-style writing.

Or maybe I'm just lazy? I dunno.

**** Out of curiosity, which is more fun to write, TLS or WYLB? I presume the latter is rigorously plotted with notes and spreadsheets and all, while the former is written depending on how you feel at the moment, so you have more freedom. Also, being the less important story, you have less pressure to finish a chapter on time. TLS sounds more fun in that sense, though I suppose the sense of achievement from WYLB's success is greater.

Also, very curious (and skeptical) about your Slytherin!Luna story I have heard a bit about. If you manage to write a convincing novel length fic about Luna in Slytherin, then I will declare you the greatest fanfiction writer of all time.

***** I'd say TLS is more fun to write. There are scenes I have planned out for WYLB that I think will be, overall, more fun. But yeah, especially since TLS is more like a vehicle for "fun super!Harry ideas" rather than a, you know, actual good story, I'd say it's more fun.

The Slytherin!Luna thing... it's something I've been kicking around for a while. The key would be that you don't change Luna, you just change her circumstances and how she Lunas it up in a different environment.

** This is kinda dumb since in some ways they aren't similar at all, but as you haven't gotten any other responses I'll throw this in there.

The Lesser Sadness and linkffn(Messing With Time) are inexplicably linked in my mind. They are both well-written time travel and having fun with overpowered Harry, not taking it too seriously while not being a crackfic either. There are lots of differences, but at the same time I don't think there's anything quite like TLS out there, so.... try it and you might like it?

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.
