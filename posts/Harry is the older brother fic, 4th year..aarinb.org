I'm looking for a specific fic and for the love of God I can't remember the title.

​

It was basically the not often used "Harry is the older brother and is in his 7th year by the time of the Tri-Wizard".

​

The defining features were:

- Harry had a limp from the troll incident.

- He was romancing Fleur.

- The fic was unfinished and ended by the time of the first task when a dragon escaped after the event was completed, and Harry transfigured a ?bird? from the damaged stands to combat it.

​

Those were probably all the things I remember, some might not be correct.
