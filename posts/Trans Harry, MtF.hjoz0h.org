I, myself, am MtF trans and would love to see a Harry that I can relate to in this way. Preferably a longer story that puts the main focus on Harry being trans and how that affects his (her? idk the right pronouns to use for a request) Hogwarts experience.


** Probably barely an inconvenience with magic.

There is one fic where Harry is forced to attend Hogwarts as a woman for a whole year, idk if it interests you.
