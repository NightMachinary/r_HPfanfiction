So with NaNo coming up, we approach a most contentious issue. What do you write with?

Are you a simple, no-nonsense person with OpenOffice or Word open, trudging along the simple path to fanfic completion?

Are you an incorrigible planner, creating detailed minutiae through Scrivener or QuollWriter, splitting everything into categories of characters, chapters, objects, favourite words...?

Do you have separate programs for writing and planning? Is there anything you use that you think is especially good for fanfiction?


** Google Docs. I mean, I don't think you really need much beyond the ability to type, make bold, italic and underline, which almost all word processors can do. So beyond that the main factor for me is convenience, and the Cloud nature of Google Docs makes it extremely convenient. You can pick up your work wherever you are.

*** Agreed. Allows me to work on the same story at home and at work, and even on my phone without having to do anything special.

*** As a beta, I love Google Docs; I can pick up a story on my phone, which makes me more prompt than my laptop, which I would reserve for a line-by-line parsing for mechanics later in the process. Authors can have conversations with me about an individual word, and it makes for a deeper, more productive dialogue between us.

I also like how easy it is to flip the screen to black; more than one author uses this visual difference to see errors pop. Others tell me having Google read their work aloud is helpful.

(I will never give up on a notebook. I'm currently using a homemade traveler's notebook with a stack of Moleskines and a sharp Blackwing pencil, which is too expensive for a repeat purchase, but the eraser is glorious. Not like you asked, but anyway.)

** I personally use QuollWriter for all of my writing and planning - it's free, it's open source, and it allows me to use numerous tabs, as well as being able to look at statistics. Statistics and tabs are my twin passions.

For planning I also use GoogleKeep, which is Google's online post-it note app. It's great for jotting down and organising snatches of dialogue or ideas.

** Depends on what your needs as a writer are. Personally I am partial to yWriter when it comes to stories and Word when it comes to things of other kind (wrote a few user's manuals in it), as well as Notepad++ for random notes and simple things like patch notes; that said, there are a plethora of other programs (and not only programs) that one can use.

So, rather than it being about what is good or better or the best, it's about what you happen to like the most for your writing.

** I normally use [[http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html][yWriter]] (since it's free) for the writing and organizing of scenes/chapters. I use OpenOffice's version of Excel for my timelines and lists. And plain old Notepad for ideas and prompts because I don't need all the extras for what is basically scratch paper.

I did download the trial that Scrivener is running for NaNoWriMo [[http://literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.php][here]], and about the only feature I like that yWriter doesn't have is the corkboard. Still don't know which program I'll be writing in tomorrow.

** For me personally: Google Docs (or any other Cloud service).

I can write on any computer, read and edit on my phone and tablet and it has a brilliant automatic-save function. Its easy in design and features, but the few tools it has (chapters, commentary-threads) are powerful enough for some effective writing.

** I'm using Scrivener this nano because I feel like it's fitting my work style really well right now.

I like having chapters as folders and then scenes within those. I'll typically have 3-4 "scenes" per chapter I think. They may all happen the same day, one chapter spans a few weeks according to my rough outline. It makes it feel more manageable - I can sit and just write one scene and that's cool!

I also really like the option to "compile" it and view either the whole chapter or whole fic all in one doc.

I like having separate areas for characters (I have a handful) so I can quickly refer back, like "shit what was so and sos job again?"

For this fic too I have a bunch of stuff all ready to go in my research area too. An outline, a thing full of inspiring quotes, a whole file with references for a character's detailed tattoo. I have one just for things I'd like to include but that don't fit super well into the outline. (Like, "x and y have a conversation about z" - I outline roughly so that doesn't work, usually just a sentence or two per scene/chapter, but I'll check back to this doc every once in a while to see "oh yeah! I want this to happen where can I make it work?")

Yes, I could probably do all this in google docs. But having it all conveniently in once place, being able to switch back and forth a lot? That's really useful for me and I've really enjoyed it in the planning stages so I'm going to stick with it for now!

** It doesn't matter what you write in so long as you're comfortable with it and store it somewhere safe (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).

Google Docs' autosave and/or saving into Dropbox exclusively prevents the sad tale of, "My computer died and ate chapters 2-100 so updates will be slow while I reconstruct my epic story that I didn't bother to back up anywhere."
