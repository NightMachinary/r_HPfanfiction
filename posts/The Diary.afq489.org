Any fics out there where the Diary Tom Riddle was affected by those 50 years of solitude? Did he become even more insane? Desperate for attention? Clingy? I'd really love to read something like this.


** Here are a few fics that explore the psychological impact on the Diary horcrux:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sysyphus]] - The Diary is extremely clingy when it makes an appearance in year two, which varies between tragic and darkly humorous. In particular, the part of the story starting in chapter 48 contains some of my favorite scenes in fanfiction. linkffn(9911469)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702269/1/Do-Androids-Dream-of-Electric-Sheep][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]] - This fic explores the psychological toll on the Diary horcrux during its 40 year imprisonment. It discards parts of its memories/personality to make its existence less torturous, and eventually It struggles with the question of whether it can consider itself human at all. linkffn(9702269)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10785698/1/Transcendence][Transcendence]] - After regaining a body in the Chamber of Secrets the Diary horcrux is not entirely sane. However, when he interacts with the smaller soul pieces trapped in the other horcruxes he discovers that his state of imprisonment was not nearly as torturous as theirs. linkffn(10785698)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731/chapters/7591550][The Two-Body Problem]] - Hermione performs psychological torture on the Diary horcrux to get what she needs. (Story is marked restricted on Ao3; must login to read it.)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem. AU

  Tom thought that perhaps fifty years of utter isolation and stagnation in a diary was a small price to pay to gain the advantages of being a living Horcrux, even if he was probably a bit mad from the experience. After all, being mad was no impediment to a Dark Lord.

*** Lul I don't really like the Hermiome wank the last one is...but

Eh the author writes the diary the way she writes it, I guess....like how it doesn't "go to sleep" when a line is drawn or something like that...

**** Why do you think it's a 'Hermione wank'? Personally I thought it was an interesting take on how Hermione's vigilante tendencies can get extremely dark. It's a good look at her flaws.

***** Because it's a Hermione centric story.. Anyway, it's Hermione wank because it shows her as a psychologist genuis. Also, why wouldn't Hermione have handed the diary in? Yes,she said that her faith in authority figures had dwindled down, but what did she think they would do? It was bloody Tom Riddle, for heaven's sake! Mcgonagall would have known from her talks with Dumbledore(JK Rowling said it herself....). And the diary. The diary! That method wouldn't have worked, as the most the ink would have done was to sink into the pages; Tom would not have been desperate to possess someone because no matter how Dumbledore puts it, he also is a horcrux. Whether a weapon or not, he knows that his main purpose is to keep the master soul from dying. I know that I'm just ranting here but I really don't like Hermione lel

And yes, I know this was AU

Not sure what gave you this impression. She doesn't show any advanced knowledge of psychology. In particular, she doesn't understand the implications of what she learns about Riddle's childhood at the orphanage. She also fails to recognize some cases where the Diary is trying to manipulate her. Overall her character is well balanced for what an intelligent kid her age could learn from books.

As for the Diary, the fic author writes it differently from canon on purpose, and in my opinion the result is an excellent story. Regarding the Diary's motives in the fic: It was pretty clear to me that the Diary wanted to end its own existence even before Hermione entered the picture. If the Diary just wanted a body (or to help the main soul) then it could have avoided drawing any attention and quietly sapped Ginny's soul until it had the strength it needed. Instead it created a massive spectacle to draw attention right under Dumbledore's nose. The clincher is when it told Hermione exactly how to cast Fiendfire and the fact that the spell can be used to destroy dark artifacts. The Diary could have tempted her with any other spell it knew, but instead it gave her the exact tool needed to kill it. It's a clear call for assisted suicide that Hermione failed to notice because she lacks the 'psychological genius' you claim.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)
