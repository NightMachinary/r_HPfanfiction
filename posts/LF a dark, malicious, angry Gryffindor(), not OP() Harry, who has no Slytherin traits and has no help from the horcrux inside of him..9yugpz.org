There are plenty of dark!Harry fics. Usually he is in Slytherin, super cunning, outsmarts even Tom Riddle and is super OP.

A typical boring hero villain.

I would like a fic that is not like that at all.

I want to see an angry, evil, brash Gryffindor Harry, who acts before he thinks and is not super clever. Basically canon Harry, but with a very different reaction to his abuse. I have never seen anything like that.

Thank you.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** check out circular reasoning; very Gryffindor dark harry who never thinks things through and is convinced he is doing right even as he kills/tortures tons of people. He still cares for people as shown by him going ballistic against human traffickers who abused their prostitutes but has no qualms with leading a troop of scouts into an ambush he saw coming just to get the chance to torture enemy troops for information

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** I think you can try linkffn(darkness within). He doesn't seem like a canon Harry, but he is definitely too Gryffindor.
