** Let me tell you a story about a better-treated Harry Potter.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
This Harry's Aunt Petunia still feared magic, the magic that took away her sister, but she didn't take it out on Harry. Instead, she raised him like a second son, along with Dudley, and she planned a way so that Harry wouldn't leave her forever, like Lily.

With one hand, she wrote to wizards, getting to know Dumbledore, then McGonagall, then through them all of James and Lily's remaining friends. She invited them over for tea and biscuits, helping them learn how to dress and act Muggle, teaching them about the wonders of her world while at the same time inviting them to teach Harry about the good things in theirs.

With the other hand, she gave Harry muggle experiences, training and tutoring him and Dudley as best she could, in sports and science and the history of normal humans, good and bad. She made sure he knew what to do and where to go if there was ever trouble, he learned to take things apart and put them together, his curiosity was nourished instead of suppressed.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Time passed. Letters from Hogwarts came, they wrote back and asked for help. Hagrid came and made his goofy silly first impression.

Harry still chose to go to Hogwarts, but it was a near thing this time; Harry's curiosity and wonder at learning /more/ magic (James & Lily's friends had been very helpful and somewhat mischievous), barely won out over his fear of leaving his family.

When the Sorting came, Harry had the honor, but he didn't have the courage, nor subtlety or cunning. Hufflepuff.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
His first year, he didn't get up to any mischief, though the warning about the third-floor corridor made him nervous. A dangerous accident at the Quidditch Pitch, even more nervous. Baby Norbert wasn't that frightening after he (she?) was safely sent abroad.

He never did find out about the Philosopher's Stone, or Quirrel's attempt to take it; the latter succeeded but was stopped from leaving with it by Dumbledore.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
Second year, the house-elf's warning worried Harry enough to send a letter describing the warning to Hogwarts. He still went, though, and happened to befriend a certain Ginny Weasley. He very nearly left Hogwarts after the second petrification, but didn't go through with it.

In the end, Ginny had the strength to dispose of the dark diary, and in this timeline, she was close enough to Harry to tell him about her fears; Harry later passed a not-very-anonymous tip to the professors, and that Horcrux stopped bothering anyone.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-4
   :END:
Third year, that year tested Harry the hardest. Sirius Black still escaped, the dementors were still posted around Hogwarts, and Harry hated every moment of it. Only the presence of Remus Lupin, who he knew well and trusted despite his secret, managed to keep him at Hogwarts.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-5
   :END:
And then came Halloween. Sirius Black broke into the castle. Harry's jitters reached an all time high. When Pomona Sprout brought him into her office, gave him some chocolate, and told him that Sirius Black was in all likelihood after Harry, Harry looked up and said:

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-6
   :END:
"Sod this for a lark, guvner. This place's getting buggered up worse each year. Nothin' on you tossers, but I'm shoving off."

And then, using the surprisingly simple Animagus trick Professor Lupin had taught him,

[[http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/oh-shi.gif][he turned into a very Hufflepuffian badger and scooted away.]]

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-7
   :END:
He was never seen again, by the magical world at least. His Gringotts account emptied itself out, and the Dursleys moved to Switzerland, where Aunt Petunia spent the rest of her days caring for an incredibly clever badger.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
