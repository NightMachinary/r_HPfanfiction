This one bugs me a lot. People put Harry with Tonks, or write her as a protagonist, but then go ahead and take her coolest, most creative trait, and make it an uncreative, basic and boring mess. Most fics then go ahead and make Tonks instantly fall in love with Harry because he likes her "just like she is" or some shit like that.

Well, guess what, she *is* a metamorph. You have a shapeshifting girlfriend. Accept her /as she is/ and rejoice.

Honestly, I'm looking for a fic in which metamorphing has barely any limits. Sex switching? No problem. Taking on anyone's appearance? Easy. Shocking people by taking the form of Lovecraftian monsters? Just a prank, mate.

Gimme some awesome metamorphing.


** Tonks is a blob monster with a human mind.

Make it part of a world in which all the magical talents are taken to their extremes. Parseltongue works with any reptile or depiction of one, allows for control of the same, and can even empower them. Parselmagic is a thing. A Seer is a literal prescient and given prophecies are set in stone. People like Lockhart that have great talent in a single field or even a single spell at a cost to their ability with the rest of magic are true virtuosos with their specialty, talented beyond any ability of others to obtain. And so on.

I could dig that.

** Once I read a tonks story which was really interesting. I couldn't remember if they had base form bs or not, but they described Tonks as having full control over her biology, to the point where the auther was describing her shifting her internal organs about in gruesome detail after she was hit by a car. Guy had to be a doctor or bio major. I don't recall which one it was. I think Tonks was a side character though.

  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.

** Full nerd ramble? Full nerd ramble.

Technically, that is more or less how the metamorph talent works in my headcanon. I'm one of those silly people who writes a universe where transfiguration is inherently temporary. The only exception (excluding alchemy) are a metamorph's natural abilities --- simply put, they subconsciously convince reality they are untransfigured, making any transfigurative effects on them permanent. They have no "base form": whatever they happen to look like at any given moment /is/ their true form. The same subconscious will to be whatever they want to be also allows them to change their shape as they please, but that does take some getting used to.

There are major advantages to being a metamorph. For one thing, their subconscious make-transfigurations-permanent ability works with anything they conceptualise as part of themselves, making them the only exception to the "you can't eat conjured food" rule. (Only for themselves, they can't feed others.) Physically making themselves whatever they want to be means they are effectively immortal --- they can be killed, of course, but they don't age like normal people do. They can switch between human appearances at will, switching sexes is no problem at all, and making themselves other humanoid beings isn't too difficult either (though without any magical abilities particular to the race). Turning themselves into things not human-shaped is /difficult/ --- they still need to be able to physically function, so it would take some practical knowledge of anatomy --- but possible with a bit of effort, as long as whatever it is is organic, and can sustain full consciousness. So, Lovecraftian monsters? If they can design in their head some kind of functional anatomy that makes sense to them, no problem. Also, as a rule, metamorphs are exceptionally magically powerful, but that is necessary for the ability to actually work. Just the way they are.

There are disadvantages as well. Learning to control their abilities does take a bit of trial and error. It's not unheard of for a metamorph to attempt something beyond their control, trying to take a shape where their blood can't flow properly or they can't breathe, or fuck up their brain or whatever, and accidentally killing themselves. Offensive transfiguration magic can sometimes be deadly, even prank jinxes that wouldn't be especially harmful for a normal person. Potions sometimes have wildly unpredictable effects. Healing magic for metamorphs is a crapshoot --- /some/ common healing spells/potions work just fine, but some don't. Even though metamorphs can theoretically live forever, they often die before they reach (legal) adulthood, either from various mishaps or Healers accidentally killing them trying to treat simple illness or injury.

Metamorphs are also a bit psychologically...strange. A not insignificant part of the human concept of self is wrapped up in things a metamorph can change at will, so being a little odd isn't unexpected. Though, I wouldn't really call this an advantage or a downside. It does often result in social difficulties, yes, but metamorphs usually don't give a fuck. Kind of a wash.

While I have come up with all of this, it hasn't really been obvious in either of my fics so far. Dora is there, being her quirky headcanon self, but she isn't a very prominent character. The sequel to To Reach Without, though, will have a metamorph for a main character. Or one of the main characters, anyway. An OC, yes, which I anticipate a lot of people to not be happy about, but I tend strongly to AU anyway.

Okay, full nerd ramble complete. Bluh.

** I think the whole 'bad time with boyfirends wanting her to be other people' was canon, not fanon? If so, given how little of her there is in the books, something like that would easily dominate what material their is about her.

Given that, it doesn't surprise me how many people do the soulmate thing go from 'a bunch of bad experiences in school' to 'everyone made this mistake but because true luv the main couple will not'. And it is totally over-cliche'd

Ironically, deconstructing/inverting it would actually be interesting now in a Honks fic: Have Harry make the same mistake with Nymphadora but realize he has stumbled into a minefield and correcting his behavior. Because 'not knowing everything about your mate / not doing everything perfect the first time' would be a lot more realistic (and interesting).

I'm doing a non-Honks Harry/Tonks fic, and i ended up stalling out because of the difficulty of finding a good way to characterize Tonks. She is kinda a blank slate besides her power. She can shapeshift, she had probems with kids in school, she hates her name, and her husband ran out on her of fear of who he was. Kinda sums up her canon.

It isn't even that contradictory to being positive and proud about her metamorph identity. She wouldn't want to be treated as some kind of sideshow attraction right? She's a metamorph and she's going to indulge in her abilities wherever they are suitable (of course and especially in the bedroom), but she'd be just as weary of people who want to date her just for her abilites or people who want to prove they are 'nice guys' and pretend to ignore that aspect of her identity and proclaim they want to see the 'real you' (what an insult to a metamorph!).

I'm almost certain its not. In canon she was making pig snouts to entertain the kids at the dinner table. These are not the actions of a woman insecure about her ability to change herself.

Which, too, doesn't really limit anything, just hints at a form Tonks takes when she's down.

******** If you wanna make Metamorphmagus something it's not, go for it. It's your fanfic. I'm just saying that it doesn't fit with what canon describes. Might as well allow all Wizards the ability to use spells that allow them to shapeshift.

********* And I would argue that canon describes effectively nothing. Tonks is not going to tell a fifteen year old "I can have a dick if I want" and the rest of the quotes are as open to interpretation as anything - with a complete lack of the words "base form" to boot.

Neither the really outlandish and extreme forms of metamorphing I asked for, nor those who describe a "base form" are non-compliant with canon.

******* Ooookay... just a few pages along and we arrived at what I think you meant.

#+begin_quote
  “It's survivor's guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin's tried to talk her round, but she's still really down. She's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!” “With her --- ?” “She can't change her appearance like she used to,” explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.” “I didn't know that could happen,” said Harry. “Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you're really depressed . . .”
#+end_quote

So yeah, I'll admit that emotional upheaval can cause "problems with the metamorphosing" resulting in a inability or difficulty when ti comes to changing her form. Still, nobody said its her base form and "She can't change her appearance like she used to" can mean anything, starting from a complete block of the ability, to not being able to do colorful hair, or something.

******** Obviously, Hermione can't say if it's her base form or not, Hermione has never seen her base form to be capable of properly identifying it. I'm just saying that there is a certain amount of concentration required when it comes to Metamorphosing, changing your hair color is one thing (I mean, there's a charm for it so it can't be that hard) but changing your gender on a whim might not be possible. If you recall, Ginny asked her to "do the one that looks like a pig's snout", key word: looks like. This means that Tonks is only capable of changing her appearance in humanly feasible ways, or only capable of taking on human features.

And thats my point. Beyond what we read in the books, we just don't know. Hence why any interpretation of metamorphing is canon-compliant.

#+end_quote

And again, I'd argue that could mean anything. Ginny could use the words "look like" since its obviously not a pig's snout, but Tonk's nose that is transforming. There is no evidence for extreme metamorphing, but there is also no evidence against it. Given that hearsay, I'd rather go with the fun and frankly just /more magical/ extreme version.
