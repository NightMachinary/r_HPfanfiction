So a friend of mine linked me a picture using this conversation

Ron: Harry do you get that feeling like you don't know what you're doing?

Harry: Ron, If there's even a moment I imply that I know what I'm doing, it's an impostor.

Can We get more conversations like this? of just Ron, Harry or Hermione shooting the shit with each other and acting like actual friends instead of being serious all the time?

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

**** I know I've come across as whiney pointing this out in the past, but that story was written like 6 years ago, and only just published. She's pointed out she's trying to write her HP/SW fic, but is having less than actual progress at it. So I wouldn't hold your breath on getting an update for any of the stories.

***** Uh... the powerful magical artifact story was just written last year ish. It was originally a solo-Harry story, but the death of Chilord and our many conversations had me thinking about Ron and underutilized he can be when people really write him well. Then I changed it to make it a Harry and Ron story. Chilord just passed less than a year ago.

My muse has ADD and I struggle to write solo. I like to work with someone in writing and Plums' muse hasn't been able to wirte in any of these stories.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?
