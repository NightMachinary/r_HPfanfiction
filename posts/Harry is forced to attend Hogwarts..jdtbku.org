:END:
So I've been trying to find this story for the last few days. I don't remember what it's called or many details, but I remember it had Dumbledore kidnapping Harry and forcing him to attend Hogwarts, but because he wouldn't expel Harry, Harry refused to go to classes or detention.


** There's a fair few fics like that....anyway to narrow it down a little more?

*** I can't remember the details, but I vaguely remember something with him assaulting Draco and his groupies? Feel free to link anything you think meets the original post criteria though, I'll probably read it even if it's not the one I'm looking for.

**** As far as him being ‘kidnapped' and forced to Hogwarts the first one that came to mind was ‘willing' on ffn, that is Harry/Snape with a dom/sub dynamic though so I can't honestly say if that's what you're looking for or not... another might be 893 linkffn(7161848) but in that he is blackmailed into going to Hogwarts and doesn't want to be there... but like I said, there are literally stacks of them out there, but maybe try searching for some key words and the fic you're looking for might pop up

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.
