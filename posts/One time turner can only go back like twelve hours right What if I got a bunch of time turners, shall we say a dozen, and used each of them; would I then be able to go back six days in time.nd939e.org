#+TITLE: One time turner can only go back like twelve hours right? What if I got a bunch of time turners, shall we say a dozen, and used each of them; would I then be able to go back six days in time?

** You probably could, but any halfway decent magic system will find a way to punish someone for trying to abuse the rules of time travel like that.

*** Halfway decent? So yes essentially

** A time-turner can only do 5-6 hours leaps safely because either of the instability of the Time-Reversal Charm or because magical time-space continuum shenanigans, but nothing would physically/magically stop you from going back another 6 hours into the past. The only reason you 'can't' is because of how dangerous messing with time is and the further back you go the most likely you are to fuck some shit up. Now, twelve hours could still be short enough to not trigger the butterfly effect, but a week? You're asking for some paradox to kill you or someone else.

** Thought on this before. Honestly, I think it depends on if you do them all at once or one at a time.

Using one at a time would likely make it linear. 6 hours each, with very few side effects. Using more than one simultaneously, though, thats where thing s get tricky.

One possibility is that the same would happen: linear progression backwards. However, considering Temporal Magics, the Unwritten Rules of Time, and the Law of Resonance it's entirely possible, and highly likely, that each extra one would have an Exponential boost to the duration. Two would make 36 hours, three would make 216 hours, four would be 1,296 hours, etc. and that's before you get into how you'd spin that many at once, which could decrease the time by half, or multiply the time traveled by up to 1,000.

So yeah, funny way to meet the Founders, but honestly? Not worth it.

** I think there never was "a limit" to going back in time but more of a limit on the time turners themselves. I didn't read Cursed Child, but apparently there was a "new" time turner that could go back years.

So the question is not if you can do it but more like what would happen if you do it, using multiple time turners would mean having 3 of you sometimes in the same timeline : The original you in the past, The you who went back in time the first time before you used a 2nd time turner, the you who went back in time after using a 2nd time turner. Something is bound to go wrong at some point. But then time travel in the HP series is complexe because it suggests time is a loop and your future already happened so if something went wrong you would have known it?

*** Cursed Child violates PoA's time travel rules. In Cursed Child, every use of the time turner creates a new timelime where any changes made are played out. In PoA, changes /can't/ be made. Everything that can happen, will happen, and already has happened.

So... yeah. Either you can go back infinitely, but there will always be at least one timeline where anything you do doesn't happen, or you /might/ be able to go back a long time, but can't change anything whatsoever.
