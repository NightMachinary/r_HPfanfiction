Preferably new(er), a decent length, well written, and Harry paired with a DC girl. I'd especially like if it's not one of the usually recommended crossover fics. Thanks for reading!


** Well, one of the best DC fics I know of is The Prince of Clowns, it's kind of Dark and has a lot of The Joker. I haven't finished it yet but it's tagged slash so....

  Joker never understood why his brother took destiny and prophesy so serious (or anything for that matter. He really needed to smile more). The future wasn't set in stone after all. Besides, wasn't it much more fun to corrupt the child, shape him to their image of insanity and chaos, instead of killing him? He certainly thought so. Insane!Harry, Dark!Harry, Adult content/Slash later

**** TBH I'm not that big a fan either, I usually skip those parts. I haven't actually reached any slash parts yet though so I can't really say about this one

** I'm fairly sure there is a crossover with Harry as "Mister Black" from RB's Make a Wish story. Harry goes over to the DC universe, interacts with the justice league etc. Decent number of words, decent number of chapters. Pairing is currently Harry and Supergirl.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.
