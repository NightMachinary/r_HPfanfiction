In a lot of fics, we see people going to extreme lengths to get rid of Ron or Hermione. This is where the whole Weasleys-Are-Being-Paid-By-Dumbledore thing comes in, or Hermione Raises Her Hand In Class, and Turned In Your Firebolt so she must think that everyone is dumber than her, or is evil.

My question is, is there a way to naturally end/back off their friendship? I haven't really seen anything like that in fics ever, and I was wondering what everybody's opinion on this would be, since you don't always become best friends for life with people you've met when you're eleven. People grow apart, and change and I'd like to know how to portray that.

Another thing: at which point in the canon timeline is it practically impossible to do so, because they've gone through so much together that only extreme circumstances could break them apart?


** Honestly, I've seen a couple of post-Hogwarts stories where the Trio separating is done really well. Growing up a little outside of school and getting placed in situations where they don't have each other to rely on right away makes the idea of them either drifting apart or becoming so different that they have a disagreement that breaks the friendship more realistic.

At Hogwarts, I can honestly see them separating at any point before the end of book 4, either because of a fight or because of just finding new friends. After book 4, tho, they're dealing with something that sort of requires them to at least try to be on the same page and they all know that facing whatever's coming will be worse without the only people they can talk with and trust implicitly.

*** The only one I read where they separated naturally after school was a crossover fic with Doctor Who. Due to his childhood encounters with the Doctor, Harry basically grows up to become an alien hunter, Ron wants to settle down and Hermione goes off to Muggle University.

** For Hermione, I think it wouldn't be out of place for their friendship to end in 3rd year. Ron is angry over Scabbers, then Harry over the Firebolt... she was very stressed trying to manage all her classes and save Buckbeak. She was isolated from her friends, and I think she really needed some support during that time. I can imagine if she was pushed just a bit further she might not forgive the boys.

For Ron, 4th year. Either he doesn't get over his jealousy and pride, or Harry doesn't forgive him. Especially if this happened in an AU where Harry lost his friendship with Hermione in 3rd year as described above. Harry would have been left alone and I think that would have made it harder to forgive Ron for leaving him.

As for the point of no going back in their friendship, I'd say end of 5th year. Running Dumbledore's Army together, and then the ministry fiasco would be enough to make the kind of bond that doesn't break so easily, especially on top of everything else they faced.

*** I agree, these are good points in the books where a natural separation could have occurred. But I do also think it would be possible post DH, they might have been through a lot together but people handle trauma differently and have different needs when working through it.

Off the top of my head, a couple of basic scenarios:

Harry ends up more isolated once Ron & Hermione get together, so he finds other support people. Perhaps for Harry it's easy to talk to someone more removed from all the bad things he experienced. Maybe Ron & Hermione try to force Harry to confide in them again, and it pushes Harry further away. Then later on, Ron & Hermione break up, they still care about each other and have plenty of passion, but realise they aren't good for each other & now there is no Harry focal point to keep them together.

or

Hermione is completing her last year at Hogwarts while the boys head down the Auror path. Hermione is forced to make new friends and starts to really discover herself outside of her identity within the Golden Trio; she decides she doesn't want to go back to how things were. Meanwhile Harry starts to realise he doesnt really want to be an Auror, he's sacrificed enough for the wizarding world, instead he decides to travel and have some normal experiences while he figures things out. Ron is happy to stay, he doesn't want to be far away from his family. Distance and time takes care of the rest, they're still friendly but they just aren't part of each others lives anymore.

I guess the quick takeaway is - They don't need to break apart, friendships often drift apart once you leave school & are no longer together all the time.

**** I could see them drifting apart after the war, due to differences handling trauma. War and trauma are certainly big enough to break up even the closest of friendships.I just thought OP was talking about during the course of the books.

Though Ron/Hermione drifting apart from Harry when they get together doesn't seem realistic considering Harry dates Ron's sister. I imagine that would keep them close. OBHWF. If Harry didn't date Ginny, perhaps.

I don't see them drifting apart because Hermione goes back to school and Harry decides not to be an auror. I don't think distance is enough to change their friendship at this point. Look, I can go years without seeing my bestie in person, and months without properly talking. I've made new friends, so has she. We have very different lives. We've been friends since we were 14 and 16, and it's been over 10 years. But our friendship has never faltered due to distance. If we need each other we're there. Distance doesn't matter when we're close enough. I think the trio are close enough at that point that distance and time won't break their friendship.

Perhaps if one of them changed schools during the course of their school years, I could see them drifting apart, but not after the war.

***** I had to laugh at myself then, cause I totally forgot about Ginny! And I even like book Ginny.

I do actually agree with you, I think the most likely scenario is that it wouldn't matter how much distance there was or what other relationships they build, they'll always have a special connection & remain best friends.

But I do also think the right author could use something like that as a starting point to create a story that makes it feel believable for them to drift apart after the war. It'd need to be a very well done, slow burn, kind of change but I think it would be possible.

*** What would Hermione have to forgive Harry for? Getting mad she went behind his back and almost lost him the equivalent of a Ferrari? I completely understand her being stressed out over all the pressure, but I don't think she would be right at being mad at Harry for being mad at her. It could still end the Trio though.

The fourth Year seems more likely for Ron though, depending on how stressed Harry is and if Hermione is keeping her distance too, it might turn ugly.

This could also happen not through fights, but if they made other friendships that became stronger, say, Ron with Dean and Seamus, Harry with well, perhaps some people outside Gryffindor, and Hermione with either her books or other girls. Then maybe they don't see each other that much and naturally, their friendship degrades.

I personally think that's the most realistic way, since often that's how this happens in real life.

Point of no return? Ministry Battle.

**** Hermione was concerned that Harry recieved an anonymous gift when, as far as they knew, someone wanted to kill Harry. The gift, if tampered with, could kill him. Hermione goes to the teachers out of concern for Harry's life. They obviously thought it was a legit possibility, as they confiscated it, saying they'd return it if it was safe. It's like Harry got a Ferrari when someone was trying to kill him, Hermione asked the teachers to check it for a bomb, and Harry got mad at her for that. Then proceeded to ignore Hermione for ages. Yeah, I'd be mad if I tried to look out for my friend and he abandoned me for it. Like I understand Harry's response. It's realistic for a teenager. But that doesn't mean his response wasn't wrong, and Hermione has no reason to be upset.

I think for Hermione, who has trouble making friends, losing touch with Harry and Ron because she made other friends isn't super realistic. It would be more realistic for Harry and Ron to make other friends and slowly distance themselves from Hermione.

Also, I think that after first year, they have been through enough together that they won't just fall out of touch because they make new friends. They have already been through a lot together, and formed strong bonds. It's not the same as when we were 12 years old and drifted from friends who you basically just talked to and played with. Most friendships at that age are fairly shallow, so yeah, drifting apart is easy. The trio don't have a shallow friendship. So yeah, I think they would need to fight for their friendship to end.

His response absolutely wasn't wrong though and you're massively underplaying what Hermione did. She didn't tell Harry she was going to a teacher or properly try and talk to him about it, she made one passive aggressive statement then went behind his back.

****** Look if he was mad for a couple of days, then came around, sure, I'd say he did nothing wrong. But he ignored her for ages over it.

She was a child who's friend was possibly in danger, so she immediately went to get help from an adult. That's not wrong. She didn't need to talk to him about it. If a child is in danger, and their friend, who is also a child realizes, the first thing the friend should do is get help from an adult. Children should not be expected to handle this sort of thing on their own. If it wasn't life threatening, maybe Hermione should have spoken to him first, but it was, so getting help right away was the correct course of action.

I like to think Hermione knew Harry well enough to know he wouldn't listen. Because I really think he wouldn't have, and the conversation would have started a fight and put Harry on the defensive. It's very possible that if he knew Hermione was going to ask a teacher to check the broom, he would have done something stupid to keep the broom, or try to prove it wasn't dangerous. Because he was a kid and kids do that sort of thing. And if the broom was dangerous, it could have killed him. Or he could get a false sense of safety because it was cursed to only hurt him if he went so fast, or if he was playing a quidditch game, or something.

Hermione did nothing wrong.

I'm not saying Hermione was so mature she knew his reaction. I'm saying she knew Harry well enough to know he wouldn't take it seriously. Two different things. And i mean, was she wrong??? He was more concerned about quidditch than his life. That's not out of character for a kid, but like. It proves her point. Then I gave examples of how, by talking to him and giving him warning that she would be talking to an adult about the broom, it could go wrong, to demonstrate why it was a good idea to go to an adult.

******* Hermione is 14 yrs old here. Since you have her with such mature reasoning, she should be more than capable of speaking to her 13 yr old friend. Nevermind she thought it was best to brew Polyjuice Potion the year before instead of going to an adult over her concerns about Draco, but this also fits her characterization so I guess.

However, your reasoning does go against Harry's characterization who generally speaks with an adult about his concerns /before/ moving and can be convinced to do so even when he's in a frenzy.

Writing to Quidditch Quality Supply and asking who they sent the broom to would have been a quick fix, too.

Harry was able to keep a clear head on stressing/combat situations, Hermione wasn't.

She also never spoke to him seriously or anything she just went completely behind his back while knowing he had no faith in most authority figures by that time. Oh, and she never even apologized for being wrong.

By Fourth Year she also chooses to leave Harry by himself for a time despite the most obvious thing in the world is that he didn't want to be in the Tournament.

Harry takes this badly and increasingly sees the prophecy as applying to him and him alone, causing separation on both ends, especially when the end of fourth year had Cedric die, fifth had Sirius die, Harry wants to stop other people getting wound up in him vs Voldemort. Ron and Hermione stay together and perhaps even start their relationship sooner but the trio is split.

The same mistake could be made with Hermione by Harry asking if he should have been giving a heads up before she ran to the teachers over the firebolt.

The question is who would their friends be if they broke up? Ron is usually portrayed being friends with Sheamus and Dean. Who is Harry going to be friends with? Maybe the Quidditch team minus the twins (if things go really south with Ron) Harry doesn't seem to have friends outside of Gryffindor until the DA. Maybe he gets close with the Hufflepuffs after warning Cedric? Hermione seems the harder to pin down. Without Harry there is there a chance that Ron and Hermione patch things up?

** The most natural separation-points would be third year for Hermione, and then fourth year for Ron.

In her third year, Hermione's stretched to the point of breaking - she's bitten off far more than she can chew for her class workload, and then the argument over whether Crookshanks ate Scabbers, as well as what to do about Harry's Firebolt. It doesn't take much to escalate that to the point where the friendship doesn't recover.

In fourth year, Ron briefly splits away from the Trio because of his jealous streak - again, it doesn't take too much to escalate that rift to the point where their friendship never recovers, /especially/ without a third friend there to mediate as per the scenario where Hermione breaks off from third year.\\
Fourth year also provides one more opportunity for Hermione to break off, between her being forced to mediate between Harry and Ron and her SPEW efforts not being taken well by anyone.

As far as "when are they inseparable" goes, I'd say the summer between fourth and fifth year is the end point for a split on bad terms. At that point, they've all pretty much seen the best and the worst of each other, and gotten past it. The seriousness of Voldemort's recent return further puts them all in a mindset of "we /need/ to stick together as friends" - barring some magical help (say, from a Horcrux-locket), I don't see them Breaking The Fellowship at that point anymore.\\
Post-war, I can see them slowly drifting apart, but not on bad terms - just in a "life happened" sort of way where if they met again they'd still hit it off.

One important reason they stay such good friends is because they all remain somewhat outsiders - Ron doesn't want to share his siblings' friends, Harry is generally socially stunted, and Hermione is both haughty and too focused on classwork to prioritize her social life.

Also, Gryffindor pairing with Ravenclaw in some classes may have opened up a lot more potential friends. Association with Hermione and Ron damned canon Harry (and them) from befriending Slytherins, and the Hufflepuffs in their year were cliquey.

** I think an early romance within the trio with a nasty break up at the end could break them apart. So let's say Harry and Hermione get together in third year, a combination of feeling like a third wheel and jealousy causes Ron to not hang out with them any more. Then in the fourth year Harry and Hermione have a nasty break up where they can't stand to look at each other. Voila no more trio.

A non-dramatic way is if the trio pick different subjects and are too busy with homework or club activities to hang out outside of classes. While it's easy to imagine Harry and Ron not being in any classes together, but they'd still be share dorms together and be in a classes together with Hermione. Pulling this off would be a lot easier if there was a plot convenient resorting and they end up in different houses.

As for post-Hogwarts it's easy to imagine they'd drift apart if Harry and Hermione weren't so closely tied to the Weasleys, they all have different careers after all.

** I think it also depends on the reason. Why would the golden trio separate? Most of the time, authors tend to force the issue because they dislike a character and that leaves a bad taste to the reader.

There are multiple ways to do so and multiple ways to invent situations that would lead to their separation. And the viewer will accept it as long as it doesn't blindside them (and if you have written it correctly, it shouldn't) and your reasoning is "hur dur, Hermione/Ron just sucks ass".

Fact is, they didn't separate in canon, why would they now? What changed that lead them to their separation?

** In AUs where Harry is more studious than in canon, it's pretty easy to calmly distance him from Ron, since he's not shown as interested in studying, no need to add eeeeevil into it... for closer canon behavior, I'm with the people saying 3rd year for Hermione, 4th for Ron.

** Pretty easily tbh. Most childhood friendships IRL don't hold up through teenage years because people change and want to focus and what they like. I can easily see a situation where by fifth year, even without conflict, Harry starts focusing on training for the war, which in turn causes Hermione to drift off towards some ravenclaws and Ron to drift off towards quidditch. Like they're still friends to some extent, but they just no longer spend all their time together because they just don't have that much in common.

** 2 obvious ways:

- Postwar. No longer forced together by circumstances, they may drift apart to do their own things. They'll probably never be completely estranged from each other, but their close friendship may drift apart.
- (Ron only) GoF debacle. Harry was abused and doesn't trust easily. The Ron debacle could be taken as a loss of trust, something Ron isn't able to recover simply by apologizing. To be clear, I'm not talking about Ron bashing, but simply Harry not accepting Ron's apology at face value, and it's possible to write a future from this point where they may regain cordiality, but not the close friendship they had. This is IMO not implausible.

** All it would take is sorting Harry into Hufflepuff. Neither of them would have anything to do with him. And lets's face it: Harry repeatedly taking Ron back as a friend indicates his intense loyalty, and he's certainly no stranger to hard work.

As for when it would be too late for them to break up in canon? Never. When Ron takes off during the Horcrux hunt, that's yet another potential breaking point (and his most egregious betrayal, IMO). When Hermione cries herself to sleep night after night because she misses the useless lump, Harry could easily tell her, "If you miss him so much, just go." Even in the epilogue, Ron confesses to several crimes that Harry, as Head Auror, should charge him with. So it's never too late to break them up.

** I'd say that it is possible to do so (I'm actually working on having that happen in one of my fics), but it can't be something that's done quickly. It needs to be a slow drift apart, like how most real friendships end. Then, when they're next spending time with each other, they realise how far they've drifted apart and that there's not a lot they have in common anymore

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** I think Scienra Cwena had a good approach to it. Basically, while Harry and Ron were fighting over the Goblet thing (pretty much as they were in canon), Harry and Hermione befriend Fleur instead. Ron still apologises, but the two have gotten close enough to Fleur that there's a bit of insulating distance between Ron. Not hatred or dislike or anything, just distance. The Trio was forced together by circumstances until they started to like each other, basically, so taking advantage of a distant period (For Hermione, likely the Broom or a similar original plotline) to slot someone else into the spot and build the relationship between Harry and whoever it is could probably be the best non-conflicting way, I'd say.

** I'd say 5th year when Hermione/Ron were doing that flirty fight thing. All it would take is one ultimatium to choose between his friends to imagine a split while staying mostly within canon.

If you want to deviate from cannon more, I'd say it is still easily doable although you have to contrive a situation. Common ones I can think of would be Ron/Harry doing a rivalship over courting the same girl or maybe one of the trio transferring to another school.

For as close as they stay, you don't get the impression that it is something they are going to fight tooth and nail to maintain over a long distance. Hell, have Harry or Ron moved to a different sleeping arrangements would put a pretty strong hamper on Ron/Harry

** I've read some really good ending to their friendship and some really bad ones. One good one was Harry spending time with Draco (obviously a drarry fic, ha!) for a class project or something and Ron was super pissed and jealous, which made Harry mad cuz he didn't ask for Malfoy as a partner. Well Ron started ditching Harry for Seamus and Dean, and Draco got sucked into Harry drama, cuz obviously nobody else was around to help him. At the middle of the book Harry and Ron cane back together and Ron apologized and Harry accepted but kinda pressed Ron like, “you really have more in common with the others, right? And you can talk about girls and your not jealous because they're not rich and famous.” And it ended their friendship but in a healthy way - Draco was a better friend because he was rich and the Malfoy's have fame (“any press is good press” as the saying goes). I'm not sure where Hermione was throughout this book... can't recall the title right now either. It was a really good one though.
