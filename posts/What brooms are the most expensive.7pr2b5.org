I have Aidan Lynch own a Cleansweep while he's going to Hogwarts. Are the Cleansweeps the least expensive?


** The Firebolt is supposed to be really expensive.

** I think the canon hierarchy was something like:

- Firebolt at the top

- Nimbus 2001

- Nimbus 2000/Cleansweep 7

- Cleansweep 5

- Comet 260 or 360, I forget

- Nimbus 1000

- Older Cleansweeps

- Older Comets

- Antique brooms (although some like the Oakshaft '79 are built to be very reliable)

*** Some antique brooms could be priced higher if they are rare and popular enough.

**** Collectibles probably don't count when discussing “modern,” competitive brooms.

**** Silly me, I got sidetracked thinking about how good the brooms were rather than price~ I think it's still more or less correct apart from the obvious oversight, though.

*** Don't forget the old shooting star. I think JK discusses brooms at length in her book "Quidditch Through The Ages," which is worth a read.
