Looking for fanfiction where harry potter goes back in time in his body, to his school years, where he tries to fix things.


** Do you mean older Harry arrives in younger Harry's body intentionally? The prompt was not clear enough. I will give a few recommendations where Harry time travels intentionally or not.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world.

Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

****** Alright here you go. Note that some of the fics I link I have not read. But they are really popular so I am linking them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance]] "In which Hermione attempts a time-travelling ritual without due preparation and Harry happily goes along for the ride, and both have to cope with living their best friend's life."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4662080/1/The-Future-lies-in-the-past]] " After Voldemort kills Ginny and Harry's baby she was carrying Harry decides his future lies a few months in the past, Read as Harry's life is totally changed and he eventually gets together with Hermione."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191296/1/Number-48-Rebirth]] " Harry has died, again. This is his last shot, his last chance before he gets written off forever. This is his 48th life. But he is not alone, the game plan has changed and he's got a plan to fix everything. Hopefully while avoiding dying again. Death at his shoulder. Warnings language and possible mature situations later. Hiatus Pending Rewrite "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11782884/1/Not-even-a-first-chance]] " Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11877475/1/Put-into-Lifetime-Detention-by-Death]] " Reptilia28 Challenge. Harry learns the fallacy of forgiveness at a Maternal!Reaper's knee. He realises that maximum control is the only way to destroy the Voldemort ideology. ALL Death Eaters(inc Snape) are bad. Max Revenge, Min romance, CRACK/heavy tropey/OTT elements, so distrusted but not bashed Weasleys and Dumbledore. (Add pinches of salt to taste!) "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594791/1/Backwards-Compatible]] " The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before. "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past]] " Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel "

******* Here are a few more. Again I have not read a lot of them so I can't tell how good or cringy they would be. They are certainly popular.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/Knowledge-is-Power]] " When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different. "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap]] " Harry Potter won the Second Blood War and defeated his enemies... and was left with nothing. Decades later, he contributes to the creation of a revolutionary new piece of technology and destroys the future in order to rewrite his own past... "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11033616/1/You-re-my-Density]] " Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke. "

What happens when he meets the Grim Reaper? Especially when the Reaper isn't happy with him. Rating changed to more appropriate one. HHr. Other pairings as they come. "

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]] " At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13242443/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Pale-Horseman]] " There is not much Death cares about, but the Natural Order is perhaps the most important thing to him. Tom Riddle violates the Natural Order of Life and Death. But Death is cunning, and so he gives Harry three choices: Stay dead, go on or go back. What else could Harry choose but to go back when there's people to save? Got tired of being bashy, changing that. Still HHr, though. "

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** *He's Not Dead Yet* linkffn(9963013)

Crack'd Comedic Parody of the Reptilla28 challenge. Lots of Monty Python references and skits.

It's more enjoyable if you don't take it seriously. I find the harem aspect of it is one big poke at the Lord Harry Potter-Slytherin-Peverel-Gaunt-Gryffindor-Black-Trump-Nixon-Malfoy-Dumbledore harem fics.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.
