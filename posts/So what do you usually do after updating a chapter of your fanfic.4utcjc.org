*** How does this happen every time? I check the live preview and suddenly there's 20 errors I can see in the first 1000 words. It boggles my mind.

**** Yeah, it could be a formatting issue. There are fonts I read differently; it's not a disorder, but anyway. I have taken to playing with the background color when editing and reading in a different font, but I still find things.

** having a massive eye-twitch when I see that I got another review but fanfiction.net still doesn't show it to me on their page.

I'm so glad they have email notifications, otherwise I would die of OCD overload.

** I hear voices in my head.

*Uploading to DLP's Work By Author Section*: /Bruh you know this shit ain't ready. Matter of fact: you ain't shit, you ain't never been shit and you ain't never gon' be shit!/

Me: Hmm. I think I'll jet to the loo.

...

/And your formatting is atrocious, my nigga./

*Uploading to Fanfiction,net:* /Check the Story Stats again, Seatbelts! Check it check it check it cheeeeeeeck iiiiiiit--/

Me: I did. Five minutes ago.

/What about reviews? Did you check your e-mails? Didja?/

Me: Yep. Nada.

/Why doesn't anyone like you, Seatbelts?/

Me: You have to love yourself first, you know?

/Huh. Fap time?/

Me: ...I think this is my cue to leave the keyboard.

Then I'll "eat a sandwich", watch a DJ Akademiks video and pass out.

** Having never posted Fanfiction, I will instead replace the term with "scene from one of your scripts"

I smile, take a shot of alcoholic beverage, and say "you did well..." then get back to work.
