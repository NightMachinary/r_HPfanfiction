Would like to know Fics that contain Ginny being fine with Harry marrying another Woman, so they are both married to him. It doesnt necessary end up with Ginny and the 2nd Wife.

Or Harry and Ginny are married, but he gets attracted to another Women too. Ginny acknowledges this and maybe encourage him to marry her too, but he refuse since she is the one that he wants as his Wife. Also in this, Ginny and Harry would be married, but she wouldnt mind him being attracted to another Women (maybe even said one being attractive enough that she understands, why her Husband is attracted).

No Harem, just these 3.

I would have imagined Harry with Ginny as Main and Harry/Narcissa as a side pair. AU are fine and i would like if the other Women is older, but no Requirement.


** I remember one where the pair was Harry/Ginny/Astoria but it was only in the backstory and only came up to tell Lily (the kid) why she couldn't date Scorpius.

** Harry/Hermione/Ginny, or why Ron stopped talking to Harry for a while. No recommendations as this pairing seems to be like anti-matter. Hard to prove it even exists.
