Slughorn is actually really clever and has loads of high up connections, I would love to see this utilised in a fic, instead of just bashing him for one misjudgment he made, Riddle trucked all teachers except Dumbledore so he is not solely to blame. He is an interesting character I would like to see developed. Preferably a Harry-centric fic

And let's not forget that Dumbledore received the Privet Drive treatment (the orphanage director talking all kinds of shit about Tom like the Dursleys badmouthed Harry with the neighbours) before even meeting Tom, and the first meeting being with a Tom expecting a hostile guest.

IMO it's highly unlikely Dumbledore would have caught onto him if he had first met Tom at Hogwarts.
