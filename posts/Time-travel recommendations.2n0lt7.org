I've recently started getting into time-travel fics and was hoping you guys could help me with some recommendations. I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]], and would like stories with a similar premise (Harry getting a re-do at his time in school). I'd prefer more serious fics than that, but I definitely don't have any problems with humor. The only other fic like this that I have read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764665/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Children-of-Change][Harry Potter and the Children of Change]] which I'm starting to think is abandoned. Thanks in advance.


** (Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon)[[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]]]

Basically Hermione builds a device that will return her and Harry to the CoS if the die or trigger it willingly at the end of third year. It's very good and although incomplete has several full run throughs of Harry's adventures and is kept fresh by them messing with the time line so things are never quite the same (e.g. accidentally inspiring the Triwizard Tournament to be harder and removing Dragons one year by causing an international incident trying to off a Horcrux)

**** It was originally explained (or later was, I don't remember) as a sort of extended drabbles through the time reset mechanism. I don't think it ever had an end planned, but that writer doesn't appear to be active anymore.

*** Matt Silver wrote far too few stories. Dementor's Stigma is one of my favorite near-complete AU and I'm pretty sure it's the only post-Hogwarts in my top 10-20 stories.

I'm very disappointed that Tw15ted, Kitten, and JB abandoned hpfanfic. They all had different writing styles, but I enjoyed most of what each of them had written. Similarly, while S'TarKan insists he's still writing, he hasn't updated in forever, so NoFP might as well be abandoned. DeadWoodpecker only recently updated the third part of BWP, but he's not been consistent at all.

I don't think I've read anything by the last two. Guess I better get on that.

** One of my favorite time travel stories. I will say that it is a little dark and definitely out there. It doesn't take place at Hogwarts and by the time we meet Harry he has mastered some crazy esoteric magic. This is truly epic in scope. This story is actually completed and the sequel is out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and The Wastelands of Time]]. Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all

*** I've actually read this one and loved it. I haven't read all the way through what there is in the sequel (I think I got through chapter 4 or so before getting distracted by something else that I saw on this sub), but I'm following on ff.net and saw that it was updated.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] is probably my favorite. IIRC summary: Harry has essentially lost the war, uses some desperate magic, and then has 24 hours in the past with which to defeat Voldemort and all his Horcruxes.

Note: I've read almost every recommendation here, so when I say it's my favorite that means a lot! Its only downside is its heavy focus on action scenes, but that's also its main strength. If you don't like action you might hate it, but otherwise it'll probably become one of your favorites too.
