It can be Canon, so a OFC is introduced, who is described similar or the same as Bellatrix (from the appearances), but is not an Evil Person. Or an AU Fic that have Bella never turn evil, but instead having a seductive Persona. But also in the AU it doesnt have to be Bellatrix, but like in the first mentioned sentence, can be a similar described Character.

â€‹

Its not important on what point of time if happens. Lets say for an example it happens epilogue age, then she might occassionally seduce the main male characters. I would leave it to the Fic, if she succeeds (or rather, if he falls for her, since the sducing part is her most fun and the "infidelity a Bonus) or not.

There is a time travel au that kind of fits? The Black family realizes Voldemort isn't the way to go before the first war, and Bella is still kind of crazy, but crazy with a major crush on Harry.

Edit: Since I'm terrible at everything.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
