Taking shots at the continuity of Harry Potter seems so 2007, but can we talk about the Cedric death scene in GoF? Voldemort orders Pettigrew to "Kill the Spare."

So Pettigrew kills Cedric. Right?

Then why does Cedric come out of Voldemort's wand later? Did Pettigrew use Voldemort's wand?

I've never seen this explained in fanfiction. Anyone know what this is about?

Also, sorry if this has been talked about before.

EDIT: As [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] says below, Pettigrew lost his wand somewhere between 81 and 94, forcing him to use Voldemort's wand. Pettigrew had a new wand made by Ollivander in 96 after the wandmaker was kidnapped by old Voldie. That makes a lot of sense, and it is in the book, which I apparently missed.


** I think you are correct and that Wormtail used Voldemort's wand. I don't believe he had a wand on him as Scabbers and there is no mention of him stealing a wand in his search for Voldemort after PoA, so the simplest and most likely explanation is that he just used Voldemort's, which covers Cedric's shade.

*** Which is weird when you realize he overpowered Bertha Jorkins a year beforehand.

I find it hard to believe she was so dumb that she was wandering around in Albania without a wand during the Yugoslavian conflicts and breakup of the Balkans.

**** Well, it was Pettigrew who brought Voldemort back his wand, having originally gotten it from the rubble of the Potter Cottage in 1981. Presumably that's the wand he'd been using all along, sharing it with Baby-Voldemort. Bertha Jorkins surely had a wand, but not every wand takes kindly to being used by just anybody; Dragon Heartstring wands (and the Elder Wand) are the only ones who give themselves up so easily to whoever overpowered their original owner.

So my belief would be that on balance, Voldemort's wand was still much better suited to Peter than Jorkins's, and so he stuck with what he had.

****** My point was that it might not matter in that situation if Bertha had a wand or not. If he took her completely by surprise.

Although in this case it does seem he had Voldemort's wand the entire time.

Edit: Wait, sorry. Now I get it. I guess if he had Voldemort's wand he had no reason to take it.

**** In fact, she had to have one, since Voldemort was able to break her and then kill her.

Maybe Voldemort ordered that such a lowly coward does not deserve a wizards tool. Sounds like the sort of BS he would spout.

**** Thats the thing, it wasnt a mistake.

1: Pettigrew picked up Voldemorts wand from the Potter house prior to Hagrid/Sirius arriving. Its why it was never found with his "black robes/cloak" next to the crib. This makes sense since Pettigrew betrays the Potters, and turns up with Voldemorts wand in the 4th book.

2: Pettigrew then is challenged by Sirius in the street, and he promptly cuts off a finger, blasts the street apart, and escapes as Scabbers. His wand must OBVIOUSLY be found with the bit of finger, or they wouldn't assume him dead.

3: Pettigrew kept Voldemorts wand safe until he found Voldemort in Albania as a shade. However, Voldemort doesn't regain a body until the cauldron in 4th year AFTER Cedric's death. Pettigrew is actively using Voldemorts wand in the Graveyard and is ordered to kill the spare. After resurrecting Voldemort takes possession of his wand again.

At the end of the day, even if certain things are not directly stated in canon, logic tells you if it was not canon, then other bits of canon would not make sense. The story fits.

Edit: Compiling separate posts in the chain because it makes sense to.

** u/Achille-Talon:
#+begin_quote
  Did Pettigrew use Voldemort's wand?
#+end_quote

Yes, he did. Peter picked up Voldemort's wand in the wreckage of the Potter Cottage in 1981, and seems to have lost his wand in his battle with Sirius. He then hid the wand somewhere and remained wandless during his years as Scabbers. When he escaped the Shrieking Shack in 1993, his first resort was to get back said wand, which was the easiest one he could have access to, and he used that wand up until Voldemort was fully recovered and asked for it back ("My wand, Wormtail").

Between 1994 and 1996, Peter must have used some stolen wand that didn't suit him, if he didn't get by on wandless magic altogether (I wouldn't be surprised if the Silver Hand boosted his abilities in that regard). Finally, in 1996, the kidnapped Ollivander crafted a new wand for him, which is the one he uses until /Deathly Hallows/, where Ron takes it from him.

*** But he doesn't lose it in the battle with Sirius. He still has it in DH according to the HP wiki (and I'm pretty sure it's right). If he had his own wand, why didn't he use it in GoF? Which according to JKR from a link above, he didn't use his own wand. I guess it's just one of those anomalies I'll have to live with.
