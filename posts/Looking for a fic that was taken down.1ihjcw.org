Does anyone have a saved copy of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/528665/frolicfeather][frolicfeather's]] Harry Potter and the Fight for the Malfoy Empire? Went back to read it this summer and saw that it was taken down, not really sure why. Would love to be able to read it again. Thanks!


** Did you try sending the author a PM? Maybe she'd be willing to share her story with you, particularly if you said you liked it.

*** Yeah, I did, but I'm not holding out on too much hope that the author even uses FF.net anymore; the account activity's been dead for two years :(

**** Authors get notified of PMs via email. Who knows, maybe she'll respond.

** I don't have it but I've learned to save favorite fics. I use Flagfic.com when I find a story I liked in FFN and archiveofourown has a button to down load in any format.
