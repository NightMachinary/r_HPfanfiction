** Cheering Charms wear off after a few hours.

The protection charms around the DH camp sites lasted at least several days.

Flying Charms on brooms last years if not decades.

Gubraithian Fire lasts forever.

The limitation on spell duration appears to be spell-specific, not a limitation on magic generally.

**** Well, an anomaly as regards fire. In other areas, spells seem to be expected to last indefinitely. The spells holding the Burrow up, for example. And the Permanent Sticking Charm on Mrs Black's portrait.

** Personally, I just think turning Wizards into batteries is a particularly dull way of limiting magic. There are literally hundreds of other things - from 'Lady Magic doth decree it to be so!' to simple skill at what is quite possibly akin to doing theoretical physics equations in your head while trying to lasso a tornado, or even that magic has to be limited in order to hide from bigger scarier things. There's a reason 'mana' is usually just a game mechanic rather than an active narrative element and that Vancian magic (where you learn a spell then forget it, D&D style) is so popular a limitation.

My best guess at a reason for spells being limited it that it's because spells are active things. You cast a spell and you're 'doing' it (be it the process of channelling magic or some quantum-mechanics-esque direction-of-attention thing). If your involvement stops, then the spell stops.

** Honestly it's very based on some of the modern witchcraft movements which holds that the magical ability is inside of the witch but that you need to work it like a muscle. The more you practice and study, the more magic you can do before becoming exhausted or having spell backfire.

So, it's mostly pulled from modern ideas of how witchcraft worked based on Buckland and Gardner and a bit of Crowley.

*** It's also quite a prevalent idea in modern media. That whole 'My Power Level is over 9000!' or 'My Mana is low!' type thing is a relatively common example of magical-system limitation.

** I think Magical Cores started out as purely a way to show power-level differences, to attach a meaningless "mine is bigger than yours" comparison to the idea of magic. There's quite a lot of fics where Harry's said to have a massive magical core, and then it goes completely unmentioned (and un-shown) what having a big magical core actually /does/.

The few times it's actually shown, it functions purely as a "limit" to magic - suddenly, Ron's exhausted from lifting the troll's club because his magical core's run out of juice (as opposed to the fact he just spent a lot of time dodging bathroom sinks, troll weaponry, and bits of toilet). Someone's in awe of Harry's ability to cast a Patronus Charm not because it shows his knowledge or skill, but because he shouldn't be able to manage it with a teenage magical core.

I actually kind of dislike it as a trope - it feels like an arbitrary limitation to weaken anyone-but-the-protagonist.

** Setting magical cores aside, canon spells seem to fall into a number of categories: permanent, permanent unless cancelled, lasting, focused, and immediate.

Permanent spells are like the permanent sticking charm. You cast it, it does it's thing, and it doesn't stop doing it's thing.

Permanent unless cancelled are spells that will last forever, doing their thing, as long as no one comes along and cancels them.

Lasting spells are ones where the spell takes effect and lasts for a duration unless cancelled. The duration of the spell most likely correlated to how well the spell was cast. Over time the spell fades and eventually stops working. Spells like disillusionment.

Focused spells are like the levitation charm or the patronus. You cast the spell, and it is there doing its thing for as long as you are focusing on it and maintaining it.

Instant spells are spells that perform and action and then stop. Like the stunning spell.

** The way I generally have it work in my fics is pretty varied. The biggest thing to note is that none of the various attributes of "cores", a fancy term for the ability of the soul to process magic, are static. You get better at magic by doing magic, and your ability to cast magic doesn't atrophy.

So there are three major traits that I use to define cores

1. Capacity. How much magic can you store? The naturally increases as you grow older, and is increased further by casting magic. Some people start with a slight boost in this front over others, but experience is far more important.

If one completely runs out of magic, then they can begin pulling magic from the environment instead. Doing so tends to put some minor strain on the soul, but it heals naturally with time.

1. Replenishing. How quickly the soul can "refill" it's store of magic. Like the above one, it's improved through experience, and while some people bstart with an advantage, it's usually insignificant my adulthood.

2. Affinities. This is the most varied and most versatile category. Some spells come more easily to some people than others. Affinities allow one to cast spells that would otherwise be beyond one's ability. For example, in one of my fics, a character with an ice affinity was able to cast a fifth year ice charm as a first year.

Some people might have elemental affinities (fire, ice, light), some might have affinities for fields of magic (transfiguration, charms), other could have affinities based on the use of a spell (protection, housework), and affinities can even be as benign as having affinities for spells that begin with certain letters or have spellbolts in certain colours. Affinities can also be trained, but they tend to be more indicative of a one's personality, desires, and values. Undergoing major life events that cause one to re-evaluate such things can help them gain new affinities, although affinities can not be lost

** There has to be some difference in magic, we see it in the books. Combining with intelligence/practice magical cores work well enough. Just like our muscles magic eventually running out of energy makes intuitive sense to people. And like anything else there are awesome and terrible examples. Anyone know of any works handling this really well, I can't think of one at the moment.

** I've always had the idea that the limiting factor, other than knowing the mechanics of the spell like wand motions and pronunciation, is will and emotion.

The strength and duration of a spell is determined by how much you want it. And then different spells have different upper bounds for length. For example a standard Cheering Charm might regularly last an hour but if you were desperate to cheer up a grieving friend you might be able to make it last a whole day.

Where as the spells used to make brooms last decades as long as you do them right but someone who is especially proud of their work could make it last over a century.

You could totally hold an active spell like levitation charm all day as long you can focus on keeping the feather up.

The reason you can't keep a Patronus going for hours on end is because holding onto the positive memory/emotion is overwhelming and you start to get distracted and emotionally exhausted.

The reason you can't use a million Killing Curses in a day is because even for terrible people drawing on the ill will and desire for death over and over is taxing and after a while you grow numb to it.

This also explains why people can do extraordinary magic when I'm danger, of course their will is stronger when the spells they're casting could save their life.

I admit this is a rough theory that I've never written out before so there's probably some canon examples that is doesn't gel with but I prefer a system where effort and knowledge of spells is more important than some inherent power that in a lot of stories there's no way to make better so people like Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry are just born better than their peers.

** Seems like there are two types of spells... those which act for only one instance like the majority of spells and those that require and then those that require you to maintain the flow of magic like the Patronus, Wingardium Leviosa, Cruciatus, Mobilicorpus or Reparo (if we consider the movies as canon).

As for magical cores I also think it's a silly theory but I liked the concept of magical exhaustion from NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series which compared the use of magic with a muscle and the more trained it is the more resilient you become and overdoing it would tire you but you wouldn't run out of magic.

Personally I like to imagine that magic as thought out by JK involves having the right state of mind (Patronus, the Unforgivables) or willing to pay a price for it (Lily's sacrificial protection or the Horcruxes) or communicating your intent through a series of vocal commands and wand movements for simpler spells.

** Maybe I read too much smut, but I thought a person's "core" is just a euphemism for those parts of a woman's body where she feels sexual arousal and pleasure, so a "magical core" is just a witch's core and has nothing to do with spellcasting unless "sex magic" is a thing.

Basically, Lily Evans had a magical core, Petunia Evans had a non-magical core, and neither James Potter nor Vernon Dursley had cores of any sort.

** I really love InwardTranscience's concept, where there isn't any numerical "magical core power-level" type situations. Instead, humans are imperfect conductors of magical energy. Like in electronics, you can run any current/magic through your wire/human. The trick is not overvolting the system and turning your nervous system to slag with the waste energy.

People have different initial resistances to the energy, and they get more efficient as they get older and keep casting. Another related fact from this system is that Dumbledore isn't that much beyond average for a person of his age group. He's just very, very clever at maximizing effect.

On the time limits for transfiguration: I prefer a quintessence-based (fifth element) explanation. Transfiguration is fuelled by quintessence, which operates as a universal substance propped up by magic to make the transfiguration operate as it should. True conjuration of matter is possible, but rather difficult beyond basic substances like water. Conjuring a true bird, for instance, would require the complete knowledge of every single property of the bird. The more consistent the quintessence is with what it's emulating, the longer the transfiguration will last before the quintessence falls apart. Conjuring a bird with some basic knowledge of how the bird acts and their organs would result in a more robust conjuration than a blob given the instruction "be a bird".

Gamp's Law of Food Transfiguration isn't a magical law, it's a piece of advice. Eating something that dissolves after your body has incorporated it is rather bad for your health.
