We know many super!Harry or Indy!Harry stories that feature the obligatory animagus training. But why are there no stories where Harry's form effectively IS the power he knows not? In that his form is the center of the story and his main strength. I've read stories where his form is only used for stealth purposes and I guess that's sensible, but I want to read where Harry may not be more powerful than average but his animagus form gives him an advantage.

Considering my narrow parameters, I doubt I'll be recommended any non-Gary-stu stories. Worth a shot!


** "Growing Up Kneazle" and its sequel should fit. Harry pretty much goes around as a kneazle whenever he can.

** The problem with this concept is that animagus forms aren't really /that/ useful. They are immune to lycanthropy and resist dementor exposure. In a pinch, they could provide mobility or stealth (especially if caught wandless) but that depends heavily on the form and the context, and talented wizards would have other tricks up their sleeves anyway (e.g. Snape's flight).

*** I think if the animagus form were an Alpha Predator, or large animal, you have a lot of capabilities open to use that don't even require a crazy form. The fact that all the animagus forms we have seen are non combat doesn't mean it is impossible.

I can imagine if he turned into a rhino he would be able to cause quite a bit of damage, even against wizards.

**** If you're skilled enough in transfiguration to be an animagus, you're probably also skilled enough to turn a rock into a rhino, removing any chance of you being injured. I think smaller forms a la Peter Pettigrew are more useful, especially in situations that aren't necessarily combat, but still involve an element of danger or of being caught/captured.
