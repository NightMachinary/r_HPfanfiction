Really not sure on the pairing on this all I remember is a scene where Harry and friends are running from fluffy the hell hound and barricade themselves into a room when the teachers find them they are all sleeping and I believe Blaise or Seamus are holding on to halberds or polearms they found in the room.

Thanks

*** I'm really trying to find it, but I have read so many fics and without knowing if it was complete or anything like that, it's hard, sorry

The Downward Spiral Series by Bolshevikmuppet99 has got a Harry/Daphne pairing wherein the two of them are the Dark Lord's most faithful Death-Eaters which is different from the usual Daphne is Slytherin Mary-Sue trope.
