It may have been a Harry/Ginny. The main thing I remember is that Ginny tried to explain why people didn't believe him after the graveyard battle. Something like "History is written on the edge of a wand" and disbelief that he could match wills with Voldemort. Think it might have been independentHarry, dont think it was darkHarry or smut. Read it a few years ago. Sound familiar to anyone?
