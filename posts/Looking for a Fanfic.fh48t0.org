:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the title, but Harry was named Hadrian Potter. It was a Fluer x Harry fic I think, and he had a younger brother who everyone thinks is the boy who lived, when in reality Harry is the boy who lived but no one knows. His parents are still alive but are neglectful of him in favor of his younger brother. He also becomes a chaser and plays for a team and they get famous. If anyone knows the name of the fic please comment below. Thank you for reading this.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD
