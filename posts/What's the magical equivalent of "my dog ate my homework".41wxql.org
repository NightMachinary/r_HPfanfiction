** - My homework spontaneously combusted.

- My homework turned into a dog and ate me.

- My homework caused a time paradox and has eliminated itself from the timeline to prevent the end of the universe.

- My homework gained sentience and is now living in the Forbidden Forest.

- My homework is on your desk but is both invisible and intangible.

- When I defeated Draco in a duel, mastery of his homework passed to me. I am the true owner of Draco's homework.

- For my spell creation homework I created the homework vanishing spell. As you can see, it has been incredibly successful.

- Professor Trelawney made a prophecy that you will never receive my homework. So that's three true prophecies now, I guess.

** I insulted one of the Weasleys and the next thing I know everything I'd written in the last week un-wrote itself.

Or here's one that might get some sympathy from the older teachers: I wrote it on muggle paper. I had no idea- the second I tipped the paper up, all the letters slid down off the page onto the carpet.

Sorry, my revision with fire-spells (or vanishing spells etc.) got out of hand ;)

The giant squid destroyed it (works when you do homework outside and the teachers know that - unless it's winter, because that makes it hard to believe!)

I had homework? Check me for obliviation please!

Oh, I sent the wrong scroll to my parents, sorry professor, this is my letter home!
