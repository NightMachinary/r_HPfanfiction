During the final battle what happens if harry and tom both die and harry is taken to either the past or an alternate dimension where he again fights not because its the right thing to do but that he simply doesnt know how to stop fighting

no slash no fem!harry no crack fics

bonus if Harry is stronger/smarter than in canon like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12101842/1/What-s-a-Little-Death-between-friends]])

Apologies for hijacking the thread, but this sounds like a very interesting premise. No clear winner at the Battle of Hogwarts, no more uberwizards and children of prophecy, no super-wands: just the remaining DEs, Order members, and others embroiled in brutal guerilla war to rule what's left of Wizarding Britain.

*** truthfully i think that if that happened then the DE's win simply because they still have the advantage of most people being to afraid or weak to fight back especially without a figurehead

**** I don't think that's necessarily the case. Voldemort literally laid Harry's body out before the defenders of Hogwarts, and they just redoubled their efforts.
