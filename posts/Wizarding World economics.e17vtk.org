Considering that an important tool such as a wand cost approximately 7 galleons and that 1000 galleons is enough for a business capital for the twins, and their is also the fact that Magical Britain has a smaller population than the UK and that the conversion rate is £5 to a Galleon. Any thoughts on Magical Britain's economy? Like for example how much would be the tuition fee for a prestigious school such as Hogwarts? or how much is a top of the line racing broom?

I find the “Harry has billions if not hundreds of millions of Galleons in his vault” trope a bit funny.


** Didn't JK say something like she wasn't good at math and she messed up the conversion rate, just because she didn't think about it much?

*** This. She arbitrarily came up with 29 knuts to a sickle and 17 sickles to a galleon, but that means 493 knuts to a galleon. At 1:1 British penny to knut conversion, that means 4.93 GBP to a galleon. The problem was with saying what a knut converts to.

Though to be fair, an in-universe argument could be made that magic both reduces the need for labor and drastically reduces scarcity of essential goods. This would seriously slow inflation in comparison to the muggle world.

**** I didn't know that it came from a ‘penny = knut' conversion. Thanks for this. It actually makes a kind of sense now, at least why she set it at that rate. Lowest = lowest, etc.

** Truthfully I don't buy the conversion rate simply because the math doesn't add up no matter my thinking. The only thing that could possibly help is that magic makes everything cheaper/easier/quicker. One person can do the job of many more efficiently at less cost so things cost less. Another idea is that the wand is subsidized some by the ministry to make sure everyone can get one.

** Hmm, do we ever hear about Hogwarts requiring tuition? (in the books mainly, but maybe Pottermore too). The Weasleys had little money but all seven of their children attended. It could be the school itself is paid for by the government and the students only need to pay for robes/books/etc.

Purely a guess, but 50-200 G for a broom?

*** I've seen a few times that the ministry pays the tuition for their employees. Irl my friend got a free ride to the college his mom taught at.

I think JKR has tweeted that there's no tuition in canon though.

**** Good point, I also got a free ride when my mother was still teaching at my old school. But what about those who doesn't have ministry employees as parents like Harry or the muggle-borns living in a prejudiced world?

***** Hermione's parents could probably afford it. Harry's parents probably left him enough for that.

Given the shitty ministry, usurious, poorly explained loans are most likely.

*** This is Britain in 1980s (early 1990s) seen by eyes of the Labour-voting left-leaning JKR, so yes I take it when Hagrid said that the Hogwarts are tution-free for all, I believe him.

** in my opinion 1 Galleon = 34 NZD = 17 pounds. This is based off the one currency I remember specifically mentioned and that is when a butter beer is two sickles and a standard drink like that is about 4NZD so 2NZD to a sickle. This is what I use but it makes the night bus way iver priced so I change that cost.
