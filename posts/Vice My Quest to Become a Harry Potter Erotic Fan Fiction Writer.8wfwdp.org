** Vice is trash and that story more so. "Fanfiction has existed since the begnning of the internet." Bitch, it existed before the internet. It existed in the fucking 1920s with tijuana bibles. It existed even before that!

Shit, an argument can be made that EVERYTHING is fanfiction if it follows the basics of the hero myth or other archetypes.

#+begin_quote
  A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.

** Why would you subject yourself to Vice? Or give them clicks? At least archive that shit.
