Hello all,

The titled fic (the smut that it is) is available on AO3 up to Ch. 15. However, on the currently down HPfanficarchive, it went up to ch. 17. I was wondering if anyone knew another place to find those chapters, or if you could share those chapters with me if you happened to have it saved.

Thanks!

*** Initially it's Harry and Cho, but adds a lot to a harem after. It's definitely for specific fetishes and won't appeal to everyone. The 2 chapters missing from AO3 are focused on Tracey.

Obviously, if HPFanfic goes up again, it's not a problem, but no idea if it will.

**** Ohk then I wont be searching for the extra 2 chapters, I'm not interested in Tracey, Lily is one of my guilty pleasures, and the others definitely aren't slacking in the hotness department, so might just read it

***** Well I do want the missing chapters! XD I'd hate to read or save a copy knowing it's missing chapters I'd read once upon a time!

  AU. A regular teenage boy was getting ready for his 6th year of Hogwarts. He lived a normal life with his family. There were no dark lords terrorizing the wizarding world. Like most boys his age there was a girl he dreamed of all the time. The perfect angel. However, what would happen if the perfect girl turned out to be a cruel and evil bitch that tried to make his life a living hell. The boy would need to show her the error of her ways with the help of a magical collar...
