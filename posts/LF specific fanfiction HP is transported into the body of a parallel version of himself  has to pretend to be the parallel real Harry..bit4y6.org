:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What I kinda remember was that he had at least one sibling and that his parents were good people (no bashing). I basically remember HP becoming a better big brother, because he knows to appreciate this family. Sirius was married to some french witch, I think, and had a few kids.

If this seems familiar to you, please link the fan fiction you're thinking of! :)


** That sorta sounds like this fic Linkffn(the abuse in a violently different dimension) Harry gets attacked by the original harry as soon as he shows up in the new detention. Harry then kills the original harry and has to assume his identity or get caught. He also has a little brother which he initially doesnt get along with because he is unaware of their familial ties. His brother acts hostile towards him as well due to original harry not being the best brother towards him.
