The Lover can be Harry or some other Guy from the known People. Even an OC is fine. Whether the Fic is written from her POV or from an narrator, like the Canon doesnt matter. I cant say, what i would think about how the Story goes....maybe Harry grows older and travels to an alternate Universe and there Narcissa falls for him. However, the End of the Story i had thought about this: during a Occasion at the Evening of the Day that would keep her from going home she is able to leave the Place (all people, who would know, she is there, would keep thinking it) and thinking about sleeping with her Lover....possibly to find out, if she really loves him or not or how it is to be loved by another Man. Upon arriving on his place, he would refuse to sleep with her, since she (vigorous) refused about doing this not long ago, but she convinces him and things happen.

We dont know if Lucious and Narcissas marriage was arranged or they loved each other, but i think it was pretty much arranged in the first place and the Result was just for the benefit of the Purebloods. But maybe she "adapted" to her situation and began love him.

Sorry, if the text above might be to detailed, but i simply would like to know Fics that contain a similar Story with rough the same result. So Narcissa wants to sleep with another man because she wants to find out how it feels to be desired and wanted or similar things. However, she is clear that this is only a one-time thing and would never happen again, atleast as long as Lucious lives.

I dont mind, if she has more than one affairs with said Person and she is going to end it.


** There was one that included little snippets, in no way the main focus, of Narcissa/Remus. I think it was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]]

It is a total crack-fic, which just happens to include Narcissa.

** Triwizard Tales, linkffn(7594305)

It's not a main story point. Sort of? It kind of is, but isn't. It is a running joke though.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.
