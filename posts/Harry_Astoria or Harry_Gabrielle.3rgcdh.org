Looking for good Harry/Astoria or Harry/Gabrielle fics. I think Harry/Appoline Delacur is too much to hope for.


** For Harry/Astoria, Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver and Unatoned by SeriousScirbble are great reads.

linkffnbot(7539141; 8262940)

Both are masterpieces with quality writing and superb characterization.

** Its writing is rough in places and plays with Judaeo-christian mythology more than some would be comfortable with but I strongly recommend The Little Veela that Could by Darth Drafter. linkffn(5490079)

*** Could you elaborate on the Judeo Christian mythology. Because i really liked the Denarian series of harry potter fanfiction, as well as other stuff like the Lucifer comic series, which include things like angels and demons and stuff. Because i think i remember stopping this fic after a few chapters when hermione was wearing harry's wand as a necklace and didnt care too much to continue.

**** The short version.

Yahweh wasn't so much a god as a Light Magical Creature whose power was intimately linked to his bond with his angels. The bond was broken and they died. Veela are there decedents and pale shadows of there progenitors.

When Harry attempts to replicate Lily's blood protection to save Gabbi he inadvertently triggers her transformation into an angel making Harry her Lord.

*** It's worth noting that Harry/Gabrielle doesn't actually happen /at all/ in the fic until the very last chapter, even even then, it's barely anything. The author inserted an OC for Gabrielle to date for pretty the whole thing. As such, the story is 24 chapters of essentially quidditch league filler, but even so, I still found it decent.
