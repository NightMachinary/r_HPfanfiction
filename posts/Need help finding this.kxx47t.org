:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fanfic a while ago. It goes that all the women in Harry's life and at Hogwarts and such are extremely attracted to him because of the part of Voldemort that he has inside of him. I believe Dumbledore first explains this and says that Tom Riddle was also extremely popular among the ladies when he was at Hogwarts and with Harry having a part of Riddle in him, he has that attractiveness to him as well
