I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] and it was hilarious. But it also got me thinking.

There are a few story points that crop up /all the damn time/ and while they can be fun if done right, they are often done *badly* (because this is fanfiction, what did you expect?). Things like Harry actually being Lord Potter, or Marriage Contracts being a thing; I'm sure we've all read a pretty huge load of those sorts of stories and are thoroughly sick of them because something like 90% of the time it just turns into a way to allow Harry to step on cannon without actually /doing/ anything. This is why I absolutely loathe Harry Crow (which I will not link too); all those tropes pop up and it doesn't make the story /good/.

So, does anyone know any stories where those sorts of tropes pop up... only to be immediately rendered pointless?

"You are Lord Potter Harry! But since this is a democracy, that means literally nothing."

"Dumbledore has been hiding a secret extra Gringots vault from you! ...Which contains some old furniture from your grandparents house and nothing else of value."

"This marriage contract says you have to marry Draco Malfoy! ...but it isn't actually legally binding or anything, so if you don't want to..."

I have read a couple stories that do things like this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's brother]], where Voldemort got himself a child's body around the time Harry is 9 or so, and then told Harry he was his brother and when they went to Gringots there was a small extra vault that had things like Lily's wedding dress in it. No ancient tomes of Potter Magic which somehow is super ridiculously powerful or whatever; just a few mementos. (okay, my memory wasn't very good, that story is kind of lame)

Another fic that very nicely subverts the manipulative!Dumbledore trope is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a baby?]] where Dumbles totes is manipulative and maybe a little evil, but Harry is so much more evil and powerful that Dumbles basically says 'well that seems alright then'. (fair warning, that fic is a cross over with Naruto, but it takes place almost exclusively at Hogwarts so the cross doesn't matter very much)

Most of these fics are likely to turn out kind of cracky, and that's cool, so long as it is /well written/ crack people. If the author at any point refers to an individual's actions as 'snarky', that is *bad crack*. Humor is supposed to arise organically, not because the author writes a verbal 'buh dum tish' into the thing. :P

Anyone got things like that? Harry is part of another character's harem? An animgaus form of a gerbil?

Non-crack is good too of course

** Well, if you are up for reading works that are derived from something else rather than the Harry Potter series, and do not mind the fact that it is not complete and has slow-ish updates, then there is a story that treats the topic of soul bonds fairly well. If the answer to the previous one is “yes” then just know that the story in question is “Blazing Sun” by esama (not linking to it because of it not being a Harry Potter story).

Going with the other ones, “Inheritances” (linkffn(10986961)) has a well-played plot element of Harry inheriting some titles.

Then the veela bond, played wonderfully in “Playmate” (linkffn(10027124)).

The next on the list is “Registration” (linkao3(830080)), with its humorous handling of the various “cooler names” that Harry could get due to people thinking “Harry” too simple.

“the heir of something or other” (linkao3(4330836) is a fine, a little bit station--of--the--canon-y for some people's tastes but still quite well written, take on what Harry getting sorted into Slythering would actually be like. I know I'm biased but I want to say that it is beautiful, and I don't think it's shameful if you cry while reading this---or any of the other stories from the series this author wrote that this story belongs to.

Harem stories next, oh yes, and we have “Two Drunks Equal One Harem” (linkffn(9116521)).

  Slytherins--- this is a group who laughs when Neville falls off a broom and breaks his wrist. And what if we had Harry there, who had always been the one laughed at, who had a nice thirst to prove himself, who had green trim on his robes instead of red? This Harry still stepped out in front of Malfoy's best sneer and demanded Neville's Rememberall back--- though he got a detention from it, not a Seekership.When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. Harry did not ask Millicent to come with him; this was not a boy who asked for things. When he had asked for things, Dudley had laughed, Petunia had scowled, and Vernon had said, “no,” or just kept reading the newspaper like he hadn't heard anything at all. But when Harry went, Millicent bunched up her robes in her hands and followed.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
