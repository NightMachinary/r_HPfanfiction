The first Dramione fanfiction I ever read was breath mints and battle scars on account of so many recommendations. I've read other highly regarded fanfics like the Fallout, Turncoat, Isolation, and some others. But, they didn't really compare for me to BMBS. I'm looking for fanfics that are similar. preferably after the war. I think I enjoyed how dark it was. Or maybe it was just because it was my first Dramione fanfic(I really don't read much Harry Potter fanfiction). If anyone has recommendations, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

P.S. I would've put this in the Dramione sub but I just wanted to see if anyone had other recs too.


** And the wolves all cry by monroeslittle is one of my all time favourite fanfics and everything the author writes is amazing (sunshine in my eyes, and there's a few drables on her tumberle in the same universe as ATWAC that are great)

its a Jilly fic where voldermort never hears the profercy wins the war.\\
