May be a long shot, but there was this fanfiction I read a while back. It was about how every year, there was a muggle hunt organized at Malfoy Manor. Severus would be invited but he'd decline and would instead sneak onto the property to help as many people as he could, and one time it ends up being Harry but he somehow becomes a fox in a fit of accidental magic? Thanks in advance!


** I remember this one! I can't for the life of me remember what it was called though or even where I read it haha

If I find it when I get home from work I'll make sure to link it :)
