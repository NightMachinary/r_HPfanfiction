What about Moody? or Figg? or Pettigrew's remaining family? Something different, but kept to existing characters. ie: not Sirius/Remus, Voldemort, a mysteriously-surviving Potter, or any variation of the Dursleys, Malfoys, Weasleys, or Grangers. FWIW, I've seen Hagrid, Trelawney, Mr. Creevey, and the Diggorys make a go of it.


** Have you read the one where Harry is raised by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man][Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson]]?

*** I...there are no words that can describe how hilariously stupid that story is, that simultaneously made me want my 10 minutes back and think that they were ten minutes well spent; that made me go "wow, this guy's creative" and "that disclaimer that you weren't on drugs when writing this, all lies".

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. --- (Eventual Harry/Hermione) Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.
