For example: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]] by Esama, in which Harry becomes the Moriarty of the Wizarding World and basically rules the criminal underworld.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8746563/1/With-a-Forked-Tongue-I-Lie-in-Wait-Taming-Snakes][Taming Snakes]] by DelusionalGrandeur, in which Harry is raised by criminals and becomes a BAMF.

Similarly, I thought that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8046571/1/The-Diadone-Method][The Diadone Method]] by m0untainc1imber was pretty good. It features a mafia!Harry.

I have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300805/1/Heir-to-a-Warlord][Heir to a Warlord]], in which Harry Potter becomes the heir to a Somali Warlord. It was OK, but it was a bit too much.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door][An Unfound Door]] has elements of this, and is quite good. It also recently updated (not on FF.net, in the WbA section of DLP).

*** Huh, I didn't even notice the update in the WbA section. Granted, Joe is a professional author, so expecting him to actually finish his fics is kind of unrealistic, but it's nice that he's taking the time to throw out an update every now and then.

Also, as an aside-I enjoyed chapter 6 of What You Leave Behind. Looking forward to 7 and more Fleur.

**** You got my attention with :

So I checked his profile quickly and I found HP & the Wastelands/Heartlands of time.

Somehow I am not surprised to learn he is a pro. Damn good in my opinion :D

***** Not surprising at all. Also, every time Joe gets brought up I whore this out, but I like to think someone new will see it and enjoy. His [[http://joeducie.net/the-reminiscent-exile/distant-star/][Reminiscent Exile series]] feels very much like a spiritual successor to the Wastelands Of Time. It incorporates the same epic style of prose and storytelling, and uses many of the same concepts first explored in Wastelands. While not a direct sequel or related in any sense of universe, a Wastelands fan will recognize many concepts and shoutouts to the fic and to the fanfic community.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium][Moratorium]] sounds a lot like the first fic you linked to, Business. I also love the weirdness of Harry in it.

*** Yes! I just read the first chapter and it seems awesome! Thanks.

*Edit*: Finished. It sorta... deteriorated in terms of plot and mechanics. Still, it was a fairly enjoyable way to pass the time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/1/893][893]] features a badass yakuza-raised Harry who unwillingly returns to Britain for plot reasons. The writing isn't anything to, ah, write home about, but it definitely entertained me. It's complete, by the way.

** Some that come to mind, aside from the others mentioned in this thread, are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5731338/1/The-Raven-s-Anger][The Raven's Anger]] Harry becomes a mob boss in NYC, around 50k words but abandoned apparently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1617442/1/Potter][Potter]] Pretty good story of harry growing up as heir to Mafia boss, 100k words, complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2138102/1/Blood-Prince][Blood Prince]]Another growing up mafia story, 75k words, complete and has a completed sequel

Although not exactly crime world related, these too still have harry committing crimes: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood]] more comical than anything else, but still a really enjoyable read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/Death-Before-Dishonour][Death Before Dishonour]]

This fanfic was published at the end of September and so far only has 3 chapters, with 24k words. Features a Slytherin!Harry, who along with Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and Draco Malfoy are trying to make their fortune from nothing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3105609/1/The-Next-Great-Adventure][The Next Great Adventure]]

Currently reading this fanfic, although it was abandoned back in 2007. Definately features a criminal Harry, although he has multiple sets of identification saying otherwise.

"Much to his displeasure, Harry is thrown back through time into his six year old body. As a result, Harry decides to contort the timeline, purely for his own amusement."

It has some interesting time travel aspects and Harry becomes a mob boss.

** I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2817585/1/Malignant-Objects][Malignant Objects]] a lot. I like the writing style, the atmosphere the author creates, and of course the plot too. Sadly it was abandoned in 2008, but I think the chapters that have been written so far a worth reading.
