Looking for any recommendations on stories where Harry has some special ability.


** There was a cool incomplete one where Harry has the power to use water to basically move between the ethereal and corporal plane. I don't recall the name. He is super, but not totally OP. There is even a scene that reminded me a lot of Thor Ragnarok in it.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11759933/1/In-All-Things-Balance][a good star wars crossover]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8516157/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-the-Dark-Side][This one's]] another star wars crossover. Downside is that it basically follows canon plotline to almost a tee.

also a recently published [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12917212/1/It-s-Lonely-At-The-Top][harry/fleur one]] I'm following where harry is known as the "second coming of merlin" as well as the bwl. Nothing special so far but he's basically so powerful he can do wandless magic pretty easily even before hogwarts starting.

  That one where Harry is an ice elemental and he is paired with a fire elemental OC is really good. I forgot the name of it though.

"Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power"?

They start off hating each other? Fire elemental named Lillian, nicknamed Freckles?

Thought it was in my favourites somewhere but can't seem to find ... oh.

Looks like the original was deleted, but someone (idk if original author?) posted it here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12798308/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-s-Power]]

** [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and the sequel [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise over Britain]], both are very long, but great works, they were written/planned before and after HBP came out. You can expect some cliche tropes, but generally the authors were writing before things became cliche. It's written well and the tension is actually there, and you can't always say that for most other super!Harry fics. It's also got a well developed Harmony romance. it delves into multiple subjects and is just generally enjoyable.

Harry becomes monstrously powerful in this story, in a *BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION* sort of way.
