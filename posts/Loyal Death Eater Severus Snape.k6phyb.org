** There's one fic I've been meaning to find again.

Snape cursed Harry to make it so no-one could tell him about his inheritence, which somehow made it so he missed out of it when he came of age. (a bit dumb, but let's call it a coordinated death eater plot)

He travels back in time and breaks the curse causing fallout.
