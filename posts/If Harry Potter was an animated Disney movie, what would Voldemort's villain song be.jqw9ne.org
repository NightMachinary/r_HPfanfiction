** Voldemort has a high voice rather than a deep one so it should play on that. He's also not the sort that does big, ostentatious dance numbers; probably shouldn't be anything more than casual pacing and small gestures. Thematically it should play on his ego and casual cruelty. Ergo, I think it would have to be something similar to the King's song from Hamilton.

****** Yeah. Like a loan sharktopus though. While umbridge is definately more evil, they both have a lawful evil alignment and similar style.

Now I'm also thinking of villain songs for the other HP villains.

Snape's is definately Hellfire. He's such a lovesick drama queen.

Lucius' is the Cruella de Vil theme.
