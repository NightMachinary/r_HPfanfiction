Harry is well educated in the ways of society. When he goes to the Hogwarts Express, he strikes up a friendship with Draco/Daphne/lowkey any Slytherin as he knows of their family's political presence.

Then, we have the typical Weasley bashing moment where Ron barges in and demands that Harry stops being friends with the child because "their parents were Death Eaters!"

Harry calmly points out that Dumbledore's dad went to Azkaban for attacking muggles which Death Eaters often do. So, he asks Ron whether he should not trust Dumbledore.

The story continues with Harry being sorted into Ravenclaw/Slytherin and Ron going to Gryffindor. However, Harry's words bother Ron until he decides that Harry is right. Dumbledore can not be trusted.

Ron starts rallying Gryffindor against Dumbledore. He tells them that Dumbledore is basically a junior Death Eater and that he is not a true Gryffindor. Slytherin joins in because they don't like Dumbledore much either. Ravenclaw sees the logic and joins in as well. Hufflepuff joins in because they had nothing better to do.

The youngest male Weasley leads the school into a revolution against Albus Dumbledore until the man taken to trial. It is there when Dumbledore's association with Grindelwald is revealed. He is sent through the veil for supporting a terrorist and withholding information.

Ron Weasley is then crowned the Savior of the Wizarding World and the Headmaster of Hogwarts, all while still being in his first year.

*The End*


** Of course, Ron knew that he had no chance against Dumbledore in a fight... but then he remembered that there was another sort of magic, the one that the Headmaster himself said was beyond all that was done at Hogwarts.

***

"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"

For a minute, silence reigned. Then, Ron Weasley stood up from his seat and started to sing - but his what he sang was not the venerable Hogwarts anthem.

One by one, more and more students joined in, until the entire Great Hall bellowed the words that left the wise Headmaster speechless.

/Do you hear the people sing?/

/Singing a song of angry men?/

/It is the music of the wizards/

/Who will not be slaves again!/

/When the beating of your heart/

/Echoes the beating of the drums/

/There is a life about to start/

/When tomorrow comes!/

Shout-out to linkao3(Green and Ginger by Slytherin_Soul94) which is basically a Sinyk uber!Harry bashfest with Ron and Hermione swapping places

  There aren't enough fics with this couple as the main couple and I think this is the couple we all deserved and I'll be more than happy to write it.

**** That's okay - sometimes we make mistakes.

Like I said, you were going strong until that point; this is a 92% grade work.

****** Hmmm... Well, it's gonna be crackfic, so more cliches are allowed

-A longer timeline than one year

-throw in some of Voldemort's shenanigans, hell, since Dumbledore is gonna be comically evil, go with the usual cliches of Albus planning around Voldemort's shit

-Ron using his brain should mean he pays at least a little bit of attention in class

-since this is going crackfic, comically evil Snape (if serious fic, allow for redemption)

-Draco redemption, at least a little bit; none for Lucius, though

-Harry/Luna - Harry would probably be better in Ravenclaw, anyway

-Ron, being too distracted to be a prat, doesn't treat Hermione like crap before Halloween

-Somebody old enough to remember it, or who paid attention in History, calls out Dumbledore whenever he mentions Greater Good™ and links it to Grindelwald

-Hermione/Tracy Davis because why the fuck not.

And finally, Professor Flitwick plays the role of Designated Adult™

Not necessarily all of these, but these suggestions are what I have.

Oh, and Bonus round: Molly Weasley is the True Final Boss
