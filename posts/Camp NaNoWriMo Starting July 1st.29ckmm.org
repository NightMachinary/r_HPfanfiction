Camp National Novel Write Month is starting July 1st. Camp NaNoWriMo is the summer extension of Nation Novel Write Month, which takes place every November. It is a way to track your progress and set a goal for yourself by including a month-long deadline.

Camp NaNoWriMo differs from NaNoWriMo not just in time, but with a system called cabins. Each cabin is made up of up to 12 authors who help each other, share thoughts, and motivate one another.

I've made a HPFanfiction cabin, so just reply below with your camp username if you would like to join.
