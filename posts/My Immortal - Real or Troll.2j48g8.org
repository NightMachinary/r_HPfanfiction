This is something I've been wondering about. This fic is so awful it's brilliant, and allusions to figures like "Tom Bombadil" and "Spartacus" indicate that the author is probably more educated than he/she lets on.

But on the other hand, I've tried my hand at writing Troll Fics, and it's harder than it seems to butcher the English language so horribly on purpose. I just cannot believe that an educated person had the patience to write so badly for so long.

Finally, I've heard some people arguing that the whole fanfic was a viral marketing campaign sponsored by Hot Topic or My Chemical Romance.

What do you think, is My Immortal a real effort or a troll fic?


** An epic troll.

*** I used to think it was a trollfic until I tried to write my own trollfic (a Game of Thrones AU with Robb as a POV). I got so frustrated I gave up at Chapter 3. It was so laborious trying to misspell enough that it seemed reasonable enough, but not to the extent that the reader figured out you were trolling. I died a little inside with every malapropism and run-on sentence.

So now, I'm still skeptical about the authenticity of My Immortal, but I'm not so sure...

**** That just means that they were a better troll fic writer than you are. I get frustrated and give up when I try to draw, that doesn't mean nobody can draw.

** It seems to me it's a hilarious, deliberate trollfic. The author wrote it to make fun of the sludge in fandom and incite the rage of those who hate it, or make them laugh, depending on their personal interpretation. This is coming from someone who used to write many trollfics.

** I think that the most likely possibility is that it's a troll fic /written by a team/. A small team of writers brainstorming ideas together in the "Yes, and" spirit of improv, then editing a common text on, e.g., a private wiki, may well be able to produce a level of linguistic butchery with which a single writer would have trouble.

** The encyclopediadramatica article says that it is confirmed to be a troll fic. As others have said the Bombadil reference kinda seals it for me
