I've seen fics where magical Britain is some primitive backwards embarrassment of a country compared to everywhere else, but I've never seen the opposite.


** I've always kind of wondered how Hogwarts is the most prestigious wizarding school in the world when the History professor is a ghost with memory problems, the Divination professor is basically a fraud, the Potions professor clearly doesn't actually teach and is super biased, and the Defense professor is sacked or dies every year.

Kind of makes you wonder if every other school is like [[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/p9do4b/key-and-peele-inner-city-wizard-school][Vincent Clortho Public School for Wizards]].

*** Bear in mind that of the three most prestigious wizarding schools in Europe, one has a reputation for focusing on the Dark Arts, and the other is run by a half-giant, while Hogwarts is run by the guy who saved Magical Europe and is widely considered the most skilled wizard alive.

*** To be fair about Snape, even though he is a terrible teacher, he doesn't seem terrible at teaching considering that the three Students he hates the most still receives Excellent grandes at their O.W.L exams and except for Lockhart who was a fraud, all the Defense teachers were very competent in the material.

And History and Divination are probably not considered to be that important.

***** Yes, they knew the material well and were skilled at magic, they were only bad teachers by choice.

Edit: examples

For Quirrel are his skill in cursing the broom, wandless magic or him taking out the Troll.

For Umbridge Shes capable od both the Cruciatus and the Patronus Charm and acckrding to Rowling invented her cursed Quill.

For the Carrows They were Death Eaters and managed to teach Crabbe and Goyle very advanced Dark Magic.

****** Quirrel - we know he could do this, but it isn't general knowledge.

Umbridge - actively prevented students from learning material.

Carrows - terrorists who forced students to torture each other.

How would any of these teachers increase the prestige of Hogwarts?

******** What's your point?

The discussion was on "how Hogwarts is the most prestigious wizarding school in the world". Why does it matter if teachers were naturally or deliberately bad teachers?

Either way, their presence is a significant black mark for the school.

*** I guess (considering the other answers to your comments) it's also because of Dumbledore. Probably no other school has such a powerful wizard as headmaster simply because powerful wixen do not want to become heads of schools.

** I've once read a fic -really don't remember which one, but Harry goes to a bunch of countries and is mentored by Dumbledore I believe- where on average, magicals from certain regions have different magical affinities. And the British were, on average, just a lot more powerful than most others. "If facing a northern wizard, bring fire. Face a French wizard, bring poison. Face a British wizard, bring 10 wizards." or something like that. It tied into that Britain was magically powerful enough to go independent and progressive a lot earlier on, before the ministries were really formed and despite the wars, they were still ahead of most other countries.

I've also seen mentions sometime of magical America being much more prejudiced in law than Britain. For example, marrying a muggle was forbidden in the states, in Britain merely frowned upon if you were pureblood and that was it.

But yeah, the "British are neanderthals" is much more popular, usually involving a Harry who somehow knows law better than fudge and dumbledore combined by doing laps around the lake.

** I would say that you either need to heavily modify canon Wizarding British society, or have it less of "Wizarding Britain is the most enlightened" and more that "everyone else is primitive and backwards".

Personally from how I look at it, it'd be one of the more developed magical nations - certainly not primitive or backwards in a lot of ways. However, the treatment of magical beings, along with the rather dark laws and the presence of a powerful noble/pureblood faction in the country makes me rather sad if that's the most enlightened in the world. So I like the idea of making other nations be more open in those respects - not all of them, of course, but at least some, or in different ways.

** That's the usual case in my stories - Dumbledore used his influence to make WIzarding Britain one of the most progressive countries in the Wizarding World. (Mainly to explain why the muggleborns didn't simply quit the country for another once discrimination started to ramp up.)

Mind you, it's the best, but certainly not really good, all things considered.
