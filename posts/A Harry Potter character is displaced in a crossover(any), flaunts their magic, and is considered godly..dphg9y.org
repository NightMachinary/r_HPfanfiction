Saw one that was the opposite of this, and was curious of any stories where a HP character is considered a top-tier character in the universe, because of the sheer versatility of their magic. Maybe they can do wandless, or they are just really skilled at using their magic.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  On his way to warn Helm's Deep of the marching army, Aragorn comes across a woman with green eyes and black hair, a woman who heeds none of his warnings of the approaching orcs but instead rides up to meet them in battle. Fem!Harry.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

** Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) - Kinda.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger) - This one is crass and kind of silly, but it fits. The only thing that could hope to oppose him is Sauron or a really unleashed Gandalf/Saruman, nothing else stands a chance.

Linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg) - Maybe.

Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter) - A Song of Ice and Fire being the setting it is, a wizard is unstoppable.

Apart from those already listed:

linkffn(11022305) - it was a wonderful ME/HP fic, but it died.

linkffn(11132113) - is a classic.

linkffn(2857962) - quite literal in this case.
