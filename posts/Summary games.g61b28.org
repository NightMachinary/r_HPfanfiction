Ok I'm bored lets play another game.

Lets make a 'summary' to a fic that you want written but hasn't been written.

Let me try :\\
Scapegoat - Ronald Weasley was always the scapegoat in his family, AU world where Ron is neglected and forgotten as the 6th weasley, nothing special.


** "When young Bill Weasley learns that if all the major Pureblood families die off completely their wealth will be transferred to the Prewett family and thus the Weasleys,the nine year old sets out on a quest of murder aided by his young siblings"

*** Oh my that would make a fantastic crack fic! Please do! It'd be even better if they only killed off the blood purists (like carrows) and used the money to improve not only their life but others too. E.g, helping the werewolves, fixing the daily prophet

** *To be Ordinary*

"Do you know what it feels like to be ordinary? Ah! Maybe you do. Of course, most people in this world are ordinary. Let me rephrase that question. Do you know what it feels like to be ordinary, /surrounded/ by extraordinary people? Come take a look into my life, and find out. Blimey! I forgot to tell my name. It's Ron. Uh- Ronald Weasley."

** I've got... altogether too many... for, you know, when I'm actually motivated to write, which isn't often.

//

*All The Best Intentions:* Harry Potter swears on his magic that he /did not put his name in the Goblet of Fire./

"Lumos!" he shouts. His voice echoes across the Great Hall.

His wand does not light.

//

*Endeavor To Be:* Snape keeps making Harry an example of what /not/ to do in duels; unfortunately, Harry won't stop improving. (The crack-treated-seriously oneshot about Snape as the 6th year DADA professor who likes to humiliate Harry, except it backfires spectacularly.)

//

*If That's All,:* Someone compares the DA's coins to Dark Marks. Hermione begins criticizing Voldmort's approach to seizing power, and realises halfway through an incensed rant that /she could do so much better./ (Hermione's learned to be creative, and that's what makes her dangerous. Crackfic for sure, because damn it'd be dark implications all around.)

//

*Plan B:* Voldemort succeeds in killing Harry as a child, except Harry isn't quite done with life --- and now Voldemort has a ghost child following him around. It's doing wonders for his reputation. /Not./ (Voldemort ends up basically raising Harry, who's just as Gryffindor as ever.)

//

*The Unfortunate Phenomenon of Bystander Apathy:* Harry and Hermione bind together in righteous indignation at how grossly underprepared the muggleborn population is, and how /blatantly apathetic/ everyone else seems to be. (A politics and policy fic, of course.)

//

*Blazing, Burning, Blistering:* Ron Weasley is reborn and he sets his red-fire heart on saving Harry Potter. But Harry --- Harry was reborn too, and he /hates/ him, because in Harry's world, Ron is a monster.

Hermione is much the same.

His friend's eyes burn with hatred as strong as the fire in his heart.

(Ron is still sorted into Hufflepuff, because he will never leave his friends. /Never again/.)

//

*The Indiscretions of Youth:* The ground is cold and hard beneath their knees, but they know better than to move, they've learned to stay still and never look up, and they would never dare to /think/ to suggest that they are anything more than a vessel of His ideals--- (The War, from the perspective of a Death Eater under Voldemort's influence. Since it's like, basically a cult?)

//

Haha... ha... ha... so those are the most coherent?

*** Okay the first - My heart wouldn't be able to take something so devastating!

The second - An interesting crack fic, could be hilarious or cliche depending on the exectution.

The third - I mean you'd have to make time critiquing it yourself but reading it would be extremely impressive.

The forth sounds very hilarioous, you prefer crack fics, don't you? It could be a series of drabbles.

the 5th - This could be an interesting fic like the purge, not dumbledore, or wish carefully. Be careful or you might mess it up though, no one likes mugglewank.

The 6th - This could make an interesting long story, I'd love to see it and read it!

And the last - A dark, unique, oneshot could be made of this. I like it. Which gen of death eaters? The first gen who are loyally devoted (when tom riddle was still tom), or the 2nd gen who join only because their parents say so?

** /"She sighed. She was tired. First journey from the mountains, far away from her home, then navigating through continent, always wary, always careful. And now this - this was fourth day onboard a ship and it was far from pleasant. She barely got in. But it was worth it, she kept reminding herself, looking at the book in her hands. Her bright green eyes shined as she thought of the destination. It was worth it, she thought, because she knew she would find answers on British Isles."/

In a strange chain of events a girl with bright green eyes finds a mysterious book from England and in desperate attempt to escape her fate decides leave her home in Himalays to look for people from the book in hopes for explanation of weird incidents happening around her for as long as she remembers.

/^{It's not something I definitely must read, it's just that this idea - more or less - has been flying around my head for some years now.}/

** Dolores Jane Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor, is really pissed off. She had everything perfectly planned out to ursurp Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic, and now all her effort spent kissing up to the idiot is wasted because some damned Dark Lord decided to come back from the dead. Dolores will do anything it takes to stop Lord Voldemort from posing a threat to her Ministry ambitions, even if it means turning the students of Hogwarts into her own personal army.

** *Worth It*

Harry gets access to the memories in his scarcrux, and he's aware of how things were at the end of the last war and uncertain about whether to even bother with Wizarding Britain. He decides to attend Hogwarts, at least for his first year, to get a feel for how Wizarding Britain responded to Voldemort's defeat, and whether it's worth fighting for when Voldemort returns. He'll certainly find a few people worth protecting, but how will he judge the society itself?

** My name is Harry Potter, I'm sure you've heard the stories. Greatest wizard of the age. Defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort in my 7th year at Hogwarts. Prevented Voldemort and his followers from killing even one single person, magical or muggle during the entirety of his second reign. Singlehandedly stopped Voldemort, all his Death Eaters and an army of dark creatures in a single night. Did all that and still managed to graduate as head boy with near perfect NEWTs.

​

They say I'm part of a secret organisation of super wizards. That I've trained diligently my entire life. That I stole magical secrets from the goblins and the centaurs. That I'm a time traveler. That I'm Merlin reborn.

​

In truth, I don't have the discipline for absurd training and I have no secret power. I can't even duel. Everything I achieved I did through cunning, deception and clever tricks. Through using tactics that my enemies couldn't conceive let alone defend against. Through striving to be what I think of as a great wizard; One who is wise.

​

My name is Harry Potter, and this is the truth behind my story.
