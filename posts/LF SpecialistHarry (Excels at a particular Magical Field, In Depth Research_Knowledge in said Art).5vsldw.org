So what I'm searching for are fics that focus on a Harry specializing in a few particular fields of magic like Transfiguration: ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823][The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]] ), Potions: ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196][The-Pureblood-Pretense]] ), Arithmancy, DADA, Runes, Divination, Care etc. or something less common like Enchanting, Alchemy, Spatial/Temporal magic, Mind magic, Rituals, Necromancy, Animation. Or maybe even forging and arms.

So what I'm asking is for a Harry that is so into a particular field(s) of magic that we get to see how it performs in action and also get a more in depth feel of the foundations that govern it.

***** And it's also riddled with very american language, teachers swearing in front of their students, loaded to the brim with tropes, and just feels unrealistic (For example Lily's notes to herself tight in Ch01)

While I love some aspects and the premise the execution just feels constantly a little off, and without any continuous 5 minutes of immersive reading I kinda lost interest.

It's just too many small problems.

******* I like harem and stronger than canon, so that wasn't the problem here. What I mean are (now that I'm back at a computer I can actually quote)

#+begin_quote
  Lily's Chest of Awesome
#+end_quote

Feels extremely modern and out-of-place for the timeline of the books. Would a 20-year old write like this in 1970, especially growing up in an old-fashioned environment (Hogwarts)?

But then there's other stuff, like the note:

#+begin_quote
  Improvements in Basic Charms. Note to self; show my ideas to Flitwick, he'll love it. Maybe I can even skip the Mastery program with these.
#+end_quote

I heavily doubt that a note to myself will ever look like this. If you think you can gain your Mastery with something, you know. You don't need to write it down.

But Flitwick is a great example, let's go to another Quote of him:

#+begin_quote
  Flitwick sighed. "Damn, well can't blame a man for trying," he chuckled.
#+end_quote

Flitwick saying "Damn" to a student? And the small Americanisms that are interjected constantly:

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione!" Harry said with a small jump. "Jeez, warn a guy when you sneak up on him."
#+end_quote

It's the little things that annoy me, not the big stuff. I can totally see how this might be rather invisible when you're from the US or simply read stories differently than me, but it's not the plot.

**** Frankly the rune system doesn't sound great either. In Potterverse, ancient runes is a dead language -- of some academic interest, but just as magical as written English, in and of itself.

That's not in the books, so authors can feel free to elaborate and incorporate runes into wards, rituals, items and engineering. But at least have some respect for canon. If rune magic were 'really insane' and disfiguring tattoos such an easy path to power, surely we'd see it in the books.

There's elaborating and explaining on canon magic. Then there's blindly and disrespectfully shoving your own 'cool' magic system in there, without thought for the originals.

This doesn't happen in that story. One of the few things that are okay about this story is (from what I've seen) the magic system which isn't totally OP.
