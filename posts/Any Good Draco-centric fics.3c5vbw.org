I've been looking for Draco-centric fics, but almost all of them seem to include romance, mostly pairing him with Hermione or Harry. I suppose it's just the remants of the Draco in Leather Pants fans. Any good Draco-centric non-romance fics?


** I don't agree with the common fandom Draco characterization, so it's difficult for me to find good Draco fics, too. I much prefer him miserable and cowardly! [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes one of the few Dracos I like. Her fics are pretty light on the romance even if they're marked with a ship; they are much more like character fics. I have [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][a fic]] as well but it's unfinished. The other Draco fics I know of feature heavier romance.

** I always seem to recommend the same few fics, but they always seem to fit the criteria.

Linkffn(The Code)

There's no romance until the 3rd book, which was just finished, and even then Draco isn't OoC, and it's not explicit.

** This one is pretty good: it's about Draco having an OC sister.The Malfoys aren't whitewashed in the least, so that's a plus.
