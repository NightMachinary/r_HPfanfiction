Maybe the stone was separate to the Ring, or Harry gets it somehow, but Harry having the stone through the challenges he faces. Asking Saint George about how to get past the Dragon, Merlin (Or Morgana) how to beat Voldemort. He finds out about the Scarcrux early? He summons Herpo the Foul and finds out that there IS a way to remove it without dying. There's loads of options that you could use the Stone as a learning tool for.


** Harry uses it to summon the Founders and learns each of their own specialty techniques.

Slytherin teaches him to be a master of the mind arts.

Gryffindor teaches Harry the process of creating his own sword.

Ravenclaw I imagine teaches Harry how to 'see and feel' magic. Give him kind of a sixth sense on the battlefield.

Hufflepuff I see as a pet master, using animation charms to swarm her enemies. If you've read Wind Shear, thing that.

*** Then Harry realizes they are completely useless since they don't speak modern English.

**** And that magic evolved by /a lot/ during the millennium since their deaths, so there are many more efficient ways of achieving the same and even better results. He gets information on their artifacts and later council about building magic households from them though, then starts calling the more recently dead foremost experts in their fields such as Nicholas Flamel.

** It would be interesting to see a story in which Harry becomes dependent of summoning the dead for advice and while at first most of them are happy to help him, they gradually get annoyed with him constantly disturbing their peace so, while they have to come when summoned, they deliberately sabotage Harry at every step in hopes that he would die and stop bothering them. When their plan is successful, the resurrection stone ends up in Colin Creevey's hands and he keeps summoning Harry to sign autographs or take pictures with him. And that's how the universe punishes Harry for playing with death.

** Related: I'd love a fic where Tom Riddle uses it - in canon he gets it just before he heads off to kill the Riddles. What if he used the thing at that point?
