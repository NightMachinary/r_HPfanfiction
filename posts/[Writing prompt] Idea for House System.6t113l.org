I had an idea where there was no sorting hat. Everyone went to a certain house based on what year they were in to help make them well rounded individuals. The heads of houses were people who taught about and how to use the traits of each house.

Years 1-2 Hufflepuff

Learn about friendship, loyalty, hard work, the value of patience and a good work ethic

Years 3-4 Gryffindor

Learn about bravery chivalry manners and perseverance in the face of adversity

Years 5-6 Slytherin

Learn about cunning, ambition, leadership skills, and resourcefulness . What it takes to get what you want. Learning how to talk to people. Learning about politics and wizarding traditions

Year 7 Ravenclaw

Smaller group because of NEWTS

Learn about proper study habits helping you revise for the test. How to research and prepare for the real world and help with finding a career.

Feel free to use it in a story if you want. I just have two requests. You cite me for it and you send me a link to your story so I can read it.


** I had the same idea except I had Ravenclaw as years 5-6 (because OWLS) and then Slytherin as year 7 (planning for the future, setting up job interviews, networking, etc.).
