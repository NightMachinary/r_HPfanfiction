So I haven't read Percy Jackson in years, but this came to me out of nowhere in the shower as most things in life do. I won't be using it and maybe it'll help someone else get inspired:

During the battle of the Department of Mysteries, just after Sirius falls through the veil, he's thrown back and followed by a pale teenager with messy black hair and Frankenstein scars. The room goes silent. Harry rushes to Sirius, who has fallen to his knees, as the boy looks around curiously. He shrugs, then tries to step back through the veil. It refuses to budge. Bellatrix, because she's Bellatrix, shoots a killing curse at him for the hell of it. The boy seems to realize what it does, because he suddenly grows angry. A strange, fearsome cold aura emanates from him causing everyone to take a step back. The stone floor cracks and Bellatrix falls through enough to be encased in sharp, black rocks.

At this point, Voldemort appears. He glances at the strange boy curiously, then waves his wand at Bellatrix. The rocks disappear and she runs. Voldemort studies the boy and Harry and decides to attack them both (not only does the boy look like Harry Potter, but Voldemort is curious as to what he can do; it's been a long time since anyone has managed to intrigue Lord Voldemort). The Order members intervene. They're now fighting Voldemort and Death Eaters until Dumbledore arrives. A fight breaks out, Voldemort is defeated, and he possess Harry. When he leaves Harry's body, instead of standing over to taunt him, he turns to the strange boy. He asks who is. The boy grins and that strange fearsome aura overtakes the room worse than before, bringing a freezing cold and dancing shadows. “I'm the Son of Hades,” he says.

Fudge and his witnesses appear. The boy is stunned and sent back to Grimmauld on Dumbledore's orders. That summer, he is treated with fear and distrust at HQ from everyone except Sirius. When Harry joins them later on, he follows Sirius's example. The rest of the Order questions him, but doesn't believe his answers. They grow even more fearful when his answers don't change under Veritaserum. Snaps takes one look in his mind and pales and flees (the boy realized what was happening and summoned the most fearsome battle he's fought in).

When Harry returns, he asks about that night from the boy's- who turns out to be called Nico- perspective at dinner.

“He appeared in the Underworld,” Nico says, inclining his head at Sirius. “The living don't belong in the land of the dead, and it seemed like he fell in more than anything, so I led him back.” He sighs heavily and drags his spoon through his soup. “Granted, I didn't expect to arrive in the middle of a battle. Or get stuck in a grimy old house in London.” At this, he glowers at Dumbledore, who has somehow managed to thwart all his escape attempts. Even the ones through shadows.

“I guess it was kind of my fault,” Harry admits with a cringe. “Voldemort lured me there. There's a prophecy about us and only the subjects of a prophecy can retrieve it.”

Nico groans. “I hate prophecies.”

Harry grins. “Me too.”

“Are you a child of prophecy?” Dumbledore cuts in.

“Nope!” He says, oddly cheerful. “That was all Percy! Not that I didn't help him out, mind you.”

“Percy?!” Ron blurts.

Nico's brows raise. “You know Percy?”

“Well yeah. He-“

“Not your brother, Ronald,” Hermione sighs.

Ron's incredulity smooths out into comprehension. “Oh.”

“He wouldn't happen to be a son of Poseidon would he?” Nico asks with a grin. “Or Neptune?”

Mrs. Weasley chuckles. “If he is, my Arthur has been holding out on us all.”

“Wouldn't be the first time,” Nico says, shrugging.

“So what does a son of Hades think about the greatest dark lord of the century?” Harry asks with a grin.

Nico frowns, his countenance growing abruptly serious. “There is something unnatural about him. Something wrong. I can feel death. I can feel souls. There's something off about his.” His eyes take on a feverish glint, not unlike Sirius's at his worst, as they trail up to Harry's forehead. “There's something wrong with yours too.”

In the tense silence, the kitchen door slams open. A boy with blonde hair and big, blue eyes smiles out at the crowd, ignoring the raised wands pointing at his chest.

“I'm looking for my boyfriend,” he says. “Have you seen him?”

And that's that. If you use it, let me know. I'd love to read it. Of course, Will Solace probably wouldn't come alone. I'd want to include Percy, but that's totally up to whoever wants to use it.

** I like the prompt, I don't like the OotP semi bashing that's kinda happening. Very interesting premise. Are you going to try and write this OP?

*** Nah, I've got too many WIPs as it is. Also, I think after the Order and Dumbledore realize that he's not some dark wizard/entity, they would back off. They're just hesitant in the beginning, for good reason.
