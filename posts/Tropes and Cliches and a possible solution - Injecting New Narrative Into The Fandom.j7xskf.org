A long title, but also a long-debated issue - over my short time here, I've seen a lot of people really, really hating 'tropes' (they usually mean clichés, but whatevs - the *first link* below explains the difference and *links to two other pages* that explains why you literally can't/shouldn't have a story without tropes - *'tropes are tools'* and *'story without tropes'* in hyperlinks in the second paragraph).

So, I wanted to propose a solution. A website called *TV Tropes*. For those who haven't heard of this delightful wonderland, it's a list of a metric fuck-tonne of tropes and the stories they're from across every type of medium (not just TV!). If you're looking for specific inspiration, you can *search the indexes for something* that might be of interest to you (see the first link again) or... you can take your chance with the *random trope* button.

Right at the top of the screen on any TV Tropes page, there's *a red and a blue button*. One will give you random media (TV shows, books, etc) and the other will give you *random tropes*. Unfortunately, it's not specific, so you could get plot tropes, setting tropes, mechanics tropes, character tropes, etc, but if you keep clicking, you might find something interesting and new that'll inspire you.

For example, if you want a new way to write Daphne and you're not sure what to do - go find the characters indexes (there's *more in the Narrative tropes section* than the single Character Tropes link I put below) and start searching. Or, just hit the random button and keep going 'til something appeals or inspiration strikes.

If the tropes we have are going cliché, lets try get some new ones!
