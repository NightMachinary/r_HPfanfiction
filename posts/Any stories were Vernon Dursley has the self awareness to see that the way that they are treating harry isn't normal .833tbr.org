so he Does his Best to not let harry having magic influence the way he treats him?

Really I think that a lot of story's Portray Vernon Dursley wrong.They always seems to make Petunia the Sympathetic one when her hatred of magic is personal. Vernon just seems to be going along with Petunia. (like the typical browbeat British husband who just goes along with his wife to make his life easier)

So are there any stories were Vernon Does his best to Run interference between Petunia and Harry?


** I remember one where Petunia died early and Vernon ended up raising both Harry and Dudley. He didn't know anything about magic. I'll try to find it if it interests you.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

**** There's a crack fic where Vernon is actually aware of magic, and Grunnings is either a front or actually just run by the Gnomes. He takes Harry and Dudley to some convention. Can't remember if it was a oneshot or actual fic though, and it might have been part of a collection.
