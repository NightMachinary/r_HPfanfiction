Hi, I read a fic a while back where Harry duels Dumbledore in the Room of Requirement in front of an audience. They weren't enemies or anything like that. I don't really remember the outcome, but they started dueling because someone requested it (i think), after they held a dueling tournament for other students.

Thanks!

** Do you remember any more details? I know I have read a fic where hes powerful and being trained/worked out by order members or something using the Room of Requirement over the year, and then at some point Dumbledore duels him to test how hes progressed and its an amazing duel and leaves all those watching astounded.

I also remember another one with a duel between them but I dont believe it matches your criteria.

Problem is I have so many ive read and saved over the past few years that god knows which one it is. Would need more info to attempt to narrow it down.

*** I'm sorry, but I don't really remember much else. It could be the one you described but it's been so long... Can you link it please?

**** Thats the problem though... I remember it but I would need more details to find it in my giant mass of stories I have saved lol. If I end up finding it I will link it but it may not happen.

*** That's not it either. It was one continuous duel rather than multiple rounds. That said, I greatly enjoyed reading the dueling part in this fic, so thank you for that.

** Dumbledore and Harry have a couple of duels in this one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny-and-Blue]]

They're more of a testing themselves against each other duel instead of a training duel.

*** No, that wasn't the one either. But I've really liked reading it so far, even though I usually don't enjoy slash. Thanks!

**** Yeah, I normally don't read it either. This one surprised me with it, and by that point I was invested enough to finish it.

Its one of three fics that are slash that I enjoyed reading and can think of off the top of my head.
