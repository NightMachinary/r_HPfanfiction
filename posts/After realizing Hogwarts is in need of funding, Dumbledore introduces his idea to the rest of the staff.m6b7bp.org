McGonagall sputtered "A-Albus! What are yo-"

"Hogwarts The Wand Holster!, Hogwarts The Colouring Book! Hogwarts The Breakfast Cereal! Hogwarts The Goblet! Hogwarts The Broomstick, the kids will love this. And last but not least, Hogwarts The Doll - Me!"

Dumbledore pulled the string from the doll's back.

"For the Greater Good!" it said in a squeaky voice.

Firsties loved them, but Trelawny was somewhat miffed that the cookies were deemed more accurate than her. It's a minor thing in the story, but could probably be worked up into an amusing one-shot.

  He even brought a large bag of fortune cookies and told me to leave them out for the first years.

  The firsties loved the cookies, but I heard a large batch of them found their way up to the Divination classroom, where Professor Trelawney took exception to them. Several students claimed the cookies were more accurate than she was. I suspect Ron and Seamus had a hand in that little affair, but I can't prove it.

**** Yes, he sold him to Voldemort for 1€. Harry and Voldemort got along quite well and watched some old movies together. Voldemort had a bit of an online shopping problem in this one. He was also wearing leggings with a leopard print, which was probably inspired by the cover of the seventh book in German. Minerva tried to explain Dumbledore that 1€ wasn't going to help much but Dumbledore didn't quite get that. And in this version Dumbledore is also a rapper calling himself Fresh D.

Luna and Xelophilius making a deal with hogwarts and selling creature dolls. Binns actually being replaced and students learning more than just goblin rebellions. The rich purebloods showing off by donating a lot of money to Hogwarts as charity (ug ug, Malfoy). No, but it could give him perhaps even more power, betting pools on Quidditch matches et cetera.
