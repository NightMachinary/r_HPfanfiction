** I agree. I'd be fine with the prompts if they were thought out and serious but most prompts seem like the OPs just posted the first thing they thought of. Most of them are title only. Considering that most prompts don't even lead to a short drabble, to say the least of full length stories, I'd much rather have one large thread of prompts. Most of the prompts are low substance silly stuff too that's hard to get exited about.

Moderation leads to, well, moderation. Without prompts, there'd be more room for discussion posts on stories, topics, etc. I most enjoyed the architecture post and my own healing post recently.

** We definitely need more high calibre discussions. Where would we be without our regular Haphne good circlejerk ?

Maybe we could be adventurous and mix in some Snape bad and even a bit of Harmony good ?

*** When does this sub ever do "harmony good" circlejerks? I just searched harmony and harry/hermione in the search bar and the last "positive" mention of them was 3 months ago and even then it was a backhanded compliment. Otherwise, the only time it's mentioned is 1) people saying "LF Harmony with [insert requirement]" and 2) "Which ship/shippers do you hate?"

** I admit, I'm not quite understanding the connection - why do lots of prompts make discussion difficult? Not criticising or disagreeing, I just don't understand. Could you explain?

*** if the discussion threads don't garner a lot of upvotes, the discussion is minimal. And the best way for them to gain upvotes is for them to enter hot, where people can see them. Which is difficult when half a dozen prompt posts are clogging the space.

**** I guess not a lot of people sort by New, huh? That might be why I haven't seen this as a problem - I don't ever sort by anything else, hot included. :D

I can see what you mean there then, though - the threads need momentum to get more upvotes and they don't get that momentum or that momentum stops since prompts get more upvoted on the hot sort and discussion threads don't make it there, meaning less people see them and thus less people comment and thus there's less discussion.

Do you really think removing or reducing the prompts would help, though? I mean, the prompts get a lot of interest, clearly, so would removing them make people any more likely to comment in discussions they don't comment in already? If they actually wanted to discuss stuff, surely they'd sort by New or actively go looking for discussion stuff, no?

Again, no criticism or disagreement here, I'm just curious and trying to understand. :)

***** It's very simple. I personally just don't care about the prompt threads. I'm here for the discussion and fic recommendations. Also, you overestimate how many people sort by new and how often.

****** I gathered that much, but I'm asking if you think that removing or reorganising them would actually get you more discussion like you seem to want? Removing something that seems popular probably won't happen, judging by the mods, but reducing or changing them about to get other content more traction might happen.

And I probably do - I'm very new to reddit and I'm still learning the culture. :)
