What are the tropes that you've seen so many times on fanfiction that it just get annoying?


** Absurdly abusive Dursley's. Dumbledore was watching Harry through Mrs. Figg. If Harry showed signs of actual physical abuse, he would have stepped in. Ghe Dursley preferred emotional abuse and neglect. Those are harder to observe outside the home.

Hermione bashing. Hermione is not perfect. She can be bossy and judgemental but she never stops trying to help her friends. On top of that, she's one of the best written characters in the book.

Snape worship. Snape was a petty, vindictive, and shallow man. He never grew out of his schoolyard crush despite her disinterest. As a person, Snape is just awful as nd I don't think he was meant to be anything else. As a character, I like him. He's s good antagonist and red herring for most of the series. In the last book, he's a good tragic hero. However I keep seeing him written as a victim of fate. He may have had a shit life but most of it was his own fault. In my opinion, there was no excuse for bullying children for years and trying to ruin the life of the child of his "life long love" by having him expelled and his wand snapped.

*** Good list!

And it's not just Snape: the whole tendency to whitewash Slytherin is like that as well. I increasingly view Snape as the best argument for abolishing Slytherin and redistributing its students to the three remaining houses. Slytherin took a smart and curious half-Muggle kid whose best friend was a Muggleborn and made him a Death Eater known for inventing brutal murder spells.

**** I'm not sure about abolishing the house but I do agree that it's a very toxic community. I'd be more interested in reform. I will say that Salazar Slytherin was a monster and should not be treated as a positive aspect of the school's history.

*** I will say however, i believe it was implied that the Dursley's physically abused Harry in the fifth book. Something about muggle studies and his O.W.Ls that said “... and a good sense of fun” and Harry thoufur “more like a good sense of when to duck.”

I'm paraphrasing, obviously, but I wanted to say this

**** Vernon also basically tried to choke Harry out in the fifth book when he was caught listening in to the news. I'd argue that while the Dursley's never beat him regularly, Dudley most definitely did beat him up and Vernon most likely dealt out hits as well.

(That's why I think is generally believable when authors describe her trying to hit Harry with whatever object is closest or in her hand.)

***** True, I absolutely agree. The occasional "corporal punishment" or "boyhood tussle" would likely be something anyone raised in a moderately traditionalist pueblood home would ignore though. If Mrs. Figg reported any of that it likely went unremarked.

**** Sure, to you or me but the Wizarding world stopped developing socially around the time of Dickens. I can see that being an acceptable living arrangement to a pureblood wizard. I'm not saying Dumbledore didn't drop the ball but I think he would have stepped in if he'd gotten reports of physical violence.

*** I think there's a disconnect with what we now consider abuse and what was just "raisin em right" in the 90's. Many young writers don't have the perspective of having grown up in a society that considered striking your children a necessity for them to "turn out right", and so they try to build this sort of culture but fail miserably by making the dursleys over the top violent and evil.

** well most of what i hate is already ruling comment section but i want to write some so here it goes

1. super friendly goblins : you know the one where goblins help Harry with all his problems because he showed basic courtesy and remembered a name
2. that super powerful animagus form: like a basilisk and phoenix and a dragon and sometime all of them together
3. that inheritance test: remember when harry get what like 10 trillion galleons and 15 marriage contracts
4. harem: which brings me to this I fucking hate a harem fic, i mean how can you expect girls like Hermione and Fleur or Tonks to coexist with same person in a marriage
5. a good Snape : i have said it before I will say it again, Severus Snape was a Slytherin through and through. That man was loyal to only himself and couldn't care less about anyone who wasn't Lily Evans and to even think he cared about Harry is absurd .
6. That basically another worldly trunk: self explanatory

Well I can go on for ages but I am tired now so I will leave it here but these are only some of those. I guess i have read a little too much of fanfics so....

**** Short reasons: I don't like this spell, I don't like how it is used in fanon, and I don't think it fits with the rest of Harry Potter Magical system.

Long reasons:

- Use /Tempus/, and either light or smoke will comes out your wand to tells you what hours it is. It just sound a lot more like sci fi tha Fantasy magic.
- How the hell can the spell know what hour it is? Does it automatically set itself on Greenwitch? In that case, does the French have to use another spell (Tempus horas Francia?) or can they set the tempus to their own timezone?
- Some fics use it as an alarm clock. Does it mean that I can use a spell on a wand that will only goes of years later? Can I use it for other things? Like can I curse a book so it will only explode 8 hours later and then gives it to someone I don't like?
- If such a convenient spell exist, why the hell does wizard still use clock?

I don't really care that much about it (it's not enough to make me drop a fic like the inheritance test as an example), but I'm a bit annoyed every time I see it.

***** Actually, calculating time based on the location of the sun or moon in the sky would be an incredibly simplistic spell. There's a reason why rudimentary clocks have been around for millenia.

As for why bother with clocks, why does anyone still have clocks in their home, or wristwatches in an age of smart phones? Maybe wizards like the convenience of not needing to find their wand to check the time when they're pigging out on their couch listening to the Wireless.

***** I think it would be bettered a lot by changing the presentation of the spell, away from letters and numbers. For example:

- Cast the spell by tapping your temple. Immediately, anything that is blocking the horizon, the sun and the moon from your vision fades from your eyes, allowing you to see the sun, a line representing the horizon and the moon regardless of your position, the clouds, any building around you, and deduce the time from that.

- The spell condenses into a roman clockface instead of a digital clock.

- The spell conjures an ethereal sundial as well as a small lightsource in the same position as the sun, only scaled down.

- The spell gives you a feeling, but only in relation to other times. So it may tell you "after noon" or "shortly before midnight" or "sunrise", but not any sort of accurate time.

- The spell references your body clock. Bring it out of whack and it becomes somewhat useless.

** I can't stand Weasley bashing.

I can't stand the Slytherin first year politicians, though I don't know if that's because I don't have the brain capacity to understand politics.

Mary Sue Hermione

Humongous apartment sized trunks

Magical animagus Harry

Befriending Hermione before Hogwart. Like, Harry's class suddenly has a new classmate. Guess who it is. Or Harry is rescued from the Dursleys and taken in by the Grangers.

List of all of Harry's vaults and their contents and ancestry, inheritance and properties. I don't mind Lord Potter, I just don't care for reading a 1000 words long list. Even worse if creature inheritance, natural animagus or magic blockers are mentioned.

Harem fics. I am very peculiar about my favourite ships. I want those two, and not a whole lot of women I don't like seeing Harry with.

There is nothing called the silver trio. Probably not the golden trio either.

Harry suddenly being able to talk down Dumbledore and be the arrogant, conceited brat Snape always claims that he is.

**** *Nice!Hermione* is a Hermione who has had a number of her personality traits, particularly her drive, her viciousness, her self-righteousness, and her judgementalism excised. She is passive, naive, defenceless, and a little shy, with no real values or agency. In my experience, she is often found in Dramione, Bellamione, and Krumione fic, as well as in Harmony fic that features a smart/powerful/gray!Harry. Her role in the story is typically to be swept off her feet and/or rescued. Most of the time, though not always, she ends up the male lead's arm candy.

*Whitewashed Slytherins* are a friendly, supportive bunch, who don't actually harbour any blood prejudice, genocidal ideals, or antisocial attitudes, but believe in meritocracy and noble wizarding traditions full of grace, elegance, and mystique, particularly compared to the boorish Gryffindors. Unfortunately, perhaps envious of their general superiority or their mastery of Old Magic, or perhaps tacitly encouraged by Dumbledore himself, the other three Houses---but particularly Gryffindor---despise and persecute the poor Slytherins at every opportunity.
