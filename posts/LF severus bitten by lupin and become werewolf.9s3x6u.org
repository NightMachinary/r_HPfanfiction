  “The scar is small, at least,” Pomfrey says, pulling the bandage snug around the cleaned wound. There's a pity in her voice that makes Severus want to throw up again. “It will be easily covered.”Dumbledore catches him inspecting it, as if mesmerized. “You are lucky to have survived at all,” the Headmaster says.Severus does not say I don't feel very lucky because it is stupid and obvious. Instead, he says unsteadily, “I want to press charges, sir.”Pomfrey stills, tightening the bandage to the point of discomfort.“Remus Lupin would be executed,” Dumbledore says. “The Ministry takes a dim view of werewolves who infect other wizards.”

  Severus Snape escaped from the Shrieking Shack unharmed, but what if he hadn't? Life takes an interesting turn, and hard lessons are learned. "The need for control always comes from someone that has lost it."
