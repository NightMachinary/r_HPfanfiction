In many rich!Harry stories, there are lines like 'The Black estate is worth 15 million G, with income of 1 million per year...' There were like four living blacks left, tops, at the fall of voldie. Shortly afterwards, there was only a widow living alone and Sirius in prison. What kind of insane nonsensical expenses do these authors think the Black estate has?? Aside from 'where is all this even coming from', where was it all going??? Do these people math like JKR or something??

** I'm usually confounded by the idea that goblins would offer interest on gold they can't leverage.

Still, the way most people treat advanced mathematics is a good analogy for how advanced magic is treated in the Potterverse.

"It's really not all that complicated. You just have to recognise that transfiguring something from non-edible to edible doesn't imbue--"

"Blah, blah, blah- Big Deal! Is it going to help me get more butterbeer? No."

*** Interest is a far too modern concept for wizards really. Usury being a crime even might be amusing. However they vaults are basically giant ass safety deposit boxes, and they should just be accruing fines for renting.

JKR started the trend of numbers that make no fucking sense.

**** Exactly. Modern banking (and by "modern", I mean "at least as far back as the Templar banks"), relies on the concept that /money is fungible/. Any given 20 pound note is functionally equivalent to every other 20 pound note in the world, or indeed to any pile of twenty 1 pound coins.

This is what makes it possible for you to deposit money at one location and withdraw it at another.

This is also why interest is a thing. The bank doesn't just put your money in a box and forget about it - it adds it to a big pool of money which the bank can leverage to make additional money. Some small fraction of this additional money is returned to their customers as an incentive to keep the money with the bank rather than withdrawing it all and trying to leverage it yourself.

On the other hand, in times of financial crisis, this can also lead to situations where you ask the bank to give you your own money back, and the bank can say "Err, sorry, we don't actually /have/ your money right now. Maybe check back next month?". This is a problem avoided by the "individual sealed vaults" model of banking.

It wouldn't take too much fanwank to assume Gringotts offers "liquid investment" services in addition to "individual sealed vaults" services, but there is little support for this in canon. The Weasley family also stores their money in the form of a pile of coins, it's just a very small pile.

******* It still doesn't explain stuff like the Weasleys having a galleon and some change in their vault and it being enough, somehow, to actually get shopping done, when you have shenanigans like hitwizards and aurors earning a four-digit sum of galleons per month. It's just broken, really, and while there's not too much wrong with that (the story doesn't centre around money nor is money ever actually important for anything but continuing the joke that the Weasleys are poor), it's something you can't really explain away. The only things you can do are accepting it as-is or remaking it from scratch.

**** Yes I know that and it looks fine in a book set in the US (Alexandra Quick et al). In books set in Scotland/England it grates on me, so when I saw the OP's title I couldn't hold back. There are a couple of other examples, mainly revolving around how kid in the higher or lower age-group classes are described.

It's just a minor itch - most non-British authors do a fantastic job of fixing up those small things and in other books, I appreciate that the hard yakka is being done on the story instead.

** It's not only bad math -- magical Britain can't have an economy which supports such sums -- it's boring. Completely boring.

With magic, you arguably wouldn't need to be super loaded to have a decent lifestyle. You can Transfigure, duplicate, and repair items -- and, according to a comment by Hermione, you can even duplicate food, even if you can't make it out of thin air. You can conjure water. You can build your own house (just look at the Burrow). Those things alone would cut down on expenses immensely, and the more talented you are at them, the better off you would be.

Sure, you'd need ways to acquire materials to alter/duplicate or to use in building (assuming you can't just conjure up wood and stone) but a little money would go a long way. And if you're unscrupulous, you could always get a little "charity" from Muggles too Memory Charmed to know what hit them.

For once, I'd like to see a Lord Potter story where he inherits some ingenuity, then rolls up sleeves to do his best in an almost post-scarcity society ...

*** The society would have to revolve around the desire for luxury goods. Gold is needed for robes/quills/jewels that have a quality that can't easily be transfigured or can be proved to be genuine etc.

That would explain the need for gold and perhaps for the snobbery of the purebloods if looking down on those who don't have luxury items is the driving engine of your economy.

** When I write fic, I fix this via the notion that instead of interest, you'd obviously have /investments/ that make revenue for your vault. Or, alternately, you own businesses that continue to function and give you a share of the profit while using some rest of the profit to pay for the employees and costs. Or your family owns a property or building that you let for rent for a business, etc.

But then again, I quite enjoy reading Lord Potter fics and exploring the governing system of Magical Britain. Powerful!Harry is extremely satisfying to read so long as the fic is actually decent in terms of opposition and emotional/physical/political struggles. (Which is apparently an unpopular opinion? This is my first post to the subreddit)

Edit: This would also be why old families stay rich. They do something/have something unique to offer the market, get revenue, then reinvest or start making /money-making/ operations. And thus they have clout both financially and politically.

** I'm more bothered by errors in time intervals, which affects a broader range of fics.

Examples: You don't start your /sixth/ year after /six/ years of schooling, and there aren't two years between the times that Harry was almost kissed by dementors, despite it happening 'two books ago'.

*** Well, technically, the first time a dementor tried to kiss him was on the train. Assuming that he spent some time with the Durleys before the dementors in 5th book found him (I don't have the book with me right now), there's more or less 22 months between the two incidents, which is close enough to two years to call it such.

It does get worse if the incident from the third year talked about was the one with Quidditch, though, yes; and it gets utterly terrible if it's the end-of-the-year incident that is talked about.
