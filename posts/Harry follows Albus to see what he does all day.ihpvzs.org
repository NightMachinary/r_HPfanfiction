** Would be funny seeing a 11 years-old Harry deciding that the best way of becoming a great wizard is by imitating Dumbledore as much as possible and upon receiving the cloak promptly starting to stalk him so he can get better at “Dumbledoring”... incidentally he learns a lot of personal information about people that he later carelessly drops in the middle of conversation while acting overly familiar and mysterious -it goes as well as you could imagine.

**** "Bloody hell Nicholas, can't I leave you alone for a week? /'the mythopoetic properties of chimera-scales lend themselves easily to the strengthening of potion vials'/, yeah right. Didn't even think of considering the magical density while fiddling about with /magical potions/ inside a flask lined with /magical scales?/" Dumbledore continued ranting quietly while he wrote out a very, very long letter, occasionally referencing one of the books arrayed around him.

Harry did his best to follow, but most of it went over his head, a fact that was not helped by his being hidden in a corner.

***** Dear magazine I noticed you credited the invention of floo powder to 1740 by miles prowler but if you did your research you would have discovered that it was invented in 1620's and that Miles prowler himself in a 1660 Journal that he wrote which I will now qoute from 'while I am often credited as the discovery of floo powder, it was the life work of my mother who spent decades working on the powder and I being the noble son that i am carried on her legacy, while I heavily refute the claim of inventing the powder, I will not deny that I refined and modified it allowing it to be produced much cheaper, I supose if one must credit me as having invented it then perhaps me and my mother should be listed as co creators for my work was merely built on the foundation of hers'
