** The rest of the Wizarding world is exactly what I'm looking for.

** As great as fanfiction is, I wouldn't feel comfortable with anyone other JK Rowling creating stories in the canon universe.

** One thing I'm surprised the author didn't mention (and I didn't see it in my quick glance at the comments) was the fan expansion of the Star Wars universe. I've always felt that that type of fan expansion would be really intriguing in the Harry Potter universe. There are whole aspects of the magical world I'm sure don't interest JKR, but there are plenty of people ready and willing to explore those avenues and take the time to meticulously expand the cannon.

TL;DR: Harry Potter needs its own extended universe.

*** I was just talking about this myself. I think having a means of submitting stories to become canon, like the Star Wars EU offers (offered? I'm not sure how Disney is handling this now) would be amazing.

*** That's what I'm thinking. Allow others to write in the extended universe, but she retains control. That would be amazing.

***** That's fine. For those who want out of canon there's fanfiction. For those who don't there's extended universe. I doubt most of it would be about the people we know.

** Fanfiction.net\\
Harry Potter: 688,000 Stories published\\
Naruto: 364,000 Stories published\\
Twilight: 216,000 Stories published\\
Glee 105,000 Stories published

There are twice as much published harry potter stories than the runer-up

I do think is time for a Harry Potter Expanded Universe
