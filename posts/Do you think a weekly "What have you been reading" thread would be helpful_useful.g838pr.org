Over on the [[/r/wormfanfic][r/wormfanfic]] there is a thread posted every saturday, with people telling what they've (re)read that week and some short thoughts on it.

I know that it's helped me find both very old and very new fics that I'd never otherwise have come across. Thoughts?


** Hi folks! I see a LOT of interest in this. We can set up a trial run of this for the coming month and reassess in June. Look for this post sometime soon!

Update: Automod has been configured to post this. Assuming I did things right, it should post at 8am EST tomorrow morning and repeat weekly. Again, we'll come back and reassess in June. There is a form provided in the post and contest mode will be enabled so all discussed fics will have a time to shine. We will welcome discussion in the comments both of the fics provided and on how the thread itself is functioning. This will be an evolving thread as we iron out what will work in a subreddit as large as ours, so patience and understanding would be appreciated! Cheers!

** Definitely. I'm always reading HP fic so having a place to share it would be nice. I think it could also be really cool if all the ones from the same ship were in a comment thread? Like if the comment was "ship name" and people replied to it with the fics they're reading for that ship. I think it'd make finding fic for specific ships easier, at least on here.

Even if it's not like that I think its a wonderful idea.

*** Yeah, I wouldn't care too much about that. If the fics are good, those comments will get upvoted, the authors will get the attention they need and deserve, and everyone wins.

If the fics are bad, hopefully people will say so, the threads will /not/ be upvoted, and the authors will get criticism they need (whether they can take it is a personal matter), and everyone still wins. Or, at the very least, no one loses.
