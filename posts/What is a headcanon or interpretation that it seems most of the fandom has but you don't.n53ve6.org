** If I have to hear that God awful Snape is am incel theory again I'm gonna cry. Snape was vindictive and cruel to Griffindors not women and was weirdly hung up on his childhood bully, that makes him a bad person but he lacks the entitledness and neediness around women to make him an incel also as I remember nothing in the books even implies he had romantic feelings for lily. Add to this he was apparently socially competent enough to navigate being a mole in a terrorist organisation that was run by a psychopathic mind reader and the theory has no weight.

** Ok you know like if you ever read Marauders fics where they in hogwarts and you get to the Snape and whomping willow incident and Sirius tells Snape the location and everyone gets pissed at him? Or at least 1 Marauder does? Most people i think accept this headcanon. Ya I don't think that happened.

I dont think you can get that to happen and then have like Snape being bullied the way he was in Ootp ( cuz that happens after). You'd be apologetic or hessitant or something but they weren't. The most you get is indifference from Lupin but no one reacts to it so it comes off as status quo not a new shift in his views post wolf incident.

I know it sounds kinda bad but I think they knew what Sirius did and were chill with it but at some point were like wait we can't do this ( or at least James was) and saved Snape. And that's why when Post Azkaban Sirius like hey fuck you you deserved that to Snape Lupins reaction not very negative you think if this was a big deal back then in the group it would get some kinda reaction but nope.

My guess is you know how Snape was following around Marauders so he could get proof of them doing shady shit and/or proof of werewolf Lupin and get them kicked out?

Well that stalking might have gotten really intense and was really getting to them and Sirius is the type to do really dumb shit when he's under stress and the type to lash out physically or verbally when riled up so he was like ya go on go to the whomping willow. And they were like ok yay we dont have to worry bout Snape anymore and then a bit later were like fuck wait no this is gonna be awful. It also makes sense with the Ootp incident because ya maybe they saved him but they still mad about the stalking and now taking out that frustration on Snape.

** Back in the day, there was a lot of talk about how the trio plus Neville, despite all being in Gryffindor, represented the four houses. The commonly accepted distribution is that Hermione was Ravenclaw, Neville was Hufflepuff, Ron was Gryffindor, and Harry was Slytherin.

I only agree with Hermione.

Neville is most definitely the Gryffindor. Bravery isn't being fearless, it is facing and overcoming your fears. Neville literally has to face his greatest fear (Snape) several times a week in class. Yeah, he's not great a potions, but he's still there and still trying.

Ron is the Slytherin. Think about what he saw in the Mirror of Erised. The fact that he has absolutely no motivation to work to make his dreams come true, does not change the fact that he has high ambitions.

Harry is the Hufflepuff. He is loyal even to those who don't show him loyalty in return. There's no other reason for him to keep taking Ron back as a friend, because Ron is a lousy friend. He taught the DA when, at that point, the entire school had turned on him not once, but twice. He remains "Dumbledore's man" even after Dumbledore says he knew Harry would be abused but left him there anyway, and lied to him for years because he "loved him too much" to tell him the truth. He even was loyal to the Dursleys, going to their house even after he was of age and Dumbledore was dead, to give THEM one more year of protection against Death Eaters. And what explains the god-awful name he gave his second son?

** Snape as Draco's godfather. To me, it just doesn't make sense for Lucius and Narcissa (rich pureblood supremacists) to name a poor half-blood as their kid's godfather. Especially when they had (equally rich and pureblooded) family members running around; Bellatrix and Rodolphus make way more sense as godparents for Draco.

​

Not as common, but I still hate it: Luna as a seer. I just want Luna to be a conspiracy theorist that is sometimes right. She can teach her friends that there is still more out there to be discovered- that there is still magic that they don't know. I think it'd be cool if some of her crazy theories/creatures were confirmed later- to everyone's shock- but not all of them. I think making her a seer cheapens her character and all her friendships tbh.
