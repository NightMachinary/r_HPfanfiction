** Its not very long but i always enjoyed linkffn(11576007)

Actually most of their works are nice.

I know a couple other short ones but most are pure lemons and ones more humor verging on crack.

  Pure-blood Culture: Heiress Lavender Brown is a true Seer. She Sees ever so much. Most of all, she Sees Heir Harry Potter as he truly is, which changes everything.

** Right, I went on a HP/LB kick awhile back. Let me dig a couple of favorites up.

I remembered more of these existing.. linkffn(7150923;12728426)

I really liked Blue Eyed Doe. I dig some h/c and that's basically the whole fic. The Garden was.. readable. I remember it being a bit on the pretentious side, though.

*** Blue Eyed Doe bashes basically anyone but Harry and Lavender. It has its moments, but it is not a good fic. Still the best H/Lav though, not that this is saying much.

  Harry, shattered by Ginny's death during the Battle of Hogwarts, retreats from public life, even from almost all contact with the Weasleys. But he is not the only one with scars. Six months later he comes across a witch who may be more damaged than he...

#+begin_quote
  A few years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry's friends have resumed normal lives, but he is drifting, and his relationship with Ginny has stagnated. Hermione may have found a way to restore her parents' memories. She needs some help, so Harry looks up old friends, and becomes reacquainted with Lavender, Parvati, and others. Romance, tears, and a dash of Jane Austen.

  Harry has just defeated Voldemort and needs to make arrangements to bury Remus, the last of his father's friends. To do so he needs money, which means he needs to settle things with Gringotts. Towards that end he requests the assistance of Professor Filius Flitwick, Charms Professor and half-Goblin...and former Mafia Hitman. This is bound to be interesting.
