Looking for a Harry who gets amnesia. Idc what happens after that. Hit me with some good ones.


** Only fic with amnesia in it is linkffn(your my density). Its a time travel harmony fic where they go back to troll incident. Its one the few harmony fics which weren't cringe worthy

There's also linkao3(swung by seraphim) where Lockhart manages to obliviate harry

Edit: there's also one fic where an unregistered potion from Snape wipes out Harry's memory the night of Halloween fourth year... He runs away , is brought back, doesn't remember any1 and thinks his wand is a tricoder. Very humorous fic , sadly I don't remember the name rn

  Kakashi really didn't know what to think when one of his new students acted similar to his old teammate, who passed away years ago.Sakura wasn't sure what to think when she passed by a gray-haired ninja one day and a voice she knew well whispered in her head, “I know him.”Obito was terrified when, years ago, he woke from death to find two parents cooing at their toddling child, and he was looking through the child's eyes.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

** *The Shock of it All* - linkffn(12011689)\\
Harry loses his memories. Luna goes all mad scientist ravenclaw on him. Magic is all about intent, right? Well, she gets him thinking /differently/.

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.
