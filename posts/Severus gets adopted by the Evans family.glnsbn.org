After finding out about his home life Ms and Mrs Evans decides to Adopt Severus but instead of focusing on Lily and Sev it focuses on the dynamic of Petunia and Severus


** The closest to that story line that i have ever seen is a Snape/Harry/Hermione time travel story called Reboot by Kallanit

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
