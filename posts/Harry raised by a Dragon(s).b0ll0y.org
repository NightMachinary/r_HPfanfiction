I'm looking for any fanfic that has Harry raised by Dragons - with the following exceptions:

1) *NO SLASH!!!!!!!!* - seriously, all the ones that I have seen have way too much Harry/Draco or Harry/Charlie

2) I already know about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779853/1/On-Black-Wings][On Black Wings]], it's my fanfic, after all. Go check it out!


** Now I am imagining him being raised by Dragon from worm.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
