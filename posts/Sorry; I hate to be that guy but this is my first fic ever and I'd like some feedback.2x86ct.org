I noticed a while back there's a lack of space-oriented Harry Potter fanfiction, not counting crossovers. When I saw interstellar about a month ago the sci-fi itch became unbearable.

#+begin_quote
  Working as an Unspeakable is the most exciting job Harry can find. Of course, all that changes when he realizes aliens might be invading Earth. This story is somewhat AU during the period of the books, and extremely AU post-DH.
#+end_quote

There are specific concerns I want to know about, but I'm going to spoiler tag them and I'd prefer if you didn't read the spoiler before reading it, so that you're not primed to detect or to not detect those concerns. [[/spoiler][My main concern is that worldbuilding and detail may be bogging it down and making it more dull than it could be. Also, in this first chapter not much is actually going on, so the characters are all passive. Given this and that I think I have a particular writing style, I'm afraid that all the characters seem the same.]]

  But I would change the paragraph where the speaker talks about space agencies, because it looks way too crowded with those abbreviations.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I wasn't sure how to get readers to remember the names of space agencies, but your method of just generally scrapping the official names most of the time would probably be best. I doubt all the government officials that would have been present would know the names of every branch of every other government anyway.

**** I liked all of the initialisms, it felt very real. Governments are full of way too many abbreviations, and all these governments together means a lot of abbreviations! But yeah, continuing to use them would definitely confuse me.

** This is a really good start to what looks like it could be an interesting and original fanfic, something in short supply these days!

The writing does need a little polishing, though. Especially in the last few paragraphs. I think the most important advice I can give you is to remind you of the old writer's maxim show, don't tell. Instead of info-dumping about four agencies on us, and telling us what they think, why not show it? It'd make the agencies easier to keep straight if the head of each agency was a memorable character, who got to express their opinions through dialogue, rather than the author just telling us everything. Also, you've really got a huge amount of stuff squeezed into this chapter: muggles and wizards encountering each other for the first time, wizards experiencing muggle technology, muggles experiencing magic, the UN being notified of an alien invasion, etc. It might be a good idea to expand on all of these things, as I think you've got about 3 or 4 chapters worth of content squeezed into one short chapter. If you expand on this a little, it'll give you the opportunity to create and develop memorable characters, and show the characters we already know and love doing things and reacting to the events around them.

But seriously, what do I know? The only writing I do is nonfiction, so all I can really tell you is what I want to read. And what you've got is good. I'd just like more, please. :-)

*** Thank you. All of this makes sense. I've always been told I rush through the beginning of stories, so it's helpful of you to point that out.

**** I second the idea of giving each agency a memorable character. This looks very promising so far! It's a unique premise as far as I know.

** Not a bad start, but glossing over Harry becoming immune to death with the only consequence being invited to join the unspeakables is extremely off-putting.

If Harry being immortal is central to your plot and isn't simply wish fulfillment then you're going to need a lot more explanation in later chapters. If it isn't, then you should get rid of it now before it kills the suspense and makes any fight pointless. Try finding another way for Harry to be relevant than unexplained supernatural powers.

** I really like the premise! And so far I really like what you've written too!

I know other people are telling you to expand this one chapter in to several chapters, but I really liked the pacing of it. It's probably an overwhelming situation for those involved, so having the reader be a teeny bit overwhelmed with events flying by fits. I also enjoyed your details and world building, though I am a huge fan of authors like Sanderson who excel at world building. I always love details in my fantasy and scifi, especially when it highlights the differences between our reality and the story's.

If you're worried about all of your characters sounding the same, try to differentiate by giving them particular speaking styles. (If you ever played Mass Effect, think of Mordin). Maybe one that speaks very little, in short choppy sentences, and another who loves adjectives, or another who reads like an Asimov scientist. Give them an actual voice in your head and make sure what you write for them fits with their voice.

That sounds like it could be a very useful technique.

I probably won't expand the chapter. The first part could be expanded, but I was thinking of expanding on that later in separate one-shots.

** It takes 8 min and 32 sec for light to reach earth from the sun, so it makes no sense that it would take hours to reach Neptune anywhere in our solar system. Also where is ESA? (European Space Agency) It is arguably the second most advanced space agency in the world, if not the most. Also it is way bigger than the Russians and Chinese.

*** /sigh/. This is what I get for doing research on wikipedia. Any other corrections for me? And perhaps suggestions for reading material that'll cover these kind of basics?

**** Instead of specifying the speed you could simply say "fastest possible speed" then there's no arguing over the exact speed. Same trick can be used for distance or time, this way you don't have guys like me who have an education in stuff like this acting all high and mighty. And for reading material [[http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/public-policy-and-government-affairs/introduction-space/global-space-programs][this]] is a decent place to start, but you should know that that site is biased toward the US and NASA. Otherwise there is this [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_space_exploration][wikipage]] that gives a quick overview of what nations launches what, and the "See Also" is worth checking out. Only thing they miss is that they only say who shoots what rocket and not who makes the payload. NASA and ESA a well known to make rockets together where ESA does the payload like satellites and probes, and NASA makes, launches and control the rocket.

(I'm sorry that I might have come off a bit standoffish, I actually like your fic, and especially how Harry's immortality is simply just accepted xD)
