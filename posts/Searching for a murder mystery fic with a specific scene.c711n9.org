:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I'm looking for a fanfic I read many years ago, but that still pops up in my brain sometimes. I think it was on ff.net but it may well have been ao3.

All I remember is one specific scene: the killer goes into a bar, fingers Blaise Zabini's mom, plants a bomb in her vagina, and detonates once he leaves, killing her instantly.

I just want to remember why/how that happened. It's such a quintessentially bizarre thing to put in a fanfic and I need to go back and relive the experience.

Knowing my taste in middle school, it was probably either a slash fic (mostly likely involving Draco) or a really popular genfic. I'm sorry I don't have much to go on, but maybe someone knows what I'm talking about.


** That's the one in which Harry is a crazy vigilante serial killer and Riddle is trying to catch the murderer: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/][Dreams and Darkness Collide]] linkffn(6996054)

I had a hard time getting through that fic even though it has an interesting premise and plot which I wanted to like. I remember the Ms. Zabini scene was one of the grossest "wtf?" moments of the fic for me. I eventually gave up reading it due to my annoyance at how often the main characters internally monologue about dominance and being "Alpha males".

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
