I love it when people are surprised that a dyed-in-the-wool Gryffindor like Harry manages to be terrifyingly sneaky and underhanded, all for the greater good of course. Usually this is just a one-off thing that doesn't get addressed, or everyone just accepts the information without any reactions. So I'm hoping someone her has a story or two where people actually respond to this, maybe Zabini or one of the Greengrasses or other ‘nice' Slytherins are shocked by this, maybe a redeemed Draco Malfoy learns that he was the sole reason Harry didn't go to Slytherin?


** Cannon Harry was pretty much like that until POA, then Rowling threw it away in exchange of teenage angst

*** Yeah, even with then being children's books, the characterisation of Harry is best in those three books. In book 4 and 5, it's bearable but book 6 is imo, the worst book in terms of individual characters. And the less said about the foolishness in book 7, the better.

*** I actually havent read the originals to their entirety in a while. Ill usually read the first two then the 4th and stop there. 3, 5, 6, and 7 just don't hit as good

Hagrid's words about how not all Slytherins were bad, but every really bad wizard was in Slytherin were just as important.

*** It's been years since I've even seen the books, but I swear when harry was asking the hat not to go to Slytherin he thought something about malfoy.

I'm probably wrong about this though.

***** Alright, I guess you could either go:

“You know, I asked not to go into Slytherin because of you-“

“WHAT?”

“-And something Hagrid said back then.”

Or over the years Hagrid's words pale in comparison to the persistent antagonizing from Draco which causes Harry to remember Draco being the predominant reason for avoiding Slytherin

****** Assuming this is post-PoA, then Harry would know that even Gryffindors can go bad. Actually, if someone had told him about Sirius earlier, then he'd have known then.
