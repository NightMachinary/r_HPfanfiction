I read this today and got this feeling like this fic is going places. linkffn(12575015)

There are a few places that could have used better vocabulary and the use of 'magical oath' is a bit irritating but overall I can give this a 7/10 with 10 being something like 'HP and the boy who lived' and something like 'HP & runestone path' or 'harry crow' being around 2 & 3.

Well, you might not agree but for me it's something better to follow than 'Draft morons' or 'one thread pulled'.


** Does including Daphne in the characters list or summary cause a shit ton of people to follow and favorite a story? Because if so...

*** Maybe, coz Daphne Greengrass is /the OC/ she stands above all the weird OCs and (Merlin help me) SIOCs coz she /is/ mentioned in the original books (if you squint hard enough). Yet the character can be molded to be the omnipotent being of perfection coz there's literary nothing on her save a name and a sister's name in extra to the fact that she's pureblood compared to let's say.... Hermione Granger who should be a bookworm, should be smart, should be a teacher's pet, should be..... well you get the point.

*** It tends to make me to drop a story - I'm pretty much burned out on the character.

**** /What/ character?

She's mentioned once in the books - and that's only her name - plus other sources say she's a Slytherin and has a sister called Astoria who ends up married to Draco. That's it. In other words, in fanfiction she's basically an officially approved OC.

What /does/ get me is when people re-use the "Ice Queen" crap. Whichever author came up with that needs a slap.

** So, do they mean elusive or illusive in the description?

To be truthful the summery is crap and neither illusive nor elusive really apply at all.

  The war is over. Britain is safe and enjoying peace. Why then do the fabled Necromancer's Guild want to meet with Harry Potter? What is going on? And how does the illusive Miss Greengrass come into all of this? TimeTravel! Powerful!Harry, AU, Harry/Daphne.
