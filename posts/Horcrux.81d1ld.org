The Horcrux is described as the wickedest of all dark magics but canonically it doesn't seem so terrible.

There's the murder, of course, but both in the books and in fanfiction we see the death eaters do a majority of the dirty work for Voldemort. Most of the damage of a Horcrux seems to be entirely internalized.

So my question is how do you take this wicked piece of Magic and make it truly the wickedest of all.


** One of my favorite approaches was in Prince of Slytherin.

It's about maintaining a mentality there. That of all human race, you are the only one of worth. Allowing yourself to feel any empathy for anyone instantly results in the loss of the protection.

This ensures that only sociopaths with absolutely no scruples can have an active functioning horcrux.

** You somewhat answered your own question. The horror of the Horcrux isn't in what the consequences to /others/ are, but in the consequences to /you/. Literally the only worse thing on Earth is the Dementor's Kiss. You're /ripping apart your own soul/, the immortal core of your self and mind, and to make it even more awful you're doing it to yourself /willingly/. It's horrible in the way a sect whose members willingly, gleefully poke out their own eyes and cut off their ears would be horrible.

** Rowling has kept the details of the ritual that creates a Horcrux under wraps, but her editor was horrified by it.

It's not the murder that makes it so wicked, it's whatever else is required to mutilate the soul and encase a piece of it in an object.

**** I think the ritual, as applied to a normal, whole, healthy (as it were) soul, would be required, but by the time Voldemort tried to kill Harry he had already done it 5 times. It stands to reason that his soul was in tatters and could be torn apart much more easily, even without the full trappings of whatever ritual is normally required.

It's like trying to break a bundle of twigs in half compared to a single twig. Or removing a piece of rotted wood as opposed to healthy wood.

***** If what you're telling is true, than Riddle should lose a part of his soul every time he cast AK and we know he casted it often.

It's also stated that a murder is a mandatory step. But Voldemort failed to kill Harry. It should have jeopardized the whole ritual.

Also there're deaths of James and Lily just before. Were they a part of ritual too?

****** Well if you look at it this way. From reading the scripts from the book (not the whole book) but just the section in which it happened. Sounds like Lily intervened with Riddle attempting to kill him. By do this, i suppose, she sacrificing herself caused the ultimate shield that reflected the spell back to him which caused not only killing himself but causing his soul to split. Maybe by accidental suicide can cause a Horcrux? Or maybe the combination of the suicide with lily's death caused the soul to split?

  I know that, and you know that, but here is the thing: for convenience, I had Dumbledore say to Harry, 'You were the Horcrux he never meant to make,' but I think, by definition, a Horcrux has to be made intentionally. [...] I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux, but Harry did not become an evil object."

******* Creating a complete Horcrux requires a cold blood murder. With Harry Riddle failed to complete this step, but still Harry became a partial Horcrux with the main property of giving Riddle immortality.

From that I conclude that a murder is not mandatory step. You still can create partial Horcruxes and be immortal without killing anyone :-)

While I respect Rowling and I just can't close my eyes on all inconsistencies in her works and interviews.

******** It doesn't say anything about cold blooded murder. The books just say murder. That's it. And Voldemort does do so. He didn't fail to complete this step, because:

Voldemort did kill James and Lily --- even in cold blood.

It was also said that part of his soul was torn apart and thrown into Harry because his soul was already so unstable, meaning that it wouldn't have happened if he never created a bunch of them, meaning that it does in fact, always, require murder.

** I think it somehow involves pregnancy and fetuses. Look at the story of Bertha Jonkins. She was kidnapped, disappeared, her body was never found, and later Voldemort had the appearance of a baby-like thing.

That ties well into the story that the editor was sick after hearing JKR's original plans for horcruxes, so he forced her to tone it down for the final product.

** I wrote a snippet once where a horcrux was actually its creator's whole soul; instead of anchoring its creator, it anchors a summoned demon or devil so they can't be destroyed or banished.

The evil in it was that as the summoner and horcrux maker (or rather horcrux giver), you'd be consigning yourself to hell or oblivion, in order to protect an agent that exists solely to bring about indiscriminate destruction and corruption, sow pain and suffering, and torture kittens.

** Harry Potter magic is very conceptual. I like to think of the souls in Harry Potter as a manifestation of the “self.” In order to assure himself a means of immortality Voldemort has to willingly and purposefully diminish himself, his own sense of self. Additionally I subscribe to the belief that Voldemort as we see him in the books isn't as dangerous because of this. In his first ruse to power he was described as very charismatic and cunning, characteristics that he definitely possesses less of after he returns to a body after his first Horcrux (the diary) has been destroyed and that part of his soul lost to him.

** I have no idea if this is true or not but I've heard that her original idea was that the ritual required the maker to consume the body of the victim after killing them.

** Maybe, if Voldemort adapted it to be 'safer' to make more - so a smaller fragment of /his/ soul to keep him connected to it, intwined with /a sacrificial soul/ as the actual anchor?

So instead of it being self-mutilation, its soul-stealing mixed in with consigning sacrificial souls to an eternity in heck with the maker? Twisting the souls together to the point where not even death can seperate them, against their will, to keep oneself alive?
