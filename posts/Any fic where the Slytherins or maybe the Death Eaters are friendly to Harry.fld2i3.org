Preferably because Voldemort told them so. I read a lot of fics where Harry joins/ falls in love with/ buddy with Voldemort etc, and when he goes (back) to Hogwarts the Slytherins are friendly to him. As for the second part I read smth where Harry married Voldemort and the Death Eaters became protective of him and that was the best part .


** Not a recommendation, but I always felt like at least some Slytherins should have tried to be friends with Harry. It was commonly believes that Voldemort was dead, Slytherin are all about ambition. And who is the person with the most political clout in their generation? Harry.

I didn't like parts of it for ex. Harry is too emotional for me and its too angsty sometimes but there are great ideas in it so its worth a try but its really long so suit yourself.
