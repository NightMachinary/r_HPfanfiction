Im looking for fics that go into stuff like duelling, competitions in various subjects (something like high school student olympiads), extracurriculars at school that are magical and preferably competitive.


** A few recommendations that Ive already read that would fit this: Linkffn(Hogwarts battle school), a fic where Hogwarts student duel and thats a huge part of their education, with a ranking system. School similar to the one in Ender's game. Linkffn(the chessmaster: black pawn), chess fanfic, Ron travels to tournaments and such. Unlike most chess scenes written, the author seems to play the game. Linkffn(harry potter and the methods of rationality) has team magical battles as a side plot.

** Yes there should be like way more cool magic sports!!! Like final fantasy blitz ball stuff! Like zero gravity magic depulso-ing a ball that changes colors, and when it goes through a colored ring it splits into three and then you have like 20 seconds to score lots of points before it turns back into one. Or something! Make it magical - and not just relying on broomsticks and quidditch variants!!!
