I started reading novels when I was 7. My very first novel was Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets, ironically. I didn't understand jackshit but something about it fascinated me, captivated me. At that point, there was no turning back. I devoured the first book, and I fell in love with reading.

I am 18 now, and when I look back upon my childhood some of my fondest memories were about novels and Harry Potter. I don't know who would I be a as a person today if I hadn't started reading. Certainly different and a lot more poorer in wisdom because of it.

Thank you, Harry, for staying with me through my childhood. You taught me more about love, loss and moving through pain and grief than anyone else could have. Despite everything, you will always hold a special place in my heart. To quote a famously misattributed quote, When I am old and frail, sitting in my rocking chair, I want my grandchildren to come upto me and seeing the Harry Potter book in my hand, ask, "After all this time?".

I will reply, "Always." Every time.

Happy Birthday, Harry Potter. Always and Forever.

P.S.- I would love to hear all of your thoughts about this and how HP affected you.
