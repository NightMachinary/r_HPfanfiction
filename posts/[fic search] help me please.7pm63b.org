I'm looking for a HP/TR fic. It's got time travel. The one thing I do remember is that Grindelwal's forces attack hogsmeade. There's an epic battle. Harry and the older students send the younger years back to school via the tunnel under honeydukes. The battle continues. Harry and Riddle are very impressive.
