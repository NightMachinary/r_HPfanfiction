:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a few things that will hopefully narrow this down but not enough to successfully google.

I am fairly certain there was background Ron/Luna and Snape/OC. I believe over the summer after 5th year Harry meets a war veteran and through him decides to take the war more seriously. When he gets back to Hogwarts he uses the ROR to continue the DA.

I'm positive I originally read it on FFN.

Thank you in advance!

** By chance do you remember if it was a muggle war veteran, squib, or first voldemort war veteran?

Is there anything more you remember about the OC who snape hooks up with?

Any other scene that sticks out to you?

*** I want to say the veteran was a muggle! The OC character was someone that Snape had met at a potion event, possibly American?

I remember that they used the RoR to re-create locations to practice battles in. The room had a lot of involvement in their training. They might of used the idea of magical paint guns?

**** Ok I'll search the fics I've read. The one story I remember them using magical paintball guns with the paint replaced with a potion was a Time travel story but I thought it started them back at 4th year.

The story is called Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk

********* I'm not 100% sure this is the same fic but I remember a scene where Hermione gives Harry a fake spell to transfigure something into crystal (I think it is) and he is able to. McGonagall is there and is surprised because that shouldn't be possible and Hermione explains that she thinks as long as Harry does not know what he is doing is impossible his magic seems to make it happen.

  The war against Riddle has finally ended, and Harry has lost all of those that are most important to him. Fate has a little surprise in store for Harry Potter though, and it plans on helping him along the way.
