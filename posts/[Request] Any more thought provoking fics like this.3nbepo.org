I just finished reading some decently written thought provoking fics. Can someone please recommend me more like these.

Linkffn(10493620) Linkffn(11205544)


** Could we get a rundown on what they were about and what you liked about them?

*** I agree, we need a some more info here. Going by the summaries the two fics seem like they might feature a Harry that is grey, dark, amoral, ruthless or something similar. There are a lot of good fics out there with those qualities.

 

What exactly about the stories was thought provoking to you?

** The linkbot doesn't work unless the letters are lowercase, so do /linkffn/ instead of /Linkffn/. You can also bring up multiple fics by with a single botcall, just seperate them with a semi-colon and no extra spaces.

  Dark times lie ahead for the Wizarding world. Blood will be shed as Harry Potter sets sail in his perilous quest for revenge - by any means necessary. Non-BWL, no canon rehash, dark undertones.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
