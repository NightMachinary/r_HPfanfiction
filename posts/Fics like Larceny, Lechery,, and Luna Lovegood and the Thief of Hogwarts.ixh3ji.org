I loved the early Harry/Hermione "stealing shit" partnership aspect of the former, even though the whole fic went off the rails in a (badly) ridiculous way as it went on (the whole Ron Jeremy thing was cringe-worthy, as was fanon-Luna's involvement).

The latter, having Harry as an amoral but innocent thief, was /fascinating/... but it is long-since abandoned, sadly enough.

Are there any fics like these two out there?


** linkffn(Faery Heroes) is a time-travel fic that also draws very heavily on LLaLL, and happens to be one of my all-time favorites. It does have some significant Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing, but the hilarity of some of the stunts the trio pulls (like full-on Grinching the Notts on Christmas Eve) makes up for that.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

*** The bashing warning really does put me off reading this (bashing is like sugar: good for a craving, but pretty much empty calories), but the temptation of reading the three pulling off some heists is calling to me, heh.

Thanks!

**** Whether the treatment of Dumbledore is even bashing depends on your interpretation of the character, given that it uses exclusively canonical information and events (solely from the books, even) to draw some very ugly conclusions about Dumbledore's actions.

Also, while the bashing of the Weasleys is pretty "meh", it does function in part as a setup for one of the most hilariously evil (and/or evilly hilarious) curses I've seen in fanfiction.

** Heists are the central theme of my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief". Hermione teams up with Fletcher and Sirius while Harry and Ron become Aurors.

** In “A Black Comedy” Harry and Sirius burglarize Death Eaters on multiple occasions. Some readers like it, others think it falls flat.

*** I can see where they're coming from tbf. I enjoyed it, but it does straddle the line between crack and seriousness, and the pacing is pretty janky especially towards the end. Oh and it has “frat boy lifestyle” Harry and Sirius which was an odd choice.

**** Yeah.

I loved the initial concept of L, L, and LG because it had Harry and Hermione of all people just stealing people's shit.
