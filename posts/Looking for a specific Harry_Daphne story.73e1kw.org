Stumbled upon a Harry/Daphne story ages ago. Harry was with the Goblins and had found out the usual manipulation and Lord Potter tropes and was about to leave for the past when Daphnes family were murdered. Think they decided to leave for the past together. Can't remember anything else about the story expect that at the time I thought it was ridiculous, but if I read it again it might be fun.


** It could be "Beginning of a New Life" by rlpj4 on fanfiction.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5163465/1/Beginning-of-a-New-Life]]
