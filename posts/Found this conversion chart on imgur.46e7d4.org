** I have no idea where they came up with those values, but they make no sense. If you go with Rowling's estimate that 1 galleon is roughly equivalent to Â£5 (and assuming that was in 1991, since she didn't specify), 1 galleon would be somewhere around 15 US dollars in 2016.

Of course, if galleons are actually solid gold, her estimate is utterly ridiculous.

**** "1000 kids at Hogwarts" would give us about 35 kids per house in each year; we actually get like...8. So yeah, utterly ridiculous math.

** If I remember correctly, the only good frame of reference we have for money in the wizarding world is how much Harry has to pay for a copy of the Daily Prophet while he's traveling with Hagrid all of the way back in the first book.

If you assume the cost of the Daily Prophet was roughly equal to the cost of the average British paper at the time, you get about 1 galleon to 95 pounds. Round up to 100 pounds for convenience sake.

This actually makes a lot of sense because it means that wands cost around 700-1000 pounds, not 35-50 pounds. It's easy to understand why the Weasleys can't afford a bunch of them under the higher price, but not so much with the lower price.

*** The cost of living is vastly different for muggles and wizards, so it's not that simple.

**** I didn't say it was "simple," just that it's the only reliable frame of reference we have - it's the one and only time that a price is mentioned of something that exists in both worlds. It is thus the only basis on which any sort of currency exchange rate can be estimated.

The fact that it results in prices for other things making sense supports its use.

Finally, we haven't the foggiest idea what the "cost of living" for magicals might be, so we have no idea how "vastly different" it might be from muggles. There's nothing in canon about average salaries, the cost of food, the cost of housing, or anything else.

We know that the Weasleys are poor, poor enough that they can't even afford new wands for at least their youngest, and I believe also their older children (I think Charlie had Ron's first wand before him). Since the wand is the absolutely most important tool any witch of wizard can have, not being able to afford a well-matched wand is seriously bad poverty.

They really don't seem to be so poor that they can't afford the equivalent of 50 pounds, but definitely poor enough that 700-1000 pounds is out of their range.

JKR was bad with math, she admitted it herself. Her "official" currency exchange rate doesn't make much sense and neither does her "official" estimate of the magical population of Britain. Better to use well-reasoned and logical alternatives.

***** We also know that a chocolate bar costs a sickle, so that's a seventeenth of a galleon. A chocolate bar can cost up to two euros so a galleon can only be worth about 35 euros. Unless chocolate manufacturing is just a lot more expensive in the wizarding world for some reason.

******* Maybe since the magical world is comparatively tiny there aren't many sweets vendors so zonkos has a monopoly? So maybe a chocolate bar costs the equivalent of ten euro?
