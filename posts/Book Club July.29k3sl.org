There were multiple requests for it, so this month's fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]]. Only the first book will be official for the book club, but I encourage everyone to read the others as well.


** I preface this by saying that I haven't read the whole series. I'm currently making my way through the second book but I will leave most of my thoughts for the first book only.

I think the one time release and the prose are superb. There were only three or four typos from what I remember, but everything else is very professional. (Aside from enclosing thoughts and asides in parentheses. I think there's a much better way of doing it, but I appreciate the consistency). The world building and detail are excellent and, more importantly, restrained. When information was needed, the author would provide. It wasn't a simple expository dump of "This is how Wizarding America works." I feel that is the strongest aspect of the author's writing. Constructing a believable and constrained world is difficult when you're melding the different cultures of such a large country as well as doing your best to mix wizarding and Muggle affairs.

The author is very much like JKR, believable and necessary world building in combination with characters that are easy to remember. This might be revisionist, but the author is also like JKR in that the story is wider than it is deeper. Perhaps it is a side effect of being the first book in a series. Perhaps the age restrains the author from exploring more mature themes. Regardless, the characters and the setting paint a broad landscape that is very rarely delved into. Anna is Asian and smart. Darla and Angelique are ditzy and dumb. David hates anything that doesn't support ASPEW and other equality issues, real or imagined. I get that they are young children that have to be established but they are memorable because of the repetition of their characteristics, not because of their actions. Very much like JKR, Hermione is bookish, and while she bends and breaks the rules, she is still much the same person at the end. Ron, stubborn and jealous but loyal to a fault, repeats the same character arc in the 4th book that he does in the 7th. I fear that Anna, Darla, the twins, and David will be the same.

I have yet get to Alexandra. I will not rant paragraphs about her. She has her characteristics and I admire the author for sticking to her guns about what Alexandra is. I also acknowledge that sticking true to the character is the mark of a good author who knows what the character is. Yet, yet, yet, is /painfully/ hard to read about a character as obnoxious and unlikable as Alexandra. Headstrong (idiotically so), prideful (at the extent of all others for almost 85% of the first book), and just plain stupid, Alexandra is a difficult character to root for. I don't mind that. Not all characters have to be super!Harry. But it is made doubly hard when Alexandra is the only third person POV we have. With so many of the other characters so one dimensional for the time being, I found myself wishing more harm than good upon Alexandra.

I respect the author's restraint in regards to the plot. It is too easy to get overblown and start by the villain trying world domination. I just didn't find a lot of agency in the plot. For much of it, I was wondering where it was leading to. When I realized what it was circling towards, I found myself unsurprised by the plot twists (both of Alexandra's character discovery as well as the main antagonist). It speaks volume that the writer left enough clues to piece together what would happen, but it didn't GRAB my interest. It's not even until midway through the second book that I found anything to really hold my interest.

Perhaps it is my age. Perhaps it is the eerie resemblance to JKR's style (which I've come to dislike). It is hard to not recommend such a well written work. I come to this, then. Respect the world building. Admire the prose and the consistent plot. It is rare for a plot to be so well planned out. For me, there were things that I couldn't overlook that prevented it from being a favorite work of mine.

It is a troublesome fic to review.

*** I think one of the reasons that Alexandra's behavior stands out as being so horrendous is that Inverity has included a social structure that will consistently reprimand Alexandra for behaving the way that she does. Harry only ever had this in the form of Hermione, one of his two friends, easily ignored. Alexandra has parents who are far more involved than the Dursley's, as well as a Headmistress who won't condone or encourage outrageously dangerous actions like Dumbledore does. While you're right that she's the only third person perspective (with only one exception that I can think of) that we get in this series, we are also constantly viewing her actions through external judgments, and that colors our perception of her character just much as Alexandra's perspective does.

**** True, though I do think that some of her actions, even in isolation, have to be considered incredibly rash. Case in point, her decision towards the end where she follows the crow into the woods.

I hope that as the series grows, the character matures as well. I think Alexandra is very well written. It is because she is written so well that I find her argumentative and stubborn behavior so irritating as I don't have any other characters to latch onto.

** All I'm going to say right now: Finally something worth reading.

*/Edit/*: and just in case:

#+begin_quote
  Not far from the Interstate, but through a fence, a field, a spur of woods, and over a small hill, three children were lying in the tall grass surrounding a sluggish green pond.
#+end_quote

That's not a good start for fanfiction. That's a a fantastic start for everything.

** *My comments will probably be spoilery for the entire series.*

I've just reread the first few chapters, and one thing that immediately jumps out is how quickly and clearly Inverarity defines Alexandra's character. Only five chapters in, and we already have a pretty good idea of the kind of person that she is. I know some people are highly annoyed by Alexandra, but it occurred to me while reading the conversation between Brian and Alex after the Kappa attack, that part of the reason I've never found Alexandra as annoying as I otherwise might is that things never actually go her way. Brian confronts her, rightly, about her being thoughtless and only ever considering what she wants. This behavior would be incredibly obnoxious except for the fact that from the moment she enters the wizarding world the odds are stacked against her, and nothing ever really goes her way. Many of the calamities that befall Alexandra are exasperated by the behaviors Brian complains about. She can't help but to be impulsive. It's who she is. By book four, the world has smacked her around enough that she at least begins consulting with people occasionally, and her abilities grow so that she can deal with far more dangerous situations, but she still doesn't have a mind for long term or unexpected consequences, and it makes for an unpredictable, fascinating story.

*Definite Major Spoilers Ahead!*

The other main point I took from re-reading these few chapters is how complicated this whole situation really is. The meeting between Alexandra, Claudia, and Dean Grimm is one that is eleven years in the making. I've read this book several times before, but this is the first time I've questioned whether or not Claudia was confounded. Now I have to wonder. Was Claudia in a state of shock over the end of her separation from the wizarding world? Did Dean Grimm confound both Claudia and Archie in order to spend time with her niece without interference? Most of all, I feel sorry for Alexandra. From the very second she enters the wizarding world, she is being lied to and manipulated, and even worse the people doing the lying and manipulating have their own valid reasons for doing so. What a complex web Inverarity has woven. Or perhaps I've just spent far too much time thinking about this series.

** Having read all of the stories, I can see why people find Alexandra annoying. I do, however, think that it's an understandable character trait and not really a deal breaker for me.

As for this book in particular, I would have liked to get a little more focus on her becoming/being 'best friends' with Anna. That particular relationship suffers a little bit from telling rather than showing, particularly early on.

**** I agree. It's a similar problem I've seen people have with characters in tv shows. If the character has flaws, people hate them, think they're terribly written, etc etc etc. So many people aren't willing to invest time in something and see a flawed character gradually grow.

That or they go the opposite way and give an overly flawed character WAAAAAAAAY too much leniency and forgive almost anything, usually because they find said character attractive.

**** I think the difference is that the protagonists with character flaws in other fanfics are likeable. A character flaw is great and is a sign of a (usually) competent author, knowing where they want to take the plot and how to develop both the story and the character.

Take [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]]. Harry is quite naive (character flaw) and because of it, someone has died. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza's]] Denarian series is another example. Harry here is rude, selfish, and not a nice person to be around, yet I still rooted for him. These are only a couple of examples but I think you get my point.

The difference between Alexandra and all of these other characters is that we like them despite their flaws. Alexandra... well... I honestly don't like her. She frustrates me to no end. I think Kwan summed up her character very well. She's headstrong, stupidly prideful, and it's a rinse and repeat. I read fan fiction to enjoy myself but I honestly can't because Alexandra is so difficult to root for, I find myself just hoping someone will just slap it out of her.

***** I dunno, for me the protagonist doesn't have to be likeable for the story to be enjoyable. And really, I don't consider Alexandra to be as unlikeable as people make her out to be.

****** Oh I agree that just because a character is (in my humble opinion) bad, it doesn't make for a totally bad story. They are positive things to the story. The prose is outstanding, as well as the depth of the world building. The world which has been created hooks you, while the plot draws you in.

****** Of course, opinions will vary on whether or not you like Alexandra. She will obviously appeal to some personalities more than others. A couple of points though.

*SPOILERS ABOUND*

- Generally, when a character acts stupidly or arrogantly, there is a cost. It would be poor literature otherwise. The cost can come in several different forms. For a majority of the story, Alexandra acts recklessly to the detriment of all others. Yes, she has some good reason to. But don't all actions? It is a testament to the writing that one can even /root/ for Alexandra after all the things she does. Off the top of my head, she endangers Brian's sister by not informing Brian of the dangers within the pond (which she knew). She continually exploits Bran and Poe's servitude for her own gain. She foolishly gets drawn into another stupid dare by Larry in staying in the forest (dragging Anna into it, though to be fair, it is of Anna's own volition). She strays away in Chicago, ignoring everyone's requests despite the numerous precautions and detentions already sent her way. Finally, she breaks into the Registrar's office, putting herself in a position to be incredibly exposed (as well as Anna). Then, without informing anyone else, she follows the crow into the woods.

These are a series of selfish and prideful decisions. How many detentions will it take? What kind of punishment will deter her? How many times will her friends have to put themselves on the line for her own needs? Of course, she doesn't pay the cost at the end of this first story nor should she have to. Now that I've completed the whole story, I can say that Alexandra has paid some of the cost, but I don't think she has balanced what she has done (going after Maludo takes the cake in incredibly moronic decisions) in accordance to her punishment.

*** Agreed. Sure, Alexandra is a total brat and does a lot, /a lot/ of stupid things, but I can totally understand where she is coming from and why she's doing what she's doing. So, I wasn't really that much annoyed by her behaviour and after a while I just came to expect her to fuck shit up and get in a lot of trouble. I have bigger problems understanding why her friends are her friends in the first place, though. There was barely any time for them to become close and then they already feel the repercussions of being associated with there - wouldn't people normally seek as much distance as possible to her?

I did like the books a lot though and was greatly entertained reading them. Can't wait for the next one to be finished!

** The entire series is amazing and a great take on the american wizarding world. The first book however...

I like the story, don't get me wrong, but it's obviously not the writer's best work. She's progressed over time and so has her writing. While that doesn't ruin the book for me, it still makes me cringe at the way the reader is told practically everything and shown only a few things.

The main thing I did like, however, was how Headmistress Grimm was handled. She isn't a perfect character, her motives are secret, and by the end of this story I am still unsure about whether or not I like her.

All in all, it's a great story. A few flaws here and there, but the author herself has progressed to a much better writing.
