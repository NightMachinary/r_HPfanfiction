:END:
I once read a story where Harry travels into another dimension (I'm not sure but I think with Ron and Hermione) and is raised by Sirius and everyone treats him like a kid babying him and not telling him anything about the war. I forgot what the tittle was and I'm dying to find it


** That's pretty vague and could apply to a lot of fanfics - do you remember any specific little detail that could help identify the specific story you're looking for? :)
