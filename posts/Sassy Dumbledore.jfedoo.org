For some reason I really want to read some fics with a cheeky Dumbledore. You know those hilarious comics where Dumbledore is always having a go at everyone and making stupid puns? I want stuff like that, maybe a bit less exaggerated. Definitely nothing serious though, I just want a laugh

Not the most serious of requests but I'd appreciate some suggestions if anyone knows any good fics like this


** Albus and Harry's World Trip: linkffn(13388022)

Harry gets expelled for his heroics in Chamber of Secrets, and Albus never gets re-instated as Headmaster. Dumbledore decides to train Harry personally, and takes the mickey out of pretty much everyone in the process.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

*** This is a very good one. The only way to make it better is if you would include a quote or two, to better attract readers. Because this must be shared.

  "In addition to the forbidden objects, the Forbidden Forest is, shockingly enough, forbidden. This, too, is not a negotiable point. Any student stupid enough to go into the Forest will not be punished, we simply won't go look for you. Considering the nature of the dwellers in the Forest, I will remind the students that they should avoid it unless they are facing their Potions final.

  (...)

  "I have one further announcement to make. This year, the rooms on the east side of the third floor are /forbidden/ to anyone who does not wish to die a truly remarkable death. I realize that in a school of young people, some of you are certain to go exploring because of this warning, but by giving it, I am now covered as far as the board of directors is concerned. I reiterate that the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden and that any student who dies as a result of ignoring this warning will be buried in the usual mass grave in back of the castle reserved for those who have thankfully removed themselves from our society before their idiocy can do too much damage. Thank you. Now, time for bed. Sleep well." Dumbledore bowed and turned, walking out the staff entrance to the hall.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** Second. The Dumbledore in that story is amazing, and the story is good too.

>! "What are you doing in the closet, sir?"!<

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he replied. "Coming out of the closet is often an ordeal...

I really hope it gets finished, it hasn't been updated in a while.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
