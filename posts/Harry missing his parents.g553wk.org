Hi all! I'm looking for pre-Hogwarts or early Hogwarts stories about Harry where there's a strong theme of his parents being gone/missing them.

For whatever reason, I'm a huge fan of the whole concept where main characters are raised with awful guardians and always imagine that someone will come for them, whether that be their parents or another guardian. Thanks!


** There's a short story where Harry writes a letter to his mother/parents. Very sad. It's called Lonely Pup by TurtleJesus.
