Harry is raised by the Dursleys after his parents die at Godric's Hollow. He goes to Hogwarts and gets sorted and befriends everyone from canon. At one point in time, whether that is at the TWT, Chamber of Secrets or another moment I don't mind, he is believed to have died. Everyone mourns for him although actually he lives. He's sent to another universe or reality where he is mentored by someone really OP. He then manages to go back to his original world where he joins the fight against Voldemort, along with all those who thought he was dead. No slash

I know it's quite specific so I don't really mind if it doesn't respect everything, but I just thought it'd be really cool if he had a moment like Thor's entrance in Wakanda during Infinity War where he comes bacjÂ¡k from the dead super OP.


** There was a period a few years ago, where every other fiction was like that... I might have some on my favourites, but I can't remember any right now

** Harry Potter and the Mirror of Maybe.

Except he's only missing for 30min. But then because he lived like a decade in the other dimension he changes his identity and goes missing for real. Similarish.

*** Yep, this one fits great! The author is also re-writing it now to fix some of the spelling, etc. issues that people criticized the first version for. Personally, I think the original is fine as is :)

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

** If I remember correctly, linkffn(No Hurry At All by RobSt) fits this since he goes through the Veil after Sirius.

Edit: Nevermind. He comes back out of the veil at the same moment he went through so nobody knows the difference.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr
