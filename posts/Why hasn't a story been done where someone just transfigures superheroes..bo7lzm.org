We know that you can create living things through transfiguration(desk to pig, button to bug, etc...), and unless your telling me that kids at Hogwarts know advanced Biology, and Chemistry, then the magic of that universe is based off of belief, and intent more than knowledge. Taking them together, and taking into account that this is MAGIC, meaning just about anything is possible, why hasn't someone written a story about Transfiguration masters(or OP MC stories) creating Superman, Green Lantern, Wolverine, etc...

I know people may say that it would be really OP, or something, but it should at least be theoretically possible(unless there's some magic law I don't know). So I guess my first question is is there a story that does this? My second question would be do you personally consider this possible in the HP universe? If not, why not?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Transfiguration changes a thing's physical nature. While magical beings can be transfigured into other magical beings (e.g. wizards into quintapeds), so far as we know you cannot use transfiguration to gift non-magical things with magic.

So a wizard would be no more able to transfigure a Muggle into a superhero than they can transfigure a Muggle into a wizard. Either way you would be trying to grant magical powers to something non-magical.

*** I don't think you understood my question. Just like you can enchant mundane objects, so to should you be able to transfigure an object into something like a Superman. The powers themself are not magical in nature, magic is only the conduit to gifting such. Superman gets his power from the sun, so why can't magic create a being that gets the powers of Superman from the sun, and before you go saying how that isn't possible, may I remind you that this is magic, and going back to my earlier description, unless these 11 year old have perfect understanding of both Biology, and Chemistry, it's both belief, and intent that shapes magic. So you should be able to create a Superman just as easily as you can create a pig.

#+end_quote

Statement 2:

#+begin_quote
  before you go saying how that isn't possible, may I remind you that this is magic
#+end_quote

These are contradictory.

Statement 1 suggests that the powers are physical in nature and you are simply using magic to bring those physical structures into being. In that case the answer is simply that physical structures cannot produce those effects in the HP universe. In the HP universe, non-magical things are as they are in real life. Superman's powers can only be produced by physical structures in a world operating on "DC physics", which does not exist in the HP universe.

Statement 2 suggests that the powers are magical in nature, not physical. You are saying that the physical structures, by magic, produce effects that are contrary to the way normal physical things behave. In that case, the answer is the one I gave above: transfiguration creates physical changes, it doesn't enchant things.

In any event, there is already a canonical magic that you can use to give yourself (most of) the powers of Superman: Re'em blood.

***** You don't work well with logic do you. My second statement was to state that magic makes anything possible, including gifting a table life as a bore. Does that mean the boar is magical. No. The boar was created by magic, but it is not magical in nature. These are not contradictory statements unless taken out of context(like you did). Transfiguration transfigures, that is to create change in something, it doesn't have to be physical, if it does, please show me WOG, or one of the magical laws in HP stating such. Unless you can do that, my theory still hold at least possible. Transfiguration like most magic is based on intent, and belief. If a Transfiguration master wants to make a Superman from a button, there is no reason why he couldn't. That's the beauty of magic, it makes the impossible possible.

This falls within "Statement 1". A boar is a physical thing, therefore transfiguration can create it. Superman is not a possible physical thing except in worlds running on DC physics. Which HP is not.

This is pretty well-established. For your sake:

--------------

Transfiguration is the branch of magic concerned with altering a thing's physical composition and structure - what JK Rowling refers to as an object's “fundamental nature”:

#+begin_quote
  /“Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:/

  /Spell: The generic term for a piece of magic./

  /Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.” (JK Rowling's Old Website: Spell Definitions)/
#+end_quote

Although JK Rowling phrases this as the difference between “Charms” and “Spells”, from the example of “turning a teacup into a rat” she's clearly talking about Transfiguration. A Charm, unlike a Transfiguration, is stated to “not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject”, which means that the reverse holds: Transfiguration does fundamentally alter the properties of the subject.

JK Rowling has been consistent on this. As early as 1998 she stated:

#+begin_quote
  /“With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.” (The Herald, 7 December 1998)/
#+end_quote

The change that Transfiguration makes is a permanent one. We know this from two sources. The first is the pig's tail that Hagrid gave Dudley, which did not go away on its own and had to be surgically removed:

#+begin_quote
  /Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. (GoF Chapter 4)/
#+end_quote

The second is from the legend of Quintapeds in the companion book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them:

#+begin_quote
  /In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and Transfigured each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five-legged creature. [...] The Quintapeds cannot talk and have strenuously resisted every attempt by the Department for the Regulation and Control of magical Creatures to capture a specimen and try to untransfigure it... (Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Quintaped)/
#+end_quote

Now, no one knows if the legend of the Quintapeds' origin is true or not. But the key part is that wizards, including the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, consider the story credible enough that they have attempted Untransfiguration. That means that the story -- including the permanence of the Transfiguration performed -- is within the realm of Transfiguration possibility.

So Transfiguration is not some kind of tactile illusion. It is not that the original object lurks “beneath” a layer of Transfiguration magic. Rather, the object is fundamentally, physically changed into a different object.

The permanence of Transfiguration also makes sense. Since Transfiguration is a physical change, there's no reason for the object to revert to its previous state. Physical objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects in the absence of magic. You would need some new magical intervention to make a further change.

** They should be able to do that! Even in canon Hermione has this validating line of dialogue. "unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself ? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers...."

So it is actually possible to do in canon! But they're uber advanced.
