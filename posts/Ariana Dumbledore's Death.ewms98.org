So, it's canon that Albus, Aberforth, and Gellert faced off and Ariana died and they don't know who killed her. My question is thus - narratively, who would be the best culprit? Not morally, but which would make a better impact on a character's plot or personal development and/or the overall narrative development in general? Also, do you think it'd be better for the culprit to find out or not? Canon story and characters or Fanon story and characters, whatever. I just wanna read some thoughts on the matter, yo.

Also, why did Albus have so many middle names when neither of the younger children had any? Did the Dumbledore family have a middle-name budget that they spent on their eldest or something? :D

Finally, any fics that deal with this situation or mention it in passing or deal with the outcomes?


** On a meta level, JK Rowling probably just thought it was funny to have this list of grand middle names only to end with Brian. Aberforth and Ariana may have equally entertaining middle names, but they have yet to descend from JKR's Twitter feed.

*** There's quite a bit more theorising on the Albus etc etc Dumbledore wiki page about why those names were chosen. Always interesting to see just how far this fandom will take their rampant theorising. Harry Potter fan theories really do breed like rabbits. :)

I'm with you, though. The way he says his name in the courtroom with that lil' pause before Brian strongly implies it was just for laughs.

*** When I first read OotP, I totally wasn't expecting “Brian.” I initially read it as “Brain.”

** I don't know about best but the worst would be Gellert. He is wholly unaffected by it, and the person who is affected the most, Albus wouldn't have to feel any guilt anymore. Rather than a complicated relationship, the story would turn into a simple good guy vs bad guy.

Albus already has heavy guilt not knowing who killed her, I think knowing for sure it was him would destroy him and bring him to his lowest point. If he doesn't die there then the only way left for him to go is up.

Aberforth may be the most complicated. First of all, he is the least likely candidate to be throwing around anything lethal. He seems to have fully blamed Albus so maybe if it was him then.... I don't know what would happen.

I think the best and my personal favorite is Arianna didn't die from any stray spell. She died because the stress caused by the fight made her Obscurus explode out violently. That way, all of them have a shared responsibility but them being human, would put blame on one of themselves.

*** maybe it was not a single spell but multiple spells merging and mixing.

we know the least about aberforth, he might have hated gellert enough to go lethal

*** I mean, he's already pretty cantankerous, so I imagine Aberforth finding out it was him would probably either not change much, or lead to a completely massive change in the style of Greg House.

I do like your suggestion though. It's a nice middle ground between all of them, but it still affects each one and would probably lead to them effecting some personality change or another.

** Of the three in canon, Gellert doesn't care, Albus blames himself, and Aberforth blames Albus and Gellert both.

Narrative wise I think confirmation that Gellert cast the spell could play out where knowing the truth from the start could possibly have pulled Albus out of his self blame. Which could have resulted in him taking a more proactive stance with Grindelwald during the war instead of waiting so long to confront him. I'd imagine those character traits would continue through his life, making him more proactive in politics as well as his headmaster duties.

Confirmation that Albus killed his sister is the least interesting to me. In Albus's mind he was responsible regardless, and knowing the truth wouldn't change much. I would imagine that without the fear of finding out the truth, since he would already know, that he would once again face Gellert sooner during the war, but that overall the result would be a more timid and passive Dumbledore.

Aberforth is the most interesting. He blames Albus for associating with Gellert, he blames Gellert for corrupting his brothers head with nonsense, and he blames them both for his sisters death. I'd imagine that confronting the truth that his spell was the fatal one would be a difficult thing for him, he'd probably blame the other two at first still for creating the situation, and have to deal with the truth later. He might either continue into obscurity at the Hogs Head or make something more of his life in trying to change. It's also possible that in the moment, with Gellert at his side, the burden of his sister gone, and Aberforth to blame, that Dumbledore would have left with Gellert after all, dramatically changing everything.

*** Well firstly, thank you for inspiring me. I'm now planning out a three-thread parallel-universes story exploring this (alongside the literal [And yes, I totally counted] hundred other ideas I've got on the back-burner, so it'll be awhile 'til I start it properly) and it's looking to be a fun write.

I've mostly been trying to work out how to respond to this beyond "Um, yes, wow. Totally agreed, and I like the way you put it." but that really is all I've got.

** I think [[/u/SurbhitSrivastava][u/SurbhitSrivastava]] covered your first question pretty well, but for your second, I've personally always thought he made the names up (or chose some that had meaning to him) to add fuel to his senile, powerful wizard image.

I remember reading a fic where Harry was so feared for his power that the Ministry started imposing restrictions on him. Dumbledore has always been the same for me. The people feared that he'd turn his power on them, and so he portrays a 'grandfather' personality. A mad wizard, firmly rooted in his beliefs. All to make people think he's no danger.

Actually, now that I'm writing it down, it doesn't seem as well thought out as I thought it was. I may have to rethink this one.

**** As far as I remember, yes.

Edit: Yeah, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Percival_Dumbledore][he]] was called Percival ([[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Percival][useless information about the name, because I feel like putting it in!]]).

** I would say that it was Dumbledore and Grindelwald's faults, Ariana would have probably been scared to see her big brother and a friend fight so much, that Ariana would have ran in the middle of the fight when Grindelwald and Dumbledore fired a spell at each other, making the impact of the spell worse, killing Ariana.
