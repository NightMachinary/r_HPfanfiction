** The only one I can think of off the top of my head has Harry go on a rant against Islam, but even then that version of Harry is more or less a complete misanthrope, and he hates them specifically over ideological reasons(he thinks religion in general is evil), not racial ones.

I've seen sexism pop up in fanfics too, but to be entirely honest, while I have seen some content that people might consider racist on the part of the /author/, the closest I've seen to racism in the characters beyond blood beliefs is the example above.

** Think I've seen Malfoy use slurs against Asians and Indians before but normally they specifically Merton it isn't a thing. I think I've rad a fic where they said macusa had racial tensions. Also there's a pretty good chance Salazar was a moor or Arab or something.

** The UK doesn't have the same problems with skin color as the USA, does it? Seems more like cultural bigotry, like against immigrants and such.

But what the hell do I know, I don't live there ðŸ˜‚
