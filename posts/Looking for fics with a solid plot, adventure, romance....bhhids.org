:END:
so I'm reasonably "new" to fanfics in a sense, I read a lot of fics back in the OTP/HBP days, but I've only recently gotten back into reading fics since about the new year and I'm looking for some recommendations =) I've already delved through a fair few "top fic" lists and some of my favs have been (in no particular order):

1. Harry Crow by robst
2. Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin - one of the only WIP fics I'm actually following
3. Harry Potter and the Darkness Before the Dawn (and the rest of madscientist's fics)
4. What Happened Next? by fawkesthephoenix
5. Heart and Soul by Sillimaure
6. Blindness by AngelaStarCat
7. A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool

I'm rather partial to non-canon pairings, and in general stories with at least a reasonably strong romance thread that doesn't devolve into nothing but PWP (M/X rated scenes are fine, but if I want nothing but smut, that seems to be easier to find lol)

​

not particularly partial to slash pairings, time travel (not to say that it can't be good, but I find rather often just... isn't), adult/minor pairings (at least not ones with a massive age difference like SS/HG, I've read quite a few really good Harry/Tonks fics), and I've never been a big fan of DM/HG outside of a nearly complete re-write of the canon story, I just can't picture someone dating their schoolyard bully outside of some weird stockholm syndrome type situation... not as obtrusive or distracting if it's more of a background pairing, but not something that I actively seek out.

​

please no abandoned or rarely updated fics (if it hasn't been updated in 2019 and is still a WIP.... I'd rather not), and I prefer not one-shots or super short stuff


** Based on your preference, you should like following fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travel to 1975, teams up with Bellatrix

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Still canon pairing, but you will find a very different Slytherin Harry and Slytherin Ginny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): The real war begins after Voldemort's fall. Harry, Hermione, and Ron again lead them to victory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): One of the better Harry/Multi fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After Voldemort's fall, Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot.

*** I've actually read The Accidental Bond, I can definitely agree that it's one of the better harry/multi fics that I've read, most of the harry/multi fics I've read end up getting weird quick, but that one was certainly a step up from a lot of the rest :P I'll definitely have to dive in =D I think I might start with Hail Odysseus, I'm not against canon pairings exactly, it's more like I have a preference to "something different" and a slytherin H/G pairing could be a lot more interesting than the canon pairing with the semi-worship she has for him (I still think that at least in the books, she's more in love with the idea of "the-boy-who-lived" than Harry, at least minimum up until OTP)

**** My view on the Canon pairings changed as I got older. I see Harry as having 3 possible interests from the books. Hermione could have been one if he didn't see her as a sister, Luna could have been one, and Ginny was one. Everyone else like Cho, Fleur are inconsequential. Ginny's character flaw is lack of characterization and an interest in love potions at the beginning of Half-Blood Prince (despite bashing fics, she definitely didn't use it in canon. Also, selling date-rape drugs is not cool Rowling.) Luna Lovegood, if you go by the fact Remus Lupin is the most blatant and unlucky name for a werewolf, was actually taken on a date, is loyal, and somewhat quirky. I feel there was some compatibility. Hermione was fiercely loyal. She stays with Harry through everything. She will maim to protect him. But she also was a nag, and slightly dismissive. Ron and Hermione wouldn't work because of the nature of the couple. Neither is at fault, and for all the ron bashing fics, in Canon only Hermione resorted to violence in that couple (the birds).

***** I think those are the 3 pairings that make sense with the least deviation from canon - but I could also see a few changes making Fleur or one of the background characters we don't know much about be the pairing without much difference.

I do pretty much treat the Harry/Hermione couple as pseudo canon though, it's not really even an AU to me haha.

My biggest character flaw for Ginny is she's basically two characters - Year 1/2 and 5+, but by the nature of how I read the books she's basically stuck (for me) as that young girl with a crush on Harry who got possessed by the diary, and not much else.

****** I can agree with both of your opinions there, I definitely think that the only pairings for Harry that make any particular sense in canon are Luna Hermione and Ginny.

Luna is actually probably my favourite one to imagine, I think her quirkiness would balance out some of his kinda angsty-ness , she has that talent for awkward truth with a logic behind it that you can't even argue because you know how deeply true her observations are.... I know they never discussed it but I always kinda thought she has more than a touch of Seer in her with her uncanny ability to read people like a book. And of course both of them have that stunningly fierce loyalty to their very small close-knit group of friends.

Hermione I also feel like her personality just matches Harry's very well I think that for all the same reasons they have such a solid friendship, they would work very well as a relationship, though I do firmly believe if they ever got together during their school years that Ron's friendship with them would be.... unlikely to survive his jealousy, particularly at any point after the Yule Ball 4th year, and especially so if it happened after he left them on the Horcrux hunt and before they all got back together, there's a reason the Locket showed him Hermione leaving him for Harry... but their friendship as the "/Golden Trio"/ aside, she's definitely his closest female friend bar none. She might have been a bit of a nag, but, for the most part, she was really only a nag about things she felt were really important, their only real legitimate fight in canon was over the Firebolt, and even then, she had a very, very, */very/*, strong argument for being suspicious of it, and most of the rest of her nagging was because they were ignoring their schoolwork, which is a pretty fair thing for her to nag them on really as far as those kinda of topics are concerned really, since ya know, they are still kind of in school lol.

Ginny on the other hand, like you both pointed out, really doesn't have much character development and is 2 completely different people between the starstruck child, and the fiery young woman that joins the DA, (I can definitely agree with jakky567 there with the love potion thing.... a little too date-rapey for my taste in kid's books... particularly after seeing the spectacular effect of Romilda Vane's attempt on Harry, which though not explicitly mentioned as being one of Fred and George's..... the fact that it happens /after/ WWW is up and running leads me to believe that's where she got it...) but yeah for me she always kinda stayed "stuck" in that image of the little girl infatuated with the idea of the "boy-who-lived" than Harry

** Right. So, based on what you mentioned, here's some of my favorites. List is pretty much in order of most recently updated to oldest, because that's how my favorites list is arranged on ffn. Behold!

- /Vitam Paramus/ by TheEndless7. Pretty much the only good Harry/Gabrielle ever written. Very much a character driven fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus]])

- /The Pureblood Princess/ by TheEndless7. Good Harry/Daphne in 6th year. From Daphne's PoV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess]])

- /Letters/ by TheEndless7 (perhaps you're noticing a pattern with this author...). Harry/Fleur in 4th year surrounding the Tournament. The author thinks it's his worst fic, but it's also his most popular. Go figure. I think the real gem herein is how he portrays Daphne. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]])

- /A Question of When/ by vlad the inhaler. I know you said that one-shots were not your preference, but this one is too good to not recommend. Besides, it's the only good Harry/Romilda I've ever come across. It's /very/ good. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

- /Contractual Invalidation/ by R-dude. Excellent Harry/Daphne post-Hogwarts. Harry uses his brains for once. It's also the only good use of a marriage contract that I've seen in a long time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation]])

- /Patron/ by Starfox5. Very good world-building and a good plot. I think this is the best fic that the author has written. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation]])

- /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by Less Wrong. This is a /very/ divisive story in the fan fiction community (and that's putting it rather mildly). People either love it or hate it. Some people really just take issue with how the author approached a few things. But if that doesn't stick out as a problem for you, then you'll probably love it. That said, the fic has had a huge impact on fan fiction in general, so it's worth giving it a shot for that much alone. And with over 34,000 reviews, it's probably the most popular fan fic ever written. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]])

- /Seventh Horcrux/ by Emerald Ashes. Probably the funniest fic ever written IMHO. Gets rec'd around here a lot for good reason. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]])

- /Coming Back Late/ by alchymie. Technically it's probably incomplete and abandoned at this point, but the author got enough finished so that it has a proper climax and most of a conclusion. Probably one of the best fics out there, so long as you don't mind Harry/Hermione. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- /Stages of Hope/ by kayly silverstorm. Rather unique AU. No pairings though. And rather dark. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]])

- /Hocus Pocus Adele Polkiss/ by Ecmm. Watch as Harry grows up with the little sister of Piers Polkiss hanging off him and falling in love with him. It's a wonderful, short fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss]])

- /The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks/ by Paimpoint. Whatever did happen to the Perks girl that was mentioned once and then never again? Excellent mystery fic. No real romance though - Maybe some HHr if you squint really hard. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]])

- /Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time/ by joe6991. Time travel with a hell of a twist. Harry's stuck in a time loop until he can finally defeat Voldie. He's gone through this thousands of times, and he still can't beat him. Harry's lost quite a bit along the way - mostly his sanity. Harry/Fleur. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]])

- /Time is the Fire/ by Oddment Tweak. The most epic Harry/Hermione fic ever written. Time travel and Master of Death done right. One of my all-time favorites. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- /Resistance/ by lorien829. Starts at the Battle of Hogwarts where the good guys proceed to lose rather badly. From Hermione's PoV. Harry/Hermione. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ by Angry Hermione. Excellent older fic, written before DH. Might be the only good soul bond I've ever read. Also has some rather interesting original ideas about magic. Harry/Hermione. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- /Eighth/ by lorien829. Really, if you like Harry/Hermione, just read everything this author has written. It's the good stuff. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2607390/1/Eighth]])

- And finally, since I'm not above blatant self-promotion, I'll add my humble little fic to the list. It's not nearly as good as the stuff I've already mentioned, but I'm going to put it here anyways because I can! linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]])

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
