Does anybody know any stories where harry is a criminal instead of the hero? I would love to see a good story where at the end of the war harry decides to join the wrong side of the law and do criminal stuff. I've read a few where before Hogwarts hes in juvie or part of a crime gang or mafia or living on the streets


** as in he's a criminal and we like it or he is a bad guy?

There's one where he's moriarty which is amusing
