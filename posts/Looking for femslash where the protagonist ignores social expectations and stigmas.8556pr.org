Are there any decent fem!Harry, Hermione or other "strong" women femslash stories where there's a stigma on lesbian relationships but the protagonists don't care? I know that coming out can be a difficult thing IRL, but we are talking about characters that have endured far greater hardships here. So instead of

#+begin_quote
  "I love you, but let's try to hide our relationship so the next twenty chapters are filled with a shitton of angst"
#+end_quote

how about something like

#+begin_quote
  "I killed a basilisk when I was twelve! With a bloody sword! What's the worst they can do, look disapproving? Try to bully you? If they try anything I'll show them why I bitchslapped Voldemort half a dozen times and still live. If they try to hurt you, I can always introduce them to the aforementioned sword."
#+end_quote

I expect cracky results, but if anyone has something serious I'll gladly take that as well.


** linkffa(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path by wordhammer) - there is angst, but mostly it's justified. Of course, I may be biased.

*** As a big fan of this story, I'd like to second this. So many great and memorable moments.

Fair warning to OP, Holly isn't strictly a lesbian, but she is strictly a badass.

  Girl!Harry walks a bizarre version of Harry's life at Hogwarts, until she makes her own Mark. Darker!Everyone. Rated for language, violence, sexuality, bio-squickiness and questionable taste.

** If tardisisthewaytotravel finishes linkao3(trials and tribulations of a ninetailed fox) it'll probably be this. Fem Harry is feral and doesn't care about anyone's opinion except Hermione's, it's been rubbing off on Hermione.

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]

*** The only thing remotely fitting my request that I can think of is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/1/The-Silent-World-of-Cassandra-Evans]]). Pure crack with a rather dark start, a well done "Hermione does something wrong but they make up eventually" arc (those are really rare without mayor bashing), a subversion of like 50 tropes and a nice Harry gets her own minions/charges arcs.
