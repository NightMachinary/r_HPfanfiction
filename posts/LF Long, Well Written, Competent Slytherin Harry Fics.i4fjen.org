Slytherin Harry is probably my favourite thing to read out of the entire fandom. My problem is that I've read most of the best ones, I would think. As of late, I've decided I'm going to find more of it to read, but it is proving to be quite the task.

I want a Slytherin Harry story where he is competent. He does not have to be super powerful or anything of the sort. He can start ignorant and wide eyed, that is fine. But I don't want it to take until book/year 5 before he figures everything out and starts being a character that does not elicit frequent facepalms from the reader.

I'm really not bothered about pairings, just no slash and no multi please.

Here are some of the fics that get recommended a lot on here that I've either read, or attempted to read and then dropped (not listing all of them because we'd be here all day, just the ones that I see come up a lot):

linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) They Shook Hands Series by Dethryl (I don't remember how he formatted the title exactly with the new version, so somebody should link that one if they can, since it is a very well done series) linkffn(Harry Potter and the slytherin selection) series. linkffn(travel secrets first( linkffn(on the way to greatness) linkffn(antithesis) linkffn(Harry Potter and the homecoming) And Sarcasm and Slytherin on AO3.

I'm definitely leaving a fair few out, but I think that list is long enough. For those looking for fics like me, those ones all come up a lot. Some of them I love, some of them are not for me, but those seem to be this Reddit's favourites.

If somebody could recommend something good that's not on that list and matches my request, that would be splendid!

Bonus points for lengthy fics!

Cheers

** Subversion, my favorite Slytherin Harry fic, is a WBWL centering on the mind arts. It's dormant around 75,000 words, so not very long, but the writing and premise are excellent.

Have you read either Victoria Potter or The Pureblood Pretense? They're both fem!Harry, don't know if that's an issue for you. VP is one of the best-executed and creative fics in the fandom, although personally it feels restrained, somewhat to a fault. It's not a snark fic and doesn't try to be.

Pureblood Pretense is just a great epic story, with a somewhat OOC protagonist but really great worldbuilding and expansion of canon. It's more in line tone-wise with some of the fics you've suggested above. VP is in the middle of second year at 170,000 words or so, Pretense is in the middle of fourth year, but is over 1.5 million words.

Those are the three I'd wholeheartedly recommend. There is also To Be a Slytherin, which is a WBWL-ish fic about Harry's twin sister sorted into Slytherin. It's rather long-winded and has a romance with Malfoy, which isn't everyone's cup of tea.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

**** I have a hardtime with Victoria Potter. Its enjoyable but it is soooo slowly updated its hard to follow. In approaching 3 years there's been 24 chapters. I totally get life gets busy and such, but the author posts a lot here I've noticed and often talks about their story and will recommend it. It's always brought up in this category.

Again, I enjoy it, but with the incredibly slow updates despite constantly seeing the author here talk about it and everyone else, and not much has been written yet I just can't get excited about it.

Maybe when its complete or at least year 1 is I can read it all together and anticipate year 2. But its been too one to be so early on, I'd rather be recommended stories that are complete, or have far more written or are updated more regularly.

****** Oops sorry that's what I meant. That's what I mean how it seems like it's still towards the beginning after all this time, I have to keep rereading it when there's an update because its been so long and it just seems like its in an earlier spot than it is. Like I said I like it but the super slow posting compared to seemingly every couple days seeing people recommend it or the author talk about it, makes it seem even slower if that makes sense. Thank you!

***** The slow updates are because it's peer-reviewed through DLP. Whole chapters and scenes have been rewritten because of feedback. I think the writing process is in general four or five chapters ahead of what's published, with two chapters in advance being workshopped on DLP.

This isn't unique - many of the really good fics around, like Pureblood Pretense and Alexandra Quick - also have an editing process. Inverarity somewhat solves this for AQ by writing and editing the whole book in advance of its release, but the really, really good fics generally have slow update speeds.

If you want really good stuff that updates really fast, read Notus Oren or Cerulean or Wildbow or something, but beyond that most serial fiction has an inverse relationship between quality and update speed.

** There's one by EclipseWing where James comes back to life (was never really dead) and has to reconcile himself with both 1. missing years of his son's life and 2. his son being a Slytherin.

It's not what you may assume from that description at all. James's resurrection is a tad bit contrived, but the writing is phenomenal, the characterization very close to canon, and it's driven more by an emotional journey than a plot one. It also only covers one year so it's complete and leaves the rest of it for the readers to imagine, because that's not really what the story is about. The story is about parenthood and a father-son bond, and it's honestly brilliant for what it is.
