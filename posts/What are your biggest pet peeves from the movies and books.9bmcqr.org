** It's such a petty thing, but my biggest pet peeve is probably the movie "robes". I /hate/ the school uniforms and the idea of people wearing normal, muggle clothing under their robes (which they always take off once they get home), but it's pretty much the only version of wizarding clothing I see in fics.

Its just so completely inconsistent with the books and the way wizarding society is set up (and it completely defeats the point of those great scenes at the Quidditch World Cup, and also Snape's Worst Memory) if you have purebloods going around in what amounts to modern business suits under a weird overcoat.

*** Yes! I always feel petty complaining about it because the movies have so many other issues, but it really irritates me. Especially because it undercuts the degree to which pure-blooded wizards have cut themselves off from muggle society - remember how badly everyone was dressed at the Quidditch World Cup? It doesn't make sense if robes are just an alternative to a jacket. ([[http://thesanityclause.tumblr.com/post/132847489998/based-on-that-post-on-the-hogwarts-uniforms-i-was][This]] is how I've taken to imagining the Hogwarts uniform.)

*** Yes. The Robes are a very good Point, but to be Fair: Atleast the First Movie showed, how the Magical Community should be clothed (as the Diagon Alley is shown). Just McGonagal is the only Witch, that keeps her Robes AND the Witchhat constantly over the Movie-course.

Personally, i dont see their "Formally" clothings as any annoyance, although it is described in the Book, that atleast Harrys wears his Civil/Muggle clothings and this may suggest that any others will do to. The only "Schooluniform" are the Hogwarts Robes. While in the The first Movies they are wearing Jumper, shirt and tie....yes, a tie might look a bit to "high Society", but im not annoyed by it. The annoyance starts in Movie 3, where the Actors occasionally wear either Civil or school Uniforms and even then, they dont always even the Robes.

The Worst Outcome is in Movie 5, where the whole Pupils seemed to have decided that Robes are "uncool" or something like that and just wear their Formal attire...and the "Formally" is even more underlined, by the Lack of the Robes.

** The wand movement thing isn't really a movie thing. In the books, wand movements seem to be easily dispensed with. I suspect it's like non-verbal incantations: when you get good with a spell, you can "internalise" the wand movements just like you can internalise the incantation. Because whenever we see adults casting magic, they generally do so with a single flick, jab, etc not proper wand movements.

Unlike you I do prefer it this way - it makes magic more cerebral, more about your knowledge/understanding. Also magic would be very slow to cast if you had to use wand movements.

As for why to vary your spells, there's an easy reason for that: because HP wizards don't get tired out from using magic, there's no point in spamming the same spell against an opponent. If they can block that spell once, they can block it indefinitely. In such a situation, you're going to have to switch to a different spell until you find one they can't defend against. It's not about using the "most destructive" spells, because it doesn't really matter what happens to your opponent once your spell makes contact. Whatever spell you hit them with is going to be enough to win the duel, whether it's a stunning spell, disarming charm, reductor curse, or whatever else. So the key is to be able to hit them with a spell in the first place.

The one exception is the Killing Curse, which due to it being unblockable by magic is the ultimate finishing spell. But you still have to manoeuvre your opponent into a position where a hit is guaranteed. This is how Voldemort duels against Dumbledore: he uses Charms and Transfiguration to keep his opponent occupied, manoeuvres, then tries a finishing Killing Curse.

*** urgh, Wand Movements. It is a "nice Detail", but i wouldnt classify it a necessary to perform a Spell, although its stated right in the First Book, that it need to be done correctly for the Spell to Work. I sucesfully blend this "detail" out, when the Progress continued. It makes the perfomance more complex, but in my Opinion: the correct incantation and the Magical Knowledge combined with the own Magical Potential should be enough to perform a Spell AND give it a possible better Strenght. With the Elder Wand, any Amateur can become a Master.

** I don't care about Movies since they are basically another form of fanfiction by the screenwriter Steve Kloves, who worked hard to ship Harry/Hermione and bash Ron and Ginny. Sometimes I think even robst did better than him!

The Books have lots of consistency issues and tropes associated with being a children's series. For example:

- The Potters can't be their own Secret Keeper, But Weasleys can.
- Tom Riddle could bypass the Trace by using his uncle's wand, whereas it would ALWAYS get Harry.
- Many magical devices are created to advance the plot, and thus exactly once.
- Dumbledore flying on a broomstick to the Ministry in PS.
- A thirteen years old solved the plot in an entry level creature book in CoS, whereas the supposedly very experienced and wise professors were running around like headless chickens.
- Moody impersonation plot was stupid, and made Dumbledore even more stupid.
- Dumbledore's behaviors in HBP were criminally negligent, and Hermione was a stupid bint in that book.
- In DH, Harry's win was based on too much luck and Deus Ex Machina. I hate the “lucky hero” trope.
- In the Final Battle, they got Greyback down, but refrained from putting that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business. We see him getting up later, ready to mutilate, torture, and murder again. I hate the “good guys don't kill” trope.

*** Just a point, Tom Riddle was never trying to avoid the trace by taking Morfin's wand. He was simply trying to incriminate him further (as his wand has cast the killing curse).

Tom Riddle avoided the trace because he was in a village that a wizard occupied and therefore could not be detected-at least according to Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  “You are quite right --- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by ---”

  “Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?”

  “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls.”

My headcanon is that Dumbledore simply improved the Fidelius Charm after the Potters.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't think he bypassed the Trace by the wand, but rather because the Ministry knew there was already a normal wizard there. This is why the Weasleys could totally do underage magic at their home without being detected. He just used his uncle's wand to frame his uncle.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore flying on a broomstick to the Ministry in PS.
#+end_quote

I like to pretend Dumbledore was just being a jackass. He could totally arrive quickly, but is rather taking his time just to fuck with the Ministry.

#+end_quote

Yeah, this is my biggest problem with CoS. I like the book a lot, so my headcanon is that there's never been a documented case of a basilisk Petrifying someone. So while the idea of a basilisk certainly entered into people's minds, they dismissed it because basilisks always kill.

No counter-arguments there. Especially for Hermione. She got annoying in the last 2 books. A lot of things got kind of annoying in the last 2 books.

I agree with everything you said I picked dueling because other than the good guys don't kill it's the only thing that happens enough to be a pet peeve imo. Yeah all of those things are pretty stupid but like it's not a continuous problem that's always coming back up.

*** Some of these aren't really issues:

-The Weasleys weren't their own Keepers. Bill was the SK for his parents property, and Arthur was the SK for Shell Cottage.

-The Riddle thing makes sense. The Trace is ignored if there are known wizards nearby.

The rest seem correct though.

**** Bill states he's the secret keeper in text. But I have a theory, obviously not stated in text, is that although you can be your own secret keeper the secret keeper must go outside the home at various points to maintain the secret. This was fine for the Weasley's but the Potter's would likely have been killed quickly. Bill does go outside the home at least. Notably it's convenient to be the secret keeper of your own home, if you have visitors visiting.

But since it was never stated in canon it doesn't amount to much obviously.

Dumbledore himself indicates that it was never the wand that hid Tom Riddle's magic.

******* I see your point, but the Secret-Keeper isn't able to give the Secret out if they're Imperiused, or under Veritaserum, or apparently even under torture. They have to give it up completely voluntarily. So I don't think it makes that much difference where they are.

I dunno. The way I see it, you can't really do much if you Fidelius yourself and never go out, you know? You can hide permanently, sure, but if you're someone like Voldemort, you're going to need to risk something anyway to accomplish your goals. A person in hiding 24/7 won't win a war.

​

wasnt the Point that the Potters were willingly give their Protection to "Outsiders, who they trust"? They actually wanted Sirius to became the SK, but Sirius convinced them to use Peter instead, because a Weakling like him would attract any interest and Harm like Sirius. A Legit Point, but also a Dangerous one as Weak Personalities are betray you very quickly.

​

​

> A thirteen years old solved the plot in an entry level creature book in CoS, whereas the supposedly very experienced and wise professors were running around like headless chickens.

​

Well, you mentioned it yourself: Its a Childbook series. Although i have to admit, that this Teacher Behavior is ridiculous...and the only Purpose for this is to lighten up the Mood with humour in a Dark Passage of a Childbook.

​

> Moody impersonation plot was stupid, and made Dumbledore even more stupid.

​

Many seems to think that and i honestly dont know, how i should see it. Dumbledore mentions in Year 5, that he can do Legilimens (atleast to a Degree, that he can detect, when someone is lying to him). I think, we can assume that Dumbledore isnt flawless. If you can imitate your Best Friend perfectly, not even you would notice any difference. And Dumbledore even claimed that his plan wasnt Flawless in Book 5 as he acted exactly like Voldemort would have been expecting it.

​

No comments on HBP, the whole ignorance is just for the Story sake. They acted stupid, because it needed to be done to keep the Plot for the Finale.
