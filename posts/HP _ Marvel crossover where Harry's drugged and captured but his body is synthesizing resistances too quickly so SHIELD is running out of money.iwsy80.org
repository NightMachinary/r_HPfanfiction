:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think they discover him when the Hulk goes on a rampage and this one area of New York is surprisingly undamaged. I also remember a moment when some of Harry's magic fails against Thor, but a Crucio takes him down, then they capture him and keep him drugged so he can't apparate away. But keeping him captured turns out to be financially unsustainable so Fury makes the call to allow him to wake up to talk to him.


** so long as Harry's not like "So you attacked me and drugged me cause i'm deifferent? OK let's be besties!", i'd love to read it. Hope someone finds it

** Found it! It was linkffn(8275548)

I don't really read slash so I ended up skipping over this in search results a couple of times. I'm rereading it now and I don't remember it being a romance story at all...

EDIT: I just reread it and this story never got to any romance before it got abandoned. I'd say it's pretty much 9 fun chapters of SHIELD trying to capture Harry at all costs

  One day, Harry J Potter made a wish in front of the mirror of Erised. One day, Bruce Banner woke up naked in a green-eyed man's aparment. One day, Harry introduced himself with his father's name to a strange man he found naked, green, and angry on the street. One day, SHIELD discovered human magic... and tried to make weapons from it. And the world is never the same.

**** Yeah, it's fairly low commitment and a fun enough story. It's basically a powerful, whimsical, and somewhat paranoid HP vs SHIELD clash, and I think the character motivations are pretty solid throughout

  After defeating Voldemort, Harry thought he'd be free to live his life as he pleased...unfortunately the Ministry didn't agree. Drugged and captive on a Helicarrier belonging to S.H.I.E.L.D, Harry's only hope of escaping and living a life is the Avengers and their old nemesis Loki.
