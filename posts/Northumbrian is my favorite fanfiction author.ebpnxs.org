I love Northumbrian's fics. Especially the continuity. His stories are my head canon. As far as I'm concerned, that is exactly what happened. I've been reading fa fiction since 2014, and yeah, I stand by this guy. Starfox5 is my second favorite

Who's your favorite?


** My need for silliness and easy escapism means I have to recommend: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot]]

When I go back to fanfics I've read before, it is Rorschach's Blot's which I revist most often.

** Northumbrian is indeed awesome. Their Susan and Lavander are two of my favourite characters.

Of the currently active ones, my faves are [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]].

** I loved Northumbrian's Strangers at Drakeshaugh - it was honestly a refreshing fic after reading all these fics about wars and battles and dark lords and what not. I haven't read their other fics though. If you liked Strangers at Drakeshaugh then you should probably like FloreatCastellum's works as well. I've probably read through all her "Slice of Life" one shots in AO3; her writing feels like it came out of the book series itself, and she has an incredibly strong sense of style and character voice. Taure is another author whose work I enjoy, though he /does/ have a tendency to not complete fics. His work /The One He Feared/ is probably one of my favorite fics of all time, even though it's incredibly short with only four chapters. It's just that good. Finally, I'd like to recommend Annerb. If you like Harry/Ginny, Annerb is your go to. Honestly, you could spend a whole afternoon going through her H/G fics. The Changeling ( a fic where Ginny is sorted in Slytherin), made by her, is again one of my all-time favorites.

** I have 22 authors in favourites on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Some are heavily disliked here, but I don't care. Fanfiction is a silly and fun pastime for me. If I wanted super serious stuff with deep meaning I'd be reading classical literature.

*** Who did you link that's "heavily disliked" here? Only one that I /think/ might be disliked in general here is Robst, but I'm not even sure there.

I don't recognize any of those as authors the subreddit in general dislike. I find a few on the meh side, but none that I'd even say I dislike.

**** I think Sinyk is pretty heavily disliked due to the number of tropes he uses. Especially in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]]. Some of these authors like Broomstick flyer and Darth Mittens write mostly Harry/ Hermione and some people really dislike this pairing.

As far as Robst goes I think the trick is to never read more than one of his fics. Read only one and then move on to other authors for a while and then come back to Robst. (It's a bit off- topic but the tv series "24" with Kiefer Sutherland is the same- watch only one season and it's fun. Try to watch two in a row and you start seeing the same plot elements and tropes over and over again.)

To be honest I can't really seem to get the hang of this sub. Sometimes it likes certain things, but other times there's a lot of negativity. I'm really fine with less than great writing. We are after all talking about amateur writers. These people probably have other priorities like school, jobs, family, etc. So I'm okay if not everything I come across is great.

***** That advice about reading only 1 fic, them moving to another author before circling back at some later time seems great, for any author. I've seen the need to do so in myself, and am aware that not doing so sometimes leads to my not enjoying a fic as much as I could have.
