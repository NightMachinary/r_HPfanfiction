Anyone know where those two fits can be found? I took a hiatus from reading them and I can't seem to find anywhere now...


** There are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/search/?keywords=lacrimosa&type=story&match=title&formatid=any&sort=0&genreid1=0&genreid2=0&characterid1=0&characterid2=0&characterid3=0&characterid4=0&words=0&ready=1&categoryid=224][a dozen Harry Potter fics named /Lacrimosa/ on FFN]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=lacrimosa&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=_score&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc&commit=Search][half a dozen more on AO3]]. If you want anything more than that, you're going to need to give more information.

Just googling "Queen of the Bramble Court" brings up a copy of the story that I won't link to because it looks like an unofficial mirror that you probably shouldn't use and definitely shouldn't sign in to if you do use. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/241121/Araceil][The author's page on the real FFN site]] shows that they have deleted all of their stories from the site. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Araceil/pseuds/Araceil][They appear to be active on AO3]], but haven't posted the story you're looking for on there. The story also appears to not have been updated in over five years, so you probably didn't miss anything.

** Could you provide some more details? Who were they by, what kind of plots did they have, what pairings did they feature, were they one-shots or chaptered fics, etc?

*** I'm pretty sure Queen of the Bramble Court is a Prince of Tennis crossover but I'm not sure about the other one... OHSHC crossover maybe?

**** I have no idea what either of those things are. Could you clarify on 'OHSHC', please?

But okay, that's a start. Do you have anything else? Even a vague idea of a pairing or event would help. Also, the sites you started reading them on.

***** OHSHC is Ouran High School Host Club, as for pairings.... Lacrimosa has Mori I think? The other is pretty hazy...

****** Cool. I'll check around and see what I can find.

Hmm. Might be worth also posting on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. Could be possible to go at this from the crossed-over fandoms as well as Harry Potter.

****** Been poking around and yeah, I got nothing. Apologies. All I can suggest is the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] thing and see if anyone else on there is part of either of those other fandoms and can help.
