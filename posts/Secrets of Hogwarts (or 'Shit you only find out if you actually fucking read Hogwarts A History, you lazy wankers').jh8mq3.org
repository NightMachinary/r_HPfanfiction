So, *two parts to this post - a discussion and a request*.

*Discussion is - what kind of things do you think are hidden at Hogwarts?* Is there more grand, big, mythical *stuff like the Chamber of Secrets*? Is it just *smaller things* like a corridor that twists the wrong way or *the trick step on the moving staircases*?

==o=o=o=o==

*Request is - do you have any fics that cover the secrets of Hogwarts?* I'd prefer it if they also took a more mysterious take on them, but anything works. To give a couple of examples, the upper floor labyrinth changer thing from Arithmancer (Link below) or the hidden chambers and doors in An Unfound Door (Link below) both work for secret locations. It could be *any kind of secret* though - *location, backstory, personal drama, random spell residue*, etc. I just want something about Hogwarts itself.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** linkao3(14984261), WIP, has a "Hogwarts Quests" feature that lets characters get magic items, plus there is stuff about the castle's wards. Harmony, no smut, set in MOR universe but somewhat independent of that, definitely still a Nerdy Harry story. I like it.

linkao3(The Venom Peddler) is set partly in the Chamber of Secrets and there is a bunch of new stuff found there. There is also a big and unexplored underground part of Hogwarts, and an interesting take on the castle's wards. No ships or smut.

  Harry and Hermione are young Ravenclaws with big plans to change the world. Harry wants to use the power of science to invent magical space travel, while Hermione is a celebrity Auror-in-training who wants to fight injustice. However, the two of them, in spite of their intelligence, can't seem to figure out how romance works. Also, there's this prophecy that one of them might destroy the world? Better reign in those science experiments, Harry.All characters are based on those from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR). It's technically a sequel fic, but written to be fandom blind.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

I'd say yes, though I also thought MOR got better as it went along, as the author got more engaged with the story per se, instead of just using it as a soapbox. Anyway the writing style of SoP is much different from that of MOR.

****** I think it is ok to just start reading somewhere in the middle and skip around til you find some parts you like, or decide that there aren't any. Harry becomes less of a git after maybe 10-20 chapters. This is retroactively explained by a feature of the plot creating Harry's personality, but in reality, I think the author simply became a more skillful fiction writer as he went along. He had written a few fiction stories before, but this was his first really long one.

As another matter though, I think HPMOR may appeal most to science fiction fans. That group overlaps Potter fans but doesn't encompass them. If you're not into SF, then you might not ever like MOR. If that's the case, I wouldn't suggest trying to struggle through a fic that you don't enjoy.

******* I am very much a sci-fi nerd. The idea of HPMOR always appealed, it's just that Harry was such an intolerable cockwomble that I could never read it for very long before I just wanted to put the story down and stop reading about this obnoxious little shit of a character. If he gets less... himself later on, I'll probably end up skipping to around that point and going from there. There's a story synopsis thing I saw somewhere that I can use to get the main plot points from the bit I skipped, if I can find it again.

And well, it's not so much struggling through a fic I don't enjoy as trying not to miss out on parts of it that I would. I've found a lot of fics where I've really loved certain elements and disliked the whole. But yeah, cool, thanks. I'll try take a look at HPMOR too, with that in mind. :)

******** You could read sequentially and just grimace and skim over the more cringeworthy parts, I suppose. Those are more prevalent in the early parts of the book, but they do keep occurring now and then throughout, and they're not entirely about Harry.

On the plus side, I thought the book had some grippingly suspenseful parts, some hilariously funny parts, some parts with convincing wisdom, and some parts that were downright exquisite in terms of let's say nerd sentimentality. Also, Harry is a horrible git in the early parts, but later on he is mostly likeable from a certain nerdy standpoint. Professor Quirrell is similar to Harry and is very good nearly everywhere, since he skips the git part. McGonagall is good some of the time but is mistreated in places, I thought.

Added: you could try reading the scene where Harry and other students try out the Patronus charm, chapters 43-46 although 46 is more annoying. Start here:

- [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/43]]

The followup scene is in a different book by a different author, chapter 14 of Significant Digits:

- [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html]]

Skip down to where it says "Not one more minute" if you don't want to read the whole chapter.

Those are particularly intense scenes from the two fics. I think if these excerpts don't attract you then you probably won't be into the rest of the books.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
