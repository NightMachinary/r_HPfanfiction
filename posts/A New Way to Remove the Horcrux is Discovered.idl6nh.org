That is the one on Harry's head. They find a new way to destroy it without risking Harry's life. And that way is... love.

(Space for Dumbledore's eyes twinkle)

Now they just don't need any kind of love, but a very magical one. They discover this after some investigations at the Love Chamber in the DoM. So the way to use love to destroy the Horcrux is one Voldemort knows not, for he is above creatures and magic he considers below him. The kind of love Harry needs is the one from sex, from 2 house-elves. So he needs to be in the same room as Dobby and Winky as they are at it and press his forehead to Dobby just as the two elves climax. They need to climax at the same time for the ancient magic to work.
