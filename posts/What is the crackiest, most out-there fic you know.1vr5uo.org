Strange pairings, incomprehensible plots, absolutely OOC...

** I just remembered; there is [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1i0ud8/what_is_the_most_ridiculous_hilariously/][an earlier thread]] that explored this topic quite well, I thought.

** [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Evil_Be_Thou_My_Good/Evil_Be_Thou_My_Good/][Evil Be Thou Good]]

Incredibly weird and disturbing read, while still being /so good/. Most of the crackfics I see people talking about are badly written 1000 word drabbles. Rustbyte struck gold with this idea though, completely OOC, completely out there, and completely entrancing.

**** Mhmm, though it's worth making an account/signing in with a google account just for the rest of the fics on the site. Some of them are very good. RustByte/Jbern being the most prominent from what I remember. Avoid Kinsfire/Jeconias like the plague.

** Dunno if this is what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][Harry Potter and the Unforgiving Minute]] is, perhaps, the most relentlessly violent thing I've ever read, that also happens to be good.

** Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] is pretty nuts. Harry and Molly Weasley in a soul bond happens to be one of the more tame elements.

** I've got a perfect one for you.: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045112/1/Oswald-the-Ottoman][Oswald the Ottoman]]

Voldemort was turned into an ottoman by Harry. I'll leave it at that.

And one more: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All_The_Dementors_of_Azkaban][All The Dementors of Azkaban]]

All I can remember from this story is that Luna's in Azkaban and Harry plays poker with Dementors. Enjoy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828645/1/Everybody-Wants-To-Be-A-Cat][Everybody Wants to be a Cat]]..."Critically injured during the final battle, Harry Potter chooses a simpler way to live. As a cat, Harry finds love and acceptance but no man can be a cat forever and everyone has to grow up and face the world one day."

I couldn't take this seriously. I laughed way too hard.

Little late to the party. Not the crackiest but one of my favorite crack stories.
