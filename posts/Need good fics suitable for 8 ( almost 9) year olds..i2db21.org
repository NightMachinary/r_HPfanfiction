Ok, so my cousin has just finished reading Harry Potter and apparently she wants to get into fanfics. My aunt asked me ( since I was a major potterhead and I accidentally let slip that I read fanfics.. /oops/ ) to recommend some good fics for my aunt and cousin to read " together at bedtime” . Almost all the fics I've ever read are rated M or E. Please help me!! Eg: No explicit language and no smut( kinda like how the original Harry Potter books go). Thank you!!


** My kids like this too.

So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

**** 11-year-old Draco briefly announces his intention to rape Luna when he's old enough, which horrifies Harry, prompting Harry to think about what a horrible culture Draco must be part of and how he could fix this. No one is actually raped. Some readers have made a huge deal of this one small incident, acting like it's proof that the author is pro-rape or something.

I figure any reader who can handle the canon rape in Rowling's series (Merope's rape of the muggle Tom Riddle) should be able to handle this fanfic too, especially considering that the fanfic condemns it more clearly, actually calling it rape instead of Dumbledore's romanticization of it, acting like it was unrequited love. I see Dumbledore's romanticization of Merope's crimes as a believable flaw for Rowling to have written into Dumbledore's character, so I'm not criticizing Rowling for this, but it is a complex point for a kid to get.

** I think linkffn(Harry Potter geek of magic) [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic]]] , linkao3(blackboards and broomsticks) [[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1327415]]] and linkao3(problem of potions) [[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255]]] fits the bill, but not entirely sure about the language. You might want to vet them first. Geek of magic features a slightly cracky Harry that is very different from cannon Harry. It's rather amusing. Blackboards and broomsticks is part of a series, about Harry as an adult, becoming the DADA teacher at Hogwarts. Problem of potions also has a slightly cracky Harry that really likes potions and so conditioned himself to like Snape. If your cousin doesn't mind fics that stray from cannon characterization wise, she might like these.

Linkffn(constant vigilance by Kevin3) --- it is hilarious! Basically Tonks' experience training under Mad Eye Moody [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12252431/1/Pawn-to-C3]]

Linkffn(lessons with Hagrid by nothingpretentious) --- also hilarious [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid]]

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the garden) --- a comedy based on one single pun. It like one of those terrible jokes that are so bad that they become funny. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10122465/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Garden]]

Linkao3(a good teacher by nia_river) --- really interesting concept [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4065484]]

Longer fics:

Linkao3(fantastic elves and where to find them) --- cracky, whimsical Harry. It's really interesting, especially his interactions with Draco and the Hogwarts staff that try to persuade him to stay at Hogwarts. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/25789]]

Linkffn(midnight by the Weasley watch) --- only features Ron and Snape. I find the discussions of chess really interesting (even though I don't play chess), and the characterizations are good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/Midnight-by-the-Weasley-Watch]]

Edit: only a few fics were picked up correctly, so I'll add links

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Nate looked over at Monty, who smiled at him. “We can go back if you want,” he said softly. “No,” Nate said lowly. Alone time with Monty-- nothing sounded more appealing. “No, this is perfect.” Monty's smile widened. “Yeah,” he said. “It really is, isn't it?”  Nathan Miller and Monty Green fall for the one person they can never be with. Romeo & Juliet AU.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
