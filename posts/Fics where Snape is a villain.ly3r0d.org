I don't mean some fic where it follows his journey into becoming a Death Eater (though he did join a fascist organization bent on killing people), I want fics where he's portrayed as the sort of awful person who bullies children would be. Where's my Snape threatening to kill an innocent man like in the 3rd books?


** so many people like to suck snapes dick, i wouldnt be surprised if there wasnt a fic with him as the villain

** Nightmares of Futures Past was started before book seven was published and makes no attempt to soften him. Harry gets him dismissed from Hogwarts and is quite pleased to see the back of him, although he's not completely gone...

** For his brief time in the fic, he's a very clear villain in Faery Heroes. Another Champions of Lilith challenge response that seems to have been abandoned years ago also wrote him as an unrepentant monster.

  AU. Just after midnight, in a hut on a rock in the sea, Harry Potter celebrated his eleventh birthday and, instead of Hagrid, was collected by Severus Snape to be brought into the world of magic. Mild abuse, neglect.

#+begin_quote
  When Minerva McGonagall discovers that Harry Potter's relatives intend to keep him from attending Hogwarts, she takes matters into her own hands. But when Harry comes to Diagon Alley one day early, it sets events into motion that end with him and his friend, Hermione Granger, sorted into Slytherin. Now the two of them must somehow tame the House of the Snakes.

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.
