Pretty self-explanatory really, I'm looking for fics where Harry has a mother figure early in life. It can be before he first arrives at Hogwarts or after as seen with Professor Babbling in "Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path".

I've read a lot of fics where Harry is adopted by Snape or another male character and I just sort of wondered why I've never seen many fics where he is adopted by a female character and now I really want to read some.


** Let me know if you get something? I've always thought that mother figures are better than father figures for young Harry.
