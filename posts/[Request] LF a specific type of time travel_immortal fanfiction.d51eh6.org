In the line of A Long Journey Home or Basilisk-born I'm looking for an immortal wise harry/fem harry/main character. (I just finished basilisk-born and once I got past the first few chapters - wow, the plot was amazing. After a point I barely noticed the typos.) I loved both of those stories, as well as that third one where Harry ends up in Egypt, something something BCE (can't remember the title right now).

I kept looking for more like this: where Harry has - either through 1) time travel, or 2) Deathly Hallows/other immortality & literally living through the ages or 3) a combination of those two - lived through a lot and is very powerful/wise because of it. He then interacts with characters we're familiar with in the greater context of a story. Unfortunately, I've not had much luck in this specific niche of HP fanfiction. I've either read them all or just haven't found many.

I'm open to just Harry Potter or a crossover with other genres. (I remember finding similar stories about Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, about the Pevensie children returning, being adults trapped in children's bodies essentially, and having to grow up all over again. They would confuse the people around them by accidentally slipping into royal speech.) I especially love crossovers with Stargate and Lord of the Rings, but am open to other books too.

I would even take regular book recommendations with a similar premise!! (really need to scratch this literary itch)

Thanks!


** Would really appreciate any and all recommendations!

** I've got what you need.

​

An un-aging Harry, who left his time after his first year, and returned his second, with hundreds of years of experience, a bolter, and power armor.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
