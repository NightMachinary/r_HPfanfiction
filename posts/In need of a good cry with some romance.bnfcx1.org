Need a good story that'll either get me depressed or cry but also has romance. Good example would be When a Veela Cries. Preferable ship is harry/daphne, Harry/fleur, or harry/Gabrielle


** What about Harry/OC.

Edit: Because hardest cry I had was in Harry/OC

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
