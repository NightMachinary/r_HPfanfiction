Do you use Daniel Radcliff to imagine Harry Potter?

Do you use Tom Felton for Draco Malfoy?

Do you use Christian Coulson for Tom Riddle Jr?

Do you use Emma Watson for Hermione Granger?

ect

Is there another actor/model/person when you think of the characters? Is there a particular piece of art that you think about when you think of the character?


** Actually I'm terrible at visualizing faces. To me characters are formless figures with attributes. Female, good looking, brown hair in a ponytail, etc...

If I were actually SI'd into a story I wouldn't be able to tell you if the characters appeared as their actual movie counterparts or merely some kids that kind of look like them. It's bad enough to the point that while I recognize my parents IRL I can't picture their faces in my mind with any great accuracy.

*** Same here. I don't visualize so much as hear characters. That's why Alan Rickman was spot on for me, given his speech pattern. Most of the other cast members I could take or leave tbh. Not saying they did a poor job, but more I didn't have strong visualizations/preconceptions for them. The only one I'm kinda Meh on is Sirius' actor. Fabulous actor, did well with the characterization of the role, but just... No on the tats...and the velvet blazer... And the facial hair. The whole costuming of Sirius reminded me more of some creepy, salvation army relative of the Shameless folks. Sirius to me needs to be in jeans and a leather jacket/trench or something. Idk.

** For most of the characters, to get a sense of how I visualize them characters, start with the movie actors, then fix the inconsistencies between them and the book descriptions--not enough to look like completely different people. Just enough that they mostly look like they were "supposed" to. So Harry is Daniel Radcliff with green eyes, messy hair, and six inches taller, and so forth.

Obviously, there are exceptions in both directions. Luna will always be Evanna Lynch, not taller and dirty blond like in the books. Neville is absolutely Matthew Lewis because puberty hit him perfectly for that role. And Fred and George are tall and thin like the Phelps Twins.

On the other hand, I see Ginny looking nothing like Bonnie Wright. Ditto for Fleur since they didn't even try to go with the Veela angle in the movie. And the Marauders' generation are all 20 years younger. (Snape is still Alan Rickman, but he's Alan Rickman from his theatre days in the 1970s.)

I think I've evolved the most on Ron, Arthur, and Percy. I initially visualized them like their movie versions, but I've increasingly come to view them purely as their book versions after seeing enough good fanart.

I actually wonder a fair bit about Luna. Evanna Lynch was delightful, but I don't actually remember whether Luna was described as tall. I know she's supposed to be taller than Ginny, if Bellatrix's taunts of "Watch us torture the little girl" are anything to go by, but that might not mean much.

One thing that does annoy me is how often I see "blue eyes" with Luna. She's supposed to have silvery eyes, that if my memory is right, and look too large for her.

***** I tend to picture them to be about the same height, with Luna only a little taller. In /Order of the Phoenix,/ when Ginny and Luna run into Harry, Ron and Hermione and agree to act as lookouts, the narration mention how Harry is able to see Ginny's red hair and Luna's blonde hair as they go back into the crowd.

This suggests to me that Luna is not significantly taller than Ginny, though I admit the movies play a fairly significant role.

Furthering Ginny, I tend to think of her as having a faceful of tiny freckles, and rounder cheeks that make her look younger than Luna.

I also imagine that Ginny copies Luna's barefoot habit when the two of them are interacting outside of classes, whether on the grounds of Hogwarts or at the Burrow, but that's more character development than descriptive.

**** A little inconsistent, honestly. Arithmancer!Hermione is pretty close to Emma Watson, maybe a little taller, especially after she started styling her hair with magic. In other stories, especially the Animagus-Verse, Hermione is plainer and has messier hair almost like Harry's, probably close to some of the well-done fanart versions of her. (I do see her as white because of Emma Watson's portrayal, and by default for 1990s England before that.)

** Daniel is a no go... He doesn't look like Harry that was described in the stories at all. Harry in the stories was leaner, taller, had messy hair and green eyes.

Tom was pretty much spot on.

Christian, not so much. I thought him more in line with the handsomeness of 1940s. But I think he is a good pick.

Emma was never Hermione in my mind. She was too pretty and didn't have buck teeth. Her hair as described in the books was a mess and not the curly hair she had in the first few films. Starting from the third film she matured and didn't resemble Hermione at all.

As to the others.

I was always disappointed with the Twins actors. From what we read in the books they were short and stocky like their brother Charlie.

Ginny... well... Bonnie is, I'm sure a fine actor, but her face is not what I would ever imagine Ginny would be. Too strong jawed and masculine.

The only actor that was spot on was Rupert... and to a smaller extent Richard Harris. Since Richard Harris as Dumbledore was excellent.

EDIT: Seeing the other comments I realised I didn't voice my opinion on the obvious ones. Of course Alan was a great actor but he was not Snape. Same with James and Lily actors, whom I'm too lazy to google. Same with the rest of that generation, too old by far and don't start me on the pedophile mustache on Lupin. Generally, they fucked up the Marauder's era people and that's that.

Pettigrew is described as barely taller than Harry or Hermione in /Prisoner of Azkaban./

Fudge is described as a "little man" in /Goblet of Fire,/ when Harry sees a new side of him that is willing to deny Voldemort's return, though that may be more commentary on Fudge being a stupid-head than it is that Fudge is physically small.

*** THANK YOU! Totally agree about Hermione. I remember when I first read her description, I could relate to her on such a personal level. I have extremely thick, extremely bushy, curly, brown hair. And I lived in the US south (where it's humid) so life for me was terrible. I grew into it, of course, learned how to manage it and moved to a much nicer climate...but seriously, middle school was ROUGH. I was so insecure about my hair. I even tried to chemically straighten it, but that did not work. I seriously wore it in a ponytail everyday from 5th grade onward.

And then beautiful Emma Watson comes waltzing on the screen with perfectly crimped, perfectly styled hair. I was so disappointed. Emma Watson was a good actress, but she was never Hermione.

I personally disagree about Rupert, though. Both him and Bonnie looked nothing as to how I imagine the characters.

About Rupert. I can't fault him as Ron. Perhaps a little less rounder face, but they were kids, kids have round faces. He's tall, ginger and that's about the extent of what we know about him. Perhaps the hair would be different, as in way shorter? Molly Weasley would not allow her kids to walk around with such hair considering the time period and her character.

** Plugging [[/r/hp_casting][r/hp_casting]]. Mix of NSFW and SFW pics.

*Harry Potter:* Tall (approx 180cm) and slim. Messy dark hair, green eyes. Glasses. Very handsome but in an athletic, boyish sense rather than a buff, manly sense. Casual dress. Confident but not arrogant pose/body language.

*Female Harry:* The female equivalent of the above: dark hair with a bit of frizz to it, glasses, green eyes. Very pretty. Skinny but not stick thin. Casual dress and pose but still feminine. [[https://i.imgur.com/My0NNvY.gifv]]

*Hermione Granger:* I actually have two different mental images of Hermione that I flip between. One is a thin girl with little in the way of curves. The other, perhaps inspired by the idea that she doesn't get too much exercise as a library-dweller, is a slightly curvier version. Either way I picture her as having a relatively pretty face and big, frizzy brown hair.

*Ginny Weasley:* Petite frame, freckles, hair more ginger than red, very pretty face.

*Fleur Delacour:* Neither too skinny nor too voluptuous. She's described as willowy, so she should be petite in frame, but given how everyone finds her sexually appealing in an overt way, I feel like she needs to have at least some curves to her. Further, she should not be a "golden blonde" like the typical American beach blonde Baywatch style look. There should be a pale, silvery aspect to her. [[http://i.imgur.com/jvztyPR.jpg]]

*Pansy Parkinson:* For some reason I have always associated Pansy with having curvy hips. I think it might be an association created via the idea of her wearing a pencil skirt from the office scenes in the fanfic Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof). Her other distinctive feature being her "pug" nose, which I read as meaning upturned and with a bit of width to it. Despite that nose, however, I still tend to think of her as quite pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way. Not "model pretty" but eye catching. Black haired. Very coordinated style, all the latest fashion.

*Susan Bones:* Below average height, hair mid-way in the ginger-red spectrum, large breasts, either no freckles or light freckles. I picture her as having a slightly "stocky" frame but not in a fat way - still physically fit.

*Daphne Greengrass:* Golden blonde, very pretty, petite. Effortlessly classy. [[http://i.imgur.com/LTfOYan.png]]

Also why the hell doesn't have green eyes? That's a huge deal that I can't overlook. And yes I'm aware of why Daniel didn't have green eyes but it is still inexcusable in my book. Ron was the only really good casting choice, and even then he lost most of his lines to +Goddess Emma Watson+ Hermione.

In general I try and pretend the movies don't exist. If I'm honest I really don't like them, not on the level of hatred as something like Eragon (what movie?) or the Hobbit Trilogy; but a strong enough dislike to dissuade me from acknowledging them.

I imagine Harry as small and skinny, Hermione as rather chubby and with a mousy face, and Ginny as tall but thin. Severus as short and with a scarred face and small black beady eyes.

*** Radcliffe had an allergic reaction to the contacts so they decided to go without IIRC. But yes, he should have been leaner and Emma Watson is too pretty but that's the problem with child actors.

*** I don't fault them for Harry not having green eyes all things considered. On the other hand, they should have made the effort with Lily's actress.

** Not much of an answer but my headcanon for the Trio and Dumbledore is the original French book covers : [[https://chasingtheturtle.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/harry-potter-covers-from-around-the-world-which-one-is-your-favorite/]]

Besides these four... Luna as in the movies, Flitwick as in the first two movies, for the Maraudeur's "era", I'd say anyone besides the actor that where chosen (except for Sirius Black, Snape's voice, Bellatrix and the Weasley parents).

Honestly, the main problem I have is that the child actors looks the part at eleven but not so much as they age.

** I don't always imagine one person in particular, I guess it depends. I do not see the movie cast as the characters at all, with the exception of a few like Rupert, and Tom for example.

** The trio for me became the trio from AVPM. They are more book-like than the movie gang. But when I am reading I think I don't really imagine the whole thing. Every character is just a shape behind smoke, vague.

** The funniest and most awkward thing for me, both in fancasting and in this thread, is the number of people putting forth adults as fancasts for characters who spend the majority of canon (and quite possible the majority of fanfiction) as children or teenagers.

I mean, I get why this is difficult because child actors, models or whatever - especially those who have been visible consistently through their childhood and teenage years - are pretty difficult to find. But I don't know about anyone else, I have more difficulty accurately placing the age of a child than I do imagining the characters as adults. Fifteen year old Hermione at the Yule Ball is harder for me to imagine than 25 year old Hermione.
