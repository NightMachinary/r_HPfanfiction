** She then started wailing like a banshee (read- toad) and tried to get out of the cupboard. When that didn't work, she tried to apparate out in blind panic forgetting two things.

1. Apparating took careful deliberation on the destination, and rarely if ever is a good option when panicking.
2. She was in a toddler's body and her magic was not stable yet.

The result of her error in judgment was that she splinched so badly that when Dumbledore finally arrived he threw up after seeing her corpse.

The adult Drusleys were sent to Azkaban for mistreating wizarding world's savior while Dudley was sent to live with Marge.

Sirius upon learning that his Godson is dead killed himself in the cell. As his records were being updated it was found out that he never received a trial immediately putting everyone involved under investigation and eventually into Azkaban.

Dumbledore lost his position as Headmaster and Chief Warlock as a result of his failure to protect 'The Toddler Who Lived'. When Voldemort returned Dumbledore barely killed him and subsequently died of injuries.

*** I think it would've been better if Voldi won instead, and then Dumbledore woke up in No. 4 Privet Drive after watching the final AK hit him, you know, just so that he could appreciate Harry's home life and his 'loving' family.

** Nothing about her life had ever been fair. Born half-blood when she ought to have been pure, seen as a bother when she should have been understood to be helpful, kept down and subjugated by those who should have been praising her.

It wasn't easy being Dolores Umbridge on the best of days, but she surrounded herself with whatever she could find that might made her happy, and maybe one day that would be enough to make her life bearable.

Azkaban had stripped away any memory of comfort or happiness. But, then, she'd had very little true happiness to lose. It was a strange thought, the knowledge that all her fluffy and pink, that her cute cats and plush chairs, had truly meant so little to her that even the dementors left her memory of them untouched.

It left her feeling her own emptiness in a way she'd never dared to acknowledge before, even to herself. And she wept for the life she'd wasted, the potential that had only ever been directed downward and away, never able to attain her desires. She couldn't remember her desires, for they must have been happy, but she remembered failing to attain them. Failing again and again. Always second-best, always ordered around, always put down.

She deserved better. But that too had a sort of happiness to it, and so it faded quickly and was consumed by the darkness.

She relived her life in flashes of harsh memory, coldness and darkness all-pervasive, and it began to seem to her that this was the inevitable end. At every step, her life had not been hers to live. She'd given her loyalty, her ingenuity, her best effort. And at every turn, it was others who decided her fate.

It was pointless. Inevitable.

Why fight it?

And so she felt no loss as she lay down for the last time, as she released the desperate hold on her magic that had become instinctive over the years. And her life, which she'd put so much effort into and received nothing but scorn and despair in return, finally flickered and went out.

​

She lay in darkness, but it was a calm and empty darkness with no void of despair. She lay there for a long time, wondering at the peace she felt, at the enjoyment - almost overwhelming - of simply lying still and warm and alive.

It had been too long since she'd felt anything but bone-deep chill and dark despair.

THUMP THUMP THUMP!

She gasped and sat up, smacking her head against something above her. She cried out, and the voice that she heard was not her own. She clutched her forehead, and then brilliant light poured in as the door was flung open.

“Up! Get up, lazy no-good, time to cook breakfast if you want any.”

Dolores stumbled as she crawled out of the cupboard and got to her feet, her vision blurry against the too-bright and her head still throbbing.

“Out of my way!” shouted someone large, round, and moving at her far too quickly. She didn't have the right instincts, and a pudgy arm shoved her aside, smacking her into the wall. Now she'd have bumps on the front /and/ back of her head.

“Hurry up, boy!” snapped the sharp female voice that had first addressed her.

Dolores managed a weak chuckle. The boy was hurrying, no doubt.

But nothing made sense. She was too thin, too weak, too small. Her magic, ordinarily sharp brilliance honed to powerful clarity, instead lay within her like a scrap of fog. Diffuse, uncontrolled, undirected.

Then something rapped her on the side of her head, adding yet another sore spot. She glared up, to find the stern tall woman glaring back with enough anger that Dolores almost backed away.

“I /said/ time to make /breakfast/.”

“You said boy, isn't he. . .” She gestured at the pudgy form, now sitting at the table and tapping his fork impatiently against his plate.

/Smack/. “No lip from you, boy. Get to work, now.”

“How? I don't have a wand.”

The woman's face went pale, then her already grim expression tightened, then she slapped Dolores again, even harder.

“None of that talk here, boy,” she hissed, her voice low and threatening. “Where did you hear that word?”

“My father,” she said, again struck by how wrong her voice sounded.

None of this made sense. None of this made any sense at all.

“Your father is dead. Because of /exactly/ that sort of mythical mumbo-jumbo and the crazies who believe in it. Understand me?”

“No, I don't.”

“I WANT MY BREKKIE!” shouted the pudgy boy.

“In a minute, Dudders,” called the woman, sweetly, then turned back on Dolores. “You'll drop the subject and never mention it again if you know what's good for you,” she hissed.

Dolores wasn't one to back down from a threat, but even as she drew herself up to stand straight and defiant, she had to admit that in her current situation she lacked any of the things which she ordinarily could rely upon. She had no wand, no magic, no Ministry to back her up. She was powerless, weak, and strangely small.

“Come on, Harry,” whined the boy. “Stop wasting time or I'll be cross with you.”

There was an undertone to his words that Dolores didn't like, and the mention of the name Harry brought half-buried memories of hatred burning to the surface. Harry Potter, the arrogant self-important liar who'd somehow wrapped half the world around his deceitful fingers. Harry, who'd defied her at every turn, who'd stood resolute against her best efforts to make him come to his senses.

Dolores was a tolerant woman who had few enemies, but Harry Potter was one who seemed determined to make the list.

Then footsteps descended the stairway, and the woman shoved Dolores back into the cupboard and slammed the door. “Let me know when you've decided to be reasonable about this,” she snarled through the slit, then there was the click of a lock and Dolores was alone in the darkness once again.

It wasn't quite as comforting this time.
