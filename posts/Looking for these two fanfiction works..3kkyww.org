I'm looking for two stories, both of them with Harry/ Ginny Pairings and it's been a while and I wished I saved them to my favorites.

1) This story is about Ginny who worked in a bookstore and Harry who lived in muggle London. They haven't met before but they end up in roommates and then discover that both of them came from the magical world. She introduces him to his family and they don't realize that he is THE harry potter that saved the world.

2) Harry is an auror who gets sick with dragon fever? Pox? something like that and in the past, has tried to commit suicide because he gave up his love with Ginny. She comes over after finding out and discovers the truth.

I think both of these stories were written by the same author. I am not sure. Any help would be appreciated.

*** Yes. I found the titles - Easier to be and Learning to fly. I'm trying to track down someone who has a copy.

**** It just so happens that I have almost all of hgfan1111's fics saved in an archive on my PC, unfortunately not including Learning to Fly. I can't remember who I got them from, though.

Just to play it safe I won't leave it here, but feel free to PM me for a link.
