Gosh, I can't beleive it. I spent the last half minute laughing at the absurdity of the idea. Who, in the world, came up with this idea? I can't imagine the SHEER stupidity needed to come up with something like this. Really? How does a male get pregnant? That sounds ridiculous, because it's the females with the eggs, not the males!

**** inb4 'Oh you sweet summer child'...

There are mythical sources for males generating offspring, and the natural unscientific conclusion of magical men being in love would be 'hey, we have magic, so there must be a way to make a baby for us, too'. At some level it's meant to give the gay segment rights and freedoms they are denied in the real world (unless they, y'know, adopt) but I think it more likely that women writers having gooey happy thoughts about bishonen Harry and Severus resisting the odds and making their love real in defiance of convention has the ultimate cherry on top by giving them little mini-Harrys and Sevs to fawn over.

In reality, I've spoken with gay men who looked at that and said, 'Yo, the great thing about our thing is we can screw day and night without ever worrying about kids, so why are you ruining our fun?'

**** I'm not a fan of mpreg fics in general, but it is not so bizarre or uncommon a trope that it deserves a reaction like that, especially in a fantasy setting like Harry Potter. There's a well-known film called /Junior/ where the Governator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, got pregnant. Male pregnancy is also depicted or referenced in numerous mainstream sci-fi and fantasy shows and films over the years, including Star Trek, Torchwood, and more, and it is officially "Older Than Dirt" due to its depiction in various world mythologies, including Inuit, Mesopotamian, Celtic, and, most famously, Norse, where the trickster god Loki is the mother of Sleipnir, Odin's eight-legged horse.

** I have a massive document which lists all my accumulated pet peeves, which I am adding to all the time, but just to pick out some highlights...

*Magic*

- Technology being depicted as able to overcome/get around magic.

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law as understood by Muggles).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

*Society*

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values, rather than having its own separate values which do not correspond to any particular period of Muggle history.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- Making rare magic commonplace (occlumency, horcruxes, expanded trunks, unbreakable vow, veritaserum, etc.).

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards). Correspondingly: too many Aurors.

- Hogwarts teachers giving their students far too much leeway. In particular, having the teachers permit a teenage authorial avatar to continually undermine their authority.

*Character*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- Harry who tells his life story including extremely private matters to everyone he meets.

- Making Harry short.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic.

- Genius Hermione. She's undoubtedly clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape. She's more of a Percy.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional (rather than thematic) connections to Hitler.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world, until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose.

Would you mind expanding on this some? I agree that technology shouldn't be vastly superior to magic (i.e a single dude with a gun shouldn't be able to take down every wizard in England), but I get the impression that you believe magic should be flat-out better, which I definitely don't agree with.

*** I find it jarring if a pure-blood character, or at least, someone raised to be pure-blood, wears clothes that are supposed to be formal pure-blood wear, but they sound like something that was purchased at any random muggle clothing store.

I was reading this fanfic the other day, and I can't recall the name off the top of my head, but Sirius was changing from his Hogwarts robes to something more "everyday" to go back home for a visit. The outfit his parents wanted him to change into included a tie, and y-front underwear. I had seen ties mentioned before in fanfic, and while I don't agree that ties would be found in a culture that split off from the mainstream culture before the invention of ties, I had gotten used to seeing it, but I couldn't forgive the fanfic for the exact same configuration and terminology of the undergarments as muggles would wear.

There's an entire industry for wizarding clothing makers producing clothing for wizarding consumption, and this industry must come with it's own supply chain, it's own infrastructure. Perhaps there's wizarding shepherds in Whales, wizarding cotton farmers in Mississippi, wizarding silkworm farmers in China, wizarding flax farmers in Egypt, and perhaps Madame Malkin has an off-site weaving facility near Manchester. Walburga had much more magical options then Primark to clothe her family with.

Though to be fair, in DH Ron does say something along the lines of “And what in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y-fronts was that about?” I think it's when Hermione runs off to get Phineas Nigellus' portrait but don't quote me on that. So the undergarment is something mentioned in canon.

** Marriage law, Harem, Mpreg, Bashing and by that i mean just coming up with ways to shit on them not just being critical or putting them in a negative light. Voldemort/ anyone, All characters got married and had 2 kids. Like really they just got done fighting a war they saw people die some were tortured. Having kids isnt everyones happy ending. Neither is getting married actually. Yes i know thats canon doesnt mean I like seeing it in fic. All Slytherins are evil, Insert character here is someone everyone is in love with. Thats not even true for Fleur.

*** Agree to some extent on each

Daphne fics are usually stuff like marriage contracts Luna CAN stand up for herself, she just won't. Oh, and I HATE death eater white washing. How could someone say that people like that are good or innocent! However, not all Slytherins are bad. Just the loud minority. We never hear from Daphne, Blaise or Tracey, so we don't know about them. However Malfoy's a piece of poop. Ron bashing! Urgh. People just accuse him of being mean. He has jealousy issues, but he did overcome them, didn't he! He was also very loyal to Harry and such a nice freind! Harry and Hermione being pricks just makes them Out Of Character. This can only be justified if they were raised / had different experiences than before. E.g, Harry ending up under Lucius Malfoy's care Slut shaming Ginny is not justified! If you are going to slut shame anyone, shame Romilda! She used a Love Potion (Which is like an imperio in my books) on Harry! Well she tried to anyways. But what if it got to Harry! She could have raped him! Helpful gringotts - That gets on my nerves the most. Why would goblins be nice to the humans? They have no reason to! The humans don't respect them at all. As well as that, although Harry being nicer makes the goblins less likely to skin him alive, they arn't going to go all misses little tea party on him! Bullies - There are bullies in every house, and good people in every house. Some more so than others. It is foolish to label them all bullies. Soul bonds. I don't like these because they feel boring and cliched, but some others might like them!

Sorry about that huge rant....

** Dark!Harry where Harry joins Voldemort.

I can tolerate any pairings, mpreg, character bashing, mugglewank, harem, lordship, and many more as long as it's well recommended and I can tolerate the first few chapters. However, I just can't see any reason why Dark!Harry will join Voldemort. Why would Dark!Harry joins the one who makes his live hell? Even if Harry really hates Dumbledore and doesn't care what Voldemort do, the most possible action is just to kill Dumbledore and left Britain.

**** From [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alpha/Beta/Omega][fanlore]]: Alpha/Beta/Omega or Alpha/Omega (occasionally Alpha/Beta) is a kink trope wherein some or all people have defined biological roles based on a hierarchical system, with the terms originating from animal behaviour research. There may be werewolf, knotting, or other animalistic elements involved, or the characters may be otherwise purely human.

** In no particular order:

- Muggle wank;

- Maybe a subcategory of the above, but any fic that insinuates that it is justified to kill muggles because "muggles are going to kill wizards with guns". There exists Apparition, Obliviate and Imperius, and any of these spells used alone would give any wizard or witch a great advantage over any muggle and muggle technology, and a trained wizard has access to many more. No, muggles are not going to exterminate wizards. Ever.

- Harem;

- 98377483883737663 lordships;

- Marriage law;

- Mpreg (in any fandom);

- Whitewashing DEs and Voldemort;

- Harrymort;

- Harry changing sides without good reason and characterization. I enjoy Dark Harry (it's probably my favorite trope in any fandom), but it is hard to get it right imo.

(Bad characterization overall. I don't care if you will have Harry crucioing a baby in the great hall, but explain how the fuck that happened.)

- Bashing.

*** I have no problem with "ward" being used as a verb to describe the function of a spell. My problem is when fanfic states or implies that spells that have the function of protection are in some sense their own branch of magic, or a magically connected family.

It's a perfect example of taking something that in canon is delightfully varied and complex and turning it into something much more simple and boring by forcing it to accord with generic fantasy tropes. The best thing about HP magic is that it's very different to the fantasy canon.

*** The most annoying part is how "wards" simplify a lot of varied forms of protecting we see, to just magical force fields surrounding place.

Like, where are the guardian bests, the cursed objects attacking intruders, the walls that require you to perform some deed to get past them, when was the last time you saw someone use a magical object like a Sneakoscope to warn them about intruders, instead of them just feeling something in their wards.

Ward is the general term the community gave to the enchantments that protect and area and place like they do even in canon. Just because they don't say ward, doesn't mean they can't be a thing.

If it was canon, you'd think that someone in the course of 7 books would have used it.

Correct. However, in-universe, they are not called wards, so believably written characters should not say wards.

Nice strawman buddy. I have no problem with AUs. I dislike wards for the same reason I dislike when characters use American slang. It's simply not a part of their vocabulary.

I guess you'd be fine with a fic using the term transmutation instead of transfiguration?
