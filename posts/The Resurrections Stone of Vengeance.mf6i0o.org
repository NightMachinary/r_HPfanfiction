:END:
I'm trying to remember which story this scene is from: Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to summon the spirits of dead orphans and paupers to kill a corrupt lawyer/ministry type who'd wronged him. I believe it takes up a whole chapter and the story's on Fanfiction.net but I'm not sure of either of those.


** Oh, I recognise the scene I think, it is one of several acts of revenge by Harry, Hermione and Luna (there might be more girls, I can't remember exactly). The editor of the prophet is killed by a whole horde of post owls. I believe Rita Skeeter is raped by a dog? And Harry does Colin Creevey in the bum as payment for some kind of favour, I think.

Edit: Could it be Linkffn(Harry Potter and the rejected path by zarkham)?

*** It could be! And apparently that fic's even more twisted than I'd remembered, because those other things sound familiar but I didn't associate them with that title and author. I just remembered that story as the one with all the Weasley males being sexual predators and Luna's "oddness" being a side effect of Xenophilius using magic to break her will so he could force her to be a prostitute to fund his publishing.

**** Yikes. I had forgotten that but about Luna and her dad.
