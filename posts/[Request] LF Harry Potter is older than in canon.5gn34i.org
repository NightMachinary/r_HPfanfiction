So recently I found some short stories that contain Harry as older than in canon, so would be in a different year, with Bill Weasley or the Weasley twins. I really enjoyed them but am struggling finding any new fanfics that have Harry older. I was hoping anyone else could share any fanfictions they have found that contain Harry as older than in canon.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

**** That would be Knowledge is Power by Fettuccini, sadly abandoned but reposted years ago on ffn. It's a decent fic, and there's something very entertaining about a dr. House style harry, altough it has quite a few flaws and comes with the cliches you'd expect from a fic its age linkffn(5142565)

  DO NOT OWN. COMPLETE. ONESHOT. Harry's in the same year as Bill Weasley, rather than Ron, and it's his seventh year - the Twin's first year. Whatever will happen now? Bill/Harry, rating for implied.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
