I quite like Sequence by Artemis Girl. It has a Hermione/Abraxas Malfoy pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10103455/1/Sequence]]


** Can't find it rn but I remember a really nice Ron/Pansy. She realizes which side's going to win so she tries to use him to get in good with the winning side and maybe as a stepping stone to seduce Harry but she ends up falling in love with him, while he mostly rejects her at first but she wins him over by being relentlessly honest with him.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Cedric reaches up and sweeps a lock of her hair behind her ear, brushing her cheek with his thumb as he does so. He slowly pushes himself up into a sitting position, and Hermione finds herself breathless by the intensity in his gaze. He looks nervous, she realises, fidgeting with his cuff. He cups her face with one hand and she leans into his touch. "Can I kiss you?" he asks.

** I like ginny/ tom riddle or ginny/voldemort. Ginny and tom stories are fun because there's more of a balance between power between them. Where as with ginny and voldemort there's a sort of beauty and the beast thing going on. She's his captive, but she's still a spitfire. Both pairings also have this natural darkness because of the diary. Ginny's been hurt by him and can't trust him.

** Harry/Pansy pairings, at least where she still shows some flaws and isn't perfect (so avoiding the reasons why I find Daphne fics offputting). Though the pairing has its own cliches like "fuck-buddies to lovers" and "accidental pregnancy leading to marriage and true love".

There's a series of one-shots on AO3 that seems to be doing different things with it that's updated regularly.

Here's a taste ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13482384]]) (FFbot linked wrong story).

  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.
