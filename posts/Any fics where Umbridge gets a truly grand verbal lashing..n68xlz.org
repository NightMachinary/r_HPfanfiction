** The Umbridge in the sci-fi AU [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] got some serious nasty verbal and physical lashing, including:

- Two trips to a septic tank, followed by week long infection
- Verbally assaulted by an OC and then hunted down after
- Radioactively poisoned by Riddle's locket, "and Umbridge was far too sick to continue as a regular worker after a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant"

#+begin_quote
  The trials of the Death Eaters and followers of Voldemort are winding down, but the Minister of Magic has saved the best for last. Former Undersecretary Umbridge is about to find out why crossing a bookworm is a very bad idea, especially this one.
