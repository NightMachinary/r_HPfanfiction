Any story's were Harry is reborn as an other character, in any time. Like Harry as Sirius' older brother or as McGonagall' son.

Any parings is fine but no slash.

Post Final Battle Sacrifice. Harry wakes up as kid/baby Dudley. Snape wakes up as kid/baby Harry. Harry isn't quite all there. Think along the lines of Luna Lovegood. Now /Harry/ has to make sure Harry doesn't die prematurely. Both of them. And deal with /himself/.

Did that make sense? Good, because I read the fic and I still don't understand that sentence I typed.

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
