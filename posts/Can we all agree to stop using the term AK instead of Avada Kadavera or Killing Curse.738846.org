I am getting sick of seeing this both on this sub and in fanfiction. Everytime someone says "Harry dodged an AK" i keep picturing Voldemort or his death eaters chucking russian assault rifles at him and it bothers me immensely why can't people just use the name. Yes Avada Kadavera is a pain in the ass to say but the "english" name is easier to say so why the stupid abbreviation? (Written on my phone sorry for grammar and spelling)


** Hm. I don't think it should be used in a /story/ (not in the narration, anyway; I could see wizard-raised Aurors coming with it as oral shorthand and the muggle-raised among them quietly snickering whenever Moody or somebody uses it, refusing to explain why), but I don't have a problem with it on this sub itself.

No, but seriously. I hate abbreviations in general. Just write the word out. I'm not reading a technical manual, I'm reading a novel. Abbreviations tend to destroy the flow of a sentence.

** Most uses of AK are in battle scenes when there are killing curses flying around constantly, although considering that repeating words constantly is pretty poor style, this should be avoided. If the killing curse is used scarcely there really is no reason to abbreviate it.

So i am assuming that writers who would not pass their english exam essay with max points use it to spare time and effort.

Of course there is also fact, that realistically speaking a lot of people use abbreviations in everyday life so the characters using AK makes sense. Especially for aurors, cause militaristic communication especially loves to keep it short and simple.

It depends on the context too. In casual conversation and in tactical situations AK would be somewhat reasonable and realistic, in official and academic situations not at all.

Still personally i agree it's pretty poor style for the author to use AK in anything other than a tactical situation where the characters need to communicate something quickly. In the latter circumstance it actually would make less sense to use the long version.

Also when speaking of casual conversation i'd imagine that toooo casual speak shouldn't be on page for the same reason going to the bathroom shouldn't be described.

There is also the fact that in the wizarding world people seem to take names very seriously, so a spell deemed as unforgivable should be given some gravitas

** Personally, I'd rather see a character using the abbreviation AK than anyone using the nickname 'Voldie/Voldy/etc.' in a fic. Talk about the quickest way to not only make me cringe but hamper my enjoyment of a fic.

As for AK, depending on the circumstances, I honestly don't mind it much. It's an easy shorthand that I could see some in the Ministry and/or Aurors using both on inter-department paperwork (i.e. cause of death: AK) or conversation between one another. Do I think they would use it in an official report that was to be made public or in a speech? Not likely; just as you wouldn't want to use slang in a professional setting in real life, they likely wouldn't want to do that either.

Do I think school-aged Harry or his classmates would use it? I doubt it unless it was introduced by someone else first. For example, I could easily imagine Tonks (in her capacity as an Auror) using it in a casual conversation during an Order meeting only for it to be overheard by Fred and George and then /them/ parroting it in front of Harry, Hermione, Ron, etc.

No matter how mature a child/teen likes to think they are, they'll still parrot things that they think makes them sound more mature than they actually are and, like a virus, it spreads.

That said, even if that were to happen, I doubt they would say it every single time (unless they were a really small child who did it for the attention).

As for using it in a subreddit?: Really doesn't bother me in the least. It's a shorthand that makes for easier posting for some.

There was one story that used "Voldewhore" in the narrative. A lot.

#+begin_quote
  It was on October 31st, 2004, that Harry finally succeeded. He had won the Final War. The mighty task of killing the monstrosity known as Lord Voldemort, oops, make that Voldewhore, was complete.

  Lord Voldewhore immediately retrieved and re-hid his remaining horcruxes -- Hufflepuff's Cup and Ravenclaw's Diadem -- behind fidelius charms. In typical Voldewhore fashion, he left taunting messages and traps in place of the former horcruxes.

** It doesn't bother me. I think it perfectly reasonable that the incantation is not spoken, given that, you know, it's the incantation to a spell that is associated with near certain death. Imagine going about your business and suddenly the words catch your ear. Especially those who'd lived through a war. I feel it's far more respectful to avoid saying it.

I also feel the unforgivables should be taboo'd, so there's that.

**** Spell check doesn't even recognise nonsense words (which kedavra certainly is for an English spell checker. Kadavera is a nonsense word too.

I honestly agree that misspelled words are more annoying than shorthand. Shorthand I will read as of it was written out, fanfics that use McGongal, Lilly Potter, avada Kadavera etc just jar me, because that's not the right word to use. If you write fanfiction, respect Jkrs writing and use her stuff correctly.

** Abbreviating something that could kill you is really annoying to read, just as annoying as someone misspelling a name wrong or getting facts wrong in their story.

Now if it wasn't in a story I'd be fine with it, but if it's in fanfiction, and unless the story is suppose to be a parody I'd feel annoyed by it personally.

However upon saying that, saying something like Defence instead of Defence against the Dark Arts is more acceptable in my opinion.

****** As far as I recall, it only shows up in characters writing (letters, timetables, etc). As a written shorthand, I'm fine with it. But it's not something a character would ever say, and I strongly doubt JK would ever write it in narration. Consider her other acronyms (O.W.L, N.E.W.T, and so on) that all have some clever meaning.

D.A.D.A. stands for Defense Against the Dark Arts. It isn't meant as dada/daddy... It's just an acronym. Not every acronym has a meaning like that.

You said "can *we* also stop talking about DADA teachers?"

We're not the characters, so it obviously doesn't imply you're talking about dialogue.

Irrelevant. I didn't argue that characters said DADA themselves. Quite the opposite.

If I'd meant writing, I would have written writing. I meant we as in we, when we are speaking out loud ourselves, and we as in when we're putting words in the characters mouths to be spoken.

No. I said that in dialogue, there isn't any DADA stuff, but there's at least one example in the narration itself. So yes, it's irrelevant to bring up the "pronouncing" bit as my original comment was already made by that point.

Who cares? She uses DADA in Half Blood Prince. It's narration, sure, but it's there. As I didn't say it happens in dialogue, this whole fucking point is stupid.
