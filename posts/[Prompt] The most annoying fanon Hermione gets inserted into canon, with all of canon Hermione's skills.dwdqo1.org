**** Ok, I might try this

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermione woke with a scream. What had happened? The last thing she remembered was figuring out that Ron and Ginny had been dosing her and Harry with love potion. She figured this out because she remembered Mrs. Weasley mention love potions once which meant that she OBVIOUSLY dosed Mr. Weasley with them and told her kids all about how to make them.

“Hey are you ok Hermione? You've been staring into space for an hour now.” Her stupid roommate Lavender said, Hermione sometimes forgot that when she went into her mind library ( after mastering occlumency after trying for one day) time moves faster. Hermione decided to start her day off practicing her wand less ice magic however, when she tried nothing came out!

“Why won't this work? Why can't I freeze this?” Hermione mumbled to herself. Suddenly she froze and stared up at Lavender who was looking at her oddly. How had she forgotten about her? She was smarter than Dumbledore! She outplayed him after he tried to use her boyfriend Harry for his evil schemes.

“Are you sure you're ok?” Her mentally challenged roommate asked worriedly. Hermione nodded quickly before trying to teleport out with her more advanced version of apparation that the wards couldn't stop. However, when she opened her eyes, she was in her dorm room still, She sighed in frustration and put her head in her hands.

“What is wrong with me today?” She whispered when suddenly she got an idea, she could talk to her amazing handsome boyfriend, Harry Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Merlin-God. He wasn't quite as smart as she was (though she had no idea why her mind felt way fuzzier than normal) but he WAS the most powerful man in the multiverse (she was the most powerful woman) so she set off to his room.

Idk where to go with this, sorry for the bad writing XD

***** I'm actually surprised she isn't dating with Draco or Snape or one of the DEs.

** It depends on which fanon annoys you the most, and all of them can be good and bad in their own ways. At the very least, there are:

1. Authority-worshipping but generally useless arm-candy and perennial damsel in distress of Gray!Smart!Powerful!Independent!Harry's
2. The flighty bookish ingenue seduced by the Rich!Suave!BadBoy!Draco
3. Genius!Hermione (usually 'shipped with Harry)

So, you'd get something along the lines of,

1. Canon!Harry cannot fill the Gray!Smart!Powerful!Independent's shoes and has very little initiative and planning ability of his own, so nothing that requires Hermione's initiative really gets done from the moment fanon!Hermione replaces canon!Hermione. Voldemort probably wins.
2. As 1 (i.e., nothing gets done), but with more romantic yearning, admiring from afar, and feeling conflicted. Contrary to her expectations, canon!Draco does not return her feelings. Fortunately for her, he is not nearly subtle enough to take advantage of them, so she is just useless, and Voldemort probably wins.
3. After an initial shock, FormerlyGenius!Hermione systematically takes stock of what skills and abilities she has lost and looks for ways to regain them and/or make the best of what she has---assuming that she doesn't fall into depression. From that point on, things continue loosely along the lines of canon, though sometimes helped by Hermione knowing what's possible, even if she can't do it at that point.

*** They're all pretty bad (although 3 sounds the "best", in that something serious could be written.)

I do like your conclusions though, although, given that it's the most annoying version of Hermione, #3 would probably have a Lockhart version of Hermione.

**** A Lockhart version of Hermione? In the sense that she is very confident about trying to do things that she is not a capable of doing and fails in hilarious ways? Or, in the sense that she spams Memory Charms to cover up her mistakes?

***** More the former, unless it's one of those Hermione's from a bashing fic that's apparently justified in everything.

****** I don't know. Given canon Hermione's most important traits, I'd view her being unable to adapt to the new reality a more "bashy" portrayal than her making the best of a bad situation through unethical means.

******* It'd be denoted that it's a ridiculously fanon Hermione though.

Although given that people bash Ron for being a love potion using rapist with terrible grades... I see your point.
