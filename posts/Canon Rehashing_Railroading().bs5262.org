What exactly counts as a canon rehash? I know it's the repeating of certain events (despite how silly or baseless the reason is), but would that apply to other Chosen Ones?

Say, for example, Fay Dunbar somehow ends up the Girl Who Lived. Would it be a rehash if she fought the Basilisk, or if she found herself shoving her wand up the troll's nose? What if the actions repeated, but the ending somehow came out different? (Like, Fay saves Hermione, but Hermione doesn't see Fay as a friend.)

I apologise if this has been asked before!


** In my opinion yes, it's just a different character playing out the same plot.

*** That's fair! Do you think it could ever be done effectively, or are you fond of AUs that are entirely noncanon?

**** This sub overwhelmingly favors entirely different plot.

I mean most of us know canon plot fairly well, we don't need to see it regurgitated thousands of times in fanfics. WTH is the point to read its endless repetitions?

There are some fics that repeat those canon stations, but with vastly different outcomes. One such example is the very popular [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106). The resolutions of CoS and TWT events are totally hilarious, and that type of ‘rehash' is totally cool for me.

*** What would happen if the book storyline was happening, but other plots were going on at the same time? You know, like how a TV show usually has more than one plot going on at once every episode? (For example, on Friends, Rachel has her pregnancy plot in Season 8, but Monica and Chandler are trying to have their own babies. Or when they go to the beach and Phoebe's mission is to find her family, while Ross is trying to figure out what to do about Rachel.) In my fanfiction, the timeline is kind of playing in the background, but it's not the main plot. There are actually a few main plots (Harry has his own, as well as does Sirius, and a few other characters) but I wouldn't say the book's timeline is the plot of the story. Is that okay, or do you think it crosses the line?

*** That makes sense! I figured that you'd /have/ to add new internal dialogue, though - wouldn't you just be repeating the same character with a different name? The new character would naturally have a different view and voice.

It's definitely important to understand /why/ Fay would go off onto wild adventures. Thank you for the bit of advice!

** Basically, yes.

While repeating some events (like Quirrelmort in Year 1, the opening of the Chamber in Year 2 or the Triwizard Tournament happening in Year 4), repeating all the events, even with different outcomes, count as Canon Rehash.

For example, with your proposition. Quirrel releasing the troll during the Halloween night is not really rehash, since this event, and the ones leading to it, happen outside of Harry sphere of influence, it would happen with or without him.\\
But now there are several questions who need to be answered :

- Fay Dunbar is the GWL, what changed? Considering her status, she has to be at least Half Blood, potentially Pure Blood, but what is her story? Is she a Half Blood who grew up with her magic hating muggle familly after her mother used "love" to protect her from Voldemort, or is her story completely different (is she a Female Harry with a different name or a true character on her own). How her, and the world around her, was influenced by her status during her uprising. And while we are at it, what happened to Harry Potter? (Dead with the Potters, or they live, is Pettigrew a traitor . . .).
- Since Fay is a different character, why is she in this situation? The trio confrontation with a troll is the result of several events (Ron badmouth Hermione to Harry -> Hermione hears about it -> she goes in the bathroom to cry -> troll happen -> the boys know she isn't there and go tell her about the troll -> confrontation). If you change anything about the premise (one of the character into another house, new character . . .) then the confrontation should not happen, or at least not as in canon (nobody comes to help Hermione, she dies or is hurt/ Troll goes to a different bathroom/ Hermione escapes by herself . . .).
- Wand in the nose. This event is really precise, and shows that the fight happen pretty much exactely as in canon. But in that case why brings a new character. Also, if the wand is stuck in the nose, when I guess someone else it there to do magic during this time. Who is it? Ron?

​

So yeah, this situation sound a lot like rehash. Though it is in 1st year though, some fic rehash so much that they manage to change everything in the fic will still keeping a very precise event (Like a genius, Slytherin Harry who is in neutral term with Draco, but still end up with the Half Blood Prince's book and use Sectumsempra on him in Myrtle's bathroom).

** Bad rehashes are basically skippable - you can assume the reader knows about Diagon Alley, so if your alternate Harry goes there at the same time, with Hagrid, and buys the same things, there's no need to go into detail about it. You can brush it off and get to the good stuff.

If the scene contains stuff that happened in the books, but also contains important information that's new and different, then it's not a bad rehash. (IE if Fem!Harry makes a stop at a dress shop during her first visit, the whole event might tell us a lot about her, especially how she's different from canon Harry. That's an important scene to keep.)

** A canon rehash is when the story happens exactly the same even when there are significant changes to the plot which would typically mean it should diverge. That's how I see it.

** Yes. It doesn't matter what the protagonists name is, if the same cannon events are happening to THE protagonist, it is +trash+ a rehash. The only way to keep the same events and not be rehashing cannon is to make your protagonist somebody ELSE then whoever the events are happening to.

For example, you could have a story with Fay as your protagonist, and keep Harry as the one who all the events happen to. She may or may not hear some or all of the details, but it doesn't matter because she's got her own plotline that is NOT just rehashing cannon. Of course, that requires more creativity then the vast majority of FF authors will ever see.

​

Different outcomes MAY squeak through as not quite a rehash IF the events that follow are in line with those different outcomes. For example if the protagonist saves hermione but isn't considered a friend, the hermione cannot randomly start tagging along anyways. Or more accurately, further events cannot serve to railroad the plot back to the cannon tracks if a different outcome has already changed it.

** There is such a wide spectrum of “reshash” I think. It goes from literally adding or changing a character and going through the same plot and quoting book dialogue (not my fave) to something as amazing as as the Changeling (a 7 year story following Ginny sorted into Slytherin full of new material and amazing character development). I recommended it to someone the other day and they said they loved it despite it “being a rehash” which I did not even think it was. But I suppose it technically falls into the category since it loosely follow the canon timeline even though it's AU.

Anyway long story short... when done well, rehashes can be quite brilliant. Canon compliant stories that fit neatly into canon but present new material are also often brilliant.

Stories where the same exact things happen with just a character switch... you need to really have a unique angle for something like that to work, I think. Now if you start with a canon event and then have a different outcome and diverge from there.... that will be great! :)

I was reading a time travel fix it/rehash the other day where Ron got the diary instead of Ginny in CoS and that went off the rails in a pretty satisfying way. Small changes can have big impacts.
