It's a summary of Bellatrix Lestrange's life and it really humanizes her without making it unrealistic and deepens her backstory. I discovered it a few years ago, but I always go back and reread it from time to time because the writing was so well done. And it shows what a tragedy her life really was.

(Was written before The Cursed Child , which is good because that was totally unrealistic )
