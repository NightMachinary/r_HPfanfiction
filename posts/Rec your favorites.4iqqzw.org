I feel like I'm always asking for stories, but I have a lot of spare time and don't know where else to look ask for stories.

I'm very fond of stories that everyone seems to hate on; stories that involve Lord Potter (Black, Peverell or whatever. I love Angry Harry and the seven, even if it's a little overdone), stories with betrothel contracts, Dumbledore/Weasley bashing (but not so much that's it overdone) Harry breaking away from Dumbledore and taking control over his own life, political Harry (but not to complicated, cause I hate politics and never able to understand if it gets complicated ;) ), femslash (not Hermione/Ginny thank you please), good/Gryffindor Draco (or just not evil slytherin Draco), grey Harry, time traveling back to get it right this time (love Three to Backstep), stories where he has a connection to McGonagall other than a professor/student relationship (and yes I've tried Harry McGonagall)

So pretty please submit your favs out of the ones I'm fond of. All I ask is that the pairing is not Harry/Ginny as I can't stand that pairing, or any slash pairing, good written and preferable a good plot (I know that's a lot to ask for which the specifics I asked about), at least 80k wording.

And please, I'm just asking for recs, not a discussion on how bad the tropes are.

So thank you!

Well, that's a few I guess. Broken Angel is a crossover with Naruto..I don't particularly like the series but the story integrates the universe well into the HP one. Twins is your typical WBWL story, nothing major, but it's long. Paid in Blood is your typical time-travel do-over story. It's long, it's decently-ish written and often times interesting. The Son of Lord Voldemort speaks for itself I think. Rise of the Wizards, With Strength of Steel Wings, The Weapon Revised and A long Journey Home (time-travel with a twist) are four of my alltime favourites. They don't particularly fall into your category of tropes, but they're well worth the read.
