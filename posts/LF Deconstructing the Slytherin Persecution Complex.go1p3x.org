As someone who has been sorted into Slytherin, I find it odd how fanfic authors portray the house. The Slytherins and especially those who are children of wealthy families are often seen as some marginalized group that is so unfairly treated by Dumbledore and the Hogwarts teachers but really? The books heavily imply that wealthy families like the Malfoys run the British wizarding government behind the scenes. The Umbridge reign in Book 5 is even more on the nose. Hell, Malfoy's grandfather pressured the first Muggleborn Minister of Magic into resigning! Don't get me started on the unfortunate implications of the "PurEbLOoD TrAdItIonS" and "Lord Potter" tropes.

I'm looking for fics with interesting Slytherin and Muggleborn characters that address the class divide in the Wizarding Society, if that makes any sense.


** The Slytherin Persecution Complex is strong in the fandom. Some fics, like /The Green Girl/, somehow manage to both make Slytherins terribly persecuted and incredibly influential and practically untouchable, completely unironically.

I've had a plot bunny for a long time that deconstructs the idea, but I don't have the talent or the time to write it. The point of divergence is that rather than treating Harry like the unwanted stepchild that he was, the Dursleys raise him as their own---which is to say, as they raised Dudley.

When Dudley is beating up other school children for their lunch money, Harry is right there cutting off their escape. When Hagrid takes him to the Diagon Alley (without having to track him down to an island in the middle of a lake), Harry almost dies of embarrassment having to be seen next to that uncouth oaf.

And, when Draco offers to help him find a better kind of friend, he takes one look at Draco's expensive new robes and at Ron's hand-me-downs, and he knows exactly whose friend he wants to be and in which House.

Once there, he invariably chooses what's easy over what's right, following Draco's lead in sneering at the Gryffindors and bullying the Muggleborns and the blood-traitors. He mocks Hagrid, badmouths Dumbledore, and ingratiates himself with Snape. He exploits his Quiddich talent and his BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot---to the point of people doing his assignments for him---for doing very little. On those occasions when Harry is absent, Draco riles up Ron by rubbing the fact that Harry chose Draco over Ron in his face.

All the while, the Slytherin persecution complex would be on full display. Young Slytherins parrot their parents' lines about "good old days" before Dumbledore ruined the country, when newcomers knew to respect their betters. They complain about Ministry persecuting upstanding citizens, then turn around and flaunt their parents' wealth and influence. They cry oppression when McGonagall justly takes House Points from them, and revel in Slytherin superiority when Snape takes every excuse to award Slytherins points and penalise and punish Gryffindors.

But then, things begin to go wrong. When they loudly proclaim something about a traditional holiday or the pureblood culture, the noisy Muggleborn girl chimes in about how recent and artificial most of these traditions are and how they /really/ wouldn't want to go back to them as they were historically, citing chapter and verse from history books. And then, she has the gall to get the best marks in her year.

Now, the Slytherins know how to deal with upstarts like that, but then things begin to go wrong there as well: the Gryffindors begin to fight back. At first, the vaunted Slytherin cleverness prevails: they use magical items, gang up, and make sure that Snape is nearby to interrupt the fight and punish the Gryffindors if the fight does go badly despite the precautions. But, the Gryffindors also become increasingly well organised, and they even begin making revenge attacks, apparently with that annoying Muggleborn in the lead.

And so, the Gryffindors quickly become too dangerous to bully, but even when Draco and Harry take out their frustrations on other targets, the do-gooder Gryffindors have the gall to intervene.

And then, Voldemort returns. Harry is eager to make a deal, but it turns out that the Dark Lord isn't the libertarian meritocrat that Draco had waxed poetic about, and he isn't particularly interested in recruiting or even a truce with Harry. It also turns out that Harry's Slytherin friends value their own safety far above their friendship. The most he can get from Draco is a whispered, "Sorry, Potter. My family's more important. It's been fun."

And so, Harry has to swallow his pride and go to Dumbledore and the pesky Gryffindors for help, beginning his redemption arc.

**** I don't know if I'd write him as either badass or kind. The hole he'd be in when Voldemort returns---in his personality, his relationships, and his skills alike---would be deep, his impetus for change will be fear, and it's not like the Gryffindors will welcome him with open arms either, so there is only so far he would evolve. Unfortunately, I don't think I could do the premise justice.

One twist that I do envision is that when Voldemort gathers intelligence about Harry, he will find a lazy, unambitious follower, an unsubtle bully who lets others do his thinking for him; someone who is brave enough to laugh at the stuttering Professor Quirrel behind his back, but would never confront him over the Philosopher's stone. He will despair over having such an unworthy nemesis.

He will also investigate Neville, whom Hermione and Ron will have taken under their wings when Draco and Harry had gone after him, and who comes into his own perhaps earlier than in canon. Having not heard the second half of the prophecy, Voldemort will wonder if perhaps he had been mistaken about which of the two children the prophecy was truly about, and whether magic had punished him for the wrong choice.

And so, he would have little interest in taking Harry's blood, nor in testing his wand against Harry's. That, in turn, would deny Harry his canonical escape clause: to destroy the last horcrux, Harry must truly die. Can he become the sort of person who would?

Hermione and Ron would never work together without Harry, Harry is the glue to the trio, without him Ron wouldn't have the impetus to rise above his desire to just enjoy life(not saying he is lazy or a coward, but without Harry and/or Hermione dragging him, he just wants to avoid trouble).

Hermione would probably be the one to help, but I don't think she would have many friends in doing that, she's not that charismatic.

That's the good thing about the Trio, they balance each other, the only one who could function by himself is Harry who has a bit of both, and can be charismatic and decisive when he wants it.

/Neville/ however, could certainly be the one to step up, he was the only other person to whom the Sword of Gryffindor appeared other than Harry.

I'd go even further. Hermione has almost nothing in common with the other two, and if not for a common enemy (i.e., a troll), they'd have never become friends. Fortunately, Draco and Harry are happy to provide one.

Now, Ron himself does have ambitions---we see them in the Mirror of Erised---and one could in fact make a case that friendship with Harry /distracted/ him from pursuing them. In this continuity, Draco would end up doing everything in his power to stoke his resentment of himself and of Harry.

Much as I like the idea of a BAMF Hermione singlehandedly holding back the Slytherin tide, I think the story would work better thematically if the Gryffindors won through teamwork. In the end, when your bully has an invisibility cloak, it really helps to have someone to watch your back.

Regarding Neville, courage and steadfastness aren't things you're born with, and early-canon Neville would probably not be able to pull the Sword of Gryffindor out of anything. He needs far more development before he is ready to step up, and in the meantime he makes for an attractive bullying target.

Hermione was outspoken and aggressive about doing the right thing from the start. She ran off crying because,

1. What Ron said was true.
2. Ron didn't actually intend to bully her; he sincerely didn't expect Hermione to overhear.
3. She had thought that she and Harry and Ron were friends of sorts---because hectoring and unsolicited advice is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship. (For evidence of that, consider that you wouldn't try to punish someone you didn't consider a friend by refusing to talk to them.)

For that matter, in this context, "BAMF" woudln't mean emotionally invulnerable. It would mean Hermione being able to fight off singlehandedly an ambush by Harry (with an invisibility cloak), Draco (with whatever magical artefacts money can buy), and whomever else they had brought along. Hermione as a paranoid badass would be fun to read, but teamwork and solidarity is the order of the day for this premise.

I don't agree with some of this, but let's assume it's true, for the sake of argument. Now, add Draco taking every opportunity to rub it in that Harry chose him because he is richer and a better kind of wizard; and maybe target the duel prank at him rather than at Harry. That might give him some drive, no?

Harry has fewer ambitions than Ron. The Mirror of Erised all but proves that.

Ron is only slightly less talented than Harry in general magic. He does at least as well on all OWLs except for DADA---and if your hypothesis about him being lazier is true, then he in fact manages it while putting in less work.

Ron's intelligence is at least comparable to Harry's: outside of savants, unintelligent people don't get good at chess.

And, Harry's drive is a very shortsighted beast: when he has an immediate magical need, he puts in the time. The same is true of Ron---and most people, really. Hermione's the weirdo who studies more than she has to and reads fat nonfiction tomes for fun.

Voldemort letting Harry join up is a possibility, though it's not clear whether he'd be interested in him as a Death Eater as opposed to as a Snatcher-grade mook. Though, once he does figure out that Harry in fact the one the prophecy was about---possibly killing Neville in process---he'd probably want to put the kibosh on him as well. Harry certainly wouldn't have the drive or the willpower to defeat Voldemort in Priori Incantanem; but sacrificial protection would still be in full force, which may allow him to escape.

I blame plot for this more than the character, if Harry trained as much as he does in some fics, some of the later books would be different, but he doesn't because that wasn't the role JKR had for him.

And he went straight for the easiest path, Harry only followed, but Harry is a very passive character anyway, for someone whose life is always in danger every year.

I mean if it was me you can bet your ass by the time of CoS I would know some more combat spells to a point that that duel with Draco would end up with him at least stunned. By eleven the boy had to face a possessed grown wizard, if that doesn't wake you up and shakes your trust in some things I don't know what does. (and here's a plot bunny being born)

#+end_quote

We get a pretty good idea about how Harry felt about each test, and I don't think there's particularly good evidence that his actual performance was that affected. Almost all of the things you've listed took place in the first half of the year. And, there is very little he taught Ron in DA that Ron didn't pick up from co-teaching Harry in GoF.

All in all, his OWL results were generally consistent with his displayed ability: he was better than most at those subjects in which he earned EEs, but not outstanding.

Given how little Harry cares about History of Magic, he probably would have failed it anyway, but even if he hadn't, that might give him one irrelevant OWL over Ron.

#+begin_quote
  I remember some analysis showing the game in PS was good, but not that good, he's good at chess yes, doesn't mean he's good at magic.

Both chess and magical ability depend very strongly on general intelligence, and so ability in chess is indicative of general intelligence.

He didn't try, either, so we will never know who can learn the Patronus at what age. What we do know is that it's more about feeling than about thinking and that Patronus skills don't generally transfer to other areas of magic.

We also see in OotP is that it's not as difficult a spell as most people think, and the main reason nobody learns it until after the NEWTs is that it's completely useless unless you plan to work with Dementors and Lethifolds or know Dumbledore's messenger trick.

#+end_quote

Harry didn't show much interest in learning either, after the first few months. That's perfectly normal: what was previously new and magical quickly became ordinary and mundane, and actually learning magic is a lot of hard work, in a world that offers many more distractions than even the Muggle one of the time.

Again, Harry and Ron are normal, and Hermione is the weird one. I don't think it's fair to blame Ron for somehow slowing Harry down any more than vice versa: Harry enjoyed hanging out with Ron and Ron with Harry. One may as well argue that friendship with BWL gave Ron something that his brothers could never have and satiated his ambition, and had he not met Harry, he would have worked harder. For that matter, Harry always had a more studious and curious role model in Hermione: the choice not to follow her was his.

I had a completely different history than Harry, we are talking about a kid who was never showed the minimum of love his whole life(that he remembers), who had to live in a small dark space and was often verbally abused. Kids like that either break or become very independent and mature just to cope(while having lots of issues). And he was almost killed and had to kill a person, he may have not processed that, but if he had, it would be quite a wake up call.

I guess that's one of the problems with canon Harry, he gets through a lot of harrowing experience, but he only grows up when it's needed for the plot, he never evolves by himself, even when it would have been pretty logical too.

He's much more well adjusted than any kid denied any positive encouragement and positive role models during their formative years have any right to be, honestly, even if we only take canon Harry, he should've had a lot of problems he simply doesn't have in canon, one of them might as well be communicating. And the authorities in his life(relatives, teachers, officers) constantly fail him, again and again, even in Hogwarts he almost dies because his teacher didn't believe him, that's NOT a good thing for a kid.

Well, he might've been able to blow Pettigrew's head off(or at least be more useful than just stay still like a moron) and then capture Voldemort in the graveyard if he knew more than two spells, if he was ruthless he would have disembodied the guy again and saved a lot of people a lot of grief while giving Dumbledore more time to be a plot device.

It's up to a point in the movies where, apart from PS, Ron is just decoration and Harry is just there to get beat up while Hermione either always does the right thing or when she makes a mistake it doesn't matter anyway because she's Hermione(like with Draco).

These generalisations are statistical in nature. Many children do neither or something in between. Not every traumatic experience leads to PTSD.

If you want to psychoanalyse, Harry, once at Hogwarts, was given the opportunity to be a normal teenager and do normal teenager things. He got friends he could hang out and play games with, a sport he could enjoy, girls he could date, and even a family of sorts. Why /wouldn't/ he embrace that?

#+begin_quote
  Well, he might've been able to blow Pettigrew's head off(or at least be more useful than just stay still like a moron) and then capture Voldemort in the graveyard if he knew more than two spells, if he was ruthless he would have disembodied the guy again and saved a lot of people a lot of grief while giving Dumbledore more time to be a plot device.

Given how much time he had just spent preparing for the TWT, his performance in the graveyard was pretty close to the best he could have done against an adult wizard skilled in the Unforgivables. If he'd been more skilled, maybe he could have resisted for 30 seconds, possibly receiving worse injuries in process, preventing his later escape.

Rowling smartly didn't put any true pagan traditions that clearly in her books to avoid the Bible Patrol, but if you are talking about stuff like Yule, Beltane, and other Celtic and/or Norse traditions, I can guarantee you some of these predate Christianity, and some of them are much milder and safer than the stuff early Catholics got up to.

I also don't like the 'uh Slytherins are oppressed by Dumbles' trope, but if the complaint is that muggle-borns are coming over and wanting to substitute their religious practices it's a very good reason.

You can however construct something that has Slytherins being prejudiced upon and painted with the same brush as Voldemort, Draco and Co. and Harry having to fight and change that.

In canon Slytherin is extremely shafted because we don't get a single neutral or good Slytherin student, while we know that not all of them are like Draco. I like to think most of them just want to keep their head down and complete school so they can achieve whatever they want to do, they know they are at a disadvantage so they just avoid both sides(you know, cunning)

The fic does have a lot of more supernatural stuff than canon, but he doesn't go around meeting gods left and right.

**** Of course, at least some of those Celtic and Norse traditions predate Christianity---though I suspect that the way they were actually celebrated was very different from the way their reconstructions are today, if nothing else because of how much we don't actually know---but the notion that the wizards are somehow more attached to those traditions than the Muggles are is entirely fanon. More likely, any wizards celebrating "traditional" holidays have about as much connection to those traditions as Muggle neopagans do to theirs.

Now, there's nothing wrong with reconstructing a historical holiday (though intelligent, well-intentioned people can disagree about issues around cultural appropriation). On the other hand, turning it into a narrative about how blood traitors and Muggle lovers are suppressing ancient wizarding traditions is an expression of exactly the sort of Slytherin Persecution Complex that we are deconstructing here.

I think the Hogwarts Founders made a mistake when designing the House system: Slytherin inherently attracts self-interested people inclined to view others as a means to an end. They proceed to reinforce each other through group polarisation, and only the wisest of them are able to expand the circle of people they care about beyond their blood relations. The best exemplar of Slytherin we see is Slughorn, who is a man at the top of his profession, but also a wheeler-and-dealer, not above using his position as a teacher to obtain favours and influence.

However, what this all means is that the only one /actually/ persecuting Slytherins is J. K. Rowling, not Dumbledore as fanon would have it.

However, one truth that is pretty much universal in human societies is that groups of people who have traditionally enjoyed power and privilege who are in the process of losing said power and privilege often confabulate "good old days" when things were better and "traditions" that haven't been followed for generations.

** This isn't really about a class divide, exactly, but there's a passage in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474][Put Your Curse in Reverse]] linkao3(7882474) that does an excellent job illustrating why I'm generally unconvinced by fics that show Slytherins as poor, oppressed victims after the war:

#+begin_quote
  “I want everybody listening to hear me---really hear what I am telling you.  A prejudice /does/ exist against those associated with Death Eaters. You cannot refute this. To do so invalidates all that we have gone through since the War ended. To do so widens the divide between us all. There /is a prejudice/---those of you feeding this rebellion have a right to feel like you do. You have a right to be angry. You have a right to want change. You have a right to be frustrated with classmates and professors who won't recognize your hardships. But this hardship...this prejudice...is not undeserved.”

  Scorpius tightened his grip on Albus's hand nervously. Draco had to raise his voice to speak above the angry shouts rising from the Slytherin table.

  “The only undeserved prejudice in our society was the dangerous and prevailing prejudice against Muggle-borns and Muggles. This is a prejudice I exemplified during my time at Hogwarts. It was a prejudice I was raised with. I /hated/ Muggle-borns; I called our Minister for Magic a ‘Mudblood' on multiple occasions as a child.”

  Many people flinched at the sound of the slur, Scorpius included. It sounded wrong to hear it coming from his dad's lips.

  “Death Eaters were united against Muggle-borns, Muggles, and their sympathizers. Death Eaters tortured and killed more Muggles and Muggle-borns that I can count. We did so because we thought they were lesser. We wanted to rid the world of them. I would not stand up here in front of my /son/, who, to my amazement, has always loved me despite my past, and admit these horrible things if they were not true. And they're true. If you know somebody who was a Death Eater, they were the most prejudiced of all, and they put that prejudice into action. They took lives. They took the lives of parents, of children, of the elderly. They tortured parents into insanity in front of their children. They tortured /children/. When Voldemort was using my family's Manor as a headquarters, Death Eaters captured and tortured a Muggle child in the gardens. For fun. Six years old. For /fun/.”

We only see Draco pulling this kind of crap, and it's heavily implied his boasts of "my father will hear about this" have some clout since his father is rich and influential(Minister listen to him) so he could retaliate if his son was reprimanded by his housemates. And it's not like Draco shouts it all the time, the only time he has done it in public was in Second Year, and there was much more to worry then than a kid calling names.

Rowling simply chose to leave the house at that, a villain House, but if it was that way, why bother sorting people there anymore? What was the point if 60% of them would turn bad and corrupt the others.

I think one of the problems is that ambition and cunning may be seen as bad things, which I think is a stupid and ignorant conclusion.

**** I /liked/ the writing of the Democracy one. It was well written. But you kind of dropped the story at the actual interesting part. That whole palaver with getting it passed is all well and good, but cripes if it isn't a depressing slog, especially considering the crap that the governments of major countries are pulling right now. Is there a sequel? I'd be keen to see where this goes.

***** I've got no sequel planned, alas. I assume for the newly minted democracy, it's business as usual. The war's still very close, so that influences things - and it's a small country, about a small town's size, so things are also more limited.

*** Holy crap if Divided and Entwined isn't tragic, I could see something similar happen.

Good story, with good history basis.

The parallels were well applied.

I don't know, if I was Dumbledore I would have thrown my hands up and gone Grindelwald on them. Blue Hellfire included.

**** Well, he came close - but as long as he saw a decent chance to change policies or take over, he wouldn't attack the Ministry.

***** If I was someone who had seen the Holocaust, I wouldn't let them pass the part where Diagon Alley was painted with all those messages. Or Umbridge torturing students.

I wouldn't have been a good politician, but I would blow up that Vichy like motherfucker, channel some De Gaulle and then gone full Elder Wand on all the Death Eaters I could find until Tom's only helpers would be Wormtail and his scaly friend.

All the while having Fawkes deliver some really hot packages to some people.

****** The problem is finding the Death Eaters. After all, most of the "overt" ones were killed when the Resistance blew up Malfoy Manor. And while that took care of a lot of Death Eater supporters, it also frightened and angered a lot of the public and the Ministry. Dumbledore attacking them would have driven them straight into Voldemort's arms.
