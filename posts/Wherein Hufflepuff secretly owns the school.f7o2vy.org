:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to find a story that I read a while back and really enjoyed but did not bookmarkfor some reason. My mistake.

I think it was on FanFiction .Net but it could've been the old HPFF .com site. The story revolves around Teddy Lupin, in his sixth or seventh year Hufflepuff and I think he is either prefect or head boy. In this fic, as at least 1 first year boy learns, Hufflepuff actually runs the school and they just let everyone else think that theyre not as smart or not as good as the other houses; they only play quidditch for fun, practicing once a week with rotating rosters and the only reason they dont win the cup is because they dont feel like it. The hufflepuff common room has some special features, a fancy library, a bar? maybe and some others i can't remember. I think it also had a fairly high word count (5k+) Any help would be appreciated.
