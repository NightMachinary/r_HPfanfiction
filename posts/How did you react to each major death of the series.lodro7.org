** I saw the movies before I read the books but when I did, Cedric's death didn't really faze me much. Around Sirius' death there was this general air of sadness and despair that I just couldn't shake off for some time. And I kind of didn't register Hedwig's death at first. I just thought "wait what just happened" and had to reread it.

Dumbledore's and Fred's death was sad, Tonks' and Remus' too but Dobby hit me the most. I was literally sobbing when I read how Harry dug his grave.

I was cheering when Bellatrix died and felt a sense of calmness when Voldemort finally went too.

** Cedric - I was too young to register what happened and I was more upset about the fact that there was no House Cup that year. I might have started to figure out what a traumatic experience was for others only in Book 5 when Harry is haunted by nightmares of Cedric's murder. And the scene in the movie is quite sad.

Sirius - that was the hardest one for me especially that Harry is so full of despair at first and eventually he becomes so sad. I was kind of hoping that Sirius would show up in the mirror and I always believed that Book 6 will contain an angsty Harry.

Dumbledore - it was just really sad but also a bit scary because there were still so many questions left unanswered and Harry no longer had a mentor. I sort of suspected that he planned his death with Snape, however I was hoping he'd pull a Gandalf the White and had only faked his death.

Hedwig - I didn't really register it. It was too much of a minor character to care about her. Harry doesn't seem to think much about it either.

Dobby - that was probably the second saddest death for me. It's interesting that even after so many losses, Harry could still suffer so much when he lost a friend.

Fred - while this one is sad for Harry, I didn't really like the twins much so I didn't really care. I think it would have been more tragic if Percy, who had just returned to his family, would have died.

Snape - I wasn't really sad or anything but I was a little bit shocked about the gory death he received... and a bit excited because I was looking forward to find out what his story.

Remus and Tonks - were also hard to registered because among so many deaths, Harry just notices their bodies for a few seconds. I honestly felt sadder for Collin who adored Harry and all Harry could think while seeing his body was that he looked tiny in death.

Bellatrix - was glad to be rid of her. My least favorite types of characters are sadists.

Voldemort - a little sad because the story was over.

** Cedric

"What? No, not fair!" I started crying when his spirit/wand-afterimage asked Harry to take his body back to his parents.

Sirius

Pure shock. I don't even think I cried, I was just so frozen about how suddenly it happened.

Dumbledore

A weird mix of really sad and "well he is the mentor, so duh!" (I was a young adult at this point and had seen enough "wise old mentors" die in stories to get a bit jaded.)

Hedwig

A bit sad and pretty annoyed because it did not have to be that way if they had just let her fly on her own. But so much other stuff was happening so fast there that I barely had time to be sad for her for long.

Fred

Sad and oddly relieved it was not Percy. (Because at least everybody could mourn Fred without mixed feelings, plus I am not a big fan of "redemption equals death". And, yeah, I like Percy better than the twins.)

Snape

Mostly shocked by HOW it happened. I had thought even Voldemort would not kill a minion he considered loyal. (Even if, yeah, his reasons made sense, at least. But why make the death hurtful and long for your loyal minion, eben if you think death it must be?) Sad, but only a little bit.

Remus and Tonks

Crying. From that point on I think I cried my way through the book. Crying because "but they just married." because "Remus should have SOMETHING good happen in his life, not die like this." because "damnit, poor Teddy, poor Andromeda!"... I also got a bit angry at them, because I found both of them going onto a battlefield with a baby at home really, really stupid. I thought only Remus should have gone, because Androneda already lost her husband and Teddy needed at least one of his parents.

Harry

"Well, this won't stick."

Bellatrix

"Well done, Molly!" - Followed by... "I kind of expected Neville to be the one to kill her, though."

Voldemort

Happy he was dead, not extremely happy by the way his death happened, but not exactly unsatisfied either. Just, he had to die, obviously, and this worked all right.

I was disappointed in Percy when he acted like an idiot, but I somewhat could understand how it had come to that. I held faith he'd come to realise he was being stupid up to the point he indeed did.

The twins annoyed me from nearly the very beginning and I just most of the time do not like the whole "twins act as if they are basically one person in two bodies"-thing.

** I am ready to fight JKR on sight for killing Sirius and Remus. I cried reading about Sirius way back when it first came out. Fred and Tonks also make me sad I def cried for Fred. Also I feel like Sirius and Remus made no sense to kill off and was such a fumbled opportunity especially Sirius.

Cedric was sad but we didn't know him well.

Dumbledore I was kinda sad about back when book came out but now I smile thinking about it.

**** I think Dumbledore was low key very manipulative when I replay events it seems like he wanted Harry to grow up to die in battle with Voldemort and kept him isolated. I blame him for Sirius death and Sirius not being proven innocent while alive. I think it's really suspect he didn't know what happened with Peter/Sirius and supposedly didn't go to investigate during all those years...other stuff...I think he had greater good in mind but a grey moral way of going about it.

Snape I think comes off pretty different in the books vs movies and in the books he's inappropriate and cruel with children who are like primary school age. He's a bigot and never renounced those beliefs. He was fine to let Harry and James die when he heard about the prophecy. Had Neville been chosen one he wouldn't have switched sides. He claimed he loved lily but did lots of fucked up stuff to his beloved's child. He was petty and immature.

** - Cedric

Wow...he's gone...

Cedric was the first major death of a big book like this I had ever come across--I was eight years old.

- Sirius

I was floored. I read the book in three days and I was absolutely stunned. It wasn't easy keeping this secret from my mom and brother. I wound up telling my dad, who doesn't read series.

- Dumbledore

I was mad as hell. I wanted to make Snape /pay./

- Hedwig

I was shocked. It was unexpected. It was like stabbing me in the gut.

- Dobby

Mortified is the best word to use here. I didn't see it coming and I was deeply disturbed.

- Fred

This one hurt. This one hurt bad. I'm a twin.

- Snape

I wasn't surprised in the least. But the realization of what was coming when Voldemort began talking about the Elder Wand...yeah.

- Remus (and Tonks)

Back to back gut punches. The hell of war.

- Harry (kind of)

Saw this coming a mile away. That doesn't mean that I wasn't moved by Harry's quiet resolve to do it.

- Bellatrix

Justice!

- Voldemort

Finally!

** /Cedric/: Fine? How it affected Harry hurt more I think.

/Sirius/: I was confused? Because the door thing is never really explained so I assumed he was going to come back.

/Dumbledore/: shock at the time. But we all were when the books first came out. Now, after 20 years of hindsight I'm kinda glad.

/Hedwig/: I genuinely missed her death when I first read it because it happened so fast. I couldn't believe it at all.

/Dobby/: THIS ONE WAS MEAN

/Fred/: shock and absolute horror and I'm still not over it at all. Poor George.

/Snape/: Satisfaction at the time because he was such an villian throughout the books. In hindsight, just pity. I don't think he's a good person but jesus he had a shit ol life and death by snake is cruel.

/Remus/: Very sad at the time. Now, Remus is my absolute favourite character and I refuse to believe he is dead. Sad for Tonks but shes not a favourite character of mine so eh. Teddy though... And Andromeda, them I'm heartbroken for.

/Bellatrix/: Pure giddy glory

/Voldemort/: triumph. It was inevitable and the drama did build. The way it's done in the book is so mundane, it's lovely and poetic. In the film it doesn't have the emotional punch but it's very cinematic which you needed for the film.

/Saddest for/: Remus... I love him, im so so sad he died...

**** Two reasons.

1) I read a lot as a kid but certainly reading Dumbledores death was impactful at the time. It was on the news like, it was a thing. And to have such an important character that I grew up with and shaped my childhood be killed off so ruthlessly. That hurt. It was the first time I remember a book hurting me. Which I think is important. Looking back it showed how much these books and characters meant to me.

2) In hindsight, reading these books as a mid twenties teacher, Dumbledore is a terrible teacher and a suuuper manipulative person and should not be in charge of kids so I'm kinda glad he got his comeuppance!

****** He does nothing for anybody unless he gets something in return. Remus and Sirius are key examples.

Harry gets routinely tortures in the Graveyard and Dumbledore sends Sirius out of the room even though Harry "did not want Sirius to leave".

He then forcably isolates Harry over the summer, this includes only allowing his friends limited contact.

He continues to isolate Harry all year even though CLEARLY that's a terrible idea that anyone could have pointed out since it just makes the boy who keeps getting into dangerous situations because of his lack of trust in adults, not trust adults even more which leads to Sirius's death.

This is highlighted in the 2 chapter of HBP when Harry falls asleep at the window, not even packing because he doesn't trust that Dumbledore will even show up despite the letter.

Also, Snape? For Occlumency lessons?? Snape is supposed to be a double agent. So Harry coming to the completely natural assumption that he's opening up his mind to the dark lord would only increase Harry's mistrust of adults. And also SNAPES A DOUBLE AGENT and working for Voldemort at this point. Which means he has to report to Voldy at some point and will undoubtly have to tell Voldy about what he's doing at Hogwarts?? Why give the known double agent that job? It's just asking for trouble.

I mean... I get people have their own opinions of Dumbledore. Great, he's a fictional character, hold him to whatever standard you like it makes no difference in the real world. And everything Dumbledore does (doesn't do more like) drives the mystery and plot so I get it!

But morally... Nah... I do not trust that man at all. Everything he does he does for his own motivations over the needs of others and I will never like a person like that.

He effectively becomes Dumbledores lacky, sworn to protect Harry in spite of anything. He doesn't like Harry, but he's under oath to let him not die. -Snape has no choice here. No way out. Then he is forced, under Dumbledores orders, to become a spy again for Voldemort essentially sealing his since there's no way he was going to survive that job.

He's never truly free at any point in his life. Never just out of oath or obligation to any person. He's always under the orders of someone higher. He deserved it, he made the oaths but still, that's sad really isn't it?

Dumbledore just would have told someone else about the ring curse and to kill him to pass the elder wand to them instead. Because I think Snape knew about Horcruxes? Even if he didn't know Harry was one and that's the reason he was useful.

Dumbledore wouldn't have actively killed him but he certainly wouldn't have tried particularly hard to save them. Same as he didn't particularly try with the Potters.

I don't think Dumbledore had friends, or knew what it was to have them. So I think he cared for people because they were useful. Not because he loved them. Not in the same way you would love a friend.

But he wouldn't know that because he doesn't know what it's like to have friends for the sake of friendship.. know what I mean?

I think people idolised Dumbledore. Respected him, feared him, appreciated him, honoured him. A portion of those liked him, a larger portion were wary of him...

But Snape? Snape was indebted to Dumbledore. Under oath to serve him to protect Harry. Nothing Snape did was out of love for Dumbledore. So if Dumbledore cared for Snape it was in the same way one cares for something useful that you own. As much as Dumbledore believed that friendship to be real, it wasn't. He just thought that was what caring was supposed to be.

Snape I was super happy. Like, ear-to-ear smile when he finally died.

The rest, including Harry, I didn't really give a shit about. Rowling did such a good job of making Harry unlikable in Books 6 and 7, that I was a little disappointed when he got up. And Voldemort going down to a spell used in 2nd year was a huge "yawn"; I remember reading the final "battle" (hard to call it that) and flipping to the end to see how many pages were left, trying to decide whether or not it was worth investing the time in a story I'd come to care so little about.

**** I don't hate them, except canon!Harry and Snape. But they weren't written in ways that made them sympathetic to me; it was bad character development.

Let's take your list, and exclude Dobby/Hedwig/Sirius and Snape/Harry, as I said those deaths I found upsetting/enjoyed their deaths.

Cedric: intro'd in PoA for a few pages, then appears in a fair portion of GoF, dies at the end. Not a lot of time to get attached.

Dumbledore: I am not a basher, but the guy did knowingly send an infant to an abusive household. Consider Harry lived in a cupboard, was barely fed, never got a single present, and was constantly emotionally and occasionally physically (? we're not sure, JKR was understandably evasive on this) abused. In the real world, Voldemort or no, DD deserved a prison sentence.

Fred: Weasleys were a dime a dozen. Never felt much attachment to any of them except Percy and Arthur. Felt like I was reading The Weasley Family Chronicles and not Harry Potter at several points in canon. And frankly, for having 8 members of the family fighting, losing only 1 wasn't that devastating.

Remus/Tonks: I might have felt bad for Remus if JKR didn't have our last image of him be as a new father trying to abandon his wife and son in the middle of a war. Tonks, well, again - newborn son at home, and she decides to go fight a (seemingly) hopeless battle. Heroic, maybe, but also negligent. Teddy deserved better than these two.

Voldemort/Bellatrix: did anyone NOT expect the two main baddies to die at the end? Anyway, when they finally were killed, again, it was incredibly unsatisfying. Bellatrix, arguably the 2nd or 3rd most dangerous magic user in Britain, offed by a pudgy ginger housewife. 🤮 Voldemort, killed by a nonlethal spell so that our "hero" didn't have to grapple with ANY morally grey areas. Even if Voldemort was nothing more than a cardboard cutout of a villain, that was a really weak end to his reign of terror.

All in all, I don't think I felt much in the way of emotion from anything past GoF. I read all 7 books as an adult, 1 book per day, during spring break my junior year of college, so maybe I was just expecting a higher quality of storytelling than JKR is capable of. She's an amazing children's author (PS/CoS/PoA are still some of the greatest "sense of wonder" books I've ever read), but absolutely shit at any sort of YA/adult narrative. She didn't have the ability to write for her audience as they grew up.
