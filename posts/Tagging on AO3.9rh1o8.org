Perhaps this is a silly question, but the thread from earlier about ffn vs. ao3 regularly mentions the very annoying over-use of tags on the latter.

I'm just interested in how different people define 'overuse.' When I first start posting there I found a few threads about this topic on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] and used those as my guide, but I'm curious what the thoughts of this particular fandom are.(Apologies if there is such a thread here and I just couldn't find it.)

For myself, I never allow tags to go beyond the fourth line. Never more than 10 character-related tags (and only for characters who are truly important to the story), tags for the main relationship(s) (if any) only, a few tags for genre/time period/main themes, and a few with relevant warnings (e.g., Explicit Language). Never any silly/made up ones.

What do the rest of you think?


** My only issue is if something that took up maybe two sentences in 100k words gets tagged. Maybe it's a post-GoF fic and there's a /single/ mention of the Yule ball in passing, so it gets tagged as Hermione/Viktor even though they're not together at any point in the story.

I sometimes use the tags to decide what /not/ to read, and using them for every little detail makes that hard to do.

**** To add to this, a lot of NSFW Tags have the same issue. Tagging bondage when there's a single sentence about using handcuffs once two years prior to the start of the fic just gives people the wrong idea of your fic.

** Lots of over-tagging on AO3 is just very minor detail being tagged. Like, I don't want to read your fic that's tagged as F/M, M/M, and F/F, when the relationships for M/M and F/F are relatively unimportant. Or when you list a ship that is background. Or when a character that hasn't even appeared yet is listed, especially if they're unimportant.

The other big problem in my opinion is the misuse of additional tags. It's nice and all that you want to put some of your thoughts into the tags, but when your additional tag section triples the number of lines your tags take up with stuff like "Draco is so cute" or "Neko Harry is the best", or "Fluff", "Like so much fluff", "I'm not kidding", etc, then that's a problem. People need to be more succinct.

** There's 2 annoying habits in Ao3 tagging IMO.

The obvious one is the tendency for some authors to overtag. It feels like over a third of all stories listed has like 5+ lines of tags, several which are joke tags, characters that take up 2 sentences or similar, and some which are just redundant. I've seen more than once stories that tags a ship 2-3 times in different variations. You don't need to tag A&B /and/ A/B (I suppose the idea is friendship-to-romance? I think there is an actual tag for this that is far less misleading), nor do you need to tag A/B, B/A.

The second issue to me, is red herring shipping tags. If I am looking for a specific ship, I have no interest in reading stories where said thing happened in the past and has overall no bearing on the story, or isn't even a real ship unless you intentionally draw dubious conclusions. Examples would be Cormac/Hermione because Slughorn (yeah because that was totally a real thing), or tagging Severitus as Sev/Lily (clearly Harry was created /somehow/, but the 2 tags give me 2 completely different expectations of a story)

*** The way I see it, A&B should be for meaningful friendshippy interaction between A & B, while A/B should be for a substantial relationship between A & B. So there is still a certain amount of information gained from tagging both. For example, a lot of angsty James/Lily fics are all about their relationship but don't really have them being friends, so I'd tag it James/Lily and not James & Lily. Otoh, something like Scorpius/Albus that has their relationship (like kissing or something, declarations of love, dates, etc.) but also scenes of them just hanging out or supporting each other as friends should probably have both Scorpius/Albus and Scorpius & Albus tagged.

** It's the same as everyone seems to be saying.\\
Characters: Only characters that I actually mean to develop in the story. Any auxillary characters that are only there to say a line or two are not included.\\
Relationships: Only main relationships. If a particular relation exists in background, there is almost no reason to include it in the tags unless it is mentioned all the time.\\
Other: Warning tags, some related to the main theme/ character descriptive ones like BAMF!Harry (But I try to use those sparingly and only if they are a thing in the fandom)

When reading, I tend to avoid fics that have so many tags that I can't be bothered to go through them because then even if there is something I like in the tags I am not sure how much of it there would be in the fic.

*** Thanks-- I see your point. I do only have one with 8 characters tagged, but it's a major ensemble cast, so I think that one's justified (and there aren't any pairings, so it was the only way to show main characters.) Still, it's helpful to hear this.

** Sometimes it seems AO3 authors focus more on the tags than actually writing a story. It's as if I'm reading the outline of their story when reading the tags, particularly when the stuff in the tags hasn't been written yet (and never will for most abandoned stories).

When it comes to pairing or character tags they are just noise if they are of no consequence to the story.

AO3 has a great and very powerful search engine, but the verbose use of tags makes it almost impossible to use. Maybe this could be solved by allowing users to vote on tags and adding the option to the search to only search tags above a certain strength threshold. Overall I think the way ffn does it (limiting the amount of tags) is the better approach.

I really like your idea about voting on tags.\\
I've also wondered if it would be possible for ao3 to only show the first two or three lines of tags on the main screen and then the rest of them (if there are any more) once someone clicks on the story.

** You have to remember what people are using tags for. If I search using the "Harry Potter" tag, it's because I want to read a fic about Harry. If I search using the "Harry/Fleur" tag, it's because I want the story to be about Harry/Fleur.

In short: only tag the elements which are absolutely central to your story. Specifically:

- Don't tag pairings which are not the pairing of the protagonist.

- Don't tag "Harry Potter" if he's not the PoV character.

Genre tags are whatever, because no one is searching using those. Go nuts with them if you want.

Of course, all of this could be avoided if AO3 had included extra fields for:

- Point of view characters

- Main characters

- Secondary characters

- Point of view pairings

- Other pairings

*** I pretty much agree with all this, though I'm surprised to see you say that no one searches genre tags. I do that all time when I'm bored and want to read, say, a time-travel fic or a humorous fic. It often helps me locate stories I've otherwise overlooked.

I suppose I could compare genre tags to themed C2s on ffn. Sure, they aren't actually recommendations, but they help me focus on what I might be in the mood for.

** The thing that frustrates me most personally is the ridiculous tagging of relationships. I prefer stories with little to no focus on the romance so I would prefer to limit my searches to gen fics, but people insist on adding the gen tag to stories that are focused on pairings which completely defeats the purpose.

Ideally tags should be used to allow people to find the stories they would enjoy as easily as possible, and for authors to advertise their story to find an audience but people adding tags for things no matter how irrelevant to the story really makes it difficult. With Ao3 I pretty much only look for specific rare pairings or characters and rely on other peoples recommendations rather than slogging through Ao3 on my own for any length of time.

Second general rule of thumb: is this tag going to be entered by someone searching for a story? Or is it trying to do a job that the summary should be doing, i.e. explaining what the fic is broadly about?

** I am fairly new to the ao3 community, and I start to wonder how all this tagging actually works. I posted the beginning of a story and tagged all themes the story will include at some point. Some of them may even be redundant, such as "assassins&hitmen" and "crimes&criminals", but I did it because I thought that some readers will search for only one of them, and if I'd be using the other one, they wouldn't find my story.\\
