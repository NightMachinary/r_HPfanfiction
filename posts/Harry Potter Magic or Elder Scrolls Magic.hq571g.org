I was just sitting here day dream when I wondered: If you had the choice would you choose to have one or the other which would you choose. The magic of Harry Potter or the Elder Scrolls?

What if you were in the Elder Scrolls world and could choose either one?


** Personally i would go with elder scrolls magic. You don't have to worry about loseing a wand and learning the spells are as easy as reading books. That and fire balls!

*** I like the versatility of Harry Potter magic. Wide variety of Charms(Expansion/Reparo/Shrinking/Enlarging/Cooling/Heating/Rapid Plant Growth), preservation magic, Duplication, etc.

Major upside for the Elder Scrolls magic is Restoration and Alteration. Healing, even spells to cure diseases and of course Transmutation to create silver and gold from iron. That spell, if it were known to that world in real life, would be illegal especially if they don't have a way to distinguish between real and transmuted metals(if they aren't considered "real/natural"). Way too easy to mess up the economy.

I just think Harry Potter magic would have a lot more utility in the real world. Never mind in Elder Scrolls especially with food growth/preservation. Perhaps even enchanted items and magical prostetics.

** Elder scrolls grants you immortality way easier than Harry Potter.

It's like Harry Potter Magic was created to make immortality bad or impractical.

*** Definitely agree about the immortality stuff, Looking Back I hate how Preachy the HP Books were about immortality. and it was there from Book one with Dumbledore preaching about how bad the Philosopher's Stone was.

** It's an interesting question. One that really makes me want to read a crossover of Harry Potter and Elder Scrolls.

For Harry Potter magic, it really depends if we're talking about what we see in the books or if fandom headcanons are included.

In the TES magic category I would also include potions, alchemy and enchanting.

In my opinion, both can be viable options if not for the fact that we don't really know HP magic as well as TES. We don't know the true limits of HP magic, we only see it from the perspective of a student in a school in a society where a lot of TES magic would be considered Dark and Forbidden.

*** But you can just wear 4 enchanted clothes/armor to do that. Hell... if you drink restoration potion first, you can reduce it to one.

*** Nope. Lore is included as well, though that doesn't mean you can learn/use it.

** It depends. If my life stayed the same as it was otherwise, I would definitely go with Harry Potter magic. There's a lot of nifty everyday stuff there. What use do I have for fireballs, summoning daedra and raising the dead?

** Harry Potter, it's far more versatile and there's no limited magicka pool holding you back.

Unless you're including Morrowind alchemy in which case it's time for a fortify intelligence potion loop.

TES magic just isn't particularly suited to mundane life, there's a few neat things like mark and recall, and healing, but it's very combat focused
