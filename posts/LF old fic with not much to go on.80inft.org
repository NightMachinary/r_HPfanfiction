I remember pieces of it. I think dudly and petunia died, and somehow that made Vernon understand Harry better. I do remember that Harry was interested in photography and was taking pictures in the basement of a shop at some point.

They may have gone to Japan, which is probably why I abandoned it, but you never know.

Its a long shot, but my Google fu isn't working right now.

Thanks!
