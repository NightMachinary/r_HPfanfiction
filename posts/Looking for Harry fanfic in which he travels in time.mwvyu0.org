Hi! I'm looking for a fanfic that I read on archiveofourown.com It was something like Harry Potter traveling back in time (2nd or 3rd year) and finding the ravenclaw diadem. When he put it on, he merged with him, and I think it left scars on his head? The diadem has as its own consciousness, and ends with three consciousnesses on its head, Potter, the diadem and two fragments of Voldemort. At some point, he encloses the two fragments in his mental landscape, shaped like a snake, and draws information from them before getting rid of them. Does anyone know what it is?
