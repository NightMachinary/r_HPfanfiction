I've been looking for some Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione fics that fill in some of the time between the end of book 7 and the epilogue. But the standard I've been finding hasn't been great. What are your favourites?

** To cut away the chaff, search Northumbrian and little0bird out. They have plenty of post DH works with canon pairings. Once that's finished, you should be able to start cutting through the lesser fics.
