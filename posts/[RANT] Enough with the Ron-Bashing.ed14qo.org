It's okay not to like a character. It's okay to ship H/Hr. It's okay to make Ron an antagonist. But seriously, knock it off with the Ron-bashing. From posts and stories that go with the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebgul3/lf_or_prompt_harryhermione_where_harry_is/]["Harry could have been so much better without Ron" to "Ron's completely terrible to Hermione"]] circlejerk. It's old and annoying.

Then there's the fic writers that go the whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13951734/chapters/32504820]["We aren't bashing him but jk we're bashing him"]], {see the Notes at the end}. The very least you can do is put up bash warnings so I don't get slammed with it midway through the fic. The bashing isn't even well-done or realistic, it's all over-the-top, hammy rubbish. For all the flack the OP/Indy! Harry harem fics get, at least the writers are considerate enough to put warnings in the summary/ANs so that I don't have to read 30k words to find out I'm reading yet another bash-fic.

Hermione (who, besides Luna, is constantly praised to high heaven) isn't perfect. Somehow, I don't think Hermione [[https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/stan][stans]] get that. For all the 'Ron is a terrible person' comments, if anyone turned out to be abusive/inconsiderate/emotional range of a teaspoon in HP, Hermione places number one. Lavander's pet anyone? Scabbers anyone? Canaries anyone? But she was 'in love'. She was 'right'. She was 'x/y/z'. You could debate Ron was in love during the 4th year Yule Ball showdown, but that doesn't make what Ron did okay. Linkao3(18935341) does a wonderful job showing that actions have consequences, as well as the now-deleted [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cG0ggDFhGDZ1VFyj_Xqpm2L8bMcJGj71sYw55pAxJlU/edit?usp=sharing][Amortentia]].

What makes this even worse is that the second Hermione bashing comes into play, Hermione stans come out to cape for their princess. All you need to see is the upvote ratio for all the posts asking about Hermione-bashing here to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/agm399/hermione_bashing/][see]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bkp5t6/hermionebashing_with_no_ron_bashing/][my]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/75iztv/lf_hermione_bashing/][point]]. Hermione can't be a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c1we6t/lf_fics_where_hermione_is_just_a_background/][background character]] without an issue. Hermione can't [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/al2hou/lf_fics_where_harry_and_ron_are_friends_with_each/][not even be friends with Harry and Ron]] either, because they're the 'Golden Trio' (unless you want to kick Ron out, then it's okay because they don't need him anyway. Harmony forever! /s).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Bashing-Ron-in-Harmony/124365/][Ron]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dumbledore-And-Or-Weasley-Bashing/129069/][bashing]] is super [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-and-Hermione-with-bashings-of-Weaselys-and-or-Albus-D/88134/][common]], but Hermione bashing? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Of-Bashing-and-Slash/121511/][Pretty]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/][uncommon]], and even then it's more 'calling out flaws/critical' than outright bashing. Or tied in with the Weasley/Dumbledore bashing.

I know every story needs a conflict, but the Ron-bashing is so overdone it's literally a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RonTheDeathEater/HarryPotter][trope]]. Be creative and try something new (or at least, not commonly done). Flip the script. Setting up H/Hr doesn't need to equate to a Ron bash-fic. If you really don't like him, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13040642/1/You-Poked-A-Dragon][kill him off]] and be done with it.


** Being someone who actually likes Ron as a character, wants to use him, and is also a HHr shipper presents some problems, because the flat truth is it is very hard to get away from the bashing at times.

I'd have to disagree with your appraisal of Hermione, though only in part. The equally flat truth is that fandoms love to round off the edges of some characters and turn other ones into nothing but edge.

That being said, keep in mind that in the end, there are more of a thing usually because there is more of a demand for the thing. We can debate the validity of Ron-bashing and show the flaws and the like, but in the end there is only so much that can be done. The market is there, and folks will provide for the demand.

**** I try to keep things level. I think some of this is just the nature of perception. A good example is in this very thread you've got folks arguing about Ron's leaving during DH, and folks are going to take that different ways, and so on. It's not the only instance that JK has written things that, while sure you can make arguments for them the implications can be taken some very different ways. A lot of characters have these, Dumbledore and Ron being two of the biggest, though Hermione does as well even if they sometimes get ignored.

And, like, I get it too cus I've had some rather heated arguments in HHr circles about Ron and the Weasley's in general. Ron also has the unfortunate place of being both a ship rival and one of the characters with some dubious actions that are going to get judged variously by various people, and you get a perfect storm.

And it's sort of a shame because truth be told, HHr stories where Ron is competently handled are some of my faves, particularly when there is drama between the group, there is addressing of the issues on all side, and so on, because Ron is a very human character and that's interesting to read about, when done well.

At the very least, I 100% agree that folks should label stories better, though I think some of that sort of comes from the fact that many folks don't think bashing IS bashing even when they do it.

Sharing their ambition to become Aurors, they investigate the suspicious activities taking place at school.

Like grow the fuck up man, this is actually important shit here and you're being a moody teen! The angst is so strong it could beat the hulk up right now.

He's a realistic character in some ways, funny and cool in others, then lastly an angsty whiny bitch friend I would have cut loose in others.

It makes him hard to love and hard to hate. He is a fair bit complex simply because he has stood by Harry over and over until this one point. Where he is just acting like a normal hormone driven, dumb as hell, angsty insecure teenage boy. How can you stay mad at that, what burn your high school yearbook?

Here's a snippet:

#+begin_quote
  But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet...

  "I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."

  But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.

  "I'm tired!" he bellowed finally, (*after nearly half an hour.* )"No, seriously, George - I'm going to bed -"
#+end_quote

There's no way that Ron didn't hear the "blast of noise" when Harry came in. But Harry remains downstairs with his admirers for nearly a half-hour before he comes upstairs to find Ron. Which gives Ron a half-hour to brood about why if Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, Ron's upstairs alone with zero information while Harry hangs out with his admirers downstairs.

And things don't go well when Harry finally does show up.

#+begin_quote
  He [Ron] looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been?" Harry said.
#+end_quote

Not a great start from Harry. Harry means it as "why weren't you there for moral support?" But to Ron, this registers as "Why weren't you downstairs congratulating me at the party with the others?"

Since we see the books from Harry's POV, we know that Harry wasn't really a voluntary participant in his own party. But Ron doesn't know this. Harry shows up thirty minutes "late" with a Gryffindor banner tied around his neck and looking like he's enjoyed spending the last 30 minutes being praised by the entire house.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. (*He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."*)

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.

  "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."

He abandoned his friend in the middle of a war that only he could end. We saw Ron, Hermione, and Harry at their very lowest. Hermione is literally tortured and she stays loyal. Harry finds out he has to die and accepts his fate willingly. Ron gives up and leaves with the lives of the country at stake after a couple weeks.

The only reason he didn't immediately come back was because he got caught by Snatchers and when he escaped both Harry and Hermione had already left.

Ron also had the most to lose considering his entire family would be screwed if he was caught and was also the only one among the trio who had the option to not fight in the war and live a relatively normal life.

I don't even have the words for this one. First you claim the horcrux made him make a poor decision, then you claim the logic he used to make his poor decision was actually super legit? You can't have it both ways. Either Ron fucked up, or you agree with his decision.

Ron was not badly injured. He had a flesh wound on his arm from where he was splinched, yes, but that is not an injury that would be devastating enough to still be influencing him weeks later. Especially not with magic to help heal him.

No, it would be akin to going AWOL from your unit directly into enemy sympathizers, then having second thoughts but your unit has already moved on without you because they have a job to do. Again, it cannot be understated that Ron made the choice to abandon the mission he knows is required for the war to be won. Did he regret it and try to get back and help? Yes, and that's why Ron isn't an irredeemable turncoat. But he still made the decision to abandon his friends and compatriots in the most important time in their lives. That's not something some people can look past.

****** Because he had the most insecurities among the trio,. Also the points I made in addition were to show why the horcrux was affecting him the most. He was the most insecure among the trio, he had the most to lose among the trio while at the same time being the only one who did not have to fight. So yeah you can have it both ways.

Also he was badly injured based on what the book said where it mentioned he was lying in a pool of his own blood, that's not just a simple flesh wound.

Once again, I guess you blame Ginny for attempting to murder the Hogwarts students?

He made that choice while under the influence of the Horcrux, after it wore off he tried to come back. If he did not have the Horcrux on the whole situation wouldn't have happened.

The biggest thing here is the Horcrux, it was said it affected Ron so I don't see why you keep ignoring it and act as though Ron left for no other reason. He wanted to return immediately after doing it.

Also are we gonna ignore Harry repeatedly telling him to leave which further pushed Ron into leaving? Or that the important mission Ron was on was going absolutely nowhere for weeks since they had zero plans at all which was another reason the arguement started in the first place? This mission of great importance was pretty much stuck with no where to go with even Hermione being disappointed with their whole situation. All of these made it easier for the Horcrux to affect him even more.

There were many things involved in Ron leaving, and putting all the blame on him while ignoring the outside forces influencing his decision is not fair on him.

**** Little reminder of the events :

- Ron leaves
- Immeditalely wants to come back, but is caught by a band of Snatcher
- Takes some times to escape them, but when he is back, Harry and Hermione left
- During the following weeks, tried to locate them and only did it thanks to the Deluminator, and the fact that Harry left the protections of their tent.

He litterally went to cool off. The only reason he was absent for so long is because of a succession of events (and Rowling's will), if he had not apparated right next to Snatcher, or if Harry had chosen to wait a little before leaving, he would have been back the same day. Hell, he would even have been back a day earlier if Harry didn't decide to apparate under the Cloak.

Things you say when you haven't read the series in a long time and miss the moral.

I enjoy prodigious/studious Harry, but that's not canon Harry, outside defense, the dark arts, and Quidditch because the story is about an abnormal kid who wants to be normal; play a sport and date girls but he keeps finding himself in abnormal situations.

Ron is his best friend because he is as normal as you could make a wizard and because he's fun. The biggest problem with Cho, outside Marietta, was that she wasn't fun. He's always looking for a laugh. Also, Ron doesn't hate learning. He's right there practicing spells with Harry in GOF and beyond. Ron just doesn't think you should spend all your life in a library.

Lastly, H/Hr fans ignoring that Harry took jabs at Hermione in PS and was on Ron's side for most arguments will always be fascinating and funny.

I do too. Writers could easily make Ron join in for a number of reasons (defence against the twins, for instance) or have him quietly sit out. Instead, they go the complete opposite extreme and make him an over-the-top berk.

That's what I am playing with in the fic I am writing now. Harry has oopsed himself without realizing it and is trying to find where he can fit in now. This is the best description of his personality in canon I have ever read.

I'm also working from the emotionally stunted angle. Not fully canon but there is no way he has a normal emotional framework to work with. I think that's part of why he enjoys Ron so much as well. He doesn't have a barometer of normal healthy friendships or interactions. He uses the reactions of Ron and the roommates as his guide on how to behave. Without them he is now a bit lost in my fic.

Ron is so... "normal" compared to the entire Wizarding World. It's odd, because people ship Hermione and Draco, and yet Draco did WAY worse stuff then anything Ron did, but oh it's okay, because Draco is misunderstood, he was following his father's orders. (Saying what people normally say with this)

I mean, I love Draco, he's one of my favorites, but he was an asshole, who was prejudice, rude, a coward, and so much more.

Ron made mistakes, but he wasn't like Draco, he was A LOT better then him. He's insecure, and uncertain about where his place is in the world. With so many siblings, it's easy for him to feel overshadowed or underappreciated.

I don't mind stories where Harry and Draco are friends, or become friends later in life, but I can't handle Ron bashing anymore.

Well, it is to be expected :

- Harry and Draco are rich (canon showed Draco's house, or his lifestyle, and if you read most Ron basher's stories, Harry is so much richer he makes the Malfoys pass for the Weasleys)
- Both of them are attractive (we all remember Leather Pant Draco, and Harry went to jog and do push up during the summer, and does Quidditch, so he is ripped)
- They are popular (yes, Harry seemed to regularly talk to 10 people his age, hald of them Weasleys, and we never saw Draco being friendly outside of his gowns and 2 or 3 Slytherins, but the rest of the school look up to them, promise)
- As for Hermione, she is a self insert character, so of course she is incredibly attractive, like just under Fleur or even equal (even if idiot boys took years to notice it), a genius (the brightest witch of their age) and sooooooo perfect.

It is obvious such perfect character will have a little more leeway than a peasant like Ronald Weasley. The riches and attractives are always easier to forgive (and by saying it, I have some HP MoR flashbacks).

Is there a way for Harry to grow apart from Ron without it being bashing and more organic? If we look at realism, people's friend groups change all the time and it's quite normal.

That said I would agree that the bashing is excessive, though I do think that if there's a break up between Ron/Hernione and Harry/Ginny, people can be underestimating how messy that can get.

But seriously, just close the window and move on. There's alot of fic that does nothing for me and that's what I do.

** Yeah omg poor Ron. He so doesn't deserve all the shit that fanfic writers give him. And yeah Hermione is wayy overhyped. Like Hermione is my fav character, probably because I identified with her as a nerdy girl when I read the books the first time around, but honestly even I can admit that Ron is a wonderful friend in many ways Hermione is not. But I actually watched a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzxwcBZFuI][youtube vid]] a little while ago that I think does a good job of explaining perhaps one reason where all the Ron-bashing comes from. Basically, it's about how the movies totally portray Ron differently from how he is in canon in the books (prob because of the director bias), and how some of Ron's best moments are taken away and given to Hermione, and Ron is just portrayed as stupid comic relief. I don't want to get into the specifics of it but if you want to watch the vid you'll see what I mean.

But also adding on to the point of the movies influencing fanfic writers (and kind of making them forget about the books), I think that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness_stereotype][attractiveness bias/stereotype]] comes into play here. The attractiveness bias is basically the idea that people view beautiful people as also "possessing other socially desirable personality traits". Like, the fact that Emma Watson is (conventionally) beautiful and Rupert Grint isn't (I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be mean, I promise) definitely affects the way that people view their characters as well. Like in fanfictions where Hermione and Ron don't end up together, I think writers figure that they'd rather have their audience be sympathetic to the pretty one. Which is whack. Anyways, I could be reading too far into human psychology but that's just my two cents.

Edit: Sorry just wanted to add one thing! I think a lot of people think they're poorly matched, which also prob adds to it. Honestly, I think they're poorly matched too, but obviously thats nobody's fault. But I think a lot of people who want to write Hermione and Ron in ships outside of romione are too lazy to actually write something realistic and complex to explain their breakup, so they just pin Ron as the bad guy and let Hermione get off scot-free and on the moral high ground.
