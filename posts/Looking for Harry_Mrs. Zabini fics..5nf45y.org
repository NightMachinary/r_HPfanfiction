I have looked for but never found a Harry x Mrs. Zabini and I'm wondering if anybody here could recommend one? I like the thought of Harry stealing the heart of the Black Widow of the Harry Potter universe.

So has anybody found anything?

I think it would be the other way around.

And literal.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
