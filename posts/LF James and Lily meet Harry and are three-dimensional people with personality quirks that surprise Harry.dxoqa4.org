I've come across a few of these recently like face death in the hope by lullabyknell, a bit of sky by shayalonnie and the devil's white knight (orphaned on ao3).

Basically, I'd like to see

1) Harry meeting James and Lily in any context after growing up without them and realizing that they're more than just the sum of people's stories - they're people with flaws and quirks that'd been lost to the rose-tinted glasses of people's grief, maybe their relationship isn't perfect, maybe they're very pissed to hear they died so young and their son was left all alone

2) no bashing when it comes to James or Lily - I want them to be flawed instead of perfect saintlike martyrs, not terrible parents like many WBWL fics make them out to be.

Preferably the fic

1) doesn't kill off Lily and James by the end

2) includes their reactions to Harry's MANY adventures and mishaps.

In lieu of these, I'd also love to see any fics of Harry interacting with other Potters - unknown branches or time travel and such, it matters not, I just want all my Potter feels <3

Thanks in advance to anyone contributing!


** Linkffn(You Did What! by nonjon)

It's the last part of a trilogy and is kinda crackfick but it has (I think) most of what you're looking for from what I can remember.

** One of my favourite 'Harry meets his parents' fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5757945/1/Too-Far-from-Home][Too Far From Home]] by story2tell linkffn(5757945). In the summer after his fourth year, Harry is transported to a parallel universe where he meets his parents -- along with an older Harry and a younger sister -- but they're incredibly wary of him. The story is fairly slow paced and has a lot of relationship building (lots of Potter feels, trust me), and it does such a great job of portraying Lily and James as fundamentally good but flawed individuals who are conflicted about how they should treat this boy who is not quite their son.

I also really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again][Love and Love Again]] by foreverandnow linkffn(7624618). Harry grows up on the streets / various abusive environments after he is believed to be dead on Halloween. By the time he is found, Lily and James are living relatively happily with a daughter, but they never stopped grieving for Harry. Again, slow paced and Potter feels, with a lot of Sirius on the side.

Neither of these fics are finished, but I highly recommend them!

** linkffn(6780275)

Instead of killing James and Lily Voldemort sends them thirteen years in the future to "witness his triumph". (He also uses the royal "we", but I think it's fitting he'd have such an enormous ego) Harry still beats him as a baby and his parents come back as his name comes out of the Goblet of fire.

Hermione goes to church in this one. It was... weird since most fics don't deal with religion.

â€‹

linkffn(12307886)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][This]] one is interesting because usually Harry travels to a parallel universe, but in this case, the parallel universe comes to Harry just after the final battle. Though be warned that the alternate Potters are not shown in a good light. (Apart from Harry's little sister.)

** Obscura Nox Animae is kind of like this. It's Snape/Lily though... but Lily's body and soul get split when Voldemort kills her and her soul ends up in the body of a mouse (Horcrux style, kind of) and she is then there for Harry during his growing up. She sees Petunia's treatment of him but can't do anything about it. At some point several chapters later Snape finds out. During the final battle she meets Harry for the first time and talks to him.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
