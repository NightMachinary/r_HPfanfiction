Currently working through the summer before year one, I'd appreciate any feedback!


** I like the little changes you've made to make jkr's world better, and I like how you write Dumbledore. My only (really minor) faults with it are my personal dislike for the bank stuff and the trunk. I'm really enjoying how you write Harry and I hope you post more soon!

*** Thanks! I'm about a thousand words into the next chapter, so it should be done by the middle of next week.

** Okay, but like, is there a plot beyond that? Nothing against trans people, but that alone usually isn't going to be enough to base a story off of.

*** Being trans certainly provides enough conflict (vs self, vs society, vs nature) to base a story off of, and that's before considering the fact that HP takes place in the early 90's which increases those factors signicantly. Beyond that, it's still a long form HP fanfic, so obviously there's going to be more to the plot than just Harry being trans. I wouldn't be 25,000 words into the fic and just getting started if that wasn't the case.

**** Okay, but what /is/ that plot? To be frank, "Harry is trans." isn't enough to draw me in.

** Is this going to follow the stations of the canon? I like that you've made some aspects of the world AU, but they seem to be relatively minor. If this isn't going to leave canon rails, I'd advise you to only write the sections that will be noticeably different, because I'm not interested in rereading canon.

** I gave it a skim and can only really echo what others have said here.

You need a plot. "Harry is trans" isn't a plot. It's a character attribute. A related plot could be "Harry fights for LGBTQ+ equality in Magical Britain." That would delve more into politics and, depending on where the focus exactly lies, could appeal to a wide audience. It would also likely take place post-Hogwarts, not before first year.

An extended rehash of canon is not appealing to me, and I doubt it is to many others. Yes, it may be a little different, but it is only a /little/ different.

I guess you don't really /need/ a plot if this is going to be primarily romance. However, if this is going to be primarily romance, do you need to start before first year? Start the story with the divergence from canon.

Like, say, the part where Professor McGonagall shows up instead of Hagrid, and removes Harry from the Dursleys entirely?
