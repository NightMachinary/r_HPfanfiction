It seems to be a common trope to make the villains in Harry Potter fanfiction very... rapey.

It's a convenient way to make the enemy hard to sympathize with (ignoring that villains that you can sympathize with are 1000x better), it meshes well with all but a few of the villains being male, it helps make some people clear victims for someone to rescue, its menacing in a way non sexual violence often isn't.

But, with the exception of some super dark horror-esque, everything goes bad and stays bad fics that suit a certain mood, I am not a fan of it being used as a trope just to raise the stakes in school children conflicts.

So I am introducing my counter-trooe that I will be using in all of my HP stories going forward.

Pureblood magical society is in fact, super sexually repressed. They are less sexually minded, no constant sexualized advertisements, many arranged marriages. They are all super Vanilla, and the thought of raping someone wouldn't even occur to 99% of their worst criminals. Sex is just something you do to produce more purebloods and only inside of marriage.

On the other hand, muggleborns and half bloods are MUCH more adventurous and open, and this is what leads to so many witches and wizards marrying outside of pureblood society. Because muggles are a bunch of radically kinky deviants (at least in pureblood society eyes).

Some support is that with the exception of the Weasley's, I don't recall any pureblood family with more than two children, but the family with a father obsessed with muggles has 7. Fertility based family magic trope? Nope, Arthur just read the Kama Sutra. Muggles wrote the book on sex, and Arthur loves all things muggle.

This of course leads to odd dynamics in a school of hormonal teenagers who outnumber competent chaperones 10 to 1.

A muggleborn and pureblood are friends, and the muggleborn makes a scandalous joke that the pureblood doesn't get.

A pureblood dating a muggleborn comes back after a night out nearly traumatized because she did absolutely unnatural things to him, but he is definitely going back for more.

Take this trope and do with it what you will. If you know any good fics that already use this, link me, I would love to check them out!

Edit: Sexually repressed, as a few people have pointed out, may not have been the best terminology, as that DOES typically tend to drive bad people towards rape. It would be more accurate to say that they are more removed from sexuality, and tend to look at it more as an animalistic necessity that happens to be enjoyable. I meant for it to lean more towards ignorance and disdain and willful separation than societal forces and repression.

I will try to reply individually, but I appreciate every single response!


** Two things:

1. I completely agree that rape should not be used as a casual plot device. Especially in, Jesus Christ, stories centered around kids.
2. A highly repressed society and a sexually abusive society are not mutually exclusive things. In fact history has shown that they very often go hand in hand. See: the Catholic Church, or Victorian society in general. All the repression means is that the ugly shit is going on behind closed doors, and the victims will be stigmatized if they dare to speak out about.

*** See also rape isn't about sexual desire. It's about power. And a society that covets power and sees sex as "dirty" is actually more likely to use rape as a method of control/a weapon. Because if all the women think Sex Is Wrong, its something that can be used as punishment, and a punishment that the victim will be ashamed of and keep silent about.

ISIS use rape as a weapon of war despite preaching a very strictly repressed sexual code in general.

Societies that are open about sexual desire are less likely to produce sexual abuse because a) people can be open about their desires and find like minded people rather than repressing it and getting weird about it and b) said societies have strong consent education and victims feel more empowered to speak out.

*** AntonBrakhage, I completely agree. But we must also realise that rape is almost alwayd a part of war. It's not only an evil act/urge by enemy agents but also a psychological weapon.

But it shouldn't be written out in detail in a fanfic like it's a smutscene. Rape doesn't have to be extremely descriptive for it to be harrowing.

If you do feel the urge to write out a 5k words rape scene then I'm starting to question the audience you're writing for.

** I dislike rape as a plot device, but I most often see it being used as a way to show off that pureblood society doesn't consider muggles, or muggleborn witches and wizards, to fundamentally be people.

After all, animals can't give meaningful consent, and exist for masters' use. It's a gross perspective but one that makes sense with how the Death Eaters treated people.

Yeah, I wouldn't expect Draco Malfoy to be a rapist, not even Pure-blood Death Eaters - Lucius Malfoy, Yaxley, Nott, Avery - would think of doing such a thing because of their marriage and mindset of superiority, but it isn't hard for me to imagine Snatchers and Werewolves finding Half-bloods and particularly Muggle-borns and using them as playthings. It isn't written in text, but the subtext when Hermione got kidnapped by Greyback was very creepy and dark and it felt like it was leaning towards this direction.

***** Malfoy, like with murder I'd say that he isn't opposed to the idea and might say as much (after all he has been asking for a genocide since age 12 and no one cared). However, just like with murder I'd say that he would chicken out but wouldn't mind if it would happen to one of the Mudbloods as long as he didn't have to get his hands dirty himself. Although his proficiency with the Imperius is slightly worrying.

In my basic head cannon world building Albraxus Malfoy runs a pedo/kidnapping ring, and Lucius inherits it. In some of my stories he murders Albraxus and burns that shit to the ground, but in others he keeps it going.

It just makes too much sense that while Voldemort wouldn't actually be a pedo that he'd use the knowledge that several high standing and powerful men are and use it to manipulate and blackmail those men to get his way.

** My run with this topic would be that pureblood culture, at least in Britain, simply doesn't put such a premium on sex. Maybe it's seen, apart from the necessities of procreation, as little more than a diversion for lesser creatures such as animals, muggles and teenagers; a true wizard of witch of the proper blood and upbringing would seek pleasure and the exercise of power in more "refined" ways.

In this interpretation:

- Fenrir Greyback, the closest thing canon has to an outright rapist by main force, is of course an outcast and /other,/ an "animal" of whom sexual violence is /expected,/ because he is a werewolf - and a walking propaganda piece for the dehumanization of werewolves at that.
- Merope Gaunt, the OG outright rapist of the 'verse, is likewise an outcast, an outsider - a withered last fruit of a fallen, once-proud bloodline that was either cast out or cast itself out of British wizarding society for the most part.
- Eileen Prince/Snape was an utter failure as a witch, that is, as a /magical/ woman. Instead of living up to her blood, she went the way of what I imagine being pretty close to the stereotype of a Muggle woman among the Wizarding pure-blood elite: a miserable, subservient, downtrodden creature without the will to extricate herself from under the boot of her uncouth, uncivilized, filthy and usually abusive husband. Such women would be held in contempt by any respectable witch, who would be expected to respond with equal parts aplomb and cruelty to (attempts at) such treatment from men - or, for that matter, women.
- Molly and Arthur Weasley's evident physical affection for each other into their middle age, and the resulting large brood, would be a part of why they are seen as gauche, improper and less-than.
- Nobody in polite Wizarding society would raise an eyebrow at the childless state of many Hogwarts professors (as they don't, as far as I know).
- A(n unpolluted, pure-blood) Death Eater would not only never dare to rape a target, but not even entertain such thoughts in Voldemort's presence, for fear that he might pick them up and Crucio the offender for being disgusting. Maybe there'd be a pejorative term from it, inspired by "zoophile".

** It's rare to find Fanfics that show genuine understanding of repressed upper class politics, especially considering that pureblood society probably closer reflects 19th century Upper class society.

Because of this, the sexual violence in these fics is often unhinged, really unhinged and not connected to the power structures at play. I'll go against the grain and say here thay if a Fanfic is dealing with adult themes Im open to an author including sex and sexuality including sexual violence if sensitively written and not just for voyeurs sake. Lucius Malfoy can be a horrible father by, I don't know, locking Draco in a punishment cupboard rather than some of the gratuitous violence I've seen people use to try establish his "badness". Nine times out of ten it will absolutely turn me away from a fic.

These old societies did have sexual violence but it was often subtle or bizarre by modern standards. Not always, obviously, but people writing these themes with carelessness should be prepared for people not to like it. I've read real life diaries where a woman was traumatised because the Lord of the house insisted that he watch her dress in the morning by refusing to provide her quarters with curtains and going for morning walks. This is more on brand for repressed pureblood society. I just really dislike reading a fic where it turns into Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They're allowed to make it of course! I just smash that back button.

** There's no indication that magical society in Britain is at all Rapey in canon.

Some people want to write that. Shudder.

I like to push this different idea . Power comes from the point of a wand.

A witch is just as magically dangerous as a wizard.

I'm not going on a wands as guns rah rah line here. It's more subtle.

Everything witches and wizards do, they can all do, if they learn how.

Daddy forcing girl into arranged marriage? Daddy gets poisoned if the girl is sufficiently upset. Everyone does five years of potions. Even Merope Gaunt, home-schooled, inbred as all get out can make powerful potions. Once her family are in Azkaban she pretty much does what she wants to.

Young witches have friends; so if Jenny Arthweith gets groped by the lastest Goyle lookalike , he's going to get taught a lesson by her friends.

So this could escalate to murder and disposal of bodies, but that's Lucius Malfoy grade stuff. (My headcanon is that he's had guest in the basement before)

Dead magical people can reappear as Ghosts. Lets reiterate this. It makes it really hard even if you hide bodies.

And divination is actually a thing, (even if Sybill's a phoney) so solving unsolved crimes is a thing.

Unless you're Mytle Warren, muggleborn with no friends. Her family wouldn't be able to engage with magical crime solvers, and it was hushed up. And Tom R covered his tracks well.

​

So I think of magical people as being much more like tigers. They don't occupy each other's territory (all those houses in the country aren't for show) , and only the young are in a school. Makes courting more formal; it's a safety mechanism. Even in canon, young witches are prepared to hex in the bits. So, manners.

** Aren't 'super sexually repressed' societies usually the most depraved ones though?

- look at Pakistan and the widespread sexual abuse and trafficking of (not always) homeless children there. Same with India.

- look at Japan, where it's taboo to show romantic affection in public yet there's a widespread issue of men groping girls on the subway but said girls being too afraid to mention it lest they disrupt the crazy, every minute matters, Japanese work mentality.

Or how they're leagues ahead of others when it comes to creating sex dolls (the literal sexual objectification of women). Or how they're the region where anime and hentai (the sexualization of young highschool girls) originated.

Did you know there's a job for underaged girls in Japan where they dress up like anime schoolgirls and give massages to creepy old men?

- the catholic church and its priests: I don't need to explain this, surely?

Sorry, I was making this point to show how it makes perfect sense to me that death eaters would be rapey, depraved bastards. It's often those pretending to be most virtuous that are most evil. Middle eastern societies are the greatest hypocrites in this regard. And Jeffrey Epstein liked to call himself a philanthropist.

P.S. I don't mean to say that we don't have this in the west. Just look at how Epstein and his whole ring of politicians, lawyers and entrepreneurs got away with their crimes ... or how some of the most evil pedophiles are for some reason Australian.

Also, 'animalistic tendency'? Pure bloods aren't aliens, they have hormones and feel urges like the rest of people. Sexuality is a vital part of a person's life. So again, seeing it as a 'animalistic tendency' would be repressing it.

Being open and adventurous is healthy. It's what makes teens realise what is and isn't normal and what is and isn't acceptable.

** On the flip side, I could see quite a few blood-purists treating Muggles somewhat like nineteenth-century slave-owners treated their slaves - as a resource to be used however they see fit. Given the amount of mind-affecting magic available, I have no trouble seeing some of the Death Eaters using a Muggle to satisfy whatever appetite they have (sexual or otherwise) and either Obliviating or disposing of them. Someone like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't sully himself by going out into the Muggle world personally, but he and others might have a "fixer" who knows their tastes and procures suitable Muggles that won't be missed.

*** They treat rape drugs as jokes, there is no punishment for their use and even the good guys sell them. And [[/u/KnightOfThirteen]] wants to change the narrative to a sexually repressed society when they don't even bat an eye at wannabe rapists.

** This is basically what was headcanon for me right from the beginning. Wizarding society stays "fixed", while muggles go through bust-and-boom cycles. For muggles, sexual pleasure strikes very well in the low effort - high reward sector, while for wizards there are so many other things possible that it just does not make sense to be promiscuous.

Also, the population size is much lower, so a pureblood who was rather open would either be killed or shunned.
