Only works in a Marvel crossover, of course


** I'm surprised this isn't more common story. I've seen plenty of MoD!Harry, even the one that is so powerful that Thanos isn't a problem for him. However I never see any story with this prompt.

If you're going for MCU, it actually doesn't change much about the in-universe stone's lore. You only need to change the location of the soul stone to earth instead of Varamir. Both stones have a similar creation myth, the soul stone is supposedly created by Death, Entropy, Infinity and Eternity. It's not a long shot to imagine that Death hold the stone after its creation and she give it to the Peverells ~1000 years ago.

There's plenty of crossover where even Heimdall doesn't know about the wizards on earth. It could explain why the soul stone is missing; at first Death hold it, then it's lost in the wizarding world.

It's pretty unlikely to say that there could be 4 infinity stones at earth at the same time. But you could make that the soul stone is on a different earth. It explain why Shield doesn't know about wizards and also emphasized why the soul stone is missing.

*** I think it's because there frankly aren't that many quality MCU crossovers out there, and the few gems that do exist are either short or unfinished. I wish there would be a greater push to write more of them, there's such a wealth of lore to go off of and so much opportunity to mesh the two worlds.

If you're talking about a specific fic, I would very much like the link to that.

**** There are two that I can remember, but unfortunately I only saved one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/209843][MoD!Harry is Not Amused]] series.

The other one is where Harry and Hermione (and Luna maybe) apparated just before Thanos take the mind stone from Vision and beats him immediately. I think it's on AO3.
