** I believe you are using RES. This is a known bug & has been reported in [[/r/Enhancement]].

To fix this:

#+begin_quote
  You can turn this off by disabling *[[#res:settings/selectedEntry/setColors][setColors]]* -- [[#gear][]] [[#res:settings][RES settings console]] > Browsing > [[#res:settings/selectedEntry][Selected Entry]] > [[#res:settings/selectedEntry/setColors][setColors]], though it shouldn't have happened

*** Thank you so much! I didn't think to check RES because I just have it set to default to the theme used on the subreddit.
