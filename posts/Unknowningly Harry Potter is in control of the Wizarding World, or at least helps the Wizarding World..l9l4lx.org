He's an Auror, he knows the minister Kingsley Shacklebolt. He knows Slughorn (Slughorn also has many connections, that he can connect Harry too, that he doesn't know), Neville Longbottom is the Herbology Professor, Hannah Abbott is the owner of the Leaky Cauldron, where she can see what's going on and spread useful information, many other students at Hogwarts that were in his year or around his year, at the final battle of Hogwarts, also got jobs that they could talk to Harry about and he could give advice, etc.

Has many connections, rather he uses them or not.

Bonus if he's really oblivious by this.


** I remember there was a fic like this... or maybe it was a prompt from this sub. The plot was that everyone thought that Harry controlled the Wizarding World from the shadows, because of all his connections (Hermione as minister, etc.) and when he found out he was really shocked.

  Response to prompt on the HPfanfiction subreddit: *Harry's Stark Realization, Years Later...* To the rest of the magical world, Harry is pretty much the shadow ruler of Magical Britain: the "real power" behind the Minister's Seat... and they're fine with it. Under his "leadership", not only has Britain entered a mini golden age, but by proxy so has the rest of the magical world.
