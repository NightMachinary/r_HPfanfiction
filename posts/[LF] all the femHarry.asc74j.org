Exactly what it says on the tin. I've done searching already and it's hard to keep track of what I have and haven't read. So here we are.

I want all the recs you have: crossovers, any ones you can think of, I'll decide whether to read based on how familiar I am with it; romance, be it gay, straight, smut, no smut, though I'll be hesitant with harem. Also the pairing can be almost anyone who isn't older than Tonks unless Harry also ages. Seriously: Katie, Ginny, Su Li, Draco, hell I'd even accept Dudley; dark!harry, grey!Harry, the-reincarnation-of-Grindlewald!Harry; time travel, either Peggy-Sue or the past eras; retelling the story; AUs; immortal!harry; MoD!harry; always a girl; becomes a girl; metamorphagus; spent too much time on the nsfwcyoa subreddit and went overboard; anything as long as it's fem!Harry. The only things I won't accept are abandoned stories, pwp, and that story quadrology where she does voodoo because I hate that one.

I don't even care if I've already read every rec I get, I just want them in one easy thread to sooth my useless lesbian soul.

#+begin_quote
  When a magical backlash causes a rift in space and time, Mary Jane Potter gains the memories of her male counterpart. Sure that she has just years before her inevitable death, Mary works to defeat Voldemort and keep her friends and family safe. Only fate fights her at every step, making her task even more difficult. Fem!Harry. Not shippy. Hard T for language and violence.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15966983][Harriet Potter and the Meddling of The Fates]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow/pseuds/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow][ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow]] and is complete.

"The fates could have worked with Harry Potter, son of James Potter but when the chance came to steer Loki into Lilly's path so they might conceive a child together? That was an opportunity to tempting to let pass.

Harriet spends the first 11 years of her life with no idea of the magical world or her mother's status as a witch but the truth of her father and the heritage he gave her will remain secret for some time more. When her enemy uses her blood in his resurrection this inheritance and the meddling of The Fates will see him forever changed. With her greatest enemy made her greatest supporter things will be forever changed.

tl;dr Female!Harry is Loki's daughter and a goddess but doesn't know it. In using her blood to return Voldemort is magically forced through a change that leaves him an ally rather than an enemy. This first installment of the series focuses on Harriet and Voldemort and how things changed from canon after Voldemort's return covering Harriet's 5th year at Hogwart's and the summer before. Part 2 is a time skip to the year 2012 with the arrival of Loki and the events of Avengers."

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
