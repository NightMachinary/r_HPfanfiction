I find it crazy how this ship is totally cast off to the side in favor of other ships that aren't even developed in canon.

*** Well, not really. The point of their relationship was that hormonal teenagers that went through terrible ordeals and haven't yet made peace with their issues, especially when those issues are related, will make mistakes, and their relationship will likely be far from healthy.

In my headcannon, Hermione purposefully undermined their relationship for Ginny's sake by not telling Harry what they were meeting about and only insinuating that it was mission critical. It lines in perfectly with the way she tends to push Harry towards Ginny.

**** Didn't Hermione also encourage his relationship with Cho at one point? Honestly not sure if that's a movie Hermione moment or a book one too.

On their relationship, it's a combination of the situation (both getting over something traumatic) and their core personalities that made it not work. CHo was looking for something from Harry that he just would never be able to provide, at least not for her.

****** Emotional support. She thought Harry shared a connection with her regarding Cedric and she thought by being with someone who knew exactly what she was going through, it would help work through her own grief. Harry, unfortunately for her, was not that person. He internalizes his grief and pushes it down. He doesn't want to talk about it; he wants people to leave him alone about it. Or, at least, he wants most people to leave him alone about it, including Cho. There are an extraordinarily few people in the books Harry feels comfortable opening up to about anything.

******* True, but I think, and I base this mostly on a writer's freedom, she as a romantic interest could help Harry open up and work through his issues. They offer a nice contrast with each other in that regard. I think helping Harry deal with his guilt and anger could have helped her.

That's one of the things I love about J.K's world and especially about her characters. She doesn't ever say 'just because'. Almost everything that happens in the book makes me say 'but what if?'

What if Harry told Cho why he needed to meet with Hermione, honestly. What if they hadn't kissed, and instead developed a friendship before dating? What if their first date was somewhere Harry would have felt more comfortable?

I think any of those things would have ended in a very different way. Maybe they wouldn't work out, maybe they would.

Just... imagine...

******** I mean, what ifs do allow all sorts of alternative possibilities so I fully support anyone trying to write such a story with Harry and Cho and making it work.

Personally, judging solely based on what canon says about the two, I just can't see it working. Whether Cho and Harry were friends first wouldn't change the core aspects of their personalities and their needs and wants in a relationship. Cho still needs a lot of emotional support and a need to discuss her feelings (which is totally a good thing!). Harry just isn't really the guy who can give that to her (also totally fine!).

Cho did seem to have a strong jealousy streak towards Hermione. The way I read that scene, it wasn't just that Harry had to leave their date for Hermione (which Cho is right to be upset about), it's the overall jealousy Cho has towards Hermione. This would be a massive roadblock to them successfully dating. I think canon suggests that Cho is jealous of Harry's relationship with Hermione.

Certain events could happen differently, and I would agree the result would be that Cho and Harry might have actually lasted more than a failed date. But eventually, and relatively quickly in my mind, their relationship would always fail.

No, the relationship never really got off the ground. Fan fiction can flesh it out, but it really was just a stepping stone for Harry x Ginny. Harry had to realize he didn't like weepy girls. (JKR might have some very problematic views of girly girls and sexually liberated women)

When he's first attracted to her, no, it's just because she's pretty. She stands up for him during the first DA meeting, if I recall correctly, which reassures him a lot. Added to that, they have time to get to know each other during DA, even though that gets glossed over.

** Well, a canon-compliant fic, in my opinion, would require a bit of effort to make the ship function. For one, Cho needs to get some psychiatric help after what happened to Cedric; that alone is a pretty serious, delicate topic that requires talent and nuance to be handled not just respectfully, but in a way that is interesting and ultimately satisfying. There's probably a story or two that manage this properly but I can't at all imagine that this is the norm, not in the same community that produces such classics as "Teenager gets raped by magical nazis" and "Adolescent power fantasy #54317"

*** Or you could just have Harry ask her out before Cedric. Conflict can arise from Cho's jealousy of Ron and Hermione and Harry being dense to the fact that he can share things with his GF, too. Marietta can play a part and Harry's overall need to keep secrets, like Sirius. They might have to break up once or twice and date other people.

You can have them get closer while Dumbledore has him locked up. Cho, whose never had much to do with Dumbledore, can keep him from being "Dumbledore's man through and through."

Some people deem the relationship unhealthy, but I think this is really only the case because of Cho's devastation over Cedric's death and her using Harry as a rebound. Had Harry asked Cho out /first/, this debacle would never have happened, allowing the relationship to be far more healthy than it was.

** I agree with the OC's sentiment on this ship (though there's a notable completed [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][story and sequel]] of this pairing by Draco664) and have toyed with doing a post-Hogwarts series with her as a prominent character.

The Cho character was mangled by JKR, perhaps unintentionally, but it's pretty overt, treating her like Asian women often tend to be in fiction--she's a shallow, disposable, minor, sexualized character with little identity beyond that. Same with Parvati, Padma, Dean, for that matter, part of JKR's whole "unlike-race relationships are unnatural and fundamentally flawed, existing so that like-race relationships feel more authentic" thing. Parvati/Harry, Padma/Ron, Harry/Cho, Ginny/Dean--all doomed from the start. As others have commented, Cho is basically Asian Ginny with brains and without the OBHWF plot armor and placement.

Objectively, Cho has a good bit of potential as a character--athletic, smart, beautiful, talented (/Patronus/ at 16). She has gritty life experience--a murdered boyfriend, a friend's betrayal, a falling out with her family in joining the DA, a participation in the Battle of Hogwarts. She lost a love interest and respect of her peers over her loyalty toward her friend (who one could be argued was coerced into betraying the DA). She could be a complex, interesting, compelling character if handled well. In fanfiction, she could provide an in into a Chinese view of magic (much like the Patil sisters have provided with Indian traditions), a Chinese community's perspective, etc.

Her given name's nonsense though, so that would have to be dealt with. (There's a contrived, retrofitted claim in some circles that it means "melancholy" and the HP Wiki is peddling the absurdity that it is really the Japanese "chou" for "butterfly" because it's /totally/ a thing that Chinese give their children Japanese names...)

** Apart from the obvious fact that it was such a disaster in canon for the brief moment that it existed...

1. They simply don't match well as canon characters and so would need some personality tweaks on both parts, so a more canon-compliant story makes it hard to pair them up.

2. Cho has "complications" with regards to the Cedric situation, making it harder to pair her unless a story is drastically changed (or see 1). Such complications include things like her odd personality and mood swings post-Cedric's death (she probably needs some assistance).

3. Cho is surprisingly unlikeable in canon to many (myself included). So it makes her automatically less appealing for fan fiction.

All 3 are interconnected to a degree.

  I find it crazy how this ship is totally cast off to the side in favor of other ships that aren't even developed in canon.|
#+end_quote

It depends on what ships you speak of. There are plenty of Harry pairings that would work WAY better than Cho and were not touched on or developed in canon. In addition, if you speak of "blank-slate" characters (ex. Daphne), there is often more interesting "potential" in them for a variety of reasons and fewer complications initially.

#+end_quote

I think that's because she makes Harry uncomfortable, with mismatched expectations. She's used to an older, more mature, much more emotionally stable boyfriend, and she expects to just continue the same way with Harry. Harry, conversely, has some very close platonic friendships, and expects to have them continue unchanged while dating someone - without having actually had much discussion.

Massive communication shortfall, really. And it takes a skilled author to do a good job of depicting healthy and constructive relationship communication. And frankly it's rather out of character for Harry.

What I recall about the Harry/Cho relationship was that, at least as I remember it, Cho's side of the relationship was all about Cedric.

** I like linkao3(14031036) ... I always thought, that if Harry got kicked a little bit in his head (by Hermione?; after the emotional teaspoon scene: “Harry, don't be stupid, yes, she is an emotional wreck right now, but if you wait for her a bit, it may be a good foundation of trusting relationship.”), that by waiting for a bit longer (perhaps holding her a bit longer in his arms), he could get the girl. And yes, I am surprised that not many fanfic authors feel the same.

** I remember briefly being all for Harry/Cho when GOF came out because it was cannon. If you wanted to wade through ffn and did it by date you might find some that were written around that time. But it was a brief thought. Back then, when Cho was on people's radar, the shipping wars were a main driving force of Fannon discussion, and the main ones were for Harry were H/G and H/Hr. We spent most of our time and energy, discussing those and thinking about how those could happen and sometimes being nasty to each other. Cho was seen as a small obstacle in either case rather than a real romantic match for Harry.\\
As people have pointed out, a good Harry/Cho story would take a level of seriousness that most writers, who at the time were teens, would not have possessed. Now, she is a minor detail in a story where there are a lot of other minor details or AU turning points that can be used, and I suspect she is just overlooked.

So have linkffn(10417400/1), it's an okay-ish fic, but one of the few with Harry/Cho.

** Cedric is too big a gulf, Harry didn't know him well enough but still carries the guilt. Cho feels guilty for being with Harry...

She was a prefect who didn't stop her house from abusing Luna, we don't know more than that.

She was jealous of Hermione, who was a much bigger part of Harry's life.

Basically... Cho was on a rebound, from a dead boyfriend, with the guy who watched him die. I can see Harry losing his virginity to her but I can't see them long term. Not without changes to the timeline, or to the characters.

Luna was set up as a much better potential match than Cho.

The best Cho stories I have read, are post DH without Epilogue. When she has had time to heal and he has grown up.
