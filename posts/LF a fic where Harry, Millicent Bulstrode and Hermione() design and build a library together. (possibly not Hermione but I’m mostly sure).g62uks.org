  Licking the Philosopher's Stone was perhaps not something Harry would have done if he'd known what it was. But that act, along with so many others, started him down his path to building a library with Hermione and Millicent while Tom lurked in the background. So, he was happy with how things turned out.---Editing for grammar in April 2019. My great thanks and respect for Tazzm for their rather phenomenal work.
