Preferably not on his own urging.

Preferably not harry/lily, harry/bellatrix(edit: unless the smut is well written). Definitely not harry/snape. I'd prefer no relationship stuff at all, really.

I've read both Whiskey Time Travel and Wind Shear and that's basically what I want: badass harry in a situation he's not in control of seeking to wrest control and preemptively win the war.

I did a search for time travel and a few other keywords but the predominant storytype involves Harry's soul ending up in his younger body: not what I want to read. So, suggestions?


** linkffn(Time Turned Back) is my favorite Harry is in 70s fic. It's plenty hilarious and none of that relationship jumbo. He's more of a prankster really in this one.

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

  Harry thought fast. No way was he letting this senile old goat know that he was fully aware of where he was or that he was from the future. That was just a recipe for disaster!

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** I read one where Harry, Albus Severus, Rose, and I think Hugo all wind up sent back in time by a red orb, which basically causes jumps to alternate timelines. The first thing Harry does is kill Bellatrix, and then he is appointed DADA teacher for the Marauder's sixth year. (It takes a year to create another red orb to get Harry and family back to their timeline.)

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** linkffn(12317784) is one of my favourite Harry get's sent back in time fic. While Harry doesn't necessarily go back on his own urging he does accept the task at hand. And while you may not like the pairing I find that it was fairly well written, at least for the pairing.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
