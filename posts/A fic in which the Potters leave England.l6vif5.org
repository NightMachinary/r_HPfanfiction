I'm looking for a fic in which the Potters decide that it just isn't worth staying in Britain, so instead of going into hiding, they leave the country.

Or, a fic in which Harry gets fed up with nearly dying several times a year and finds a way to leave the country.

Mainly, I just want a fic in which the main characters, preferably some of which are Potters, decide to leave Britain to its own devices and not fight in the war.


** There's a one shot where it expounds on the fact that while James is a Gryffindor, his mother was a Black (fanon, I know) and he decides screw this and leaves for the Continent, knowing his child is at risk and he's -going to do everything he can to protect him-. So he and Lily and Harry leave with Sirius. Good thing he didn't take Peter. :)

As I recall, it implies he knows that if Voldemort tries to leave Britain, he'll have major trouble.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.

** The few recommendations that come to mind aren't James and Lily running away during the first war but rather Harry running away with someone (which fit your second request)

*Nobody's Hero:* linkffn(7806752) has Harry and Ginny run away to France shortly after a few weeks after Sirius' death. Technically fit the "Potters run away" part as Harry and Ginny get married the night they leave so Ginny is a Potter. Unfortunately uncompleted.

*Finding a Place to Call Home:* linkffn(9885609) has Harry and Astoria Greengrass run away during the Triwizard Tournament.

*I See No Difference:* linkffn(13722277) has Harry and Hermione run away shortly after Harry's name is drawn out of the Goblet of Fire. Currently W.I.P.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  With Professor Snape's hateful and cruel words towards her, Hermione's trust in authority figures comes crashing down for good. She begins to question the adults' response to Harry's forced entry into the Triwizard Tournament and concludes that it's up to her to keep him safe. And if they have to leave the country to escape the madness of Hogwarts and Magical Britain, so be it.

** More a vignette than a story, but "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/A-Father-First-Damn-It][A Father First, Damn It!]]" by Madrigal-in-training has James take his family out of England when Dumbledore warns him to go into hiding.

The Potters leave in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12011178/1/Harry-Potter-the-Clockwork-Mage][Harry Potter the Clockwork Mage]]" by TheRavenIs. This story was removed, and has been reposted by the author. I don't know if it has been rewritten, because I didn't like it enough to read the whole thing the first time around.

There was one other story I had in which the Potters left England, but that author has removed all her stories.

I've got a number of "Harry leaves England after X happens" stories, several of which are not "Harry leaves after winning," but I'll have to try to post them later; my battery needs recharging, so I want to end this before my laptop shuts down.

  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.
