:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic I read a while ago, all I can remember about it is Harry making a tea set for the Royal family using wandless magic and scraps from his pockets, I think Amelia Bones commented something along the lines of that even adult witches and wizards wouldn't be able to make something that will last as long as that

I know its not by sinyk
