** Harry figures out (or the diary just outright tells him) what the diary is trying and he gives it to Vernon.

**** Depends, if we go with the compulsion route Vernon definitely doesn't have the willpower or the intellect to resist (specially if Harry warns the diary to not seem strange); if it doesn't have a compulsion then I guess Tom would be able to bait/trick him into it, like, presenting itself as the perfect target since it has to take whatever insult and indignity Vernon throws at him without any way of retaliating or means to ask for help, alternatively it could appeal to Vernon's more greed/prideful side by helping him in manipulating his bosses and co-workers and flattening him with empty praises.

***** I agree but it also seems to me that he wouldn't want to write in a magical diary unless he was forced to by harry or smtg like that

****** Unless the diary got Harry to spell it so Vernon doesn't notice it is magic? Like, some kind of notice-me-not specifically for the fact that it is magical paired with a compulsion to write on it maybe? Alternatively it could go to Petunia to write her gossips and Tom keeps himself from being too obviously magical, only tweaking what Petunia writes so it becomes more scandalous while she isn't looking, it could probably get himself a body by the end of the summer and nothing of worth would be lost.

******* True but would they not be suspicious of one of the durselys dying?

******** The order? Depends, Petunia would probably get a bit more attention, but unless Dudley also died (negating the protections) they would probably not investigate that deep, they /do/ have more things to do with their time. If it is Vernon I can see everyone (including Miss Figgs so it doesn't even get passed forward as a serious matter) just chalking it up to a heart-attack/obesity-related healthy problem and not investigating /at all/.

Not sure if the ministry even keeps tabs on the Dursley's, chances are that they would only even be aware of called there for some reason, and even then the information would probably take it's time climbing the bureaucratic ladders and passing through gossip at the speed of light but become progressively more outlandish to the point that by the time it gets to someone interested the story is just plainly too wild to be taken seriously.

Depending on the time Voldemort would probably hear about the death from either Lucius, Severus or the mind-link with Harry. Depending on how much he hears his reaction could be anything from shrugging and moving on with his business up to sending Lucius on a cruciatus-induced vegetative state and trying to get the diary on his side (with or without success).
