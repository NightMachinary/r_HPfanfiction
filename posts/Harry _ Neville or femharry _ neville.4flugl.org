So I was writing this as a response to a post that was submitted last week, and I decided I should just ask. Anyone have a readable fix with this pairing? Two outsiders, one for being a bully magnet, the other for being raised by muggles, the two possible boys who lived . . . it should work. It should work! But I've never seen it. I'm not going to insist on great, but does anyone have anything?
