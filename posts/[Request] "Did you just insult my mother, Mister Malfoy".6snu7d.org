Thinking about the usual "Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, gets bullied, no one but herself can help her, etc. etc." plot, I was wondering if there's any stories where Dumbledore reminds Malfoy and co. that his mother was a muggleborn as well - and that each time they call someone "mudblood"; they are insulting his mother.

Something like this:

--------------

“I didn't do anything!”

“Do you take me for a fool, Mister Malfoy?” Dumbledore wasn't smiling. His eyes weren't twinkling, unlike on his Chocolate Frog Card - they were blazing as he stared at Draco Malfoy. Hermione Granger took a step aside just so she wouldn't end up as collateral damage when the bigot was blasted to smithereens. “Do you think I am stupid? Do you?”

“N-No...” The little git was shaking his head frantically, Hermione noted with vindictive glee.

“So why are you trying to treat me as a fool, Mister Malfoy? Why are you trying to lie to me?”

“B-but... She's lying! We didn't attack her!”

“So, she decided to hex herself, in her own dorm, to get you into trouble? In her first week? Using advanced hexes?” Dumbledore's scorn rolled off his tongue like in a play. Hermione still filed the plot he had just dismissed in her mind - if she learned the right hexes, it was a possibility to strike back at her tormentors. Although, seeing the Headmaster lambast Malfoy, she doubted that she would need to stoop to such means.

“I'm a first year too!” Draco said, close to crying now, in her opinion.

“Which is why you made others do it, Mister Malfoy.”

The idiot gaped at the Headmaster - which as as good as an admission of of his guilt than anything else short of a full confession, Hermione thought - before closing up. “I didn't!”

“Really? Miss Granger has given me a copy of her memories - of the incident in class that apparently made you go after her, of your little ‘discussion' in the Slytherin common room, of the attack on her, as much as she could see before she was struck blind, and of your gloating this morning.” Dumbledore scoffed as the bigot paled even further. “I have to say I am appalled and disgusted - no, outraged - at your behaviour and your slurs. To think that barely ten years after Voldemort was defeated, someone would dare to act like this again, in my own school!” He shook his head. “Did you know that my mother was a muggleborn, Mister Malfoy? Did you?”

Draco was trembling as he frantically shook his head. “N-No...”

“Or a ‘mudblood', as you called her. Did you insult my mother, Mister Malfoy?”

“I didn't... no...”

“Really? She was born to two muggles, just like Miss Granger. And you think people like them should not be allowed into Hogwarts - my school, Mister Malfoy.”

Malfoy was crying now. Hermione would have felt pity for the git, if she weren't still in pain from the spells she had been struck with by the boy's friends.

“Now, Mister Malfoy, you will tell me everything. Who helped you. Who hexed Miss Granger, Who knew, and did not stop it. Who cheered with you at her misery. You will give me all their names.”

“My... my father...”

“Really? Do you think your father will help you? Defend your actions? Do you think your father will step up, and openly defend cursing a young muggleborn witch? Against my word and evidence?” Dumbledore smiled now, but his expression made even Hermione shiver. “I'd like to see him try, Mister Malfoy. But I think he will be smart enough not to incur my wrath.” He shook his head again. “No, I think Lucius will not even lift a finger to help you.”

He turned to Professor Snape, who hadn't said a single word so far. “Severus. We will get to the bottom of this. If the students of your house are espousing the same bigotry that allowed Voldemort to almost take over the country, then we will do what is needed to deal with this.”

“They learned this from their parents, Albus.”

“And from the older students in their house, I wager.” Hermione had the distinct impression that the Headmaster would be talking to her Head of House in private, later. He went on: “I do think the most of those children are simply stupid - they do not know what crimes, what horrors they are supporting in their blind ignorance and bigotry. I intend to rectify that.” Dumbledore's smile was positively feral now. “They will be shown what their words mean. They will see for themselves, in my memories, what Voldemort did.”

“Their parents will not like this,” Professor Snape pointed out.

“They don't have to like it - but they will have to accept it. It seems Britain has forgotten the lessons that were painfully learned in the last war. It's time to remind them, I think.”

With a much kinder smile, he turned to Hermione. “I must apologise again for this, Miss Granger. I didn't expect that things would be so bad.”

Hermione shook her head. “No, no... thank you, sir.”

Dumbledore hadn't done anything wrong, she thought. He had asked for her memories and after watching them - what a marvelous device, a Pensieve - he had acted at once. Her parents had been right - telling a teacher helped.

But only if they could use magic to see your memories.

--------------

Are there any stories where Dumbledore does that?


** I like how 3 half bloods (Albus, Tom, Harry) are owning/controlling fate of muggleborns and pure bloods.

One of the coolest ability is also wielded by a half-blooded female (Nymphadora).

One of the greatest spy, the one who is shackled to many vows but loyal to none, in series is a half-blood too. (Yes! I know all the hate Snape gets here in this group that's why I didn't call him a good person, I am admiring his espionage skills).

**** For once, I'm sick tired of the plot device Canon Dumbledore who was dumbed down and turned into a negligent fool so kids could play heroes. Her main villain was also reduced to an monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon version with enormous compulsive-obsessive disorder and poor decision making skills. If that were not enough, our above-average main hero still needed Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, and an insane amount of luck to win.

The story can only get better if writers make both Dumbledore and Voldemort acting up to their reputations.

Yes absolutely. It just has nothing to do with canon anymore. Voldemort and Dumbledore are both idiots [Voldemort less so, but even he is overly elaborate and ridiculous... if anything Harry should have been dead after the resurrection, but of course Voldemort has to behave like the typical bond villain, make a grandiose speech and give our hero a chance to escape].

The whole premise of the books is based on this so that our equally incompetent child heroes can accomplish anything... If writers elevate both Dumbledore and Voldemort to act up to their reputations there's literally no reason for it to be a Harry Potter novel anymore, he'll just be a useless spectator or worse accomplish anything just by accident (see Anakin Skywalker in Episode I: "Whoooops!" *blows up space station*). I already had more than enough of that in DH... it's really embarrassing that the heroes still needed ridiculous amounts of luck, even though Voldemort did everything wrong.

That's a lot easier said than done. I agree with most people here that Harry (at least in canon) is supposed to be pretty average. Now how do you make him more competent without falling into all the super!Harry pitfalls? Not that I don't enjoy the occasional super!Harry fic, but it's really ridiculous when he just applies himself a little bit and suddenly stands up to the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort (if they are supposed to be these amazing wizards) and learns all these amazing new magical feats that we haven't seen in canon. Why doesn't everyone do this? Well, because Harry has some kind of super-duper magical core or something and is the first animagus with a magical creature as his form... *snore*.

On the other hand if the emperor(s) doesn't wear any clothes it's perfectly credible that Harry can overcome him if he realizes that everyone is being an idiot, just a little out-of-the-box thinking required in that scenario.

I don't think I've been assuming that, but what the hell would a competent Dumbeldore need Harry for as an ally anyway? He's a child... Dumbledore is like 100+?! The only thing Dumbledore needs Harry for is to get killed by Voldemort (and I'm not saying this to shit on Dumbledore, that's canon and the whole purpose of everything). Like, what do you want? Some stupid training montage where Dumbledore teaches Harry his secret techniques? Why doesn't he do that to all of his friends and allies? Might be useful if they could do more than get massacred by or run away from Voldemort. Or again, are you presupposing that Harry is somehow special in addition to his very limited role through the Prophecy? Fine, but then again, you are going far astray from the Harry Potter "formula". You're writing original fiction while borrowing some of the HP set-pieces at best.

Is that canon? Is it ever mentioned how much money he actually has? And ... I mean okay, lets say he has enough money to play with the likes of Lucius Malfoy... aren't you describing every Lord!Harry fic ever? Especially in addition with your organizational/political point before?

That's just not credible to me. The only way to accomplish that is to give him some kind of secret techniques/knowledge (that for some reason no one else gets access to... not to mention that it's supposed to be the other way around, Voldemort and his Death Eaters are the one with the 'forbidden' Dark Arts at their disposal) or make him the afore mentioned super!duper!Harry who shoots laser beams from his eyes. He's not going to do it by sitting in school and learning how to pot Mandrakes. Again, you'll have to change the basic formula.

It's a bit lame to always reference LoTR in situations like this, but it perfectly handles the power disparity between the main protagonist and someone like Gandalf. It's very carefully constructed so that Gandalf can be a super badass without ruining the plot.

You basically have to rip out the heart and soul of Harry Potter and create something new if you want Dumbledore to do stuff.

Why do you assume Canon Horcrux hunt and sacrificing Harry was the only solution to Voldemort's immortality problem?

Didn't you once tell me that you are fed up with the Canon Horcrux scheme?

Why is it so difficult for you that some (basically good Canon) characters are made better and more competent? You even agree with me that Canon Dumbledore was a dumbed down plot device. But you prefer to make him even dumber? I don't understand how that would make the story any better.

--------------

I'm getting sick and tired of Horcrux hunts too, and that's one key reason why I like Starfox5's stories. Canon Horcrux hunt had failed or would have ABSOLUTELY FAILED in "Patron", "Divided and Entwined", and "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water".

I personally think that with Voldemort splitting his soul so many times, he weakened his main one to the point where a direct attack should be feasible. Maybe there were very dark, soul-destroying rituals that required enormous sacrifices (such as murdering 7 innocent children to power it). But with Voldemort's weakened main soul, the cost could be reduced significantly. The heroes would now be faced with a choice of using this ritual unaltered (guaranteed to work) or try to modify it using fewer sacrifices (not guaranteed to work).

I don't think this approach is anymore outlandish than the wand ownership shenanigan and sacrificial protection anyway.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

***** Indeed, Harry is no hero (sure that was probably her point, but it still is fucking stupid/disgusting...I think Harry is a bad character and should have died in the end - why? To show that working for something pays of and not doing so might even get you killed, after all Harry was a fucking slacker who know what? Five or so offensive spells (Reducto, Stupefy, Expelliarmus (Note: Don't use on fucking dark lords dipshit!), Sectum Sempra and Crucio!) and not much else...he is pitiful IMHO!)

Harry needed others to die for him, to protect him, to set the situation up so he could win because frankly:

He wasn't making any fucking effort (no, the DA doesn't count - they learned spells for OWLs and NEWTs - not really impressive magic like maybe Dumbledore/Voldemort or even the Deatheaters would wield!)

It appears to me that he has to be a manipulative bastard in order to get his political jobs done. And letting hundreds die in order to save thousands is not wrong, it just sucks for those that have to die. I think that in the end Dumbledore is just tired of war. He saw the holocaust, knowing that he might have given Grindelwald the idea, he saw the first war against Riddle and he knows that's not over. At the end he simply wants peace at any cost while forgetting that appeasement does not work.

That doesn't excuse his countless mistakes with Harry but seeing Dumbledore simply as a kind old man does not do him justice.

Considering that in canon, Hermione, Ron & Harry manage to brew a polyjuice potion in their second year (which took a month, so it's admittedly not a spur-of-the-moment thing), that clothes can be changed with the wave of a wand, that there's all manner of obfuscation and illusion charms that can be placed on buildings and wizards, it's not impossible (and not even improbable) that a group of Slytherins decided to beat up the mudblood and use Draco as a scapegoat.

I dunno, from reading this it just strikes me as Dumbledore bullying an 11-year old because of a swear word. All the ways I want this snippet to continue involve Lucius taking action against Dumbledore for not properly investigating, and intimidating his son, pureblood politics and swear words or not.

  I think the problem is that your version of Draco doesn't refute the accusations very well, and your Dumbledore is just levelling accusations at him and taking his hesitations as guilt rather than actually considering alternative possibilities.

You really think 11 y.o. Draco has the balls required to stand up to a pissed off Dumbledore?\\
Besides, Dumbledore has already seen Hermione's memories, he already knows the truth.

  I mean, sure, Draco probably called Hermione a mudblood at some point. But rallying a group of older Slytherins to attack Hermione (who, I assume, is a Slytherin herself in this snippet), and actually showing his face during said attack? Considering that in canon, Hermione, Ron & Harry manage to brew a polyjuice potion in their second year (which took a month, so it's admittedly not a spur-of-the-moment thing), that clothes can be changed with the wave of a wand, that there's all manner of obfuscation and illusion charms that can be placed on buildings and wizards, it's not impossible (and not even improbable) that a group of Slytherins decided to beat up the mudblood and use Draco as a scapegoat.

Don't forget Draco's gloating. He actually claimed it. There's also a good possibility that Dumbledore is using legillimency.

*** Well, the point of the request was that Dumbledore goes "Did you insult my mother, Mister Malfoy?" on Draco over the "mudblood" slur. (And using that as leverage to go to town on Draco, and ferret out the rest.)

** This would be amazing. I hope somebody fleshes this out into a story.

Is it just me, or are many of the most powerful HP characters half-bloods?

*** Not just you. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Harry, and Snape are all half-bloods. While the latter two might not be the most powerful (in comparison to the former two most people in the setting pale), they certainly rank up there in terms of impact.
