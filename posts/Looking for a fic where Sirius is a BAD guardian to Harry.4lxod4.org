Hi there, I've read a lot of fics where Sirius takes over guardianship of Harry after Azkaban and he is miraculously a responsible, fun, effective parent-figure despite the fact that he spent the last 10-12 years in what is basically hell on Earth. In my opinion that seems highly unlikely and he would probably be either incredibly absent or he would try a recreate the relationship he had with James. Neither of those two things would be healthy for Harry.

Any ideas?

Short and slightly contrived but here you go.

  What Harry's life might have been like had Sirius never gone to Azkaban. AU. Might be considered Sirius bashing.

** Sirius supposedly got through the hell that is azkaban by staying in dog form as much as possible, and focusing on his innocence. What about the death eaters, like the Lestranges. They were rather guilty, and would have been fully exposed to the dementors. I know Bellatrix is rather crazy, but she is still fairly capable. The descriptions in the book always gave me the implication that 10 years in azkaban would leave you fairly useless and crazy. I'd like to read a story where those other death eaters are fairly useless, so in the department of mysteries, they can barely function.

**** Also some fanfiction has the Dark-Mark lessen the dementors influence (not to mention that Voldemort is not above using anything and everything - even human sacrifices etc. - to restore his inner circle (that's why most of them are this loyal, despite being hit with the cruciatus sometimes, if their master is displeased!))

It's a whole series. In the sequels we see Sirius and I felt he was a pretty bad influence.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

** Well, I disagree (Harry's relationships with adults have ALWAYS (even Molly Weasley and her smothering him and trying to tell him what he can and can't do - despite not being his mother!) been bad (no one really supported/protected him - even his teachers were irresponsible as fuck...McGonagall and the stone (ignored what he told her and never apologized) for example or all of them looking away when he was bullied by almost everybody (those buttons in year 4 or the heir of slytherin stuff in year 2) or - McGonagall again (repeat offender!) - telling him to keep his head down when Umbridge was at Hogwarts, Dumbledore (Durleys! Ignoring Harry in year 5, teaching him stupid history (which he could have done in 5 minutes!) instead of spells etc.), Snape (bullying/abuse!) etc. etc.), so a relationship like Sirius and James had would be loads better than ANYTHING Harry has ever had before!) as Harry has already had a pretty shitty childhood (he effectively has never been a real child, so he effectively doesn't need a father - a good friend who looks out for him is better than the Dursleys by a long-shot, too!), so everything's better than what he already has!

Still, I agree that Sirius himself might not be the best parent (he kind of is still around 20 in his mind after all (Azkaban is not a prime venue for personality development after all! Unless you count arrested development and psychosis!) and he never settled down (doesn't seem the type either!) or took responsibility seriously!)

But all in all I think Sirius and Harry would fit together well (Harry doesn't need - or probably WANT at this stage in his life (he's always been alone/had to make due alone!) - a smothering parent who protects him from the world and tries to tell him he can't do XYZ (he wouldn't listen anyway if he thought something needs doing!))

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

** If for 'bad guardian' you want very bad, abusive, sirius-bashing then [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1150239][Whore]] would work. Sirius stuff doesn't start until a few chapters in, I believe, but he's a very bad/sexually abusive guardian to Harry. The story as a whole is about literally everyone sexually abusing Harry, starting with him being rented out as an underage prostitute the summer after PS. If it even needs to be said - NSFW.
