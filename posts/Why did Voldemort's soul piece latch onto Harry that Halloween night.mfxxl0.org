Side question: If it had chosen, or something similar, why latch on a living being rather than non living as all the previous had been?

Canonically or fan theories, I'm interested to hear all, please share your views!


** Souls like living beings. If they didn't have some preference for living things over non-living things, we'd see souls naturally appearing in rocks instead of bodies sometimes. The purpose of the (apparently disgusting) horcrux creation ritual is to force a soul fragment to leave the body where it once was and stick to a specific inanimate object. Both the leaving and the sticking are things the fragment would prefer not to do.

** The easiest and most logical, in my opinion, solution is the failed Killing Curse.

Sequence of events:

Lily sacrificed her life and gave Harry protection from Voldemort. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse on Harry. The curse strucks. Voldemort dies, but due to his horcruxes he lives on as a semi-ghost. He made so many horcruxes that when he dies his soul is fractured once more. It goes to the item that he cast upon. Ergo, Harry becomes a horcrux.

This train of thought doesn't even require anything apart from canon.

*** Nice theory, I just wish we knew what the ritual for horcruxes is, at least vaguely. It always bugs me that other pieces needed a complex ritual and this one didn't...

** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself on to the only living soul left in that collapsing building.
#+end_quote

The others didn't choose. They were forced into protective containers. Given that Voldemort's body was destroyed, his soul couldn't move on, horcruxes need containers and are made on purpose, I assume the piece that broke off attached to Harry because it needed a living container.

*** This, really.

I mean, Rowling has said that horcruxes are made with horrific, complicated rituals.

And then wham, somehow, without the ritual involved, Harry's a horcrux.

It's why I tend to prefer in fanfics where it's not a real horcrux, but some sort of possession that's been blocked by his mum's protection.

** I mean, technically, it wasn't attracted to Harry --- it was attracted to his scar. The freshly created scar that undoubtedly reeked of Voldemort's recently cast magic. I assume that the lingering magic of its main self is what attracted it there

** There was a pretty cool theory... I don't know if on this sub or elsewhere but it basically suggested that souls are only attracted to living things. So in order to trick the piece of soul to latch onto a Horcrux container you had to trick it to believe that that object was alive... it involved having blood flow through it and being born like a baby. In the opinion of the author that was the disgusting ritual that JK mentioned... basically inserting the object inside a woman and having her "give birth" to it. Since Harry was an accidental Horcrux and no ritual was made in advance, the piece of soul from Voldemort went inside Harry because he was the only living being in the room. As much as we know is that after making so many Horcruxes, Voldemort's soul was unstable and pieces of it were torn randomly... why it happened then and not during any of his other killings we don't know but one could theorize that it was the force of the curse rebounding.

In addition, there's another theory that the rebounding curse itself wouldn't have killed Voldemort since he had Horcruxes and he was immune to the Killing Curse. However it was the fact that he accidentally created a Horcrux which caught him unprepared that stripped him of his body. We know for a fact that Killing curses don't leave any mark.

Of course this is all based on theories collected from the internet and I have no clue what JK was thinking but for the time being this remains my headcanon.
