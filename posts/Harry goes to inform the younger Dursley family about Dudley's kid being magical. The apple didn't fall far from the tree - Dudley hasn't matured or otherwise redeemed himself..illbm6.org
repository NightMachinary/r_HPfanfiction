I've read a few decent fics where Dudley's kid is magical, but he's always portrayed as having grown into being a good man. Which is fine. But I'm looking for a different take on it where he hasn't.

Anyone have any recommendations?


** Not mistreating her, but in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] Dudley really doesn't have a good time with his daughter being a witch. Highly recommended to read anyway.

** Unfortunately, no such fics to my knowledge.

But it Dudley goes on mistreating his child, I can see Harry proposing legislation that will:

- Take away Muggleborn and Half-Blood children from abusive Muggle households and place them in Wizarding foster families
- Wipe their existence from their Muggle relatives
- Coordinate with Child Protective Service

Harry will not tolerate another Tom Riddle and a repeat of his own experience.

*** I've seen this done once, but taken to the extreme of removing all Muggleborn children from their families because Harry didn't trust any Muggles to take care of wizard children.

**** That's not likely to happen with a canon postwar Harry.

But just performing similar duties as CPS? Absolutely!

There are not that many Muggleborn children though. In Harry's year, there were only 4. Let's assume after the war, that number grows to 10 or even 20 by 2020, which is quite aggressive.

How many parents do actually abuse their kids? Based on [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/childabuseextentandnatureenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019][statistics from England and Wales]]:

#+begin_quote
  At 31 March 2019, 52,260 children3,4 in England (43 per 10,000) were subject to a CPP (Table 13). Despite a small decrease in the latest year (3%), this number has increased by 21% since the year ending March 2013. A further 2,820 children5 in Wales (45 per 10,000) were on the CPR (Table 17).
#+end_quote

These kids are those who are abused to such a degree that government is forced to take them away. The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) estimates much much higher prevalence of childhood abuses:

#+begin_quote
  In the year ending March 2019, the CSEW estimated that approximately 8.5 million adults aged 18 to 74 years experienced abuse before the age of 16 years (Table 1). This is equivalent to 20.7% of the population aged 18 to 74 years.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, they went pretty generous with the definition of "abuse", as even witnessing domestic violence counts toward abuses. But in a figure I can't show in this comment, 7.63% and 7.52% of respondents experiences physical and sexual abuse respectively.

This is a significant percentage. Now that magic and religion come into play with respect to Muggleborns, that percentage could be significantly higher. So Wizarding Britain should be prepared to adopt up to 4 Muggleborns annually.

** It's a minor plot point, but in this fic he ends up adopting one of Dudley's kids that got put up for adoption for being a witch.
