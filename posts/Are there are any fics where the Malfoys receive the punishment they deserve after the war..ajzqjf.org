  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** It is sometimes mentioned in the background, but as far as I am aware, there isn't a single story where the war is sufficiently dealt with other than extreme cases like "Marriage Law Revolution" where Harry and Hermione go full "French Revolution" on Magical Britain and later Europe. But the action there is a reaction to a marriage law, not the war itself. Nothing which has a thorough examination of the war, the people who collaborated and certainly nothing which is done by the ministry and not some vigilante business by Harry.

There aren't many people around who think that Malfoy deserves actual prison time for his terrorist attacks, much less capital punishment. And speaking from personal experience, advocating that gets you a lot of downvotes. People are willing to throw Umbridge and Lucius into prison, but other than that the popular sentiment is rehabilitation, not prison or the chopping block/veil/hangman's rope. Because clearly, not wanting to commit war crimes, attempted murder and various acts of terrorism makes it okay...

*** Under normal circumstances, Draco should have served jail time for his crimes, especially considering that contrary to his claims, there was a way out for him, as the Order of the Phoenix offered him and his family protection.

But we're talking about a post-war society here, where reconciliation usually takes priority over criminal justice. In most post-war situations, even people who did way worse things than Draco did managed to escape justice and sometimes even managed to hold on to positions of power.

**** I've been wondering about the new Azkaban. They'd need prison reform after the second wizarding war---the dementors were ineffective, inhumane, and ultimately disloyal. So what happens next? Is there a Grindelwald-style end for the living death eaters, locked in solitude until they die of old age? Or some more progressive reform-based system? Privatization, so the wealthy make more money off the incarcerated, like in the US? Legilimency-based prison so they experience decades of punishment in the span of a week and then are meant to be productive members of society again?

Sooooo many options...
