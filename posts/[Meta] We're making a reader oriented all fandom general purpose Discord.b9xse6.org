We're trying to set up a general purpose fandom agnostic FFN discord mainly for readers. Target activities will be fic discussion and fic recommendations and channels are set up to reflect that. The moderation for discussions will be pretty lax ( no hugboxing ) so heavily critical fic discussions are allowed and encouraged.

So basically what we want to have and what makes us different: no protecting the authors from critique and no one group of ppl has the "right" opinion that would be enforced.

We also have a nifty channel to collect useful tools for readers of fanfiction (and another one for writers, tho it's comparatively barren atm).

Eveyone is welcome! [[https://discord.gg/vbHtJPq]]


** Will there be as brainstorm channel for writers looking for sounding boards?
