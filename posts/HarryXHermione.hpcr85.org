I'd like some suggestions for HarryXHermione fanfictions. Preferably ones that have been completed

Extra 'points' if you know of any where Harry stays with hermione and her parents instead of The Dursleys. Or ones where The Grangers are important to the story in the same way

Any and all suggestions would be appreciated! 😊

  I DO NOT OWN THIS STORY. This story was removed due to some reasons and its one of my favourite stories. So i thought i should share with everyone. One chapter a day Reposted. Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

** I second Escape (see [[/u/crystalldaddy][u/crystalldaddy]] post for link). However, that one it is really the side characters that carry the day. Harry/Hermione themselves are a bit of a flawless power couple.

I also strongly req "Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire". It is also one of the fics that feels most 'canon-like' to me.

#+end_quote

I have to admit, I dislike this setup as a romance. At least when it happens long before the romance (ie, Harry lives with the Grangersbfrom second/third year). It leads to either creepily young romances or way too strongly signaled romances.

I find that setup is better for 'BFF' Harry/Hermione, where they get super close but not romantically involved with each other.

**** I mean, they do it in Escape, which has some of the better written Grangers (keeping with the theme of amazing side characters. Percy, Fred, and George also get in on this action.)

Off the top of my head, I can recall a few:

- 'Banking/Betting on Her', where he stays with the Grangers during GoF. It involves him going to a muggle ball in a tux instead of the Yule Ball? Romance the whole time.
- There is one where Hermione/Parents are nudists. Cause that is how you want to set up your romance ...
- I seem to recall a power trip Harry one that did this. McGonagall ends up committing suicide in a ministry cell? May also be betting on her...
- Pretty much every fic that does "Dr Granger recognizes abused child from medical training's thing with Harry?
- I also know of a few "Harry is adopted by Grangers", usually a subset of "Harry meets Hermione before Hogwarts". No good ones come to mind. Maybe Accidental Animagus if I recall? Vox maybe? I am sure there is a thread on this you can find. *

This has the best depiction of "the power he knows not" of any fic I've ever seen.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056][Angelica by DeliverMeFromEve]]

A fun exploration of the concept of horcruxes and a good bit of Arthurian mythos.

Both good Ron. DeliverMeFromEve's Rons are actually much nicer/cooler than canon Ron

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.

**** Actually, I've read some of their fics and I'd avoid anything written by Ares.Granger if I was you. They're more likely to make you hate the ship than anything.

Like, in Harry Potter and his Veela Mate, which was recommended, half into the first chapter, Harry and Hermione have already declared their love for each other and become a couple.
