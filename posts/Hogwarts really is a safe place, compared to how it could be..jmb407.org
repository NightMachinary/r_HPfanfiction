I've seen a lot of Hogwarts bashing going on in fanfiction, so I thought I could flip it on its head. Here's the basic premise;

It's all a numbers game. Magical creatures are attracted to Hogwarts' ambient magic like roaches are attracted to sugar. The wards are indeed amongst the strongest in the world, with runic based protections that curb stomps anything the Goblins of Gringotts have to offer, but they can't possibly stop everything. Even if only 1 in a 100 magical creatures make it through, that's still 10 a week.

The teachers are all highly trained combat vets with specialized skill sets that make them more than a match for trolls, Nundus, and even the occasional dragon;

1. McGonagall is a Transfiguration Mistress with a terrifying reputation for turning her opponents into Swiss cheese with Transfigured and animated javelins.

2. Flitwick is a dueling champion; his specialty is Levitating large/heavy objects and using them to clobber everything in sight (including below the belt).

3. Sprout is half satyr; her father's flute allows her to charm deadly plants into obeying her commands, and since Hogwarts is surrounded by a good selection of those, she's able to turn the grounds into a minefield.

4. Snape spends his spare time brewing explosive potions that can be fired from a battery of magical cannons mounted on the towers of the castle and Disillusioned from prying eyes. Snape designed the weapons himself, inspired by the air cannons of the Merchant Marine.

And so on and so forth. But even the teachers/combat team is no match for traitors on the inside, such as Quirrelmort; that's the only reason the troll made it within 2 km of the castle.


** Correction:

1. McGonagall is a Transfiguration Mistress with a terrifying reputation for turning her opponents into Swiss cheese +with Transfigured and animated javelins.+ in an absolutely literal sense. She's really good with transfiguration.

** This sort of concept is done really well in "A deadly Education" by Naomi Novik, excluding the whole teacher bit. In that novel the school itself is sentient and teaches the kids as it protects them from roaming monsters. Everything wants to eat the children. Even the school. But it's better odds then being outside of it, at any rate.

It's based on the legend of the scholomance (The devils school for wizards in which he claims the soul of the last person to walk out of its walls), and allegedly it's origin can be traced to a fanfiction the author was toying with in which Draco attends the literal scholomance.

Great book if your looking for a darker, more sensible magical world then Harry Potter.

*** Regarding the "scholomance", you might want to look towards the fairy tale "Krabat" rather than a HP fanfiction. The story of Krabat is relatively widely known in Germany, Poland and Czech Republic.

**** Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to imply that the legend of the scholomance was created from a HP fanfiction! It's a pretty old tale that originates, if I'm not mistaken, from Transylvania? The author mentions in an interview during an episode of the "Be the Serpent" podcast that the current novel evolved from the mentioned fanfic she was writing years ago, which is what I intended to convey when writing that post.
