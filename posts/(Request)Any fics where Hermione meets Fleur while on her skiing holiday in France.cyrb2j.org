Title says it all really, any fics where Hermione runs into Fleur while on her holiday? can be a oneshot or a lead in to a longer story if its well written, sweet, romantic and fluffy that would be amazing thanks! :)


** It's not a major plot point but in the Accidental Animagus series the Grangers run into the Delacours while visiting magical France on holidays, later the Delacours supply mandrakes to revive Hermione.

  Pre-POA AU: In the summer of 1993, the Grangers vacation in France and meet the Delacours. When the Granger-Delacour parents elect to explore Wizarding France as a group, Hermione Granger is thrown together with a girl named Fleur Delacour due to some bizarre idea that they will somehow magically become friends. Even though they have nothing whatsoever in common and Hermione doesn't like Fleur at all!In which two of the brightest witches of their age become very good friends.

** You mean the trip she cancelled in 5th year? Because that's something I have never seen.

There are plenty of fics where they meet in France for one reason or another, mostly before GoF, but come to think of it, there aren't really fics where she goes on that trip after Mr Weasley is attacked and hangs out with Fleur.

****** No, the skiing trip was cancelled because she came to Grimmauld (and it was never said where she went). Her other trip to France was before Third-year but that was in summer.
