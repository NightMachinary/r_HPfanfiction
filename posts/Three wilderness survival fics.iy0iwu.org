** Wow you have FANTASTIC timing! I just searched "survival" on this sub looking for exactly this kind of post! I don't know how similar it will turn out to be, but Island of Fire by esama on AO3 is the fic that made me look for other survival ones. (Its a crossover with another series, but I've never read that one and it doesn't detract from the fic)

#+begin_quote
  When Harry misses the Hogwarts Express as a First Year, he decides he would rather take his chances following the train tracks on a hike to Hogwarts than risk missing out on learning magic forever. Will The Boy-Who-Lived be able to survive the magical countryside with only his school supplies and wand to keep him safe?

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
