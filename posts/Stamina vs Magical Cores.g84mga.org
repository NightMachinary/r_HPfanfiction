Does the fandom even think there is a difference? I've read a fanfic, linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House), which I really liked where the protag was cornered by Malfoy and his cronies in the common room and basically the MC was able to win the fight through creativity and training with her two friends to fight while outnumbered, but in the end, it was because Malfoy and Parkinson, who were the last still up, were getting slower in their casting. The narrator explains that it must have been because they, unlike her who had been tirelessly bullied for her blood-status, had never needed to train to become good at fighting for extended times.

A couple of chapters before that, the author also said that magical theorist all agreed that age didn't matter when it came to what you could do with magic that "it was only a matter of wanting it badly enough, and then building the skill to do it consciously." It doesn't seem to be something like magical cores, but it appears like a witch or wizard can't cast endlessly 24/7 even if they can spam spells often once they mastered them and takes a bit of physical effort. Do you think it's too much like magical cores or actually a good idea?


** Between the 2 options, I largely prefer the Stamina one.

From what we see in canon, casting a spell need concentration from the caster, and could be compared to solve an equation in your head. Some spell are ridiculously easy (say "/2x =4/") and can be spammed during the day with no effort from the caster. Others are like the equations solved in science in math universities, which need a lot of concentration from the caster to not loose controle of the spell (like Fienfyre).Add to this that during a fight, the caster has to move a lot to evade spells, and thanks about other things at the same time (like how not to die), and it could explain why the witches and wizards could seem so . . . winded after doing some magic.

On the other hand, Magical Core is a true can of worms that doesn't really fit with canon (we never saw anyone with "no mana" in canon. Tired? yes. But completely unable to use magic? Never), and open the door to a lot of cliche when used:

- If the power of a wizard depend of his core, then training is useless since no matter how hard your work, you will never amount to anything compared to Harry "I-Have-A-10-Time-Larger-Core-So-I-Can-Make-People-Explode-With-A-Disarming-Charm".
- You can make the core say anything: "Pureblood made Selected Breeding so the Common Pureblood' Core is 2 time larger than a Mudblood one. So Pureblood truly are superior and Death Eater were right". Or "Because of all the inter marying, the average Pureblood has a tinier core than the Muggleborn, or NewBlood one. So Hermione was right".2 justification for really cliches plots.
- If the wizards have a "magical organ". Then stealing magic become at least potentially possible and the Death Eater propaganda of DH goes from "Completely stupid, everyone know they are lying" to "Meh, seem possible why not?".

Also, as [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Nyanmaru_San/][*u/Nyanmaru_San*]] just mentioned on this threat, using "Magical Core" is a good way to loose a lot of readers. Most people seem to hate it.

** I can't credit the story's simply because I don't remember their names but I've read several that expand on the ideas of physical and magical stamina, some have talked about magic eventually causing “strain” on the magic “channels” in the body and that's what holds wizards and witches back, and more “powerful” people either were born with bigger or more resilient channels or trained them to become bigger or more resilient. Most of the story's had the same idea that physical stamina was separate from magical in the idea that if you're jumping and running around you obviously tire your muscles and burn energy in the same way any human does, but that adding magic stamina kinda makes it harder for the body because you now have two separate fatigues you have to mentally get past. I think it really works in a story's favor to set these ideas up, where someone who wants to be better has to train physically so that they don't have to worry about dealing with that fatigue on top of any “magical fatigue” and that they also train magically. This also keeps away from the idea of magical cores which some people don't like the idea of (although they work well in some fics). Either way I personally like the fics which separate the two not sure what kinda magic system I prefer but I find that there are new fics exploring idea every time I go looking for something new in that regard.

Edit: became a little longer of a comment then I meant it to be I hope its easy to read and understand I'm on mobile so I can only hope I got my ideas across in a way people can understand.

** For me it is like force and midchlorian count. Some people born with higher midchlorians and are in more tune with force like Yoda, Vader, Palpatine and Windu. But needed lots of training to use force.

Same can be said about magic and spell casting. Wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry were born in more tune with magic. Difference is Voldemort and Dumbledore had lots practice/training and experience while Harry lacks both.

** As Nyanmaru_San says, there needs to be /some/ sort of limit to magic - to prevent people from casting spells /constantly/. In the books, we don't see that - we see people, particularly in fights, behaving as though casting spells takes something out of you, some energy.

That can take the form of magical stamina or a magical core, which are pretty similar ideas - though, notably, magical cores are often used as an inherent value compared to one that can be expanded upon by hard work, whereas magical stamina seems to evoke less of an ingrained number. But at its core, both of those ideas are basically the same (just with a bit more name recognition to the core, and less baggage for stamina).

That's not the only option, however - an author could choose to tie it to heavy concentration, that takes a toll on the person casting, to 'willpower', or even a physical toll/exhaustion on the body. Or some other method, of course.

I'll also note that magical cores are perfectly fine as an idea. They're quite /good/ in potential, really. It's, like virtually every trope, down to the execution.

*** Magic needs limits, but people running out of magic does not need to be one of those limits. We absolutely see costless magic in canon: in fights, not once is a wizard said to be conserving magic or tired out by casting a lot of magic, and more fundamentally, wizards' entire way of life is premised on the use of magic to do pretty much everything.

Ironically, a stamina-based system leads to more "spell spam", not less.

In a system without stamina, there is no benefit to spamming spells, because your opponent can equally spam defences. You're not tiring them out by doing so or gaining any combat advantage by repeatedly casting the same spell.

In the words of Captain America: I can do this all day. If your opponent can successfully block spell X, there's no point trying again. Rather, you have to try a different offence which they may not be able to block. This forces combatants to use a variety of different types of magic and raises the value of having a broad magical repertoire - as we see in canon. Alternatively it forces you to manoeuvre your opponent into a situation where they cannot raise a defence because they are otherwise occupied. Again this is a skill, albeit tactical rather than magical skill.

On the other hand, in a system with stamina, there is a combat benefit to spamming the same spell: even if it is unsuccessful, you are wearing your opponent down. You can cast 9 failed stunners and on the 10th attempt, if the opponent is sufficiently tired, it may succeed.

So a stamina system decreases the importance of knowledge and skill and increases the importance of innate power.

Knowledge and skill are, in my opinion, far more interesting factors to determine success in combat, and far more interesting as limits to wizards' abilities. That is in addition to hard limits of magic as dictated by magical law, such as the fact that (per Snape) "time and space matter in magic", or the exceptions to Gamp's Law, etc.

**** It makes me wonder why wizards don't prepare more. Considering:

- Magic doesn't run out
- Enchantments don't expire (?)
- Infinite storage is a thing
- Britain is under threat of war for most of canon

What's stopping a determined wizard or witch from enchanting the hell out of of their clothes and jewelry with every protective charm known to man, packing their bottomless pockets and bags with animated battle golems, and filling the skies with semi-intelligent invisible kill drones?

Your average Joe certainly couldn't duel Voldemort or Dumbledore, whether because of lack of knowledge or not being able to think on their feet as quickly as they do. But why not spend an hour each day enchanting some protections? Again, it's wartime so it would be a wise investment. But no one seems to do that.

***** Enchantments can expire, but it seems to be a pretty variable thing. Some charmed objects last centuries, like the resurrection stone. Others, like the school brooms, go bad much quicker (though the charms malfunction rather than complete disappear).

As for the general lack of enchanted places/things, I suspect it's a general principle of HP magic that "dead" magic generally is defeated by "live" magic - that is, there's no replacement for the presence of an actual wizard, such that most fixed protections will be generally inadequate to repel a determined wizard.

This feeds into things like Kingsley being dispatched to protect the Prime Minister, rather than the Ministry simply enchanting the hell out of Downing Street - with enchantments, it's just a matter of time before they can be defeated, whereas a physically present wizard is a much more challenging obstacle. And a similar reason why wizards often prefer to place dangerous magical creatures to defend things rather than relying on enchantments. This is also a reason why I suspect wizards often prefer use curses to protect things, rather than charms - curses are more aggressive, and have a kind of malice of their own which is like a pale imitation of the active agency of a living wizard.

The Bond of Blood Charm would seem to be an exception to this general rule, however.

Knowledge, skill, etc.

It's a bit like asking why a determined person doesn't turn their house into a fortress, with a tank in the garage and turrets on the roof and a moat full of great whites.

Probably not a great analogy, but the point is that it just isn't easy. We see in canon that hundreds of wizards working in the Ministry can't even cast a Shield Charm. This is because magic is difficult.

And even if you do manage do all those things you described, it still won't stop a Killing Curse to the back. Or simply another wizard that's just /better/, Killing Curse or not.

A fortified home like I described sounds great, until you bring up the fact that your neighbors have tactical nukes in their basements.

It's like Fudge said, the problem is that the other side has magic too.

**** To add to this comment.

A system with stamina/cores means that some wizards are naturally more powerful. Unless there is a way to enhance your core, you are stuck at whatever level you are born with. And if there is a way to enhance your core, why wouldn't every wizard do it?

Cores usually diverge into two paths: 1) Harry is naturally more powerful than almost everyone (or literally everyone) around him, or 2) pureblood/muggleborn politics actually matter because one side is 'better' than the other.

This goes against almost everything Rowling is going for in her books. It wasn't power that saved the day but being a good friend, a good partner and a good person mattered far more.

***** False. A stamina system could rely entirely on use of magic to increase stamina - just like working out in real life will increase your physical stamina.

Most fics with cores do use it as a gauge for innate ability, but that again can be seen as analogous to physical aptitude - ability at running, jumping, etc. Many people already get that impression from canon, where some people get spells faster than others, or can cast stronger (eg, Harry's powerful shield spell).

Cores can also even all be the same size, and be there for aptitude towards a certain type of magic - eg, mirroring the way that wands are said to be good at a type of magic, and with an explanation being that they'd align themselves to the innate magic of the wizard/witch

**** As I said in my post, running out of magic doesn't need to be the cost. However, it /can/ be such. Also, a magical core or stamina system doesn't mean that running out of magic entirely is a thing - just that there's a limit on how much magic a wizard/witch can use without resting.

As for canon, we absolutely do see characters getting tired when casting spells. And the operating way in a fight of not spamming out spells makes no sense if there's no limit - your argument would only work if describing a fight between two people with different - and known - 'staminas'. Eg, one knows they can brute force the other.

If there's no physical or mental limits on spellcasting, then you should absolutely spam them out in a fight. The opponent being able to block them means nothing, if a single one slipping through wins - and that's particularly true if you're the weaker party needing to rely on luck.

The only way a variety of magic used in a fight makes sense, taking the time to maneuver your opponent around like you say, is if A) defense is incredibly easy (not very true, if killing curses are on the table) or B) the users can't have limitless spells.

If you have a limit of 10 spells, and you're up against an unknown opponent, it'd be an incredibly dumb strategy to just use the same spell ten times and hope that they tire before you. Instead, you'd actually need to look at the spells you have available, decide which would be appropriate for the situation, and use it before you tire out. This also gives a reason to use weaker spells, beyond just knowing them better ..

A stamina system can increase the importance of innate power/natural skill, or it can rely solely on hard work and repetition to build up that stamina (or use of rituals or other magic).

**** True, I like cores, stamina and magic limiter trope but that's only if it pushes magic into a hard magic system but normally those that use this trope pushes a certain eugenics into it or even lazy writing to show that Harry is just born more powerful but isn't relevant after a chapter. That and hard magic system is hard to write.

If I had to choose, I'd prefer story driven limiter, like Harry had to reach a certain emotional maturity to use patronus or see a threstral. The, I must overcome this emotional turmoil before I can do this, trope. Kinda like in the first Avatar, Zuko has to learn to use something other than anger to fire bend, katarra and that story with blood bending, aang being told by toph that he is too soft that is why he can't earth bend well as well as his episode with king boomy. No power ups until character growth thus ensuring character development to a certain degree.

** Magical stamina needs to be a thing. It adds a price to magic. Why is Voldemort so powerful? Rituals to increase said stamina, while the downsides was he lost his human appearance.

This also gives credence to the whole "Mudbloods steal magic!" crap in book 7. Muggleborn are more interested in magic, so they practice more, thus getting more stamina, while the purebloods are typical second generation rich and are lazy and thus has crap for stamina.

*** Magic only "needs" a price if you are telling a story where Muggles or Muggle technology is relevant and therefore the author needs to nerf magic to level the Muggle vs. magic playing field.

Otherwise, in a conflict between wizards, both sides have access to the same ability to cast magic without tiring, and therefore conflict is retained. This is the approach canon takes, explicitly recognised in HBP: "the problem is, the other side has magic too".

There's plenty of ways to have wizards more powerful than each other without reference to quantity of magic - namely, that power is a /quality/ or /property/ of their magic, one which is not fixed biologically but rather is a function of the individual's character and experiences. That, in combination with the knowledge/skill factor, is more than enough to account for the difference between e.g. Dumbledore and Neville.

**** Stamina does nothing to level the playing field. The only ways Muggles could win would be developing some kind of magical plague or maybe very clever use of hostages (and that would only work so long). Even for a draw the only option would be to nuke all life from earth. In order for muggles to win, they need wizards on their side as well.

***** I think stamina does level the playing field. A key part of a stamina system is that spells have an "effort" requirement, with different spells requiring different amounts of effort from the caster. This is an essential part of the stamina system, as without effort you cannot have exhaustion.

The next step is to stipulate what determines the level of effort required by a spell. This will generally be how much /stuff/ the spell does. A spell that creates 2 litres of water will require twice the effort than a spell which creates 1 litre of water. Now, of course you /could/ have a different system whereby more powerful spells actually take /less/ effort, or something completely left field like effort being determined by what colour the spell is, but pretty much all authors are going to make effort proportional to the power of the spell: more power requires more effort. Anything other than this and you're not really implementing a stamina system.

So now you have a system whereby you can exhaust a wizard's ability to cast magic by requiring more effort from them than they can produce. This opens the door to Muggles overcoming spells: the more force Muggles bring to bear against wizards, the more effort is required to resist that force, and there will come a point where the Muggles have brought enough force to bear to overcome the wizard's stamina. An author can set that bar where they like - some say a single bullet, other a medium-sized explosive, etc - but nonetheless you have a bar where natural forces can overcome magic if they are of sufficient magnitude.

And that is how a stamina system inevitably leads to a more level playing field, because you have turned magic from something that can just completely ignore natural forces to something that must expend effort to overcome them.

The force blockers in Star Wars (extended universe) work without immersion breaking because even without the force, Jedi (or Sith) can put up a good fight because they have spent years honing their skills.

** I know a lot of people shit on magical cores - and rightfully so - but something like that needs to be there, because the canon magical system is broken. In canon, a wizard or witch can cast endlessly for any amount of time they want. They can cast the most power-hungry spells (provided they're an adult) or the weakest spells, and they can go on and on and on.

Canon does have a kind of "magical maturity" that happens around age 17, and that is shown in the books, but other than that, all it takes to do any kind of magic is the right intent and concentration. And with how creating spells works, wizards and witches can create spells with an incredibly OP effect and keep spamming that single spell for years, if they want to.
