** Looks down for me. FYI, there's [[http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/][Down for everyone or just me]] and numerous other sites like that you can check for any site's being up or not, awesome things. Though it's telling me that it's up... Nevermind.

**** True, I know that archive of our own does scheduled stuff like that, hopefully it's like that otherwise I'm screwed. I join a ton of challenges and stuff on there and have met (well spoken with) a ton of people, it would be horrible if it was hacked or something.

****** Years and years ago. It's when they removed the NC-17 rating and got rid of all the tagged smut.

Feels like 8-10 years ago. Couldn't say exactly.

****** [[http://ficsave.xyz/]] Just set it up to email to you. Use the bookmark thing they have and all you do is hit the bookmark when you've got the fic opened up and it'll download it, make it into a pretty epub with all separate chapters and such, and then email it to you.
