Currently going through a ‚ÄúNext Gen‚Äù obsession and Scorose is my favorite. Any suggestions?? I particularly love the ones where Scorp and Al are friends and both in Slytherin, but I'll take anything.


** Oh, boy, so many recs so little time. üòÇ

Like my absolute top Scorose writers are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2801658/GraeLiars][GraeLiars]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1394384/inadaze22][inadaze22]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1778926/enchanted-teapot][enchanted-teapot]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1223404/languidbones][languidbones]] - in no particular order, they're all brilliant in completely different ways. Grae's just overall hilarious and heartwarming and angsty, inadaze22 writes the /best/ characters, enchanted-teapot is funny as hell and an excellent writer and person and languidbones is... just wow, her writing's like sipping warm tea under a warm cosy blanket.

They're all still writing scorose on a semi-regular basis (which is nice if you want to follow an in-progress and receive occasional smushy updates) and being absolutely phenomenal at it, nailing it time and time again (they also have excellent completed works).

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798171/Josephinee][Josephinee]] who's also incredible but who's been inactive for a while - but her Chronicles and Paramnesia were a big part of my... idk, intro to fanfic?

For specific fics not by these three guys, you have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12621795/1/Falling-For-You][Falling For You?]] by MoonstoneAndStardust (You've Got Mail inspired) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11372570/1/Unequivocal][Unequivocal]] by BeanerWeasley, both excellent.

Also that hella shameless self-promo because you mentioned Scorp and Al being Slytherin mates and that's literally what I write: linkffn(13187255). ‚ù§Ô∏è If you ever do read any of them, let me know what you think!

  Adulting by any other name would still be a proper bish. Rose is struggling to keep up at St Mungo's, Al is mending a broken heart and Malfoy... well. Malfoy's a prat. A good looking prat, but a prat nonetheless. They're all doing their best and failing miserably. [Post-Hogwarts, Slow-burn, Non-CC Compliant, Multi POV]

** ‚ÄúRaindrops on Roses by backinyourbox‚Äú linkao3(373224) has all three of them in Ravenclaw, and it is probably my preferred plain next-gen story.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
