Nott has spent years hiding his intelligence to avoid attention until Blaise pushes him to apply himself. He does and finds himself the unwilling rival of Hermione Granger. He sees his good grades as a way to get into his preferred field. She sees it as a way to start a competition he has no choice but to be a part of. Better grades than her earns hostility. Worse grades than her earns smug looks followed by hostility upon realizing that he could care less if her grade is better when he still got a Outstanding. Neither of them are happy Nott hates confrontation and Hermione doesnt like her status as resident genius challenged. Only Blaise is happy he thinks its funny the git.

( No Nott/Hermione No Blaise/Hermione)


** The funny thing is that if we take the Cursed Child as cannon, he truly might be a genius!
