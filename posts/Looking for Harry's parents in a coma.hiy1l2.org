I'm looking for some fanfiction where when Voldemort attacks godric's hollow Instead of killing James and lily they are put in a coma Harry is still raised by the dursley's just not abused and gets to visit his parents in Saint Mungo's Lily and James Are not released from their coma until after Voldemort is defeated.

Must include dursley family redemption

Alternative Scenarios Can be James Sacrifices himself and Dies for Lily and Harry However when Lily attempts to sacrifice herself Instead of dying she is put into a coma And Harry is still protected, Harry is sent to the dursley's and not abused But has both his mother's and father's protection. Lily can't wake up until Voldemort is Permanently Defeated


** I read a cool fic where James is in a coma and Harry saw Sirius and Remus like fathers, with Lily's chagrin. No Durstley featured I think, but there were Regulus Black and Severus Snape who were working in a foundation to help war victims. Regulus has got a son who is the look alike of Sirius, and Severus (his godfather) feels uneasy when he befriends Harry because they looked like Potter-Black the rehearsal. LOL.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
