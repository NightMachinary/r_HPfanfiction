** It's ridiculous that it got deleted for the most trivial of reasons.

I really hope the author is still able to work on it.

***** Were those really the song lyrics that were objected to? I'm sure there are fics that quote much more liberally than that.

It seems more like some idiot with a grudge reporting the story under some bs excuse, trying to get it removed.
