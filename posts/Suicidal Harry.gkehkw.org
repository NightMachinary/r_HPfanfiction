I saw a post that said "suicidal harry" as a request without anything else written on it. A long time ago, I had a theory about the prophecy where the "power the dark lord knows not" is actually the desire to "die."

Lord Voldemort spends all his time running from death, that he wants so much, he wants to live so bad...

Harry Potter, someone who's considered "worthless" by his own family, finds himself pressured into all these things of fame, power, and after a while the novelty wears off, and he realizes he was just as depressed as before because he knew he would have to return to the horrid place where Dursleys live.

This would be a Harry without any real fight, probably in Hufflepuff for emotional support groups, probably still lives in his cupboard because he doesn't really try convincing anyone otherwise. He could even be in Slytherin with the "ambition" to die, or maybe because the Hat thinks he'll make real friends there.

This would probably be a very hurt/comfort /angst fic, but one where Harry learns what it's like to be at his worst, but come out and become better than ever, like a learning to cope fic, where he learns that life is worth living a little at a time.

But this is also a Harry at a "disadvantage" and therefore, with more struggle comes a more satisfying ending.

This could feature a lack of sensitive eleven year olds.

An over energetic Hermione that doesn't realize Harry's depressive episodes, and pressures him to study without realizing his depressive episode.

Or a Ron that doesn't know when to stop asking questions.

A bunch of Hufflepuffs that "know his secret" and won't stop pitying him or trying to be sympathetic when they don't even know his need and desire to be alone without all the "ARE YOU OKAY?" (Not nearly as bad as the Slytherins/Ravenclaws who just go around ignoring him which is better than pitying glances and whispers.)

Maybe one person who truly understands what Harry is going through, like a therapist, or a group of friends that really learn how to help.

Obviously it'd be great to read something like this, but please, without any real bashing. This would be an extremely character developed story, where people learn empathy. So a little "bashing" at first, but they would eventually learn the error of their ways ect.


** I agree, as someone who suffered from an undiagnosed depression during my early teens I would love to read something like this.

The problem is, its gonna be dark. Not by action but emotionally, and I dont think that a fanfiction author could do this well.

But it's a brilliant idea and I could be surprised.

*** I agree not many can pull it off, but you'd be pretty surprised about some of the emotional depth of some fanfiction go into. There's been a few fanfiction that made the hairs on my neck stick up because they were so emotionally intense. Unfortunately it's been so long because I've been on that site for too long to remember any of them :P

***** :( it's okay, I relate. I wrote a fanfic a long time ago about a suicidal Naruto but I don't have the emotional strength to write another one with Harry so I just hope someone else will do it for me haha

** There was a fifth year one where Harry was actively pursuing his death through the use of a potion. He planned to kill himself and the dark lord off at the same time. It was long and I didn't finish, but it was good.

** while I get if others aren't into this I dig it a lot bc I love seeing how people handle depression and suicide/ suicidal idealization in fiction and fan works. Will definitely read this if written

*** looking through ao3 with what I remember I think it's this. I don't think theres bashing but it more focuses on Draco than Ron and Hermione. Just a heads up, the writing isn't great.
