:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fic where Harry and Hermione goes to Mahoutokoro (or another japaneese school). I don't remember a lot of things, but what I remember can be seen below: Hermione is in a relationship with Ron initially, but eventually breaks up. Harry is unable to be sorted properly and gets to try all of the houses. The houses are represented by sentinent magical beings. They have some kind of dare-based game where you need to collect two coins/cards.

Please help!
