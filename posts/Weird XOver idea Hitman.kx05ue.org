So, I just started playing Hitman. Only completed the tutorial so far (albeit I completed all the available challenges), but I had a weird idea: what if Harry is 47? Like, pre-Hogwarts he accidently time travels backwards, becomes 47 and then suddenly gets summoned by the Goblet of Fire, and arrives in all of his bald-headed glory. Yeah, pretty sure this is similar to various other xover ideas, but still. It would be hilarious to seeing Agent 47 completing the tasks along with various assassinations. Or, instead of time travel, it's dimensional travel, and when he gets summons by the goblet, he returns to his original 14yo self. That'd be an interesting to read as well, since it'll be hilarious seeing the professors trying to force him to attend classes and treating him younger than he really is.


** Based on my experiences playing Hitman, I imagine that:

- The entire Slytherin house occasionally disappears, only to be found unconscious and mostly naked stuffed in broom closets and bathroom stalls.

- Harry takes out his frustration from being caught in the wrong common room by slaughtering the entire school and several teams of aurors that show up to stop him. The next day, everyone is fine and no one remembers anything unusual.

- Harry apparently has extension charms on his pockets. He uses these to carry every coin, brick, hammer, knife, and piece of fruit he has ever come across.

- Harry just dresses up as a house elf sometimes, and no one questions it.

*** Oh my. Sounds like an even more hilarious idea than I originally thought.

*** We can't forget the homing briefcase ðŸ’¼. (haven't gotten to that point, but I heard about it)...

and now I randomly want to add a 3rd fandom to the mix: KHR. Reborn and 47 are so alike in terms of their disguises. At least, based on the KHR fanfics I've read (never actually seen or read it before)

** I thought you meant something like the plot of Hitman Absolution looking at the title but I see this idea to be far better than what I was thinking.

*** Thanks! Though, can't say I know what Hitman Absolution is about -- I only ever bought the 2016 and 2018 Hitman games
