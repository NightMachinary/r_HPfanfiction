Maybe something where Malfoy gets injured chasing the snitch and Harry gets injured by the charmed bludger from Dobby, forcing them both to the hospital wing for several days while the Gryffindor and Slytherin teams are forced to play until their seekers are healed


** Wouldn't the game be postponed? (it's not like it's the world Championship) Or maybe they'd have reserve players?

*** I mean, reserve players are never mentioned in the books and I thought that the rules stated the game doesn't end till the snitch is caught. And if they postpone it, they is still the chance that the event could happen all over again =P

**** Realistically, Quidditch is basically a magical version of cricket. That's where the inspiration for potentially weeklong games comes from. So professionals probably have some theoretical reserve players to tap into and there are probably rules regarding breaks for meals (that just aren't relevant to the level of play practiced by teenagers)

For the sake of in-school Quidditch, to keep people more engaged and since they have more freedom to just move/postpone games, and due to the small size/cast of characters they want to balance, it makes sense that reserve players aren't really discussed much in canon.

**** Hmm true, but then again it's always been a flawed sport. How would a fic like that even work though...? Just a one shot?

**** Is there any precedence to say that a seeker has to catch the snitch? Surely someone else on the team could make an attempt to catch it and end the game.
