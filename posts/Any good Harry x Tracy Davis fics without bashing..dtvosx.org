** I don't know of any post war stories, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] is a great fic with a Tracey/Harry pairing.

Tom Riddle's memories gradually slip into Harry's mind through dreams over the years. Harry's eventual quest to understand the Knights of Walpurgis sends him down a (figurative) dark rabbit hole. linkffn(3688693)

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** Linkffn(The Merging) is an interesting case: it features Harry/Tonks (in a way that I personally found pretty squicky- the fic indirectly states that they're second cousins*) while Tracey has a massive crush on Harry that's mostly unrequited, but also might not be and it's kinda vague about it. As a warning, though, it's one chapter (plus two epilogues) away from completion, currently ends on a cliffhanger, and hasn't updated in a little over a year.

Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chance Encounter) is an OT3 fic, but the first chapter is strictly Harry/Tracey, so you can read it as a one shot.

* Second cousins once removed, to be precise, which means that one of Harry's great-grandparents is one of Tonks' great, great-grandparents. While that isn't /super/ related, it's more related than I'd personally want a romantic and/or sexual partner to be.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
