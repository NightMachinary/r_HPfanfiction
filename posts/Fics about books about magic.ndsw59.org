I'm looking for fics that are written as if they were the textbooks or books that appear in Canon (the standard book of spells, a guide of transfiguration, magical theory, etc). Has anybody done something like that? Like writing the literal books? That's something that I always felt was missing from canon. In PS we are told that there's more to magic than just waving a wand ans saying funny words, but that's just what we get. I understand that for plot purposes it's impossible to fit all that world building, but I would love to read a well written magic treaty.


** The library of [[https://www.hogwartsishere.com/library/][this]] virtual Hogwarts contains some of the textbooks that actually appear in the series such as Advanced Potion Making, 1000 Magical Herbs and Fungi, Standard Book of Spells series, A History of Magic and most are actually complete and written from an academic standpoint.

** They exist, but they're new. Since someone already linked the virtual Hogwarts library and a list of fanfiction like what you asked for, I'll limit myself to explaining why it's a recent thing.

The answer is that it was against fanfiction(dot)net policy for someone to, for lack of a better term, "write a book that resembles a textbook." Even if it was fictional, that was (and I believe still is) against the rules. So nobody bothered. All instances of this that I know of were created after archiveofourown was founded. And, of course, the archive was created specifically because people felt the rules of ffnet were getting to be excessively strict.

So that's the reason why, up until fairly recently, there were no examples of what you are asking for.

But there are now. So that's good.

** I like reading fanfic that dresses itself up as in-canon text.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]] is a history and an autobiography of Cuthbert Binns.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/52143][A Contemporary Survey of Muggle Habits, by Arthur Weasley]] is an Muggle Studies essay written from the POV of a young Arthur Weasley.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/131956][An extract from "The Witch's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth, and Baby Care", by Alarica Rosier. Chapter Nine: What if my Baby is a Squib?]] is an excerpt from a wizarding world babycare book.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16467041][The Foundation of the Founding Four: The Place of Hogwarts' Founders in Wizarding Britain's National Myth-Making]] is another in-universe history essay.

And [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23641126][The Hogwarts Express: A Century of Travel in 9 ¾ Chapters]] sadly only contains 2 chapters but goes into the history and magic behind the Hogwarts Express.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/40838][Excerpt from Harry Potter: The Early School Years]] is written as an excerpt from a biography of Harry Potter himself.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Some have argued that the daily drudgery of being a Muggle is too much to bear.[10] This year I learned the opposite is true: they can and do entertain themselves in some interesting, if (delightfully) odd, ways.[10] See for example Chapter 3 of Cygnus Black's No Magic, No Meaning: Our Moral Obligation to Put Muggles Out of their Misery.

  The Founders Relics encountered by Harry Potter are NOT consistent with tenth century artefacts. Nor is the narrative of the Founders that he learns typical of how actual people behave. However, the STORY of the Founders is one that has obviously been put to political use, and is well-established by the time Harry encounters it. In this essay, I will argue that the Founders Relics were created to bolster personal and communal political objectives during periods of turmoil following the ultimate separation of Wizarding Britain from the Muggle world, as part of a wider cultural phenomenon which imagined the Hogwarts Four as the founders of a nation.(no seriously, I swear the argument makes sense)
