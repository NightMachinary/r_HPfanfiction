Okay, so I've been reading a very interesting fanfic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]] and I never knew I would LOVE a Slytherin!Ron like this. I was wondering if anyone knows other fanfics with Ron as a Slytherin. I've been looking, but I'm having a hard time with it.


** Linkao3(Actions speak louder than words) is a good one, if short.

  All-in-all, it's the best kidnapping experience Felicity's had so far by a lot. So, it's kind of an epic surprise when the fallout from it is so, so much worse.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has Ron in slytherin. Although he is not a main character and is rarely mentioned until I think book 5 of the fic where he gets his own small story arc.

*** IKR! Really hoping that Demon Eyes Laharl would keep up the updates. His last author's note made me think it's going to be abandoned soon. :/ I find the '/broke my computer/', '/lost all my files/' reason is the start of a long line of delayed updates and slow death of every good fanfics.
