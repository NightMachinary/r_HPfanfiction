So as the tittle suggest, I'm looking for fics that carter to a more mature audience, with conflicts on a global scope (if possible) and every mistake can be a death sentence. Torture, death, betrayal, zombie, apocalypse, inferi, nuclear disaster, witch-hunting... give me everything that makes your blood curdle, sends chill down your spine but at the same time makes you crave for more. I don't like romance that much but I'm not really in the position to demand so ¯_(ツ)_/¯ . Here're a few favorite of mine, so you guys can get a few ideas of fics mentioned

** Linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma): a post-apocalyptic zombie fic that has a bit of everything. No one besides maybe Harry has plot armor. Can be a bit of a downer.

Linkffn(Circular Reasoning): an absurdly brutal and dark vision of a time-traveling HP. This fic pull none of the punches that most "rewrite the terrible future" storylines do, though it does suffer from a fair amount of meandering.

Linkffn(Lesser Evils): a much darker take on the OotP fic, with characters who use the Dark Arts also showing the corresponding traits associated with their use.

Linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths): a novella length oneshot about how the climax of OotP could have gone down. I would also recommend pretty much every other fic by VotN, which feature some of the most brutal and twisted visions of HP you will find (though you may notice some repetition).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
