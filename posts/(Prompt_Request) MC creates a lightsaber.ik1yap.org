Note that I am not talking about a SW crossover. I'm talking about a random Muggleborn of Halfblood that's a huge Star Wars fan and creates a lightsaber using magic. Maybe they use their actual wand as a hilt, or it's a different weapon entirely, point is, it works.


** Harry + Tom make one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23263648][this]]. Though it's a very small part of the story and not used for fighting.

** There's a spell for that in Methods of Rationality, the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade - although it's only shown on the Stun setting, since these are /mock/ battles.
