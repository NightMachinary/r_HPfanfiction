I know Crouch Jr. performed the Confundus Charm on the Goblet of Fire which is the impartial judge and entered Harry in as a separate competitor for a ‘fourth' school so that as the only person who entered he would be chosen.

What I'm wondering is if the Goblet of Fire chooses the most capable competitor of all the people who entered why would Crouch have to create a ‘fourth' school?

Wouldn't the Goblet of Fire under the Confundus Charm still recognise that magically Crouch Jr. is far better than seventeen year olds and technically pick him ergo Harry? Therefore Cedric wouldn't be chosen and Harry would have to represent Hogwarts?

I don't follow. He entered Harry, not himself. The Goblet has to judge whether Harry is capable or not.

*** Maybe someone who enters another person is still recognized as himself? Say, the name on the piece of paper would change into that of the person holding the paper.

**** There's plenty of AU stories that handle it this way but it is certainly not canon. I assumed this question was in regards to canon and not made up rules.

** Would Crouch ergo Harry be chosen over hogwarts students? Not certain, he has been kept under the imperius for a decade. And who knows what exact criteria the Goblet is looking for. For all we know it's actually just a random number generator. If the Goblet can only choose 1 student out of a pool of 1 student then the odds of Harry/Crouch being chosen are certainly a lot higher. Even if Crouch could be reasonably certain that Harry would get chosen from the hogwarts list, hes still going to make the odds as close to 100% as he can.

*** Barty was very talented. If after all that time Imperiused, he could still outfight Moody, throw off the curse, confund the goblet in the first place and flawlessly imitate a powerful and highly trained Auror with what seemed like very little effort. I'm pretty sure he could have easily outdone any student. Even as a student himself he got more OWLs than Hermione.

** If I'm reading this right, your saying that since Crouch is more powerful than any Hogwarts student who entered their name, the goblet would select his entry as the best for Hogwarts, and since his entry has Harry's name on it, that would mean Harry's name comes out of the goblet.

I can't recall if this is backed up by canon, but I think the goblet judged Harry's entry by Harry's level of power, not the person who entered him because Harry /did write his name on his entry/, not Crouch. Crouch ripped Harry's name from a piece of homework Harry handed in during DADA. I think that's how the Goblet establishes the much maligned 'binding magical contract', because Harry did technically sign his name. The method by which the name gets into the goblet wouldn't effect the goblet's judgement of the entrant. I'm not sure what would have happened if Crouch had written Harry's name.

Because of all this, Harry would be judged less worthy than Cedric (and others), so Crouch needs to create the fourth school.

I always wanted to read a fic that treats the implications of this seriously: A super paranoid magical society where everyone is afraid to write their name anywhere.

Everyone staring wildly at Harry and yelling "Are you crazy!?" when he signs his first essay in first year.
