Are there any fics with Manipulative Dumbledore (Indy!Harry or no Indy!Harry) where he's actually, y'know, manipulative? Machiavellian, ruthless and strategically-minded, able to plan three moves ahead in any situation, etc. And not the parody fics where he rhetorically distracts Harry or deconstructs his arguments (If I was such a ruthless manipulator, then what did you expect to happen when you confronted me? kind of fics), I mean an actual fic where he is seriously like that.

And not Partially Kissed Hero either please. I tried that fic and it just went utterly mad towards the end of the middle and I couldn't keep reading. (His harem became Dryads and went back in time or something?). If you have anything like that that isn't completely mad, then send it over.

Otherwise, no other filters. Het, slash, any pairing, any weird shit, etc etc.
