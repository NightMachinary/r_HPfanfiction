** A manipulative, but ultimately rather stupid Dumbledore.

The guy is a genius, a savvy politician and one of the most powerful and knowledgable wizards alive.

He does not get outwitted by a 14 year old. Period.

*** Well, he kind of is arrogant, too (and not at his prime anymore, we don't know if he really could still duel Voldemort without the Elder Wand for example!) and that can lead to being outwitted (but not constantly, he might be caught unaware once, maybe twice, but not all the time!)

ps: Especially if you give said teen the support of other politically savvy adults (from Amelia Boones to Cornelius Fudge (for all his bluster and perceived stupidity: Don't forget he was the minister and you don't get that post by being a dumbass!))

But anyway. I can deal with him being surprised by Harry suddenly behaving differently. What I meant were fics that then don't change his approach. If Harry is acting alone, he should not (even if he's time travelling back and therefore has a ~22 year old brain) be able to outwit Dumbledore constantly.

If Harry has the support of other characters that could hold themselves against Dumbledore, then its still very unbelievable that Harry can execute any political plan without fail against someone who has played this game for a century.

***** Hate President George W. Bush all you want (I don't like him much either!) but he was NOT DUMB (neither is Mr. Trump for that matter - I despise the man (I also despise Mrs. Clinton and think having Trump might make the USA shift towards a more progressive path in the next election because let's face it: Trump would destroy a lot of things from international relations to social programms etc.!), but I can't call him dumb!)

Well, 22 year old's who've been constantly treated like shit who had to grow brains in order to survive might have a chance (of course Dumbledore wouldn't give up without a fight!) ;)

Over all I do agree, still I love reading the occasional power trip :)

** The two main ones for me are:

1) Harry takes an inheritance test and finds out he's the heir to All The Things. This is stupid because

- It just hands Harry a bunch of power and influence at no cost or effort for Harry.
- If Harry is heir to All The Things, surely the Potters and/or Lily were too, so why is it a surprise to everyone?
- Most of the time the disappearance of All The Things predates the existence of Gringotts and thus would not have a vault there.
- The insular nature of wizarding society would mean that since All The Things are from An Age Long Ago then /everyone/ ought to be heir to All The Things.

2) Self-binding magical vows. These are stupid because not only do they not exist in cannon, they completely break everything with regards to storytelling. Additionally, I don't see how they could even function magically as I imagine it would be like the magical equivalent of trying to hug yourself to death or tie a not in taffy.

Yep. Who decided to hand out inheritance tests, anyway? The goblins were in control of the wealth but thanks to the inheritance test they're not. If wizards were responsible, they'd prefer to have a strict line of inheritance for everything -- and the Ministry would insist on being the inheritor of last resort.

- Somebody upset with historically accurate information (runes, titles, deeds, etc.): 1 drink.
- Anything with the word "Dumbledore": 1 drink.

** Not necessarily Ice Queen Daphne, but... FauxMachiavellian!Daphne, I guess?

So we know that she's a Pure-blood. Cool. We know that her sister got married to a Malfoy despite being the liberal hippie tearaway of the brood. Okely-dokely... But that's pretty much it.

We might infer that she's not crazy talented at every magicks evar, because Hermione would've had her own rival alluded to in canon:

("Ugh - I can't believe that blasted Greengrass got 113%! I just /know/ she smuggled in a dodgy quill..."... Or something like that)

If she's pretty, she probably isn't as fanciable as the Patil twins as the Yule Ball would've been a prime opportunity to bring it up:

("But she's a Slytherin, Ron. A snake is a snake is a snake!"

"Well, dunno about you, but she could bite my jugular any time... anyone? Come on Colin, don't leave me hanging!")

So why the anime-esque caricature of an aloof, polished, silver-tongued teen socialite who can run circles around Wizengamot members and Death Eaters without breaking a sweat?

It's so frustrating, because I've fallen in love with her name like so many others, but have yet to find a feature as entertaining as Vlad's old oneshot...

*** I love Daphne fics but i have to agree that most of them are bloody terrible. I guess she's pretty much an OC with the limitation that she's a Slytherin and most people seem to align Slytherin with 'Pureblood Princess' by default.

There are some very, very good Harry/Daphne fics and i think she's one of the most interesting love interests for Harry, mainly for the new perspective she gives to a canon Harry. If it's non canon Harry then he's usually already more interesting because let's be honest - canon Harry is an average wizard at best with moderate intelligence and while idiots follow him for something he had no influence over, he's nothing more than a mindless follower himself.

Anyway, rant over. Daphne's awesome if done right and terrible if not. Also, read this hilarious one-shot: linkffn(9564974)

***** I generally write her as anything but an Ice Queen.

In "Patron", she's a ditz, or at least Pansy Parkinson and Harry and Co. see her as the typical blonde - she's not POV character there, so her real thoughts are not often revealed.

In "Divided and Entwined" she's a typical rich pureblood witch who, after losing her parents in the early stages of the civil war, falls in with Draco and Co. to get revenge. She's starting to realise that she might be in over her head, but backing out is not safe anymore. She's a POV character as well.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", she's not particularly smart or cold either, but doesn't play much of a role.

I guess the "Love Potion Dumbledore/Weasleys" trope normally popularized by H/Hr has simply been co-opted by H/G authors to make it its own trope specific to H/G, to make the fic more interesting due to the increased conflict within the Weasley family.

Usually it starts when Harry goes off to Gringotts (usually without the aid of the manipulative!Dumbledore/Weasley family), and is told by the goblins that he's not just ONE important lord of a noble house, but TWO! So now our dear Harry is /Lord Potter-Black/ or some other asinine hyphenated name, filthy rich and powerful. But that's not all! There's also a magical block put on him by Dumbledore that the goblins take off somehow and now Harry is super-charged and extremely powerful /eyeroll/.

Don't forget about the marriage contract that was drawn up when he was a baby! Usually to our ice princess, Daphne Greengrass or some other powerful, pure blood girl, so now Harry will be in control of THREE noble house when he's married and barely 17.

Okay.

That's not all! Now Harry somehow finds out he's related to all four creators of Hogwarts, and has more power at school that Dumbledore. So Harry's now a cocky little shit, Daphne falls in love with him, and he defeats Voldemort easy as pie.

** virtually everything I ever found wrong with fanfic is already listed here in other comments. In fact [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2125102/][Lord Anarchy's profile]] pretty much has it all.

my biggest beefs with fanfiction are basic mechanical things like the complete dismissal of anything like proper grammar and punctuation. The one that started my 7 page list is this: EVERY word with an 's' has an apostrophe.. place's thing's word's.

I cringe when I see these. In fact I have taken to reading a fic with the actual word the author used rather than what they thought they used.. makes it funnier ex: 'Bellatrix is a viscous fighter'..think about it. I have a long list of wrong words that I won't put here, but a few highlights: The Daily Profit The Chudley Canons the statue of secrecy

also the clichés that abound checklist writing, stories written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639518/1/The-Harem-War][spreadsheet]]

common tropes to the point you have to check the title to figure out which story you are reading surprise slash wrong pairings (adjustable by your preference) shouting spells. !genius!!expert! Harry/Hermione/whomever longwinded before and after notes explaining what the story is about/excuses why its late/shoutouts/review replies/2000 word disclaimers/movie ripoffs, just plug in the character to the movie plot. AN in the middle of a story- that's an example of poorly written story.

repetitive use of the same bits or text. checklist sex scenes/ Sex at 13/ good sex first time/ unrealistic, as if writer was transcribing a porn video at the time Writers secret fetish or perv projected on character/written by someone who has never had actual sex.. and so many more.

Another trope I frequently see is hating of certain writers, ex: robst/etc.. Sometimes you want to read a certain type thing. I used to read the late [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer][Broomstick Flyer]]. not because the writing was good, or even original, but because the story gave me a cheap good feeling/happy ending. I read robst because he is predictable and usually won't go out of the comfort zone. Sure it's not [[https://www.google.com/search?q=great+writers&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][hemingway or theroux]] it's predictable.

****** Hmm. Not to be all TMI about it, but it varies a lot more than you're implying. Most of my friends didn't suffer. For some, it was weird - I mean, fingers or what-have-you in one's personal holes can be awkward for all kinds of reasons - but not painful. For others, it didn't hurt at the time but was sore later. Nothing dramatic, just sensitive. I think there's still a cult of mystery for some people around women's bodies and how they function. It's not all blood on the sheets and traumatic ripping.

Of course, that doesn't equate to having good sex the first time out. Especially if both parties are new to the whole thing. But that's part of the fun of writing first-time shenanigans. Embarrassment! Horniness! Premature ejaculation! What the heck is that and what am I supposed to do with it? You expect me to put my mouth /where/?

** The fanon belief in magical cores is the one which gets me most. The idea seems a way just to make the hero more powerful in comparison to the competition. Power in Harry Potter appears if anything to be linked to intelligence, creativity and possibly insanity, not an abstract core with no relation to anything else in the world. I think the only time I've actually liked it when this was mentioned was when in linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) Harrymort mentioned it as a fact and Hermione told him it had been disproved centuries ago.

I also agree that evil but stupid Dumbledore is annoying and whitewashing the bad guys is self-defeating. If I wanted to read a story about good people (who happen to be a bit racist) defeating bad people I'd just read the originals; if you're going to blur the lines make it more morally complex, don't just impose new characters onto the story.

** You know what fanon idea I hate?

Enchanting being the art of carving or sewing runes onto an object giving it magic. It is

A) Lazy. It is a method that requires very little of the author's brainpower to come up with.

B) Boring. The only time this idea has been any level of exciting has been in Bungle. And that was an '06/'07 fic. In the following 9-10 years it has never been interesting.

C) Stupid. Enchanted stuff has got to be pretty big in the magical world. Sure, you can buy enchanted stuff in Diagon Alley and probably Hogsmeade. But as we see from Mr. Weasley, this is something that people can do, and actually do, at home. Hell, even Hermione does it with the DA coins. And to have the entirety of enchanting require the use of Ancient Runes, a non-compulsory course? Fucking stupid.

You know why cursebreakers for Gringotts require Ancient Runes? Because runes (and I'm including hieroglyphics in this) tend to be carved or painted onto old ruins, and thus give context to the ruins, telling the cursebreaker the age of the ruins, and therefore an idea of the type of curses likely to be present. And some probably straight out say what curses are present, in an attempt to scare people away, or in bragging.

Stop being so goddam lazy, boring and stupid with enchantments. And this goes for 'wards' too, since 'wards' are nothing more than protective (or offensive, see DH Dumbledore dust ghost thingy) enchantments on a building or area (see DH, securing the camping site).

*** Okay, so I get why out-of-control fanon annoys you, but how does the use of runes to make enchanted objects break your sense of plausibility? There are a number of objects mentioned in the books as having unusual stitching or being etched with runes, usually to suggest that they are powerfully enchanted - the most obvious example being the Pensieve.

From my perspective, study of ancient runes would have to be a significant sideline of interest to make it worth having it be a standing elective. My headcanon for it is that runes are used in enchanting, but the modern ones are taught as part of Charms, whereas the ancient runes provide the background on how enchantment has evolved over the millennia.

What other ones are you thinking of, because all I can think of is the obvious example of Pensieve. The Sorting Hat isn't, it's just an old hat. The Ford Anglia is a normal looking muggle car. The Sword of Gryffindor just has Gryffindor's name engraved on it. The Deluminator looks like a lighter. Brooms look like a wooden shaft with bristles, and the broom's make and model on it. The Mirror of Erised is just a big, kinda fancy looking mirror with the inscription of what it does on it backwords. Elder Wand is a wand. The Resurrection Stone has the Deathly Hallows symbol scratched onto it, and the Cloak looks like any new invisibility cloak.

Everything in that sentence I like, though I also think that part of Ancient Runes is a literature/translation kind of thing.

If I were putting together a fic (not likely, I have a way with words. Not a good way.), runes would have been a very, very, very old way of enchanting, but just not as good as more modern spellcasting enchantments. Runes in modern days would mostly be used as temporary enchantments for those underage, or as academic language in high level, magical theory publications.

*** I can get your view. I do use runesin enchanting in my stories as this.

You place a spell on an item. It's now enchanted but eventually wears off at a random time.

You engrave specific runes then power those runes using the spell. The runes make the enchantment permanent.

I add a complication but that's not necessary for this.

****** Most rune carvings have no magical significance at all. Where they are assumed to have been magical, they are mostly simply the futhark (all runes in sequence). Most other runes are basically maker's marks, like "XXX made me" on a knife.

The largest trove of runes we have are from Bergen and they have inscriptions like :

"Ingibjörg loved me when I was in Stavanger"

"Smidur made love with Vigdis of the Snældubeinar"

"Lovely is the pussy, may the prick fill it up!"

"Gyða tells you to go home"

Runes as mystical magic is mostly a nineteenth century idea, unfortunately closely entwined with early racist ideology both in Britain and on the continent.

Is the "brightest witch of her age" assumption, based on the misinterpretation of a tossed-off line, a badfic trope that spawns tons of OOC Hermiones? Sure. But Hermione /is/ extremely intelligent, although her brains and her methodology don't exactly qualify her for goddesshood. They do, however, make her an excellent candidate for Minister for Magic.

I don't get why so many people still think they can base a character's characterisation on canon /actions/. Characters in canon do exactly what the plot demands of them, no matter how stupid or OOC it is.

Do you really think Remus would have kept the knowledge about Sirius being an animagus from Dumbledore, a man who already knew all his secrets and had done so much for him, when he thought Sirius was trying to murder Harry? That was done so the 3rd book could have the climax at the end.

Does anyone really think that Dumbledore could be fooled by Barty Crouch Jr. for a year? Or, if Barty was that talented, that he would have been caught at the end, instead of leaving when Harry disappeared? Again, the plot demanded it, so it happened.

I don't know where you're getting this Harry who casually lambasts Hermione. Where in canon does Harry ever get his kicks out of turning his magic on his friends and blasting them? What is it about Harry not attacking them that makes him a too sweet flower child? He's determined and talented and fierce in confrontation, and he plans to become an Auror, which requires a willingness to deal with the darkest side of wizardkind. But he's not aggressive with his magic, and he's not a prankster like his dad and Sirius. I really don't think I'm the one doing the projecting here.

And how do you know that's not how dueling works? We get the showcase duel set up by Lockhart, an opportunistic idiot and non-teacher who clearly has no idea wtf he's doing, a situation Snape immediately exploits with the intent to humiliate Harry. Historically, those who duel for sport train for it. Flitwick was a champion dueler who most likely participated in competitions, which presumably involves practice and studying up on wand movements and rules and penalties and spell categories. 'Dueling at dawn,' until it was outlawed, was sanctioned murder based on an honor code, and woe to the participant who /hadn't/ trained with the chosen weapon. Obviously that's not the kind of dueling Hogwarts hosts.

I get it that there are people in this sub straining at the leash to see Hermione taken down a peg, and they like to imagine Harry being the one to do it. They enjoy the idea of Harry demonstrating his "raw power." But that's not a version of Harry supported by canon, and it comes across as the reader/writer using Harry as a stand-in to punish Hermione for - what? Not actually being the brightest witch of all time? Starring in badfic? Stealing Ron's lines in the movies?

**** No its not. its how the movies portray Hermione. In the books, Hermione comes up with three things that are extremely vital to the plot by herself. The basilisk, the DA, and the DA coins. Every other thing is a joint effort between herself Harry and/or Ron. that is not a good track record in reality.

JK rarely used hermione to "write herself out of situations". she actually used magic for that. Why did B happen? Magic.

Hermione in cannon is obsessed with books, knowledge and has issues connecting with others because of it. she is not the smartest witch of her age, because if she was she wouldnt have tried SPEW, or knitting house elves hats to free them. She wouldnt have only put a mild hex on a piece of parchment instead of looking up legit contracts. It is not canon to have Hermione be perfect goddess mode. its just how it was portrayed in the movies because Emma Watson was more attractive than Rupert Grint

  Twin fics. Can you honestly think of an actual plausible situation where one twin would be allowed to live with their parents, while the other is sent off to live with other relations. You can't?

  'Mione - uhg, anyone else get the urge to scratch out their eyes when they see this nickname? I think it's used exactly once in canon when Ron is stuffing his mouth full of food. It's almost as bad as when people use Harold as Harry's real name.

  Prank Wars - oh god. Why? In nearly every case, they're not entertaining, and I find myself skimming through them (much the same way I skim quidditch chapters). They're boring to read about, and rarely written well. And just saying that your fic is a 'humor' fic doesn't give you an excuse, nor does it mean that it's actually funny.

- characters getting away with shitty behaviour (again: Firebolt - I mean Hermione might have been right, but going behind a friend's back? Come on, that's not ok and she didn't learn her lesson either! I mean she badgers Harry constantly for his secrets, even if she really doesn't have any right to know them what so ever: It's Harry's decision when and if he tells her and Ron...not to mention that her total obedience to authority figures is bothering me - I would never let a friend wallow in his perceived guilt, just because my school's headmaster says so...no way, I'd either visit him personally or take him away from said Headmaster (at least for the holiday), because let's face it: Dumbledore has no right to keep Harry at the Dursleys (if those blood protections fail it's only the Dursleys who will suffer, because in the end.

- "Smartest witch of her age" stop it, Hermione has so many flaws herself that it's not even funny anymore and compared to Tom and Dumbledore she's not overly smart and/or creative either (hell, even compared to the Marauders and Fred and George she comes up short IMHO), sure she isn't stupid: But she's not the be all end all either!
