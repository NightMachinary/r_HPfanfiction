Muggle culture being introduced to Hogwarts. All the tropes please - Singing howlers, We will rock you, pens, etc. Long or short, canon characters or no, I'm really just looking for something fun. I can't wait to see what yall come up with!


** Honestly, I think the most viable thing that wizards would accept without much issue would be fountain pens. Not ballpoint pens, but fountain pens. The nibs are similar enough to quills that they'd be easy for more traditional wizards to get used to writing with, and not having to pause every few words to dip your nib in the inkpot over and over again would be very much appreciated. You can still write on parchment and do so much faster and more fluidly than you otherwise could just using a quill, IIRC. Only issue comes from then needing to refill the ink chamber whenever its empty, but that's normal.

From there, other things that would likely align well with wizarding sensibilities might also be adopted. Just basic improvements on daily life, not major cultural things, because wizards don't need to be dealing with the rapid pace of muggle trends that don't really concern them much. The Wizarding Wireless already serves to broadcast messages publicaly across the country, so perhaps they might draw further from Muggle audio-recording technologies and music to generate wizarding equivalents to Walkman players and the like. Magical Television might be created via enchanted cameras and specially prepared canvas paired with specialized, magical-radio signals to to get visuals along with the audio, designed exclusively to report on magical events and the like so people can watch Quidditch from the comfort of their homes just as they would listen to the play-by-plays on the Wireless.

With regards to music... I don't see Wizards really revelling in Muggle songs. Genres, maybe, but we know from canon that the wizarding world has a bunch of magical musicians producing albums and singles for their magical audiences, so maybe the shifts and trends in Muggle genres of music might also be reflected in the wizarding world, albeit in slightly different ways. Different instruments and takes on the same ideas could come about to produce an entirely new variation on a Muggle genre when a wizard/witch musician takes a stab at it and puts their own spin on something Muggle.

I could see stuff like that happening. Wizarding culture usually doesn't care much for Muggle culture exactly-as-is, but they're perfectly happy adopting or coming up with their own variations on Muggle stuff to suit their own purposes... but they'd likely make them all "magical" and suited to their own style and cultural way of doing things. Fountain Pens would be acceptable over quills simply they can be used on parchment when Ballpoint Pens would have difficulty being legible. Television designed for wizards, by wizards, might come about from advancements on the Wizarding Wireless so people can watch the Quidditch game on top of listening to it. Advancements in magical telecommunications could also assist in talking with others internationally without the use of Floo or owls via magical radio transmissions. Etc etc.

*** Those are all very good points! I was mostly just looking for a bit of laughter, but I would be very interested in a fic along those lines if anyone knows any.

*** I remember reading a fic where Wizards and Witches wrote with quills as a primer for other skills, not because they were backwards. They wrote with quills because making your letters correctly and manipulating the length and thickness of your pen strokes were crucial skills in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. Writing with a quill taught young Wizards and Witches the control that they would need in other subjects, where the difference between an exploding rune and a sealing rune is the thickness of the stroke.

**** That's actually a pretty cool take on the idea, NGL. Would love to know what fic that was and if the rest of it was worth reading by my own standards.

But anyways, my usual viewpoint is to stick closer to canonical descriptions and stuff like htat, wherein Arithmancy is "magical mathematics, numerology and probablistic predicitionism" and Ancient Runes is just "old, dead languages from around the world that magic textbooks used to be written in".

In that sense, the quill wouldn't be /that/ important unless you want to be able to draw out the runes and symbols for Ancient Runes properly so you don't accidentally confuse the Futhark symbols for Eihwaz and Sowilo together, or Thurisaz and Wunjo and stuff like that.

If you're taking a more canonical viewpoint of the subjects of magic, proper quill writing might just be about developing patience, precision and the need to write surely and precisely because you need to be certain of what you're writing when you do so with a quill. And the deftness and precision with which one writes with a quill might also translate into the wrist-control necessary for wandwork - we've gotten loads of examples in canon where control over one's wand movements can have great effect. So, stuff like proper aiming and precision in wandwork could be a result from having to write essays using a quill and all the annoyances of writing with a quill...

Not a half bad thought, TBH, but I could still see wizards (adult wizards, mainly) transitioning to a fountain pen once they had the time to get used to writing with the fountain pen over the quill, especially since they've already learned the basics of magic and wouldn't suffer from having to use a fountain pen over a quill for the sake of speed and efficiency.

I dunno, I get that quills are more magical and fit the wizardly mystique better, but I figure that any enterprising Muggleborn would realize that if the only thing quills are good for beyond writing is just training your wrist/hand control for wandwork, then once they've gotten that down the best thing would be to switch to fountain pens. Unlike ballpoint, fountain pens should write well on parchment based on the nibs alone, so a Muggleborn would be like "Hey, I can use this on parchment and on the thicker stock of Muggle paper too!"
