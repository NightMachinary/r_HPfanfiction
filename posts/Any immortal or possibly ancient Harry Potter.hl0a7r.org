I want fic where Harry Potter is like really old and is immortal or just has a really long life span.

I want a fic where Harry knows many obscure rituals and old magic and all that stuff.

I've seen a similar post about five years ago and I'm sure there would be more stories about this concept now.

**** Well, if you haven't, you really ought to. It's spectacular.

There's also 'A Wizard from Earth', based on 'The Man from The Earth' movie (which is also spectacular, though it has absolutely no action whatsoever and somehow creates a compelling story through less than a dozen people talking in a room for two hours).

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

While Harry was in his fifth year, someone sent him back in time to 650bc. With no way in getting back to his regular time, he learns numerous magicks lost through time. He even picks up a cute vampire son named Ana along the way. (I probably explained it horrible l, but seriously! READ IT!! I really loved it!)

** Linkffn(2651376). It was good in the earlier chapters, and delved into a lot of religions and mythology in the first part. Then it goes over to a x-over with X-men. It was first posted a few years ago, and after a long time started updating about a month ago. Personally, the writing style is way worse in the newest parts, but at least until the defeat of Voldemort was very good

  Thanks to a ritual in his first life, he's been reincarnating for millennia. Every death has resulted in being born anew nine months later. He's always magical, always male, and always in possession of all his memories, but always in a different body and of a different family. This time, he has been born to a naive young couple with high ideals and little understanding but an enormous well of love for their son that he cannot fault. This time, he is called Harry Potter.This story is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
