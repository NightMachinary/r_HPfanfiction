Bracing myself for potential downvotes here, since I know Ron gets bashed a lot nowadays and Hermione has a mixed reception among the fans. I remember the days before the Ron-bashing started, back when Ron/Luna was a more popular ship - heck, I'm even old enough to remember when people went around calling it "Red Moon".

Anyway, I'm curious to see if any stories with this theme exist. How would Hermione react - especially given how she already has her issues with Luna - and would the whole situation cause any sort of rift in the Weasley family, or perhaps a rift between Harry and Ron (or Hermione and Harry, since he doesn't know which of his best friends to side with)?

I know it's a rather specific request for what's already a pretty niche pairing, but please let me know what all you find.

*** It's quite common as background pairing but makes no sense to me. Usually, it goes along the lines of Ron letting Luna just prattle on about whatever she believes in and that is the extent of their "relationship". I mean, I don't particularly like Ron, but I could totally see him going for the "hot" girls like Lavender or Parvati (or if we go with fanon Susan, Hannah or occasionally Daphne) instead of the ones who are somewhat academic and would be not very compatible with him. Sadly, writing a relationship which BEGAN purely based on looks makes it "shallow", despite being a common occurrence in the real world.

Edit for clarification: From all the Ron/Luna relationships I have seen, none seem to be a remotely healthy relationship. I mean, if one partner just pretty much ignores the other when they are talking about their lifelong passion, that seems very odd to me. And not particularly long-lived, but the author usually brushes this over with the ol' "but they still love each other" despite never showing it in their interactions. Ron in canon seems to go for the pretty girls (GoF anyone?). Absolutely nothing wrong with that. It just seems odd that someone that uninterested in academic pursuits would go for either the "smartest witch in her generation" or for "Britain's leading cryptozoologist".

  Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her.

Almost every girl spent at least a few hours getting ready for the Yule Ball, and would for any major event.

Also, Cormac McLaggen was interested in Hermione in Half-blood Prince and he wouldn't be interested if she wasn't at least passingly attractive. That doesn't mean she's a model or Emma Watson level, but calling her less than average or ugly is blatantly false.

******** She may had her teeth fixed, but she still had those teeth for 3/4 books. I'm sure that Hermione is the only one who had to use a huge amount of the hair product, she even said herself that it was too much trouble to use it everyday. While it doesn't mean that she is ugly, it does mean that she is less than average. "The attention to her appearance was unusual". Finally it's normal that Cormac would be interested in her because she is somewhat popular in Hogwarts due to her friendship with Harry and the DM fights from the fifth year. Besides nothing says that Cormac has big standard.

Edit: If you look like Hermione, I hope you will not take it personal as your constant downvotes of my replies may indicate...

People can be cute without any help at all. I mean, Harry himself is described as very attractive and he spends exactly zero time on himself. To equate "I'd rather not spend time taming my hair daily" to "unattractive all over" seems like a desperate stretch.

*********** It's almost like you stopped reading at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban. Your comments make a lot more sense with that lens. I'd agree that both Harry (malnutrition) and Hermione (pre-puberty) were likely unattractive children, but that's clearly not the case from GoF on.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.”

  Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper.
#+end_quote

Note that interesting is presented separately than fanciable.

And Romilda Vane and all of her friends, the whole bit about the Hippogriff tattoo. Harry also looks like his father, who was described as handsome. Rowling herself has said that Harry inherited his parents good looks, and Lily was also described as attractive. Even Tom Riddle, who hates him, says they have similarities in looks^{^{1}} and Tom was described to be attractive himself.

If you want to ignore sections of the books to fit your preferred view, I guess I'll have to leave you to it. If you come across anything supporting either Harry or Hermione as less than average, please do send a quote.

** I think this subreddit is relatively open about Ron, except for a few really aggressive basher, heck there were quite a few threads with people being annoyed with the bashing. About how Hermione would react, it would depend if they´re already together or not, if he breaks up with her to be with Luna, I guess Hermione would be angry, but considering what they went through together, I guess they could fix things and remain friends after a while. Harry in this case will probably be on Hermione´s "side" or just try amend things between the two. If they´re not together and Luna ends up with Ron, she´ll probably be miffed for a while, if we say it happens in year six like with Lavender, but considering she likes Luna, I guess she would just accept it and move on. About stories with them I only remember reading about the pairing as a side pairing, but not as main story.

** You know, I never really considered this pairing but I really find myself liking it. Luna in canon actually finds Ron very funny, so much so that she explicitly tells him so. Luna is the type that seemingly would be hard to humor since she is not great at sarcasm, so I feel this is significant.

Additionally, I find myself really intrigued by how Hermione would react to them being together, based on how she treats/feels about Luna. I would absolutely read a fic like this.

Based on what we know about Rolf Scamander, it would seem that Luna has an affinity for redheads, which kind of sinks my Harry/Luna ship that I've had for many years.

  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

** I always feel bad for Luna when I read stories like that. She deserves better. It can work though if Ron is more proactive and helps her out in some way, Harry seems way to busy and Luna could really need some friends earlier than in canon. Would be good for Ron too if he defines himself less through his friendship to Harry and starts to stand on his own 2 feet.

I can't provide you with a story, but I think on Portkey Ron/Luna was a popular (the only allowed maybe?!) Ron pairing, so maybe look for some stories from there.

Anyway, the only ship that makes sense for canon!Ron is someone equally superficial and emotionally stunted, maybe Lavender... but I felt bad even for her. She seemed really care about the guy - in her own Ahnung way - and he treated her like a practice girlfriend and someone to make out with.
