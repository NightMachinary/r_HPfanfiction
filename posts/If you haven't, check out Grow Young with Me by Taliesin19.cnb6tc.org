:END:
I re-read the canon series every single year. But this year was different because I really didn't want the HP World to end, so I started reading Fanfiction. I've been reading Harry Potter Fanfiction for about 5 months now and it's safe to say I'm fairly addicted.

In those five months, I've read the more popular stories that are... 'staples?' in this community. Despite many being entertaining and well-written, nothing stood out. Not to say they weren't amazing stories, but I enjoyed them equally and nothing really blew my mind.

I can now blame linkffn(Grow Young with Me) for ruining my sleep cycle because I just stayed up all night to read all 26 chapters. And after finishing, I can easily say that it is my favorite story.

I don't have a favorite song, movie, or food. I like some things better than other things, but I don't often label something as 'my favorite' because what I like is kinda volatile. The Harry Potter series was the first to break that cycle and this fic has done the same thing.

Holy shit was this story heartbreaking. I don't cry over sad stories, but damn was this the closest I've gotten. You could experience the emotions peeling off the pages. The characters are well written and feel extremely real. The developing relationships aren't forced and flow naturally. My favorite thing is how the kids are characterized. The kids are innocent, endearing, emotional, stubborn, irrational, and loving... w/hich is exactly how most kids are./ I love how the author didn't make the kids unrealistically mature or something like that because would've made the story very bland and artificial. God damn was it a wild ride.

I'm kinda depressed now because the author said it would come out sometime before October 31st. The infrequent updates are unfortunate, but the fic really does embody the adage ‘quality over quantity'.

Thanks for such a great story, can't wait till the next chapter! /^{If someone has a great fic recommendation for me, please let me know!}/


** This is so kind of you, thank you! I gave that October 31st date kind of arbitrarily, but I'm really trying to get the next chapter done before that. I'm forever grateful for everyone's patience, though. I know the long wait between updates sucks :/

Edit: Thank you to the users who gave me the gold and silver! You guys are awesome :)

If you simplify it like that, it sounds cliched but the characters are a little more complex than the bubbly girl and the sad guy. You get to learn that in the later chapters. But these stories are not for everyone, I agree.

Ahh to bad pureblood pretense is not for you. It has amazing combat, a well thought out political Voldemort, is wonderfully AU and is based on another story adapted to the potter world. But to be fair, the people around the protagonist sometimes suffer from selective stupidity. And even though it features magical cores, it does so in a , for me, refreshing way with important limitations and obstacles to overcome. Damn I think I'm gonna reread it.

And

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12952598/1/What-We-Lost][What We Lost by JacobApples]] (pretty much anything from this author is good)

*Summary:* If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Harry's fourth year has not been going according to plan, and Harry blames a lot of it on the Slytherins in his year. While venting one day, Daphne Greengrass sticks up for the other Slytherins in their year. This makes Harry think a lot about her and what she meant, as he wonders if he can trust her. One-shot. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass. Rating for brief language and fluff.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

*** Well, it's a similar time period and has somewhat similar "slice of life" content. The actual plots are very different.

I did enjoy Strangers at Drakeshaugh, but fair warning, it's part of a much bigger unified world written by Northumbrian, and not all of that world is complete.
