So I was thinking about the Killing Curse. Does it only work on humans?

I feel like it must, otherwise, why the heck wouldn't it be the go-to form of pest control? Basilisk? AK. 1st task dragons? AK. Giants in DH? AK.

Can anyone provide a logical fanon explanation why this would be so? Don't bother with canon, even if JKR referenced it her adaptations are always garbage. Much rather hear what you all believe.

Thanks!


** The Killing Curse isn't simply a flash of green light. It's a tear in thaumaturgic reality, an untautology. The Killing Curse merely opens the door, the nature of what lies beyond converts whatever it touches to "isn't".

Merely being in the vicinity of a Killing Curse causes intense disorientation and nausea. These effects can be lessened by ritual exposure to similar breaches. These rituals are almost required, since the caster is right next to the breach as it opens.

The downsides to your allies means using the Killing Curse in battle situations is a bad idea. Any enemies farther from the breach or more resistant to the the radial effects will take advantage of the brief distraction.

This also adds another element to the "everyone turns on Harry all the time" deal. He clearly must be unnatural, how else could he directly endure THAT?

** Off the top of my head:

1. It requires a powerful enough wizard to cast it (Fake!Moody claims that no one in his 4th year DADA class could have successfully used it on him).
2. It requires a strong emotion on the part of the caster - hate, perhaps, or else absolute conviction that the target needs to die.
3. Being an extremely Dark curse, it may have consequences for the user - whether magical or purely psychological. Even if its use is absolutely justified, the very fact that you use your magic and your emotions this way might influence your psyche in a negative way.
4. There's probably enormous stigma associated with its use, especially after the War (Voldemort probably used it liberally; Barty Crouch Sr. is disliked by many because he authorized the Aurors to use it if necessary). Once again, maybe you won't get immediately shipped off to Azkaban after using it on an agressive magical beast, but being revealed as someone both capable and willing to use the Killing Curse will lead to many people assuming that you're are a Dark wizard (perphaps somewhat justifiedly so).
5. Magic in general might not be as effective against the more powerful magical beasts. Maybe AK is an one-shot spell against a human being, but not against, say, a dragon. At the very least, physical barriers do work against it.

** This is very clearly not the case.

Imposter Moody killed a spider, Bellatrix killed a fox, Voldemort "killed" Fawkes, and a Death Eater killed Hedwig with it.

As for why it's not the go-to form of pest control,

  "Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.

  “Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson --- ”
#+end_quote

Most people probably can't cast the Killing Curse, especially against some random beast that they don't have particularly strong feelings about. And anyone who could probably wouldn't want to publicize that fact, since it's essentially an admitting that you're an evil bastard.

*** Well it doesn't necessarily mean you're evil. It could just mean that there's someone you hate enough to want them dead.

**** Yes, but hating everyone and everything that you happen to come across enough to cast the Killing Curse at them does mean that you're probably evil.

So to use OP's example, a reasonable person might be able to cast the Killing Curse at a giant if that giant had killed their family or something, but they wouldn't be able to kill every giant with it unless they were, at best, incredibly racist against giants.

*** I mean... take the Giants example I gave in DH. Desperate moment for the 'good' guys, extreme danger... i would think Slughorn or Shacklebolt could pull off casting it, and not using a one-shot kill-all during a battle at a /school/ actually makes them more evil than if they had used it (in my opinion).

**** They almost certainly couldn't.

Just like how righteous anger can't power a Crucio, desperately fighting for what is right probably can't power a Killing Curse.

****** Ywah I feel it's not strategic hate but personal. Death eaters readily personally hate muggleborns. You may be scared of a giant, fear them, but do in your heart do you hate them? Like, can you pull off pure loathing? Also if the killing curse is draining which seems it is, I bet you wanna conserve your magic. Giants are scary but also probably accidently hurt death eaters as much as good guys. But the death eaters can cast fiendfyre and the killing curse so i can see peiotizing energy towards them.

** Well the killing curse definitely work on every living being as canon shows us - at least on spiders, foxes, owls and goblins. I think that the reason is not used more often is because first of all it's a dark curse and association with it could bring about some bad reputation. Also I think it's a very difficult curse (what it entails is never specified but I assume that it involves a complete disregard for someone else's life)... we can see that it's not even the go to curse of most death eaters... only Voldemort uses it liberally. Finally taking someone's life is a violation of the laws of nature and it can lead to your soul splitting. While Voldemort, who thinks of himself as immortal and has a mutilated soul anyways, can use it to his heart content, not everyone is comfortable spending their eternity with a broken soul.
