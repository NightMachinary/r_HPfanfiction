JKR originally intended Dean to be a more significant character, and I find his backstory really interesting. For any who might not know, he is raised with his Muggle mother, stepfather and half-sisters, but his father was actually a wizard. His father was approached by Voldemort during the First War, and he abandoned Dean and his mother to protect them (and was then killed). Neither Dean or his mother know this. I think Dean is one of the more interesting minor characters, and I like the glimpses of his personality we see.

I would enjoy anything about him that is good, but especially something set during DH or, even better, longfic about his backstory that got cut from the books.

I will say that I really like the idea of Dean/Luna (shared trauma, spent time together at Shell Cottage, both artists, etc.) and I'm not a fan of the idea of Dean/Seamus. This is mostly just because I think Seamus is a total dick. But I know fic about Dean is very rare, so I'm not going to be picky. Any ship is fine, as long as the fic is good. Gen would also be great.

Thanks if anybody knows any fic like this! I will not be surprised if what I want doesn't really exist, but I have my fingers crossed.


** Have you read "What Lies Beneath"? Dean isn't the main character, so I'm not sure if it will be of interest to you. But the whole thing with his father is important here.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

*** Thanks, I'll check it out! It does look interesting, especially if Dean is a significant character.

** linkffn(the Perils of Innocence) features Dean as a prominent character, together with Harry and Hermione, his best friends, and his heritage plays a role, but it starts pre-Hogwarts and is currently in their first year.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** I have two, both post-war though. The second one does explore his back story (if I'm remembering right.) I don't have any Dean/Luna, but I have some gen stuff.

[[http://springtime-gen.livejournal.com/79621.html][Living Art]]: Dean's art is not a casualty of war.

[[http://cjmarlowe.livejournal.com/381675.html][When The Window Again Opens]]: Friendship, takeaway and the painting of demons.

** I like Luna/Dean, and it's /almost/ hinted at in canon. My head canon is that they gave it a try after the war and it didn't really work out, but that they remained lifelong friends.

FF.net has a few options if you search by character, this one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5262925/1/Vita-Perseverat][Dean/Luna]] though rather sad.
