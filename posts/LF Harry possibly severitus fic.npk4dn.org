:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so i don't remember a ton of it mostly just one scene. But Harry i believe is staying at Hogwarts over break. And he is staying with Snape. He making a draught of peace and he adds some ingredient that makes you laugh/ lose inhibitions. And he puts it in a bubble container. I don't have much else. There might be some snupin in it. Ugh im dying


** linkao3(Blood Magic by GatewayGirl) has a scene with Harry experimenting with a calming potion and producing bubbles that have that effect. Not an exact match, but it is a severitus fic with Harry at Hogwarts with Snape during the summer.

#+begin_quote
  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
