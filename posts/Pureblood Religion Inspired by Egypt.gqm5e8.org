Dunno if anyone's done this yet, but I've long thought that pureblood beliefs of the afterlife should be somewhat inspired by ancient Egypt, particularly the part about how bad things happen in the afterlife to those whose name is completely forgotten.

This would, IMO, actually contribute to the ostracization of muggleborns in an interesting way, as the purebloods would work to remember their lineage to stave off such horror from happening to their ancestors, but the vast majority of muggleborns won't know more than a few generations back at most, and likely few if any names of the deceased, making said muggleborns kinda disgusting or cruel in the eyes of the purebloods as they wouldn't likely stop to realize that most muggles don't hold such beliefs.

If anyone knows any fanfics where such an idea is presented, please post. Otherwise, please treat this as a prompt and please post if you actually write something with this concept.

EDIT: Note that full ancestor-worship is another idea I've been toying with for the purebloods that would have a similar flavor, just perhaps a bit stronger.


** So this is intriguing, because while we know there was a Taboo on Voldemort's name/titles during the First Wizarding War, refusing to name him (even by his title) for decades after is a liiiiiiiiiiittle extreme... unless what you're seeing is an entire nation consciously choosing to condemn their dark lords to obscurity within a few generations. Binns also makes a helluva lot more sense.

** I really like this idea! I have often struggled trying to include some type of religion into HP. Especially with the Darker families some people say their christian, but I disagree.

Malfoy does say "God this place is going to the dogs," whether that's a common vernacular choice of phrase or whether that's a clue as to their religion is up for debate, I personally pick the former.

It just seems strange to me that this group of people who very proudly and meticulously keep their family trees for generations upon generations would forgo the traditions of their ancestors that they obviously cherish. That's also the reason I don't do the godparent thing because that's more of a Christian tradition and I don't see them as Christian.

** Very interesting idea. I always thought Wizards were folk christians though.

*** Perhaps (especially if you go back far enough), but I'm among the crowd that thinks they'd be at best less than zealous (if they ever were christian in the first place) because of the witch burnings.

**** Well folk christianity in the medieval europe did took very unchristian forms and gave rise to some new religions such as Cathars and Bogomils. Furthermore most of the real life witchhunts were done against christian sects that were deemed heretical.
