I honestly don't get why Ron was portrayed as a bumbling idiot a lot of times. Sure, he was thoughtless in most cases with the most noteable examples in the 4th, 6th, and 7th book (from what I remember). However, compared to both Harry and Hermione, Ron grew up as a wizard. Hermione might be book smart, but Ron would generally knows about social queues in the Wizarding World. He is also a strategist which is most shown when he plays chess and loyal by default when he gets pass his jealous tendencies. We know that he could be smarter if he was not overshadowed by his siblings or heck, even Hermione.

Considering the movies already put him through the grinder along with a lot fanfiction, I would like to find something that would at least reflect those characteristics. Not just bash him to become a one-dimensional, jealous, idiot with nothing to live up to. I'm relatively okay with most fanfics, but I don't really want anything focusing on romances.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/12/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][You might like Ron's Introduction in this chapter of a one-shots collection.]]

It's only very short, but it's my favourite explanation ever for why Ron claimed 'everywhere else was full' when coming to sit with Harry.

*** There was a lot of drabbles, but I found the one shot you meant. That's really was a prefect explanation as to why Ron sat with Harry. I really enjoy that insight into Ron's mind at that point.

The only slight nick pick I had was the fact Ron first met Harry at the 9 and 3/4 entrance so he would've notice Harry's attire at that point. I think the one shot could still go in the exact same direction but also include that Ron was more comfortable sitting with Harry base on Ron's thought process.

Overall, a wonderful read through.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
