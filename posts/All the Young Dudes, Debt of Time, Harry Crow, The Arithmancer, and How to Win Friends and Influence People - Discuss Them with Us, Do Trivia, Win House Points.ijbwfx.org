We were overwhelmed with the response to a previous post about the HP Fanfiction Club Discord. We have added some cool new features and we would love to have you guys join us. Some of the fics we have coming up for September are:

- Harry Crow.
- Debt of Time.
- The Arithmancer
- How to Win Friends and Influence People
- Roundabout Destiny
- All the Young Dudes
- and more!

We have also put in a House Cup, common rooms, and we have other features as well. Please come join us, get to know us, and chat with us about some really good fics! We're a small community, so no overwhelming 10-step entrance system with bots and no 500-page rulebook. We're inclusive and respectful, and all we ask is that you return the favour. :)

Join us here, and ask any and all questions you may have! [[https://discord.gg/JnY7RGN]]
