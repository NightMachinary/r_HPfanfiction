*** If we assume Harry lives to 150, at 40-years-old he's just 26% through his natural life span.

The equivalent for a Muggle with a life expectancy of 80 years would be age 21.

His year of death would be 2130. The change wizards must see the world go through... all on its own, that's a gift no amount of Muggle money/power can buy. Never mind the spells.

**** I actually never saw Harry living that long. Maybe Hermione, but not really Harry.

I know the whole wizards live longer, however, by what we know it doesn't feel like it is the norm. It is more like "wizards CAN live longer" not like "all wizards DO live longer". We have a bunch of people dying in canon in 30s, and 40s... And yes, you can argue about the war, but there are plenty of people who died not because of the war...

Harry's grandparents caught a bug and didn't seem to be 100 yet. Arthur's brother(s), and parents seem to be all dead (Arthur is the head of the house after all). Neville's grandfather is dead as well. The Black family tree has a bunch of people dying young of non-war related deaths.

IMO, mortality in the wizarding community is just way higher than on muggle communities. The capability of living longer is a countermeasure for that. It also explains why there is no overpopulation of wizards.

***** JKR in 2000:

#+begin_quote
  Question: How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  J.K. Rowling responds: Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm]]

Obviously she changed her mind later about Dumbledore and McGonagall's specific ages to fit various plot ideas she had (in McGonagall's case, several times). Nonetheless, I think it's fairly clear that she has always considered wizards to have a substantially longer life expectancy than Muggles - see also Marchbanks, Dippet, etc.

And I never even got the impression that Dumbledore was really /that/ old. He's still in full time work. He's not frail at all and can move very quickly when he wants to. The witch who examined him when he was 18 years old is still alive and also still in work, albeit she is much more frail than he is.

I think Marchbanks is the best book evidence (and therefore highest canon) we have of what a natural wizarding life-span would be - she's probably at least 30 years older than Dumbledore, but also going frail. Probably by the time she dies she'd be around 170-180. Even if you say that she's particularly well preserved and knock off, say, 30 years to reach the average life span, that still brings you to 140-150.

For the other bits you reference:

- Black family tree. The Doylist explanation is obviously that JKR is bad with numbers at the best of times, and quickly scribbling out a family tree for a charity to sell is not the best of times. The Watsonian explanation is the Black family is fucked up and probably not afraid of murdering their own family members. Definitely an outlier, not the norm.

- Harry's grandparents - JKR said they were already old in wizarding terms when they had James, which just begs the question of what old in wizarding terms means. Personally I have always read that as over 100 years old (incidentally this is also the reason why Charlus and Dorea were never viable options to be James' parents).

- Arthur - don't think we know anything about his side of the family.

- Neville - again, not sure we know anything here. Both Neville and Arthur seem like very fragile hooks to hang an argument from.

I find more plausible to see a 200 wizard than a 100 old pregnant witch. Besides, you are forgetting Henry Potter was still around by the 1920s. It seems more fitting that Euphemia Potter had James at something over 50... That is an old age to have children

We do know Arthur is the head of the family so he is father is more than certainly dead.

We also know Neville's grandfather is dead.

He is the head of the Weasley family. Not like in weird non-canon Lord kind of way, but as in the eldest member, point-of-reference, decision-making sort of role. He is mentioned as such in the books, though don't remember exactly where.

Also, Ron got his grandfather chess set, another hint at Septimus Weasley might be dead thing.

There is no mention or appearance of any other Weasley family member during Christmas holidays.

Those wizard's are a violent bunch, plus they have a lot of other 'fun' stuff to croak from.

Also IIRC i've read somewhere that harry's grandparents died from dragonpox, so it might be that there was a pandemic going on somewhere during Voldemort's 1st reign of terror.

******** The way I see Harry's grandparents is by what's going on now with covid. People who are 60 plus have a higher chance of dying because of it, but you wouldn't consider 60 old. That's actually reasonably young isn't it? If they were 70+ when they had james (which is pretty old even by wizarding standards) then they would have been late 80s early 90s when they got the dragonpox. That is pretty old for a disease like that... they wouldn't have had the strength to fight it. Add on to that the stress is a war going on (stress messes up the immune system) its really not surprising that couldn't make it.

******** Still, that just adds up on my theory of higher mortality.... There are a bunch of deaths that we are certain that are not related to wizarding wards, but to diseases or magical related accidents. Surely plenty of those we don't know about are not related to wars either.

We know Neville's grandfather died at some point, after the war, we know Neville witnessed it.

Uncle Bilius died after Ron was born, after the war.

Mrs. Crouch died of illness as well.

Luna's mother

Walburga Black died after the war as well.

Professor Binns didn't die in war either.

Voldemort's mother.

Armando Dippet.

Astoria Greengrass

Kendra Dumbledore

Hagrid's father

********* Yeah, wizard's are more prone to violent and accidental death, but have the potential to live longer. It might be also, as some deaths suggest, that they can effectively suicide themselves via depression through negative magical self-influence.

Neville's grandfather - could have been pretty old, there is nothing stopping someone who's ~60-70 to have children, he could've died at some point over 100-110?

Idk about Bilius, might've been brother of Muriel and not arthur though.

Mrs. Crouch - effectively my first point.

Luna's mother supposedly died in an accident.

Walburga - no idea, might be point 1 due to loss of children.

Binns died a very long time ago, god knows how old was he. For all we know he's teaching since the founding of Hogwarts.

Voldemort's mother - point 1 and she was basically a squib who gave birth in some dingy orphanage in the 1920s - so she had no access to magical healing thus she died.

Dippet lived to, what, 400?

Astoria dying isn't canon idk what you're talking about /j. IIRC she was cursed or something and that's why.

Kendra Dumbledore - no clue.

Hagrid's father - no clue, though he could've been pretty old for all we know. Hagrid refered of him as 'small' and while that can be an inherent characteristic old people do kinda shrink.

​

Well, overall, i think it's that while wizards potentially CAN live to a very old age, they often don't - for a number of reasons, and violent death needn't be one of those. Just a minor bloodclot or anyuerysm can take someone out if they are alone and noone's nearby to help, magic or no magic, and those can happen to people of all ages. Or a number of other 'fun' ilnessess.

Ariana accidentally killed Kendra. The Blacks seemed to die young (by wizarding standards) which I chalked up to inbreeding. It's pretty much established that Merope had no wish to live and JKR has Binns as old when be died.

My headcanon for Mrs. Crouch was that she died of a "broken heart." Her husband's career, her son's choices, and their relationship just took its toll.

That was my whole point. THey can live longer, but they don't usually do. The number of non-students we have met are overwhelmingly NON 100 year old.

So I stand by my point. IMO, I do see Hermione exceeding 100, but I always pictured Harry as a death 90s.

********* I'm not what your point is it's that list of names: Armando Dippet died at over 300 years old, I have absolutely no idea why you even brought him up; Pandora Lovegood died by a freak accident when something went wrong while she was making a spell, that not a natural death; we don't know any information about when Binns died and how old he was; Merope Gaunt was a dirt poor near Squib coming from an abusive household whose mother might have been some kind of aunt or cousin and is even more genetically messed up than the Blacks, Carrows or Crabbes. Astoria Greengrass (going by Cursed Child) had a blood curse, something she wouldn't have if whatever ancestor was cursed hadn't been, meaning she would have lived passed her ‘canon' death; Mr Hagrid Sr died in the midst of Grindelwald's War; has Taure pointed out, the Blacks are an exception, not the rule; finally, we don't know what circumstances surround Mr Longbottom's death. Of course, people can die more or less young if they catch a disease and aren't cured, look at any mortal disease, and scientist from every era died while experimenting, something represented by Pandora Lovegood. I don't know why you bring up the deaths of people who clearly weren't natural or early and perhaps the oldest wizard who didn't have a Philosopher's Stone.

Basing ourselves on people we see like the Weasleys, Longbottoms and Potters who are actually sane and not some batshit craze zealot gang, we know that this (the Black family's family tree) is an outlier attitude that you would find in rare families like the Gaunts and the Crabbes and other such fanatic families. When you think about it, the only difference between the Blacks and the Gaunts is that the former family is rich so it doesn't have to commit incest as often as the latter because they're still part of ‘polite' society.

To me it does feel like there is an extra degree of inbreeding to Gaunts than to Blacks. They are clearly physically affected. And they seem to be marrying almost exclusively among them. As some sort of Targaryens...

I guess Blacks only tried to marry purblood families, and kept that tradition among Blacks. Yet they married Potters, Macmillans, Prewetts, Longbottoms... who, even if pureblood, most certainly had some halfblood ancestry at some point.

Maybe that's why pureblood families hate squibs so much? Without magic, these kids would be /insanely/ more obviously inbred, while coming from seemingly healthy parents.

No wonder they think that without magic you're some sort of dimwitted beast, if all the kids without magic are Habsburg children x10 it would color your preconceptions.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.
