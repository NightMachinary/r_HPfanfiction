Now, I know canonical Dragons in the /Harry Potter/ universe are scarcely more intelligent than a particularly quick-witted crocodile. Nevertheless, I'm a big fan of Tolkien-style talking, sentient Dragons, and I know there are others in the /HP/ fandom who agree with me on this point. linkffn(The Fight For Rights) manages to work out a way to port such Smaugesque Dragons into the /HP/ universe mostly painlessly, and I know of a few other fics which drop reference to the majestic Great Wyrms of all of which Norberta's kind are but a degenerate shadow.

Well, do you lot know of any stories where such Dragons are front-and-center?


** Well, I've just been bitten by a story bug that gave me an idea for a D&D-style talking, shape-shifting, spell-casting, plot-derailing sentient Dragon (specifically a Silver Dragon) taking baby Harry from either the wreckage of the Potter's Cottage, or the doorstep of #4 Privet Drive, and raising the child because he can.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** Linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders)

When Dudley discocers that he's a wizard but Vernon has his magic bound, they run away to the only contact in the magical world that Petunia knows well: Severus Snape.

A few years later they ride a bunch of dragons, including Voldemort Jr. in his Animagus form to Azkaban to rescue Lucius Malfoy and Severus from the Dementors.

** Saphroneth hit the climax of Ashes of the Past recently, and he's started on a new story: linkffn(13230340)

The only sentient talking dragon in it is Harry himself, though. And it has yet to significantly deviate from the plot of canon, I think.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change.

** I remember one fic in which Harry has an accident in Stonehedge as a child and ends up as a dragon that literally eats our Dursleys from their house. It was funny.

Edit: found it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/]]

Also - there was one in which Harry had a dragon animagus form, he somehow ended up being a dragon in a dragon reserve in Romania where... dragon politics happened, he had a ship sailing with an actual dragon-girl. I remember him also getting the the Hgwards letter there and pretty much being - wtf? i can't be human! And the other dragons saw it as on opportunity to regain (!) control of the magic world.Maybe someone knows which fic it is? I kinda actually feel like re-reading it.
