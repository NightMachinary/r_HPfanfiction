Hello! We're bringing the Book Club back, hopefully to stay if there is enough engagement. As per some feedback, there will only be completed fics, and they will most likely be less popular, in an effort for more people to read and engage. [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtBhOHJwuY8VeDpnMHzTGhYLeJKbyVhORXXo98359wwn1lnw/viewform][Recommend fics here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Psantium_&subject=/r/HPfanfiction%20Book%20Club][PM me]] if you have any suggestions.

--------------

This month's fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/][*Resurrexit*]] by /Master Slytherin/.

The next fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/][*Too Young to Die*]] by /thebombhasbeenplanted/.

Let me know what you think about *Resurrexit* down below.


** This isn't the first time that I've read this, but I skimmed things again to refresh my memory.

The style of the story reminds me a bit of old hard-boiled fiction. Something about the first-person style and the inner monologue in Harry's parts especially. The other viewpoints don't really have the same feel, but they do sound like the POV characters. That can be difficult to pull off for some people when using multiple POVs in a story.

The tone and direction of the story are satisfying to me, and I found the characters to be generally in-character.

A slight problem that I had with the story is that, at just under 75k words, it feels a little light, and that ties into my biggest problem -- the villain. *Huge spoilers*, but it [[/spoiler][was a bit unsatisfying to have an OC fill the role, partly because I wasn't very invested in him as a character. Maybe if there had been a little more to the story, it might have established him better and gave the reveal more impact.]]

*tl;dr* - Like the style, had solid writing, but the antagonist and the length of the story were issues for me.

** One of those deliciously dark fics that have an uncommon style and some surprisingly adult characterization. Not quite "darkest timeline" but still a little depressing. A good read and technically excellent but I wouldn't want to read this often.

** Alright. Finished reading. SPOILERS IN THE REVIEW.

At 75k the story is rather short as novel length fanfiction goes. The word count fits into the genre, but I feel like some things just don't click here and I can't decide if it's because they should have been cut or expanded.

To reiterate my previous point, the weird switching between perspectives put me off. To get the technical out of the way, the prose was polished as far as lack of typos and grammatical soundness, but nothing about it made me sit up and take notice. I'd go sk far as to say it's downright bland at times, with the author going for the straightforward spelling things out when a metaphor might have been better. Direct isn't always better.

I'm not going to harp on characterizations because this obviously takes liberties. Harry as a serial killer corrupted by love? I can buy it.

What then has to hold everything together is the plot, which I've found to be weirdly disjointed. I'm told there's thus sequence of events, but they don't gel together nicely, the story beats are like parts that the instruction says are supposed to fit together, but the installation job was shoddy.

Sayer was a wholly uncompelling character and it's not about him being an OC. I just feel like he wasn't given enough depth for his role and the final reveal was kinda lame.

Then the whole thing with Harry's killing spree. Why did he kill Mundungus exactly? Because Mundungus knew about a witness to some event that is not explained and left me confused. And I didn't buy the angst over Luna, attempted necromancy and the detour to Africa that lacked any kind of depth. Relevant exposition was thrown out in the moment it was needed, nothing was set up. The whole story read like the author decided on facts as he wrote. I'm not bashing on discovery writing, but this just has no coherence. The attempted misdirection with Bogand was weak and Neville's jumping to a lucky conclusion about Harry being the killer had no foundation. Ron's involvement was boring.

Maybe it's because of the genre, but the characterizations of all characters were taken in the bleak melodramatic noir direction which made them blur with each other. Everyone is fucked up and it's all coming out like goo through cracks. Big moments had no punch and the avalanche in the finale came rapidly, without letting one thing sink in before the author dropped the next "bomb".

I'm certain a lot of my dislike is coming from my apathy towards the genre, but for Master Slytherin's reputation I expected something less... formless. And the epilogue was completely unnecessary, or at least the second part of it. I'd have disliked it less if it had just been the funeral. That was enough to imply everything the author then spelled out for me at the very end.

**** wellll i did say it was unquantifiable.

but basically even when you write an au, if you're really good, the characters (and their interactions together!) will remind readers of their canon counterparts while also being more interesting (most of the canon characters were dull and pretty undeveloped). and it's more than the characters, it's the setting, it's how the ministry or hogwarts is described and included in scenes -- this is fucked up by basically everyone. it's what separates actual fanfiction from just 100k words with vaguely familiar names.

i didn't quite finish this story, but i read enough to tell it didn't have that.

note: extraordinarily good writing can bypass all of this.

note2: see stages of hope for an example of internal consistency (characters, interactions, settings) combined with extreme au.

***** Fair enough, though I think I see what you mean. Definitely the darker and more adult feel might not jive with everyone's interpretation of canon characterization. Maybe I'm just of the mindset that this is almost extraordinarily good writing, and I get that it's totally a matter of opinion.

I think we may be on opposite sides when comparing to Stages of Hope, and maybe how you feel about Resurrexit is analogous to what I think of Stages. It's a little too off for me with the battle hardened 4, and while it's a decent fic it doesn't seem like especially amazing writing to me.

Loving this discussion though!

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** I'm a quarter of the way through and at 75k I'd expect some of that much talked about brilliance to have dawned on me by now.

Switching between present tense first person and past tense third limited isn't endearing the fic to me. Might be an interesting experiment, but with every new chapter I have this whoop crash into a wall where I have to switch gears to make sense of what I'm reading.

Writing style is definitely peak of fanfiction, but it's not blowing me away or anything. It's competently dry.

Lastly, it smells awfully like grim tough noir detective fiction, which is a genre that bores me to tears. I'll probably finish the fic because it's relatively short, but I'm fully expecting a dinner scene at some point, with detailed descriptions of pan seared salmon with a side of cauliflower puree and freshly sliced tomatoes or some such shit.

Edit: title is fucking cool though.

** I made it through the first 7 chapters before dropping.

Admittedly, I should have just stopped reading after the first 2 chapters as I could already tell that I didn't like it. But, the prospect of participating in a book club was just so enticing. Alas. And, next month's fic looks even worse...

Anyway.

Reasons I didn't finish:

- Call me churlish and unreasonable, if you will. But, I must say that the, presumably, youthful writer makes an irritating habit of abusing, defenseless, commas, seemingly, assigning descriptive terms to the wrong nouns to get across the, actual, point, and, stubbornly, refusing to admit that adding more adjectives does not, actually, create a "mood".

- The constant switching of perspectives was disruptive rather than fluid, breaking up the flow of the story without any payoff for that discontinuity.

- Characters didn't come off as being probable versions of their canon counterparts except that they've all gone through the book events, even if EWE. In conjunction, their post-Hogwarts life choices were a little baffling at times. This is taking into account the likelihood of their having gone through some horrifyingly traumatic event where everyone they loved died, they vowed to never love again, and an invasion of Dementors consumed their souls followed by their incognizant bodies being Imperio'd into a caricature of their former selves by a Jim Butcher fan. As previously mentioned, I didn't finish this story. But, the above scenario was the only thing that really made sense, when I tried to figure out how it might have ended. Needless to say, I found the fic's characters and their conflicts uninteresting.

- Leading off the characters-might-as-well-have-been-a-cast-of-OCs point, all fanfiction writers bank on their readers knowing the characters to the extent that building emotional investment is largely unnecessary. But, when you change the mood, characters' personalities, and skew their life choices without opting for a true AU, parody/satire, or even just a single point of divergence...well. There just wasn't enough personal attachment for me to care about anything they were going through nor could I bring myself to be bothered by the crime remaining unsolved.

- The premise wasn't terrible, but it's not something I'm going to choose to read on my own. Funnily enough, this point was the real deal breaker. I'll cut way too much slack to a fic that has an idea behind it that interests me or follows a token set-up like time travel which is one of my guilty pleasures. If it's a premise that doesn't interest me, then it takes something special in the plot, characterization, or world-building to keep me reading. An example of the latter in line with this story's genre of crime/mystery: linkffn(3435122).
