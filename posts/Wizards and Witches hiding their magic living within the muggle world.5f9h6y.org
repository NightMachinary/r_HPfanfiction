I often come up with ideas for HP fan fics (but rarely write them because i flame out fast), and recently while playing with some concepts in my head I realized that I had never come across any discussion or fan fiction or general information on this idea.

For information, I thought about the following things while playing with ideas for a fan fiction plot that had Harry Potter being presumed dead, being raised in the muggle world, discovering wandless magic at a young age but keeping it completely a secret, and as he grew up, using it to advance in the muggle world. The idea had him completely separated and unaware of his past, or the magical world. Simply using his natural tools that he has self studied on to work within the muggle system.

And so here are the things I ponder....

The idea that a Wizard or Witch could conceivably know and practice magic, but stay within the muggle world, completely separated (or mostly) from the magical one.

Consider a witch/wizard who is married, but while using magic to make life easier, hides who she/he is from their spouse. Perhaps they are a house wife/husband, and using magic to clean and cook and manage the house, giving them massive amounts of free time.. all the while pretending to have done everything the muggle way in front of their spouse. Or perhaps they work, utilizing magic at times in their job to make life and the job easier, but to their coworkers and bosses they are just an amazing employee. Consider a wizard or witch who is in the military, and fights in the muggle way, but surreptitiously uses magic to keep themselves and their friends alive, and kill the enemy. Or perhaps using it to spy and discover information, all the while pretending they have sources.

There are so many possible scenarios but the key being that they live, work, play, act, and the like... WITHIN the muggle world, hiding their magic and yet utilizing it to make life easier, or get ahead, or advance, or become wealthy, or whatever it may be. They could do it in a way that is fairly innocuous, or they could utilize things like legilimancy, and spells like obliviate to get ahead.

The question becomes, would any witch or wizard choose this path? Would it be possible for them to do such things under the radar without anyone the wiser? Would they escape the notice of the magical world or would the magical world be fully aware of what they are doing?

Of course, there are some even more basic initial questions such as where were they trained to use their magic, or were they ever trained at all? Can they obtain a wand without exposure? Would their name be recorded as a magical child somewhere?

I would like to hear thoughts and discussions and perhaps fan fiction recommendations if there are any out there with similar concepts or ideas.


** I would say such a fic would have to address two issues:

Firstly, to what extent the wizard's actions would be illegal. We know that there are Muggle protection laws on the books, in addition to laws implementing the Statute of Secrecy. For example we know it's illegal to enchant Muggle objects - Arthur's department at the Ministry is devoted to tracking down people who do so. We also know that there are laws against using magic on Muggles for fun - Morfin Gaunt got in trouble for it. I think the Ministry would not look very kindly upon a wizard living in the Muggle world and using their magic to amass wealth and power among Muggles. It fundamentally goes against the separation of worlds created by the Statute of Secrecy.

Secondly, what motivation the wizard would have for doing so. What is it that the Muggle world offers specifically that the character wants? There doesn't seem to be any reason for a wizard to live in the Muggle world - there's nothing that Muggles have that wizards want or need. One angle could be if the wizard was actually not very good at magic and so preferred to be a big fish in a Muggle pond rather than be a small fish in the wizarding world.

Presumably specific muggle individuals. For Muggleborns especially, their non-magic family members and friends, perhaps romantic partners as well. Living in close proximity to the people they care about could be a huge motivator for residing in the muggle world.

** I think the Ministry and Gringotts did place protections on important Muggle institutions and locations. For example, you shouldn't expect to rob a bank and get away with it. You probably also shouldn't expect to break into Buckingham Place and get away with it.

Confunding a DL test instructor is fine, but doing the same to the CEO of BP would most likely NOT work.

Similarly, we don't know how much collusion there was between the Ministry and other important Muggle offices, such as the SIS. Maybe there was always some kind of exchange going on that even the Prime Minister or the Minister of Magic didn't know about. The enforcement of SoS would be a lot easier if certain Muggles in important positions were willing to participate. Their cooperations could be ensured by both briberies and threats.

So, a better question would be to ask what would happen if the Ministry itself decided to take advantages of Muggle world to fatten their own wallets?

In /Para Bellum/, the sequel to /Delenda Est/, linkffn(9754483), it's quite obvious that Bellatrix's Ministry was looking the other way when her own and her allies' companies were engaged in this kind of activities.

Even in the canon world, Kingsley's and Hermione's Ministry might be forced to take advantages of Muggles out of pure necessity. It could be argued that to push through their reforms and please the Wizarding masses at same time, they needed money, money, and money. One easy way was to flaunt their powers and rip Muggles off. Hermione already mind raped her parents once for their 'protection', so why not continue that practice on Muggle strangers for her 'greater good'?

*** As you said, without knowing how much collusion or partnership there actually was/is between those in power on each side of the muggle/magic divide, its tough to know for sure how policed the muggle world may be in terms of looking for magical interaction. I would of course agree that at a certain point, using magic to break a law or get ahead would likely cause discovery of the witch or wizard, but then if they kept things small and simple, without any big splashes, its also likely they would never get caught. Unless of course, there is a much more organized and complicated detection system in place for such things.

**** I think the allure for the Ministry to take advantage of Muggles by itself would be too great. Especially for Muggle experts like Kingsley, he would identify many loopholes in which his Ministry could make huge profits without endangering the SoS. In fact, magical world offered many useful items which the Muggle governments would gladly KILL FOR. Veritaserum would be one of them, especially after 9/11.

The British government would strongly benefit from a collaboration with the British Ministry of Magic, even more so if other Muggle governments were secretly colluding with their Magicals. For example, if it turned out that China's Communists had been working closely with their Magicals since the 1980s (thus explaining its sudden resurgence), there would be NO WAY the British, the Germans, the Americans, the Russians, and many others wanted to be left out.

The Ministries of course would demand their Muggle counterparts to enforce the SoS together, which meant that SoS violators would not only face their own Ministries, but also their own national governments, most likely in forms of CIA, FBI, FSB, SIS, GCHQ, BND, and etc.

Now that Muggle governments' support had been secured, why not making big money together with selected Muggles? Magically enhanced products, magically transported equipment, magically extracted sensitive information, I mean the possibilities were quite limitless. Those Muggles working together with Magicals would gain huge competitive advantages over those who didn't.

I've so far only considered some political and economical aspects of a more engaging magical government in the Muggle world. However, I believe the biggest breakthrough or gain was to be made in a close collaboration between scientific community and departments of mysteries. Magic might offer some real shortcuts in space exploration and colonization, but I will leave that discussion for another time.

** I could see a number of plausible reasons why this might happen. Family ties can be very strong; I could see a Muggle-born witch or wizard choosing to return to their family, especially if they had a Muggle partner.

I could also see someone wishing to remain out of sight for some reason choosing to take on a new identity in the Muggle world.

I think it's a very valid idea to explore.

Why put up with that bigotry when any fairly competent magical could make tons of money without endangering the Statute of Secrecy? An auto body shop/ antique shop/ marine repair/ remodeling and construction.. Find a run down building or abandoned warehouse, ward it (or charm it.. effectively the same), make it unplottable, fix it up and live rent free.

A population living inside the statute of secrecy but outside of the Ministry makes a fun third force that isn't the damn goblins being won over due to being treated well by Lord Baron Potter Black.

Probably because that's fanon nonsense, unless said Muggleborn has the bad luck to be around during Voldemort's reign.

The wizarding world is no more or less advanced, in terms of social norms, than the Muggle world. That's the entire point: the prejudices of the magical world are allegorical for Muggle prejudices. Blood-based prejudice is about as common as racism is in the Muggle world: that is to say, publicly disapproved of, politically incorrect, but subtle forms of it persist. We can see this through various elements of canon: the election of a Muggleborn Minister for Magic for the first time in 1962, the way people react to "mudblood" as we react to "nigger". These indicate that absent Voldemort, pure-blood politics was about as dead - but still clinging on - as white nationalism in the Muggle world.

If anything, the magical world is more tolerant than the Muggle one, as they only really have two prejudices - blood and species. And the latter doesn't to be entirely unjustified, given what we have seen of goblins. In contrast the Muggle world is full of prejudices that have no expression in the magical world: race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity.

***** The Daily Prophet would be able to do exactly the same thing in the Muggle USA. In general, the UK's defamation laws are considered repressive among the international community and many nations dislike "libel tourism" that takes place when people specifically start libel cases in the UK to take advantage of the restrictive laws there (though it has got better since the Defamation Act 2013). In short, in the UK to win a libel claim the defendant has to show that what they wrote was true. In the US, to win a libel claim the claimant has to show that what they wrote was false. Such a high burden of evidence - proving a negative - means that libel cases are very rarely successful in the US.

Re: teachers, there's no great difference to the Muggle world here. Snape is a decent teacher but scary and mean. That's a fairly common thing. Binns is deadly dull. Again, common. Trelawney is a fine teacher, it's just that her subject relies heavily on natural talent and is difficult to learn: ladies and gentlemen, welcome to art class. Filch is just a grumpy caretaker.

Fudge being seen to do something... apparently you are extremely out of touch with political reality in the Muggle world. That is exactly what happens. Half the policies governments pass are the result of wanting to be seen to be doing something.

There's no evidence that Snape was a bad teacher in terms of his ability to impart information. His students seem to do perfectly well in their exams. Harry did just as well in his Potions OWL as he did in Charms and Transfiguration.

I never said Binns was effective. I said that ineffective teachers are normal in the Muggle world.

Trelawney was not a fraud.

Filch's attitude doesn't matter. Teachers often talk about what nasty little shits their students are. Did he use corporal punishment after it was banned? No. Just like teachers in the Muggle world.

Also, regarding Hagrid, we don't know exactly what happened to him back when the Chamber was opened the first time. It's possible he was under a suspended sentence. He was considered responsible for the murder of Myrtle, after all. Normally that would result in Azkaban.

***** We do not know that they don't have laws against libel and slander after all as most celebrities would attest they have little effect in the muggle world and require moving through a very complex legal system to do anything at all. Skeeter was meant to be analogous to the UK Tabloid press. I don't know when you last read a paper like the Daily Mail or the Sun but I assure you they are just as bad as the Daily Prophet.

As for oversight of teacher behaviour, you must have went to a very good school if you didn't any teachers like that. My Year 7/8 RE teacher took pleasure in insulting students and my GCSE History teacher couldn't control the class so just sat there, doing nothing, not teaching. And those are only two. There were plenty more.

The vast majority of politicians with significant power in the muggle world enact some policies that don't work so they can be seen to be doing something.

And if you think there are not analogues to Draco Malfoy in the Muggle world you are quite simply deluded.

laws do have an effect, habeus corpus for instance. this is effective in the case of imprisonment w/o trial.

earning a living in the muggle world would be easy with magic. so economic disadvantage when returning to the muggle world is moot. imho

We have lots of information about civil liberties in the magical world. Notably by their lack. They don't seem to exist. see habeus corpus/Sirius/Hagrid. see Draco and hate speech. see summary execution by Fudge at his sole discretion. see Azkaban.

and of course the lack of civil liberties and/or robustness of civil liberties is much of the point and can be compared.

it's a simple proposition.. there were/are more freedoms, and better protected freedoms in muggle UK than in magical UK. there are a ton of economic opportunities available to anyone with a charms owl. Such opportunities need not break the Statute of Secrecy. Given that, I think muggleborns wouldn't stay in magical UK.

You say "change schools" as if it is that easy.

As I have said multiple times I never said laws do not have effects. They do. But some laws have limited effects, especially those that attempt to govern governments. Have you seen Snowden's revelations? Or what about the list Taure replied to you with which lists cases where imprisonment without trial has happened? For instance hundreds of people during the Troubles (Which by the way are what the Wizarding Wars are based on). Governments ignore laws more easily than people or companies.

Yes having magic would make making money in the muggle world easy. However there is the small matter of the International Statute of Secrecy which would be broken in that case and therefore the person who did that would be arrested.

We do not know that Wizarding Britain lacks Civil Liberties.

Your proposition is simple but it is also flawed in that you are assuming that because we, with our very limited look at this world haven't seen positive proof that wizards have civil liberties therefore wizards do not have civil liberties.

And yes they do need to break the statute of secrecy.

Yes, they can be brought to account. This holds for fictional governments just as much as it does for real ones.

The difference is that the Weasleys did not interact with muggles. Buying and Selling houses that have been fixed with with magic in muggle areas is clearly risking that muggles notice.

Draco's hate speech, so what? Plenty of people make hate speech all the time. It is illegal (at least in the UK, not in places like the US) but very few people suffer consequences of it, which means that it could be the same in the wizarding world, illegal, but very few suffer the consequences of that illegality.

As for Umbridge, it was very clear that the torture part of what Umbridge did was not sanctioned by the Ministry, "What Cornerlius doesn't know won't hurt him" or something to that effect was a quote from Umbridge.

And has been previously stated, muggle governments have imprisoned people without trials frequently. It is obviously bad but it isn't something that makes muggles better than wizards as they both do it.

*** Thanks for the recommendation, although I was hoping for a discussion with recommendations within said discussion.

I am aware of Emperor and have read it, but this doesnt quite fit the situation listed for discussion... if for no other reason then the Wizard (Harry) is still heavily connected to the magical world, and both the worlds are soon blended.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
