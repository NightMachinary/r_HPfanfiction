Hi!

I was hoping that someone could help me find a fic that I read a long time ago. Here's what I remember about it:

1. Harry Potter doesn't go to Hogwarts. His magic is there, but it is bound up tight. I can't remember the exact reason for it being bound, but I don't think it was the typical "Dumbledore did it" plot... but I could be wrong.
2. Harry stays in the muggle world, and he is either about to graduate or has already graduated from the local high school.
3. The magical plot starts with being hit by a car. The impact puts him in a normal hospital and his magical begins to escape from the binding. I vaguely remember something about Lupin either discovering him at this point, or already knowing about him.
4. At some point he is sent back in time to Atlantis, where he trains his magic. Something about that being the only place that can train something with the amount of magical ability that he has?
5. During the course of his training I believe he and a princess (or his trainer?... probably the trainer) fall in love, he trains to become a "Royal Phoenix" animagus and fights a historic battle with for the king of Atlantis.
6. Eventually he and his love interest time travel back to the present time to prep for Voldemort, i believe this is where the 2nd fic begins.

This is unfortunately about all that I can remember. I am 90% sure that this is a trilogy. The 1st book dealing with his magical training in Atlantis, the 2nd book beginning preps for Voldemort and the 3rd book being the final confrontation. Also, this fic is old.
