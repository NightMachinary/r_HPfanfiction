Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a special seer. Whenever he sees someone the first time in his head he sees their probable future. He unfortunately cannot do so with himself. This is why he allowed Tom Riddle to grow into what he was. This is how when he saw Trelawney he Imperiused Snape to leak the prophecy. When he first saw Harry he realised what he could have done if he had loving relatives. So he sent Harry to the Dursleys. He wanted money from Harry's vaults but he unfortunately couldn't see his destiny. He could only do it the first time he saw the person. So he could not understand what the new Harry could do.

And in addition to this Death and Fate together forbid him from ever seeing his death or events related to his death. This is what leads to his downfall.

In an epic battle of all the universes Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Huddlepuff-Emrys-Le Fay defeats Dark Lord, manipulative, evil, greater good Dumbledore (or Dumbles or Dumblefuck or Dumbly).

Behold! The mystery behind manipulatuve Dumbledore has been revealed.


** You have given a better explanation for manipulative Dumbledore
