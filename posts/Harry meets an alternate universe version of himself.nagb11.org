Preferably still set in the base universe rather than our harry being sent to another, 40k+ words if at all possible, but a neatly wrapped up one shot wouldnt go astray either


** I know of one where this happens. Au Harry travels to canon universe. But it's just a small part of the story and breaks rule 8 if I remember correctly. Harry Potter and the Elementals power

**** Actually just realised the fic I'm reading at the moment fits this as well. They meet in the prologue, but that's set in the future, so not sure how the story plays out. It's an enjoyable story from what I've read so far. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/]])

** Small funny one shot that meets your criteria to hopefully tide you over.

  The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it.OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** This is part of a series I was super into when I was younger, it's one part of a whole though so you may want to at least skim the previous parts first. I swear it's actually not a bad story, just a little tropeful. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections]]

** linkao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828]]) doesn't fit exactly, as canon Harry goes to the AU, but it's fantastic.
