***** Not necessarily. As an example, one my top 10 HP fics is a story called Eden linkffn(3494886) that's a Lucius/Hermione would be more true to Stockholm.

...I know that pairing sounds insane, but hear me out.

As a quick summary, death eaters kidnap Hermione and she gets physically and mentally abused by him everyday, but they wind up developing something between them. However Lucius never really changes anything about himself or his beliefs or really anything about their circumstances. It's a beautiful, tragic story cause I'm not really sure if it was Stockholm or love or a weird obsession. Sex wasn't even a real part of it, which made the whole situation a mind fuck.

Isolation is not even close to that kind of damaged relationship,imo. I like it so much more then most Dramione because it's not like Draco flips his script two chapters in like every other story, it takes time and a ton of work on Hermiones part, but character development does occur.

Also, in the later arc of the story, what the author did with the Slytherins, especially Theo Nott, was honestly beautiful to read.

With hetero things, I tend to want more realism and hardship, I guess to be reflective of my own relationships? Idk, it makes it seem more relatable, if I feel emotionally tied to the characters.

**** By any objective measure (favorites, follows, reviews, google results, etc.), both stories are still well-liked, but haters gonna hate.

Lovers praise and defend for a while, but there's other stuff to read and the haters never shut up, believe their personal opinion trumps the community aggregate, and believe they become more powerful when they convince others of their opinion. Everyone's free to express their dislike of a story once or twice, but at a certain point when someone just won't shut up about their opinion (for years!) you just relegate them to troll status and ignore them.

*** I haven't read Harry Crow or most of the fics on the list so can't really comment on them, but I do think that hate for HP:MoR is overblown.

Does it have issues sure. Is it the best thing in the fandom, obviously not, not even close. Some parts of it are more thinly vieled excuses for the author to explain various logical falacies or cognitive theory rather than a meaningful part of a story, and the way people who haven't read any other HP fics stumble across it and then think it's the best thing ever, even compared to canon since it's just so rational and smart! is super annoying. But despite it's flaws the technical writing in it is decent and it is entertaining enough to read and fairly unique. Better than many terrible fics that exist with horrible writing or super overdone plots.

*** I also found this article when I was newer and from what I can tell, this article is like five actually well known fics and the rest the ones the author likes. The writing style in almost all of them was disappointing. I actually liked isolation and DAYD but DAYD had some scandal with the author that was irritating. Harry crow and like four other ones I couldn't make it through.

I didn't think it was balanced as a listicle in terms of ships, canon, time period, etc. With so many fics available, you could pick high quality ones for each category.
