I remember when I read the books I disliked Snape a lot but then I saw the movie and I found him to be a pretty funny character. I loved scenes that had Snape just hating life. He is really cold in the films and composed most of times for what I remember Snape was a lot more emotional in the books more angry but I haven't read books or seen movies in a long time.

What are you thoughts? Which one do you like better? Do you see a lot of difference between movie and book Snape? Which one do you think is more prevalent in fanfiction?


** I see Book!Snape and Movie!Snape as two seperate entities. In the movies we don't see how he treats other students with the exception of Harry and his friends by extension. In the books almost all if not all loath Snape and we are told why. In the movies it's way more downplayed or cut out because it would be OOC for Alan Rickman's Snape.

** Alan Rickman single handedly took a character that no one liked and turned him into a complex, multi dimensional character. In my opinion, this allowed the viewer to see his humanity, despite his sour demeanor and terrible treatment of Harry. Arguably, Rickman's portrayal is why so many people have allowed him to be seen as a dark hero, instead of just a bitter, angry man who sacrificed his whole life for his betrayal. So, for me, movie Snape is by far my favorite, and will remain the Snape I use when I think about the books.

*** Note that the first film went out in 2001, and the Order of Phoenix book was published 2003. Thus I am afraid it is fair to say that the film Snape (and film Ron and film Hermione) took over the book one in OoP and definitively in HBP, which is probably one of reasons, why last two books are SO different from the first five ones.

** He is still a murdering, torturing Death eater in the movies and in the books so i see him as that, He still got Harry's parent killed as well.

Their is also that creepy scene he is holding onto Lily's corpse when she probably despised him as much as she despised and other death eater. I also feel sorry for Lily even though she is dead, having that piece of shit that she wasn't friends with for years touch her body. It's just creepy

*** You r making it out to be necrophilia which it wasn't. The guy was crying his eyes out for the one woman he loved his entire life while holding her bloody corpse...give him some respect man.

Snape was a fucker but he was just as human as everyone else and hence very much capable of selfless love, even if only for one person alone.

**** If someone pointed out your family to ISIS to die, and asked that they only spare your mom because that someone had a crush on her in high school, how would you feel about him holding your mom's corpse after they predictably acted liked psychopaths and killed her?

Yea, Snape is "human" all right. The same sort of human as rapists, murderers, and others who carry out horrible acts.

***** That's the thing isn't it? From what I remember, and correct me if I am wrong, Snape had no idea whatsoever that it was Lily's family which was mentioned in the prophecy. He was doing his job as a death eater at the time of delivering this prophecy to Voldemort.

When he came to know that it was Lily's son, he tried to make the best of the situation since he knew there was no way that Voldemort would spare his future nemesis.

As for him being a horrible person, there are many reformed rapists and murderers roaming the society after taking their just punishments and learning their lessons. What I mean is that Snape, just like everyone else, was a product of his situations and he, in the end, died a hero's death.

****** He was A-Okay with an anonymous infant being murdered, though, by your own admission. And even once he realized that the woman he was obsessed with was in the line of fire, he *still* only sought to protect her, not giving a shit about the completely innocent toddler he had put a target on.

There is no reforming that. Everywhere on earth outside of Western Europe, Snape would get executed for such horrendous crimes. Hero? As far from it as possible. I actually give Voldemort more of a pass than Snape, bc LV was obviously mentally ill. Snape had no such mitigation, he was just a terrorist incel willing to kill to get the woman he was obsessed with.

******* Hey, don't get overly emotional buddy. I get it, u don't like him.

But even in reference to HP, the infant he did nothing to save later on named his child after the man, remember? Someone called him 'bravest man'...

Also, what exactly could he have done against Voldemort? As soon as he realized his mistake, he went to the man the dark lord feared begging him to save them and did a 180 on being a death eater within a moment after being asked for being a spy. Being the spy against the most feared dark lord who can see through your mind like water, isn't it brave?

Afterwards, he did everything he could to destroy the fucker after having failed to save the one woman who he cared for and even died remembering her in her son. Who can forget the tears?

Alas, In seventeen fucking years, Snape had no romantic relationship whatsoever. He was depressed, angsty and later on, had to watch the reminder of his failure everyday.

As for being executed for his crime of 'not giving a shit about the completely innocent toddler', well he gave too much shit later on to make up for it.

******** Yes, Harry did name a son after the man reaponsible for his mother and father dying, the man who mutilated his brother-in-law. For the record, I despise canon!Harry - he's pathetic, cowardly, and almost unbelievably disrespectful to the dozens of people that died for him.

What could he have done about Voldemort? That's like backing the guy who ran a concentration camp in WW2 and being like "well what did you expect him to do?" How about not join magical nazis?

Again, you never address the point, so i will bring it up again - Snape willingly pointed a mass murderer at an unknown infant and saw nothing wrong with doing so until he found out the woman he was obsessed with would get caught in the crossfire. If Neville had been the BWL, Snape would never have switched sides. There is nothing brave about his decision, because it was based solely on his sick obsession with a woman that hated him.

He didn't make up for anything. If Snape's father - an unsung hero if ever there was one - had beat Snape to death, Harry wouldn't have been orphaned or abused, and the 2nd war likely never would have happened (did you forget it was Snape attempting to murder an innocent man that allowed Pettigrew to escape and seek out Voldemort?).

It's like reading a book about Jeffrey Dahmer and coming away thinking "maybe those people shouldn't have been so delicious!" You're getting the wrong takeaway, homie!

************** If he HAD dueled him, I'd agree. Again - the guy who killed everyone he cared about is standing in front of him. He just tried to kill his best friend's mother. What does Harry do?

Gives a speech, then fires off a nonlethal spell that is taught to 12-year olds. He didn't duel, much less fight. Harry Potter's greatest concern, when confronted with a mass murdering terrorist, was making sure that the terrorist didn't get hurt.

**** i didn't mention necrophilia. although now that I think about it I wouldn't rule it out, I just think it was creepy, Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years I don't think Lily would have forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater. so it would be like any random person who would happily see your husband and child dead if it meant you living holding your corpse

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4g1uxm/severus_snape/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body]] I found this post and I find that it sums pretty well how Snape is as character I mean I think that saying that he is just a torturing death eater is an oversimplification of his character. Plus I think is a good post and wanted to shared it.
