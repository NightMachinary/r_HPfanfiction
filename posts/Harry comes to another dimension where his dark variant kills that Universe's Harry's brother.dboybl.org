So I'm looking for the fiction described in the title. I also remember that Dumbledore worked with Dark Harry to get him in Voldemort's circle. After Hero Harry comes to the new Universe, he meets with Dark Harry in a cave. Also, James and Lily are still alive.

PS: How do you put flair in Chrome for Android?

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.
