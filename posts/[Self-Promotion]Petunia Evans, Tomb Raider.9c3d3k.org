It is set in an alternate Universe. A number of canon events didn't happen or happened differently. Notably, Squibs aren't muggles and can see magic. They aren't affected by Muggle-Repelling Charms either.

** I like it! I don't like Petunia-she's irritable and rude. Only seeing the worst in people. But, that's what makes it good. It's very in character for Petunia, especially Squib Petunia.

**** Can Squibs in this universe make potions? From Snape's wording, it sounds like they cannot, but I was curious.

***** No, they can't. Petunia is completely dependent on wizards where spells and potions are concerned.

****** Nice. That will be a good limit for you to work with. Plenty of room for conflict there. Aside from being able to see magic and not being affected by Muggle Repelling Charms, will Squibs have any other magical attributes?

******* They can use brooms and flying carpets, but not very well. Petunia will have to solve her problems Tomb Raider style.

**** I enjoyed the second chapter as well! I haven't been interested in fan fiction for the last year or so, so it's very nice to have something good to read again. Will it be a chapter for every school year?

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
