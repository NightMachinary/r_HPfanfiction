I read a really great one a while back with Ginny struggling with an ED and it made for a really interesting storyline. Anyone know if any others?


** The only one that comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]], which is really old, but not bad.

** Not sure if this fits the bill but I recently read quite a decent one where Harry becomes addicted to "studying". There's more to it than that, but the addiction is a big issue/plot point.

** [[http://pir8fancier.nfshost.com/hp_ghf.html][Glass Half Full]] has an alcoholic Ron and Pansy. It's a one-shot, but it's not bad.

** From Paris with Resistance: Dominique Weasley tries to help Lily Lina Potter. It's not quite complete though. (I think that only needs one last chapter, myself)

Do you have a link to the story that you were talking about in the OP?
