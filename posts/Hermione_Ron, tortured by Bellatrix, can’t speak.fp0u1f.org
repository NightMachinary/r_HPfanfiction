:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a long completed fic on Ff.net where Hermione has been kidnapped by Bellatrix and Ron finds her. Due to extensive torture, she doesn't speak at all and over the course of the fic, regains her memory and speech (although she stutters a lot). This fic takes the timeline of HP7 from Bellatrix kidnapping to the Final Battle. It also had a sequel that was incomplete. Any thoughts?
