If you choose a series, you must say your favorite from the series.

And why?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi]]

I like this story so much for a number of reasons:

First of all it fulfills all the requirements I'm looking for in fanfiction (good writing, no character bashing, no stupid theories on magic - like magical cores/magical exhaustion)

Secondly, because of the characters. The canon characters (apart from Harry) are all in character, the OCs well developed and interesting. Harry himself is interesting too, very powerful, but in a believable way.

Thirdly, because of its uniqueness. (Durmstrang e.g.)

Then of course because of its plot, which keeps me interested and always wanting to read more. I like dark!Harry stories and it is very hard to come across good ones with believable characterisations of Harry. I like his slow development into a dark wizard, the changes he goes through and how they come to pass. Everything just makes sense and I like that about it too. So yes, favourite fic.

*** Not sure I would label this Harry as dark, he's not evil in this story. He just studies dark magic because it's part of the curriculum at Durmstrang and for self preservation.

**** I think Harry doesn't have to be evil to be dark. In this case, I think Harry qualifies as dark because he is studying dark magic in depth and uses it in a ruthless manner. (There is a scene where he uses the Cruciatus on other students in retaliation). Also, Harry is a 4th year, so there is still time for development, so while right now the label dark!Harry might not be completely true, I think it will be in the future.

** I think I, personally, would choose linkffn(The Denarian Renegade). I loved the Denarian trilogy, but I think that would be my favorite - as a Dresden Files fan, I loved the urban magic feel of the pre-Hogwarts portion, and some of the fights later on - especially the tasks (dragon!) were incredible. Meciel was an incredible OC, and the fights were thrilling and exhilarating.

For those of you that don't know about it, it's the first book in the trilogy, so give it a read!

** I couldn't possibly choose a single favorite, but for nostalgia's sake I will say I have a special place in my heart for "I Am Lord Voldemort" by Nemesis. It's still floating around online somewhere I believe, but I wouldn't really recommend it nowadays. I first read it maybe 10 years ago, maybe longer, when I was first getting into fanfiction, and the fifth book wasn't out yet. (I remember being such a little shit that I posted Sirius' death scene on my Neopets profile in order to spoil people!) The writing style is stilted and cringeworthy at times, but for me at that time, it was perfectly fine, and the author's characterization of Tom as a nice boy who lost everyone he ever cared for (and was regularly beaten by Mr. Carney, the orphanage owner) was plausible. It basically cemented Tom/Voldy as my favorite character ever since.

** linkffn(Blood Magic) -- Blood Magic by GatewayGirl. I would wholesale replace HBP with it and be happy.

It's well-written (first couple chapters were a bit rough as she got her feet under her, but it was very good after that), a good concept overall (yes, it's a challenge fic, but it's well done), has some interesting interpretations on Wizarding society that aren't obviously contradicted in canon, etc. I feel that the characterizations are generally very strong, too.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951847/chapters/1861651][Rehabilitation]], in which Hermione is a caseworker assigned to ease Lucius back into the Wizarding world after being released from Azkaban,

and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2506055/chapters/5564747][Muggle Studies]], where Lucius has to decide between staying in Azkaban or taking a Muggle Studies course at Hogwarts that's taught by Hermione.

Both of them are generally happy, have a fair bit of snarkiness between the two of them, and have good storylines. Both of them focus on Lucius's reform at some point after the war.

Also, I'm currently reading one I haven't finished, but has been /unbelievably/ hilarious so far. It's Hermione/Draco with a healthy amount of Lucius/Narcissa, called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/153238/chapters/219946?view_adult=true][A Dowry of a Single Galleon]], which at first I thought was going to be depressing, but blossoms into something so cute you want to vomit at times.

Otherwise, I'm at a bit of a loss. If you have any suggestions I'll gladly take them! I'm too scared to read any new ones since the last one I read ended with Lucius dying and I had a bit of a mental break down (it's been a stressful past few months), haha.

*** Reeeeeeeeeally? /Three to Backstep/? I couldn't get past the first few chapters. What about this description do you disagree with?

#+begin_quote
  Ymmv with this story, the set up is extraordinarily weak, with the author literally using divine intervention anytime anyone questions the harem. Hermione and Daphne also completely lose their characters and just become Harry's yes-women very quickly. Harry also is in complete control of his life, including giving massive long speeches to wizards about how terrible they all are. Personally I found the story painfully weak and disappointing

  With a grumbling mutter as he watched Ron go and sit down with Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas, Harry nodded. "He clearly has no idea about bonds, how they form, or what they mean. You'd think, as a pure blood, he would."

  "Steady, Harry," said Neville, cautioning him. "It's not all that surprising. Soul bonds are extremely rare. The fact you've formed identical bonds with two witches at the same time is phenomenal. I cannot recall such a thing ever happening before."

  Harry sighed and said, "I guess you're right. It just Ron's bigotry is really getting to me. I already have to put up with his petty jealousy, laziness and poor manners. I'm just not willing to put up with any more of anything else. I thought Professor McGonagall was going to set him straight, this morning. That doesn't seem to be the case."

********** Then the author would have looked over his or her work and maybe reconsidered it. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but this is SOP at DLP. If you can't look over your work and take criticism, you'll never improve.

There's a ton of crap in the FF community, and everyone knows it. Tip towing over everyone's feelings would result in tumblr.

There wasn't even a need to point out what was wrong with the quoted section, it's blindingly obvious. That character is /not/ Harry Potter. It's not even close to Harry Potter. That's the author self inserting himself as Harry Potter. Last time I checked TTB isn't labelled as a self insert, so the author isn't doing it on purpose, they just don't know how to write characters. Maybe being criticized will give them incentive to improve.

I mean a Harry that isn't really cannon Harry has nothing to do with the writing quality. You can say the plot or the characters are bad, but the writing is far better than a lot of the crap I've read of the years. Just my two cents.
