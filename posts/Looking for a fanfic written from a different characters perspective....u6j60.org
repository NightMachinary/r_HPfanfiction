**** Oh dear. (: I'm sorry, I should have warned you! I was posting quickly and then jumping offline.

To make up for that, here is an adorable R/Hr fic... [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=816&chapno=1][Part 1]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=817&chapno=1][Part 2]]. The author, [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=1][Arabella]] also has several Hermione's-point-of-view fics (look for the Queen of Witches ones).

***** Oh I've read Arabella before! Can't remember which fic it was... Actually, looking through, yes, it was Queen of Witches! Lol, H/Hr is just too much like incest to me. :p
