Im kinda writing something like this but not in the stories kind a way more of a compilation of newspaper article and letter. Do you know anything like this?

The idea is just like to make everything better with help of the other world and the journey to slowly make it happen..

**** It is about an 18-year old American No-Maj who discovers he's a wizard and then goes to Ilvermorny the US Wizarding school, together with other No-Maj Born adults who also discovered Magic.

Meanwhile the modern Witch Hunting organisation the Second Salemers from Fantastic Beasts have risen again to expose magic and eliminate all wizards

** ...You know, I just had the oddest thought; what if instead of witches and wizards re-integrating into the muggle world/culture, they integrated into goblin/centaur/veela/house-elf/who-knows culture instead?

LF fic where a reliable waterbreathing charm is invented and magical humans integrate with merpeople to found New Atlantis under the sea.

  Eighth Year at Hogwarts was supposed to be Hermione's. And it is, just not in the way she expects. Omegaverse fic.
