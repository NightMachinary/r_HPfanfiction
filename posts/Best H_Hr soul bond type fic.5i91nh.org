Just wanted to read some long soul bond fic and H/Hr is my favorite pairing


** some would say there is no good soul bond story. nevertheless, here's what I have in my 'soul bond crap' folder:

likely the best of them is '3 to backstep' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/][Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep]]

also do a google search [[https://www.google.com/search?q=yasbf+ffnet&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][yasbf ffnet]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8481766/1/][Harry-Potter-Death-s-Revenge]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond By: Council]]

** If you want length, try /The Accidental Bond/, linkffn(5604382). Hermione is the most important girl.

Another great soul bond fic is /The Sum of Their Parts/, linkffn(11858167), where Hermione's attempt of making a proto dark mark ended up creating a soul bond between the Trio.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by [[http://keiramarcos.com/][Keira Marcos]]

You have to register but this is the best in the theme in my opinion by far.

** I think the best one you can find with this particular pairing is “A Parody of Soul Bonds” (linkffn(8895981)).

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.
