  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  For all of his life Harry has fought for his freedom and for vengeance, he has been an eternal beacon shining through the oncoming darkness. It was not enough however, the darkness has overwhelmed the world and Voldemort has seemingly won. There were two things Voldemort was not ready for though, Harry's sheer determination and will to win, and the brilliance of Albus Dumbledore.
