I would love to read a older Harry fic with lots of adventure. Something like Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord or Fate Is A Four Letter Word by Philo. The kids are their own characters and Harry is still the main character and freaking awesome. I've been looking for a long time so any suggestions would be amazing!!! I don't care about specific pairings or if there are kids or not. I don't have any restrictions whatsoever.


** Conspiracy of Blood is a novel-length story that I completed about a year and a half ago. It features older, wiser and more powerful versions of Harry, Ron and Hermione, along with a cast of canon characters, their children and their grandchildren. The story is built around a mystery and contains a fair bit of action. I think you might enjoy it.

** nonjon has a few stories that feature an older, powerful Harry, though none deal much with his kids:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]; 300k words, complete. (Crossover with Firefly/Serenity, though you probably can get by with just scanning the wiki pages).

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]; 250k words, complete. Quintessential Harry/Sirius buddy-flick fic.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]]; 20k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been

Another story is GhostForce1911's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveryrim]], a 90k word WIP (a NCIS crossover and offshoot of another of his AU stories, though that series is not needed to read this):

#+begin_quote
  Spin-off AU of Per Ardua Ad Astra. Harry lost his magic and became an elite soldier. Ziva lost her sister and became a spy. Theirs is an unlikely bond, a friendship forged in fire, blood and loss that endures despite divergent commitments to duty, country or agency. First friends, who became comrades, then something more - something deeper. They are, and always will be 'khaveyrim'.
#+end_quote

I'd also recommend Doghead Thirteen's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]]; 5k words, crossover with The Deadliest Catch. (It's better than it sounds.)

#+begin_quote
  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.
#+end_quote

Also, Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] is a commonly recommended older-Harry fic; 100k words, complete, a bit depressing.

#+begin_quote
  Post DH. In the wake of victory, Harry struggles with life, love, and the reform of the British wizarding world. He learns that life is complex, and that happy endings are fleeting. Chapter 24- Dreams: The Unicorn in Kensington Gardens
