...or really any other sort of supernatural deal like that.

There's a crack!fic one that's about ten chapters in, whose name I can't remember, which was actually pretty funny, but I haven't really been able to find a lot of other ones. It's a trope I actually really like, so it would be cool to read more of it.


** linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb) is the best 'Harry makes a deal with a demonic entity/entities' that I know of. Sure, it's only 3 chapters at the moment, but he's got two more planned (can't remember if that will include the epilogue or not) and it is /glorious/.

On a very diffrent note, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] linkffn(2452681) has a sort of demon deal...

** He makes one in both of my fics: linkffn(9265719; 11767424) /Butterfly Wings/ is still updating, but I'd say it's the better of the two 'cause I've had a few years to improve my writing. Do note that the deal isn't really the focus of either fic, it's just a plot device for changing things and making Harry overpowered. (Although when I say changing things, /For the Price of a Soul/ ended up hitting a lot of canon stations; it was my first ever long fic and it has many of the faults associated as such. /Butterfly Wings/ changes things way more.)

  Lily Potter made a mistake nine months before Harry Potter was born: Severus Snape, not her husband, was Harry's father. The ripple effect of this reaches far: Snape dies young, Harry calls vampires family, and Lucius Malfoy seeks to destroy Voldemort. But one thing remains the same -- the inevitability of death.
