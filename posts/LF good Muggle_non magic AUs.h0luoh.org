Preferably not Harry-centric. If there's pairings - no Romione or Harmony end game (it's ok if they date(d) and break up) and no slash/femslash as a main pairing (ok if it's secondary characters). Any length - complete, WIPs, one-shots.


** Is that even Harry Potter at that point?

***** If the writer knows the characters well, then they should be able to capture the personalities. Oftentimes, I see so many /Harry In Name Only/ fics that have magic, but they don't have any of the characters present.
