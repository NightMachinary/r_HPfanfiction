I would like to read stories where Harry trains secretly and gets stronger without the Order/Ron/Hermione knowing.

It would be great if he is more Gray than Light.

Thanks in advance!


** This is a Harry/Tonks where Harry trains over the summer and participates on many battles with Death Eaters. But it's a self contained summer story, it doesn't go into the next year. Edit: Although I mention Tonks, the order doesn't actually knows. I imagine most people know of this fic anyways, it gets recommended a lot...

**** Yeah, tried reading it and it drags on for too long. For only a summer, 100k words is more than enough, 150-ish AT MOST.

***** I adore long fics, the longer the better as far as I'm concerned, but i think 300k just on summer may be a test for me lol

******* Ha, I'll stick it on the list. Though i tend to avoid T rated fics, I usually.find them a bit boring, prefer M.

I think writing a long fic is one hell of a.skill, cos you really have to make sure that the story is good enough to support it and that you're actually moving stuff along rather than just rambling for the sake of it

******** I prefer 150-200k word fics, but tried this hinny one. Was a 2 part series with 400k words each. Started skimming halfway through the first and ignored the 2nd as it was basically only filler material, completely horrible to read. Not because of hinny, just the way it was written.

********* Oh I've given up on a few just because they were so utterly blah, I read too quickly to waste it on bad fiction.

So long as its over 100k ill give it a go (ill drop to 80k if well reviewed)

********** Tough no exact recommendations, I would suggest giving a few ficlets 25-50k words with good reviewes a read. They can be incredibly well made. Just stay away from unfinished/abandoned fics, makes your blood boil when it cliffhangers when the action starts.

Also, many 5-10k oneshots are very good. My favourite fluffy haphne is linkffn(ice cream)

*********** Honestly don't even get me started on abandoned fics. Started a conpleted fic without realising it was in a series. 4 books long i think. Nearly 2 millions words. Abandoned needing like 2 more chapters. I was devastated

Seriously, I read a 100k fic in half a day, I'd spend more time browsing for small one shots than I would reading them!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
