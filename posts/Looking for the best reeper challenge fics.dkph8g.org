** I assume you're speaking of Reptilia28's "Don't Fear The Reaper" challenge. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Dont-fear-the-Reaper-reptilia28-s-Challenge/70135/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Here's]] an FFN Community dedicated to it; of the fics included, my favourites are probably:

*Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin

*Three To Backstep by Sinyk

and *Forty-One Times Dead by Ruskbyte

***** As do I. I have read a few and some have been really good. I am enjoying a fair life but wanting for the update

****** I haven't read that one yet, not generally a fan of gender bending. Probably give it a shot, though.

I like do-over/time travel fics, but the Weasley bashing in the Reptilia28s can be a little much.

******* That it can be. It does the whole gender swap well but still can be a bit jarring
