I have seen several fanfics that have the sorting hat being given the name Alistair. Is this a canon thing I somehow missed? Or is it a popular headcanon (and if so why?)

​

​


** No, it's not canonical. I think one fic came up with it and enough other people thought it was a good enough idea to pump into their own fic that after a while, some people kind of absorbed it through fanfiction osmosis, unaware that it wasn't at all canon. Kinda like Daphne Greengrass, Wards, etc.

*** What about Daphne? Just the "bitchy beautiful Ice Queen of Slytherin" thing, or is there one I'm missing?

**** In canon, Daphne is mentioned once during the OWLS when she is in Hermione's group (Greengrass and Granger).

That's all there is in canon, everything else is pure fanon.

***** Glory to the Blank slate. Create a name need not I. The hard part is done, plus now it isn't OC.

****** Blanks are awesome to fit OCs while already giving them some ties to the canon universe. And you can write them in almost any imaginable way, giving you way more creative freedom.

***** Ahh, okay. Someone once tried to tell me she wasn't even a character in the series and was a fanon made up name that just spread - that one was a real headscratcher.

****** Well, she isn't a character. She is nothing but a name. Even being Slytherin is already extended canon.

******* Huh. I could have sworn she was mentioned as Slytherin in the books, but I suppose you're right. Her predecessor, Queenie Greengrass, is listed as Slytherin in the handwritten Original 40 list featured in 'Harry Potter and Me', though I know some people don't consider literally anything but the books themselves as valid canon.

By 'character' , I mean 'a name given by JKR in the books' - someone once tried to tell me that, name and all, she was never in the books.
