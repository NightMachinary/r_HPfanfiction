** Lots of them actually, for example Hermione in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994). She had lots of success against rank and file Death Eaters, but Voldemort was in a completely different league though

On the other hand, I'd like to see a fic in which Harry tried to challenge Voldemort with Muggle means, only to have Voldemort pulling out a magically enhanced minigun and mowing down surprised Order members.

*** Or develop a gaseous permutation of the Draught of Living Death and set it loose in London. For bonus points, the Death Eaters' masks were actually designed to be gas masks (hence the rather gaudy features are actually a cover).

**** I don't think a competent Voldemort would threaten the Statute of Secrecy in such a way - it would only bring down trouble on his head if we look at the FB movie, and it wouldn't really help his goals. Using such a concoction against people who attack him, on the other hand, is perfectly valid.

***** Possibly, but on the other hand wizards clearly possess significant capacity with mind magics that can't be neglected. An even in the late nineties it would be pretty easy to push it as a terrorist or foreign attack rather than as some new sovereign entity. Gas attacks aren't exactly unheard of for the British.

****** The thing is, it's still pointless and stupid to attack the muggles. The ICW isn't likely to tolerate such actions, and Voldemort has nothing to gain by killing muggles or making the ICW angry. If he wants to rule the muggles, mind-controlling the PM is the way to go, not massacring people.

******* I get that its pointless from the perspective of 'only attacking because they're muggles', but thats not why I thought of that.

Attacking London was to take out the Ministry and Diagon Alley. This would help defeat the defenses the Ministry /probably/ has but were negated by having insiders like Rookwood spill the beans, without actually having to assault the building (basement?). Diagon Alley is mostly about taking out the Goblins though. With them dead, Voldemort can stroll into and collect the gold and wealth at his leisure.

Not only that, but it appears that most of the purebloods live far from London in smaller communities, so the bulk of his followers and support base would be relatively unmolested. He could also couch this as 'pruning the impurities from society' for removing pests like the goblins who 'lord over wizards with their secrets' (Propaganda 101).

******** Gringotts is mostly underground. It's very, very unlikely that they haven't set up defences against gas. Ditto for the Ministry - if the Death Eaters can disable those defences, they can also use the gas inside the Ministry.

I also think that given Diagon Alley's age, most residents will be purebloods.

**** That was completely pointless.

If he really wanted to destroy Muggles, he just had to build many self sufficient Wizarding enclaves for his people, mind control the PM of UK and the POTUS, and order them to fire all their nuclear weapons. The ensuing global thermonuclear war should wipe out 95% of the Muggle population within a few months, and the world would be for his taking.

***** I wasn't saying it was a smart idea. But I was saying it would be the sort of goal Voldemort would aspire for. And he would probably, if understanding anything involving nuclear war, not find rendering the planet uninhabitable a long term method forward. He would also hate in any way 'relying' on the muggles like that. He may be competent, but he'd still be a narcissistic sociopath with a god complex. He really believes the shit he spouts.

Now, killing them with magic, with such ease. That is how he thinks. For every action he takes, he takes every chance to /show/ how great he is. Even talented strategists like Caesar (depending on whose story you believe) or Scipio Africanus took every opportunity too extol their awesomeness, and it often came back to bite them. Just like it did Voldemort.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Doesn't linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) have a similar premise? He uses pepper, snake venom to fight against the Death Eaters and Voldemort? Not exactly Muggle methods but quite similar.
