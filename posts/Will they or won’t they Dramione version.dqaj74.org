:END:
Draco is the boss of some large company and he needs to hire his ex Hermione because she is the best at her job, the only problem is he hates her (or does he?) because she cheated on him with Ron at the beginning of their relationship. Eventually they start hooking up again but are too scared to admit their feelings to each other. Blaise and Ginny work for Draco too and are rooting for them to get back together.
