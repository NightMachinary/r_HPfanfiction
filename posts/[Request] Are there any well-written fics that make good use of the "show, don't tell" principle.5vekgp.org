I find that a lot of fics get way too descriptive when it comes to plot, character, and/or setting.

** Well, telling is not the same as description, but you probably wouldn't say a story that was too much telling and not enough showing was well written anyway. IMO people do go a bit far with the showing sometimes and start overwriting. I can't see any reason not to just say 'Jane hurried over the road', rather than 'Jane stumbled in desperate haste over the rough gravel surface, her feet as heavy as lead and her heart beating fiercely like a desperate and dying pigeon within the cage of her heaving ribs', sort of thing.

*** I'll say that it's not a problem with the showing, though, but with the writers not trimming the bits that are unnecessary to the plot in any way, as if they were trying to write a slice-of-life story---in which stuff like that has place---rather than an adventure story or whatever their genre is supposed to be. And when you get used to everything being just that long and just that untrimmed, well ... stuff like “Jane stumbled in desperate haste over the rough gravel surface, her feet as heavy as lead and her heart beating fiercely like a desperate and dying pigeon within the cage of her heaving ribs” happens.

**** Yes it is. Truthfully you're never going to need something quite as daft as that outside of a parody. But unfortunately a lot of fanfiction writers seem to think that is what showing /is/, and I have seen fics with paragraph after paragraph of that stuff. I've had critiques advising me to do things like that. I've seen whole forum threads dedicated to the art of 'show don't tell' that leave me scratching my head in bemusement.

All things in moderation as far as I'm concerned.

***** Yeah, pretty much. As far as I'd been taught, you are supposed to “show, don't tell” things that are out of norm and have not already been told, precisely because when things are out of norm we don't automatically know but instead have to look for signs and make a guess; so when character A is suffering from some illness, for example, don't make the narrator just tell that but instead have him note the symptoms that would be easily noticed by the other characters on the scene and let the reader make a guess, And even then it's possible to give the readers a little “show” by noting that the character looked ill and then have the affected character say something along the lines of “the doctors say it's [insert-name-of-illness]”.

Showing things that are not out-of-norm for the reader, like a character simply being in a bad shape and trying to get somewhere which is difficult for them but we all know it is and we all know why and how much and what exactly is wrong with the character? Yeah, that's madness, you trim things like that because they are nothing more than filler and for the most part boring. You don't do that unless you are either writing a slice-of-life story for readers who want that or are so unsure about your writing that you follow advice blindly.

Heck, the only situation in which I'd not trim the stuff of the “Jane stumbled ...” kind would be in singular scenes where a lot happens and it all depends on a split-second time difference and basically is a desperate struggle, but in those situations I'd make the sentences short (emulating the perception of situation in bursts due to adrenaline) and mostly concentrate on the objective with anything pertaining to the character being only occasional throw-ins to show that the character is in a shitty state (one sentence in a dozen, or something like that) but doesn't concentrate on it and things that change the chances of the character getting it done (such as them tripping).

** A lot of writers seem to forget that principle. I've always admired the way Rowling wrote very emotional little pieces of dialogue and narration:

"Always".

"But he was home".

Man, says so much with just a handful of words.

*** Except, Rowling uses exposition more than any writer I've ever read. She doesn't do it when it counts however. Like in HPB when Harry randomly started liking Ginny, he never gave details on why, he never noted anything about her appearance or the way she acted, to detail why he wanted to be with her, he just did. It's kind of ironic. Because she'll do exposition on Sherbert Lemons, or add Pseudo-Characterization for Dumbledore's gayness in an interview, but she can't for the life of her work out why she came up with the relationships that she came up with.

**** I think most of the fandom can agree that, unfortunately, the romances are the weakest part of the series.

Onto the topic of exposition, I still haven't forgotten that massive info dump at the end of PoA, but it's undeniable that Rowling's writing can be subtle and extremely powerful when it hits you.
