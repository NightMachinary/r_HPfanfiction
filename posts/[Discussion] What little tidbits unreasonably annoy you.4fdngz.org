** My personal stupid little grievance is Movie!Harry riding trains just to pass the time, as though he's some hobo with unlimited amounts of money for the expensive ticket fares. And not really a little thing, but Movie!Hermione being perfect.

As far as the books go, there's a line at the end of the PA book where Lupin calls Ron "boy," I'm 100% sure it was intended to be Sirius's dialogue tag but it bugs me.

** Seekers in Quidditch are bullshit. Like, I understand that JK needed to make Harry's quidditch heroics seem more, well... heroic, but /what the fuck/. Granting fifteen goals for catching the snitch and ending the game is a broken system and totally overkill. A seeker's importance suddenly outweighs everyone else's by a significant margin.

It's stupid as shit. It's like if goals by forwards counted as three goals instead of one in football.

Also, on the topic of quidditch; I'm not sure if this is actually canon or not, but in jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] (i.e. the quidditch fic that everyone and their mother recommends), Ron says in a conversation that there's a draft for quidditch like in American sports. This annoys me for no logical reason other than that the fic doesn't take place America, so there's most likely no draft.

*** I agree that there are some inherent problems with the position, but I think its ridiculousness can be vastly decreased simply by reducing the points earned. Something in the area of 1-5 goals would be much more reasonable. Depends on the average points scored by a chaser per game though, should be somewhere in that ball-park - maybe less (considering the additional tactical value of ending the game by catching the snitch).

*** Trying to make the game more realistic, I kind of change the roles of the positions in my mind. Obviously Chasers are the offensive players. Compare it to soccer, they'd be the strikers/attacking midfielders. Beaters are sort of the defensemen. Compare it to hockey, you can have offensive and defensive defensemen. Offensive talent would correlate to preventing the bludgers from making it to the streaking chasers while defensive would be actually trying to hit the players. The best strategy for this defensive game, in my mind, would be hitting the bludgers in the positions to guide the chasers toward the outside, making it a tougher angle to score on the keeper. Similar to Hockey where you guide them to the outside. Keeper is the keeper.

As for the Seeker, there are a bunch of changes you could do like altering the points given for catching the snitch. A change that I've been thinking about is to award no points at all for the snitch, it just ends the game. (Granted, this idea would mean Krum's move in the final made no sense. But be honest, it didn't make sense to begin with.) Instead, snitches caught could act as a tie braker in league play similar to goal differential in Soccer or ROWs in Hockey. So, in league play, a win would be 3 points, a draw would be 1, and a loss 0. Ties are decided by snitches caught. In international play where its elimination, you would want to prevent the opposing team seeker from catching the snitch while you hope your chasers and beaters can do an appropriate job catching up on the score board.

** /That's not how legilimency works!/ It's not mind reading! You can't just look at someone and read their mind, that's one of the first things Snape tells us "The mind is not a book to be opened and read"

It's a /spell/! Harry reflects it with a simple protego, there is no instance where a character is being legilimenced in which he doens't know about it, and yes, like most spells someone talented can do it without a wand and non verbally, but you can't just look at someone, see what you want, and go on with your life without anyone even noticing!

*** It's strongly implied that Dumbledore used legilimency on Harry a couple times without him knowing - for example, in the "Is there anything else you want to tell me?" moment in CoS.

Further, Snape's use of legilimency against Harry in their duel in HBP was pretty subtle. Harry didn't seem to feel it or notice it - the only evidence was the fact that Snape knew every spell he was about to cast before he cast it.

***** Seems like a good implication to me:

#+begin_quote
  Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.

  “I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,” he said gently.

  “Anything at all.”

  Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, “You'll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: “Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin...

  “No,” said Harry. “There isn't anything, Professor...”
#+end_quote

We have Dumbledore considering Harry, which likely involves eye-contact, and then we have a number of thoughts swimming to the top of Harry's mind, exactly like when Snape performed legilimency on him in HBP.

There's another possible one in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.

  “Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked calmly.

  “No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.

  “Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.

  “No,” said Harry vehemently.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore established eye contact, asks some questions and takes Harry's answers as gospel. It would seem irresponsible in that situation to just accept Harry's word unless he has some way of being sure Harry is telling the truth, which we know legilimency is capable of.

He can't talk about the Polyjuice Potion or Draco because Polyjuice is illegal and Draco obviously isn't the heir. He doesn't tell Dumbledore about the voices because voices are a Bad Sign according to Ron Weasley. He does not want to be connected to Slytherin, so he /doesn't/ say any of these things to Dumbledore, even if Harry wants to help him.

I've always read Snape's "it's not mind reading" quote as being about the complexity of the spell and the mind, deriding Harry for thinking it was simple, but not about legilimency's capabilities. Legilimency isn't mind-reading /in mechanism/ but it does allow you to effectively read minds.

JKR: They'll (Ron and Hermione) probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues, and she needs to work on being a little less critical. [...] Ron's used to playing second fiddle. I think that's a comfortable role for him, but at a certain point he has to be his own man, doesn't he?

EW: Yes, and until he does it is unresolved. It is unfinished business. So maybe life presented this to him enough times until he had to make a choice and become the man that Hermione needs.

JKR: Just like her creator, she has a real weakness for a funny man. These uptight girls, they do like them funny. (Emma Watson then agrees with JKR.)

"for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron." - JKR, again on R/Hr.

Her saying they'll probably 'be fine' is an attempt to soften the blow, but JKR essentially says she torpedoed natural character evolution in favour of keeping the plot as she had imagined it (i.e. wish-fulfillment, as in fulfilling JKR's wish to keep the story as she'd originally conceived it). Plus, 'fundamental incompatibility' is a pretty damning accusation, wouldn't you say?

As for your second question, there's a lot more to fandom than shipping. At the end of the day, I couldn't care less who Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up with, so long as it makes sense from a narrative perspective. Even if it's Harry/Pansy, Hermione/Neville, and Ron/Fleur, if you can find a way to make those pairings make sense, then I'll read it.

******** Uh, that's the most ridiculous definition of "wish-fulfillment" I've ever heard. In fiction, it's used to describe characters built for the sheer purposes of fulfilling wishes. A good example is 90% of OCs/super-powerful-Harries/etc. If you want to use it that way, okay, but know that you're pretty much misusing the definition. English isn't always purely literal.

Also, cute how the part you disagree with is an attempt to soften the blow. How convenient! In the entire interview it's pretty obvious that JKR's overall neutral, and if she really disagreed with the pairing she wouldn't have written stuff like the Quidditch World Cup with them still being a couple.

Also, as I said, being ridiculously overenthusiastic about shipping wars is part of the fun of such fandoms to me, so.

As a side note, if Cursed Child includes a R/Hr divorce or anything of the sort...well, I'll respect JKR's characters and what she wanted to build, but holy fuck am I going to disown that just like many people disown the epilogue.

"I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of */wish fulfillment/*. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility."

But, I'm sorry, I'm using the term wrong, aren't I?

And, it's absolutely an attempt to soften the blow. You can't say people are fundamentally incompatible and probably wouldn't have lasted in an adult relationship in one sentence and then say they'll be fine in the next. That part of the interview is completely at odds with everything she says beforehand.

You have the prerogative to like what you like and disown what you want to disown, I couldn't care less, but if you can't see how R/Hr is "unrealistic wish-fulfillment" after Jo practically said it herself, then I don't know what else to say.

*** I don't care about the interview itself. I guess in some ways Harry would be a better match for Hermione. In SOME ways they would be more compatible. My problem is how the H/Hr shippers reacted to it. Notice JK didn't say that Hermione was a better match for Harry, just that Harry might have been a better choice than Ron for her. But the whole community flips out and we have hundreds of posts and articles spouting "proof" that Harry and Hermione should have been together and "proof" that JK said she made a mistake. All the shippers are going on and on about how they were right and how their bashing of Ginny was justified. "We were right, Ginny MUST have love potioned Harry in HBP." I read all this and wanted to rip my hair out. Did any of them read the actual original interview!?!?

I'd think the chasing game would be very up close and personal. Throws wouldn't be more than 10-15 yards, because throwing a ball at high speeds while moving in a three directional space would be really hard.

Also, for all we know the balls have some sort of charms to aid in this. If the bludger is already charmed to fly and chase down opponents, how hard would it be to make it easier to redirect?

** Decided I should put mine in a comment-

I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Rons coughs, covering a laugh.

Ron thinks the name is funny. WHY? Besides the muggle reference of pompously introducing yourself like James Bond it makes no sense to me.

He is a wizard, why is that name funny to him?

1) Malfoy means "bad faith", which wouldn't be my first choice. But Weasley is derived from "weasel" which is a byname for "A deceitful or treacherous person". Wouldn't be my second choice either.

2) First (and last) names he would know even if isolated: - Xenophilius Lovegood - Luna Lovegood - (probably) Pandora Lovegood - Galvin Gudgeon (Chudley Cannons seeker) - Ragmar Dorkins (Chudley Cannons manager) - Sirius Black (named after a constellation) - a great many Chocolate Frog Cards - a great many other quidditch players - probably at least a couple of his brothers school friends

Family/Relations: - Septimus Weasley (grandfather) - Cedrella Black (grandmother) - Ignatius Prewett (great uncle, and Percy's middle name) - Lucretia Prewett (great aunt, Black name with celestial connection- asteroid) - Billius (uncle, and Rons own middle name) And who knows that else (besides Mafalda, Muriel, Tessie).

I won't go into all the meanings of names but I don't find Draco to be of any note. It's a constellation and it's latin for Dragon both of which are pertinent for their world.

It just disconnects me when I read it because it definitely isn't Ron being mean, but I don't see any reason for him as a pureblood wizard to find humour at the name.

*** Out of Ron's siblings, the only one with an unusual name is Ginevra, and it probably seems normal to him because he grew up with the name and Ginny goes by Ginny. Ron's parents have normal names as well. If you look at [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-original-forty][Harry's original class,]] there are about 5 first names (not including the Patil twins) that aren't relatively common British names (Lavender, Millicent, Pansy, Hermione, Blaise). And you'll notice that only one of those is a boy's name. All of the other boys in the class are named things like Stephen, Vincent, Gregory, Trevor, Kevin, Anthony, Theodore, Michael, and Ernie.

On top of that, most of the names you listed (Septimus, Cedrella, etc.) are actual names, though they're old-fashioned and unusual. Draco isn't generally a proper name. So it's unusual to begin with, and seems even more unusual because it's an 11-year-old's name.

Just because he doesn't recognize the James Bond reference doesn't mean that Malfoy doesn't come off as a little ridiculous. He bursts into their compartment with his two silent bodyguards and goes into his pompous routine.

Ron certainly knew the surname, and the snigger was probably a defense mechanism as well. He wanted to tear Malfoy down before Malfoy tore him down first (which Malfoy does in the next breath).

Fanon says he might have started to get suspicious after the chamber and had the suspicions confirmed after the graveyard, but even then it's just that Voldy made a horcrux, not that he had multiple and that Harry contained one.

** "Wards".

I don't care if it's used in every other fantasy franchise. It's not used in HP. In the books, "wards" were called "protective enchantments/charms", or simply "protections" and so on. "Wards" sounds like such a generic, dry, unimaginative word for that sort of thing. The terms used in the books gave a certain impression of /magic/. You got the feel that Hogwarts has some ancient, mystical protections deriving from it's grandeur. "Wards" on the other hand, sounds cheap, plastic, mass produced and technical.

Yes, it's easier to just write "wards", and it probably doesn't matter to most readers, but in my opinion, this is just an example of the way fanfiction can suck all the beauty and magic from HP, by making magic such a generic, common and mechanical thing. Language is a magic all by itself, folks.

******* I didnt say he's not as smart as Ron, I said in terms of being a prefect he didn't have the grades or the confidence to be prefect as of the beginning of OotP when the decision was made. Take the professors perspective on it. Ron has an award for services to school from second year (both he Harry had one from CoS) his grades are probably okay (they don't know if Hermione's been helping or not they just have the grades) and he's fairly sociable (not only friends with Harry and Hermione, but he hung out with Seamus and Dean whenever he was at odds with Harry). He's a fair choice assuming Dean and Seamus are not good ones (we don't have enough to go on for them).

I said Neville was a late bloomer. He came into himself during OotP, but that was too late as far a prefectship was concerned. As of the end of GoF he was still a bit of a joke. And having confidence issues was not a point in his favour in terms of a leadership position where he has to approach students who are misbehaving and dock points or hand out detentions. Also Hermione did help Neville... she hissed instructions at him in potions. For all we know we might have helped him revise too.

EDIT: As for OWLs I still stand by that. Ron may have had Hermione's help for studying but he still took them on his own. So when he puts the effort and studies he does well.

******** I get that, but you also have to take into account extenuating circumstances. Neville was raised by a strict grandmother who wanted him to be just like his father, Ron had a supportive family, and slacked off, neither had the ideal chance at being a brilliant student, but I believe if Harry and Neville had been raised by there parents they would have probably been in the top 5 of their year. Granted we have no proof of that. But with James being brilliant at transfiguration, and Lily being the top student of her year, Harry would have turned out to be quite a bit smarter and less of a slacker. As for Neville, his parents were both aurors which is no easy feat according to the books, so he too would have been quite smart. But based on what we know Ron got 6(or 7 been a while since I read the books.) we can assume Neville probably had about the same as they're both somewhat smart. So I think how they were raised and their attitudes played a big part in how why they got the grades they did. I feel Ron would have been the same were as Neville and Harry would have been smarter if they had their parents. But we'll never know!

There's a difference. If you did poorly in school, always forgot your password to the common room, had your family mail permission slips to your Head of House because they knew you'd loose them, do you think your teachers would have given you leadership positions from an objective point of view? Mine sure wouldn't. It doesn't matter what extenuating circumstances were. Neville did not show he was a good choice /at that point in time/.

We don't know who Neville would have been if he was raised by Alice and Frank. We know who he was with the life he was given. All the potential in the world doesn't matter if you don't live up to it in the moment. Do you really think Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore, when choosing prefects, thought "oh, in another life Neville could have been top student. He might have been Head Boy if Frank raised him. Let's make him the prefect". No. They looked at his performance and personality at that point in time and made a judgement call. Same as any teacher would do at a school.

Harry had every thing Ron did, above average grades, a school award, a few friends, we know he was at least friendly with Dean and Seamus. But more importantly Harry had leadership. Quidditch captain, he got Ron to believe in himself. In the DA he led a group of students to learn magic, including students older then him. He led a group of students against a group of Death Eaters. Granted this happened throughout 5th and 6th year, but based on what they knew of Harry, saving Hermione from the troll, fighting a Basilisk, chasing off dozens of dementors, they should have realized "Shit, Harry might be a pretty good leader! He's brave but reckless, and magically powerful but untrained." Yes he broke rules but for the most part Ron was right there with him. And for all we know Neville may have been the 7th year prefect since Harry and Ron were gone, but then again the prefects may not have "existed" that year. So yes as readers we have a bit more insight then Dumbledore and McGonagoll, but there's no valid reason to pick Ron when any of the boys that year could have been the prefect and it probably wouldn't have affected the outcome of the story.
