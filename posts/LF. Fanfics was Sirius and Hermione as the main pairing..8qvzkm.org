I absolutely do not want any time travel fic

Don't care either way about the length of the fan fiction.

Good enough grammar that I don't want to claw my eyes out.

May have a third person in the pairing.

Prefer no Ron angst/ hate, but will take what I can get.

The Vail being included in the fan fiction is a plus


** It's shocking to me how many people look down on this pairing because of the age gap but absolutely wet their fucking knickers at SSHG.

*** From what I have observed that street goes both ways, the sheer proportion of SBHG fanfiction that FF.N would have a field day removing is surprisingly large. Then again, SSHG has a dedicated website...

**** I love time travel fiction in general and avidly seek out anything even remotely pertaining to it (The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August, Mother of Learning, or even Live Die Repeat:The Edge of Tomorrow... all of which I would recommend, the first two more so than the weird movie). Unfortunately, within the fanfiction community, I was disappointed to note exactly that issue. Most, certainly not all, are very, very, similar.

-Goes back in time via Deus Ex Machina. -Is allowed to attend Hogwarts as a Student/Teacher for some Inane Reason. -Accidentally falls in love. -Goes back to the future. -Lover has waiting for them all that time. -Was a cannon rehash.

There have been quite a few that have gloriously defied those expectations, however, such as linkao3(The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) which by fanfiction standards was very well written and, at least in the moment, a lovely read. Everything really did pale in comparison to that one, however, at least in regards to the Sirius/Hermione trope. (I remember enjoying [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/#end][Roundabout Destiny]] as well.)

I wish I could offer something more to your standards, but my Sirmione binge was years ago and the only one that stood out was DoT. If you where looking for a Herus pairing (SSHG) then I could probably give you something... relevant... Best of luck on your search.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.
