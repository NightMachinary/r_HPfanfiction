*/DRAFT PROTESTERS MARCH ON DIAGON!/*

/Yesterday, November the Ninth, 1995, a group of nearly a hundred protesters gathered outside of The Leaky Cauldron, most notably a group in an old muggle military automobile with some sort of music player strapped to the roof. As the protestors began to march down Daigon Alley, the people in the automobile activated their music machine, playing muggle songs that some muggleborns in the alley recognized as music used to protest the Vietnam War. Such songs include Fortunate Son, a song about the poor regular man being sent to fight for the rich and powerful, For What It's Worth, a song about paranoia's effect on the population, and Eve of Destruction, a song about how the state of the nation's politics has put it on the, well, eve of destruction. The protesters marched from The Leaky Cauldron to Gringotts, where they entered the bank and demanded their galleons be exchanged for various muggle currencies, mainly the French Franc, the German Deutschmark, and the United States Dollar./

/This whole fiasco was caused by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge's order that any citizen of Magical Britain who is between the ages of fifteen and fifty-five, and who cannot pay the 150,000 galleon draft dodge fee (which was not advertised, and was only found after a mister James Holdt Meriwether of Barrow-in-Furness reported it to the press), are forced to join the DMLE, in a process similar to the muggle world's draft. These draftees would then be trained for 3 months (the normal auror training period is 8 months to 2 years, depending on ability and known spells), and given the designation of ‘Enlistee Auror', even though they did not enlist./

/There is currently a petition circulating around Magical Britain to have Minister Fudge impeached, though most people in the nation have decided the Ministry is too powerful and the Minister's power too absolute, and thus have decided to leave Britain until serious change has taken place. Both magical and muggle travel out of the Isles has increased by a large margin, with the seemingly most popular destinations being the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada./

/Only time will tell the true result of Minister Fudge's actions./

** Not to be that guy but I think the British were busy with their own Troubles at the time to care about the Vietnam war. Also a minister cannot be impeached but he may be ousted. And I don't think the draft is a thing in UK, it was called conscription to the National Service.
