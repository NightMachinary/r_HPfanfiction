I was reading some crossovers with Star Wars I had in the backlog(most weren't exactly good) and it got me thinking about how unbalanced things would be in a fight(keeping up with canon/believability) between Wizards and Force Users, especially if the Force users know how (most) Wizards depend on Wands.

They just have to reach out with the Force and break them. That's it.

An average Force user can do it, or just pull them away if they want to be more Jedi.

And that's not even talking about the Sith who would just start choking them.

I remember reading one where they blocked Force Lightning with shields, and I was thinking, 'just break the wands or disarm them', I don't think Wizards can enchant their wands, otherwise all of them would have unbreakable charms.

And even if we only count canon Material, Force users move so fast I can't see the above-average reflexes Wizards being able to react. Force user's reflexes are supernatural, able to predict attacks and read intentions.

I was thinking of trying the classic Harry finds Holocron but this time it's a red pyramid instead of a blue cube, but then, how to write him having any difficulty in fights once he learns the basics of the Force? Sure could go the Palpatine route and just play chess while everyone else is playing checkers, but meh.

Young Harry seems to be good material for the Sith teachings, though.


** Linkffn(havoc side of the force) does a decent job I think of a realistic fight between wizards and force users. Although if you haven't read it a word of warning its not finished and probably never will be.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** Tbf, a crossover where Harry is the weak one and has to get creative and adapt to his new world would be unusual and interesting. I'd certainly be into reading it, and I'm sure I can safely say from the usual comments on crossover posts/fics that other people would as well. :)

** I just find them so... repetitive, despite the direction the story-lines go.

It's almost always Force = Magic, Harry becomes a Jedi or a third element that disses both like some on high moral judge, and that magic stomps the Force or solves the galaxies problems (especially with fanon, tropey elements that are completely cringe-worthy).

*Yawn*.

Oh, and harems. Most are always goddamn harems.

No, I don't want to see Harry fuck Aayla Secura and Shaak-Ti just because they're female Jedi.

*** Revenge of the wizard mentioned in another comment would probably be the best by your standards if you are looking to read a SW cross. Its complete and has a new take on several of things you mention. It's set in the original trilogy era with NO harem component. (Magic and the force have a relationship to each other, but you would NEVER guess what DarthMarrs created that to be without reading.

*** Ah, yes, agreed.

I was thinking more of Harry spending his childhood learning from a Sith Holocron(could be Revan, Plagueis, Imperious), then mind tricking the Dursleys into being placid, learning the advantages of manipulation, finding out he has magic, going to Hogwarts, having some fun.

Then ending the war almost before it starts by preventing Voldemort from returning(maybe he imprisons the main essence with some Sith Alchemy).

He thinks he is very powerful, then goes into the Galaxy just at the beginning of the Clone Wars and finds out his competition is rather complicated.

He could be a Sith like Revan and/or LS Imperious be more interested in knowledge and his own goals than the destruction of the Jedi and being a sadistic villain like some other Sith.

*** I agree, they are all very good. However, there is only one complete in that list. Its unfortunate that the good writers don't seem to finish sw crosses.\\
If you like last second savior, you might also like linkffn(same song different verse by selector)

  Harry thought he had seen it all. As it turned out, not so much.
