Space and the planets is barely even touched in Harry Potter fanfiction, but if there are some out there, I'd love to read them! Do anyone know any?

I know the ones made by Burnable and of course a classic one with time travel, future muggle apocalypse and dementor powers. My favorites.


** I'm actually reading those right now and find them absolutely amazing. If you like those you might like "In The Mind of a Scientist" by ZenoNoKyuubi. It's also got a sequel that is a crossover with Stargate SG-1.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

** There is a search tag on AO3 that finds a few. The most famous/notorious Scientist Harry is HPMOR, which is a rather big departure from traditional HP fanfic and gets a bad reception from some around here. It has two sequels (by separate authors) with space travel, but it is in its own universe so to speak, so maybe it won't count for you.

HP and the Secret of Atlantis has some underwater travel in a stolen submarine. I'm still reading it and it is pretty good, though on the long side.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.
