I have seen more then my fair share of "Harry turnes Darkside" FFs. I'm now looking for the opposite, but that has proven itself difficult to find. I'd be happy with any recommendations you guys have. Pairings don't matter.

Thank you in advance!

** This is definitely a sideplot, but in linkffn(innocence) and its sundry sequels, there are two Dracos (Draco and . . .hydrus?), and Lucius decides one of them should be in gryffindor. After asking Snape for help, hijinx ensue. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's worth reading (innocence itself is 800k words and then there are two more books . . . and we're only at the end of CoS. But it's definitely my favorite storyline of the fic(s).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

#+begin_quote
  aq is some sort of word-connective word mostly used by turkish guys. it is basicly abbeveration of amina koyim, which i later learned that, means fuck you.

  But it became so popular and people started to use it for wider meanings.

  After a statement-expressive sentence, as an expression of being surprised, being angry, nervous, anxious, and almost all kinds of state-expressions.
#+end_quote

--------------

/For example, it can be used like;/

/It is too hot aq./

/Which converts the whole sentence to a whine. Or,/

/Aq you./

/This is the classic, so-known fuck you style./

/Yesterday, aq, i saw him heading to valencia./

/In this one, aq is just a connective phrase, nothing more, and nothing to be offended or truly intensive letter./

**** Yeah. Some of this fic feels kind of flat, especially now that we're at school and we're friends with the same people and the same plots are happening. Draco's evolution, for me, has been the bright spot of the fic. Just looking at the subtle nudges that move Draco from, you know, Draco, to a nice, clever, sardonic gryffindor.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) does this as a feature that is not central but is relevant to major plot points. Not everyone likes it, but I recommend the author's advice of trying the first 10 chapters before deciding whether to continue.
