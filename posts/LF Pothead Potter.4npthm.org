I recently read a fic where Harry got all tatted up and smoked lots of pot with Dobby and ended up getting with Daphne Greengrass. It was called Runic something or other.

Any other halfway decent fics where Harry is a pothead?


** I feel like you might get successful searching for Sprout and Longbottom fics with Harry as a character - after all, there's no way they spent all that time in the greenhouses just to chat to the flowers.

** I can remember one, I think it was called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Blazin Goblet).

For those who have not read it, it is linkffn(Runic Animagi by Kassien)

EDIT: Bot seems to be down. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][Here's a link to Runic Animagi]].
