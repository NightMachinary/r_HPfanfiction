This is going to be a really niche bit of Britpicking but as an Irishman in Scotland - it concerns something very close to my heart: swearing.

I think a lot of (presumably American) authors assume that "shite" is just the British form of "shit" - that's completely not the case.

Using "shite" instead of "shit" is softer and used a lot more by the Irish and the Scottish (I've heard some Geordies say it but even then, it sounds weird). It would make sense that someone like Seamus would say it. It's really immersion breaking to have characters like Harry and others brought up in England say it (especially those from southern England - people in affluent areas like Surrey are definitely the least likely to).

Even then, you don't hear a lot of people use it as a single expletive. You're more likely to hear something like "It's absolutely shite"

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVI-38LjaY][Anyway, here's Kevin Bridges chatting absolute shite]]

EDIT: I'm glad to see all of the Brits stand in solidarity with me on this. What we need now is a fic with Harry graduating and joining the Magical Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, learning how to deal with the media from [[https://youtu.be/qjKHPv7b3fQ?t=318][one of the greats]]


** To add to this, I'm Scottish and ‘shite' only gets used over ‘shit' in particular circumstances. We absolutely would never say ‘bullshite' which I have seen in fic and reads godawfully.

*** You're giving me flashbacks to a fic I read that is very obviously written by an American trying to sound British, and every instance of "shit" (even in "bullshit") reads like it was CTRL+F/CTRL+V find and replace'd in Google Docs. Same goes for the words "ass"/"arse", and "love"/"luv", so everyone sounds like the subtitle track of Eastenders turned up to eleven.

The end product is some of the worst, most repetitive, faux-British dialogue I've ever seen. The sentence structure and speech patterns are clearly American, with some random Brit-ified jargon scattered through to make it look "authentic".

***** Different use of contractions in UK and UK English.

- UK: "You'll not be needing that wand today, Potter."

- US: "You're not gonna need that wand today, Potter."

Different use of conjunctions:

- UK: "Deducting house points is my duty, as I am this year's Head Boy."

- US: "Deducting house points is my duty, because I am this year's Head Boy."

And some other things like "From whom"/"To which".

- UK: "And you received this information... from whom?" said Snape harshly, glaring at Hermione with beady eyes. To which Hermione could form no response.

- US: "Where did you get this information from?"

.

In general, getting that structure and syntax right makes British characters feel more British, and Hogwarts more like a timeless classic boarding school and not some TV high school with a Catholic uniform aesthetic. Good dialogue especially highlights certain characters - the well-educated, well-spoken, or the pompous wannabe intellectuals. Without the author having to drop it to the audience by straight-up saying, "Oh my god, Sansa, she's the smartest person I know!!!"

** Ah, but Hogwarts is in Scotland. Could the kids not pick it up from spending the better part of seven years there?

Also, it's perhaps a bit presumptive to assume all the subtleties of dialect are the same in the Wizarding World compared to the Muggle one. With wizards having access to fast methods of travel long before Muggles did, I'd expect regional variations in wizards' English to be much less present than in Muggles.

*** Those are both really good points. I've got some counter-points that might go some way to answer that (or - at least - explain my reasoning):

1. If we look at the rundown of characters and their backgrounds (both canon and community fanon), we aren't introduced to a lot of characters who we could definitely say are from Scotland. The main characters' backgrounds are placed in the south of England.

Considering Hogwarts takes in students from across the British Isles, I think of it more like an international school rather than a Scottish one (as there's no sign of a Scottish/Irish majority in students, teachers, portraits, or Centaurs)

And it's not like students are on the town anywhere other than Hogsmeade which, as is shown in canon with Aberforth, isn't definitely 100% Scottish (otherwise, considering how kids love to swear, Hogwarts should be filled with people with "shite patter")

1. I think this is a good point and my answer sort of leads on from my last one. Regional dialect variations are likely to be far more fluid. I think this is dependent on how cut off all of wizarding Britain is from muggles, though - with complete social and economic isolation unlikely (Muggleborns who might work in both worlds) but not impossible (considering how wizards are shown to dress in the muggle world).

However, considering the constant influx of Muggleborns (whose early life lacked such fast movement), I'd say that there would be slower drift towards homogeneity.

Add to that, the fact that the Wizengamot, Gringotts and the Ministry are located in London, I think (assumption based on UK currently) there would be more of a southern-centric focus and language would reflect that.

(I can't believe I'm doing this much sociolinguistic analysis just to back up this hill on which I am willing to die)

Don't underestimate how slow it would be, though. Something people often forget about is that Muggle-borns, while a not inconsiderable part of the population, are still clearly a minority. Most of the population's made up of some form of half-bloods.

***** On your second point, Hagrid isn't from Scotland. He's from the West Country and I imagine that he would be the only of the three who would swear openly (probably something soft like "wazzock" followed with a "I should not have said that").

And with Dumbledore, even if his background is Irish, I can't see him or any other staff swearing in front of the students.

With your first point, I concede that they're in the minority so you're right. However, I'm going back to the fact that it would be incredibly weird to hear someone with one of the accents found in the south to use shite. I still think that Hogwarts is so insular that, while you'd pick up words from the magical community (Merlin's balls, etc), accents would reflect dialect. And dialect still reflects social class so it's really unlikely that you have purebloods and muggleborns speaking the exact same way. And if there was more Scottish/Irish influence in how wizards speak, you'd not just have it in swearing. It would be weird, like someone saying "wee elf" in a RP accent.

Even if there is the (maybe unlikely) use of this dialect, it still has to be correct. The usage of shite as a singular replacement for shit isn't correct in every single situation - which is what I see in most fics when someone from the British Isles is swearing.

** What I will say is that swearing is so regional and generational. What I would say in Belfast wouldn't be the same as what my friends from Craigavon even though it's both Northern Ireland, but especially so noticeable when we moved to Somerset in England.

Feck is a fairly good example of a swear word I often hear used by older Irish family members but not so much by younger. Minger is a weird one because to be a minger (rhymes with singer) is to be ugly but to be a minge (rhymes with binge) is to be tighter than a ducks arsehole. Also arse? Not used as frequently as people seem to think. We have a lot of words for backside, including shuck (irish), khyber (for khyber pass, cockney thyming for ass), bum, buttocks, bollocks (surprisingly unisex around here) or even your jacksy.

Be mindful of where the person is from, find a decent comedian there if possible. That's my usual hack for getting down any sort of accent or preferred swearing. Rhod Gilbert losing it over a baked potato helped me hammer out a bit of a south-west Welsh one, for example.
