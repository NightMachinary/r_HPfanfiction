** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1010245]]) is just a straight up bashing fic. All in good fun but it's a genuinely, good laugh.

Every paragraph is great.

  Because no matter how much we may love it, nothing is without flaws. Contains mostly nitpicking, the occasional funny aside, and an in-depth questioning of some of the actions made by the supposedly responsible authority figures of Hogwarts.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter has achieved immense power, a large bit of craziness, and a desire to seek amusement where he can. This will be a series of stories of him traversing the multiverse solving problems through ways that amuse him. Various crossovers planned.
