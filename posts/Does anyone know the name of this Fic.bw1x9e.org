:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A few years ago I read a fanfic (I think it was on ff.net) where Harry Potter was some kind of martial arts assassin. The guy who trained Hary took him off the Dursleys doorstep and took him to somewhere Asian. He grew up there and learnt fighting stuff and a bit of magic. I remember all this, but not the title */sigh/*. Also. it later turned out that the guy who raised Harry was the one who really caught Grindelwald and he'd been commissioned by the queen to do so.
