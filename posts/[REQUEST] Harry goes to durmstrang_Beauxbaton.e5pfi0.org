*** If you do want to read it, do so on the DLP (Dark Lord Potter) forum; the version there has like 2 additional chapters if memory serves correctly.

Edit: to read it you'll have to make an account and make at least 5 constructive posts on the forum. Also see this Reddit thread ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4j1z10/harry_potter_and_the_boy_who_lived_on_dlp/]])

** Ill warn you ahead of time. I have been searching for these for years posting the occasional request here. I think I have seen a total of maybe 3-4 posted, none of which were that great. Its a very underserved genre, likely due to the effort required in world building a whole other schools environment AND characters.

I would suggest searching the subreddit for the threads that have requested it in the past if no one reponds with one (sorry i cant remember them).

Harry goes to Durmstrang for a while in this. Whole lotta OCs, but they're actually pretty good OCs. Like every fic by E.C Scrubb, it's angsty as all hell in the beginning, but it does get more fun later on.
