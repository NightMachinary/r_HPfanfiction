I am an avid fanfiction reader and was wondering if there is a one shot about the Marauders reuniting in the afterlife? Peter is there too but feels he doesn't deserve to be with them after everything, as he feels guilt and regret for betraying them. Despite Sirius' disapproval, they tell him to hurry up and join them, saying he has the rest of eternity to make up for his sins. I feel like someone had to have written it, but if not, I would probably write it if I have the time


** I *know* it exists. I remember reading. I have no idea where it's from, tho. Or if it's a fic on it's own or an ending to one. Hopefully you'll find it!

*** I remember a one-shot snippet that has Harry enter the afterlife where his parents, the Marauders, and Snape are waiting, along with a few other faces, and Snape is determined to not let it be a good time. Even as he's on the receiving end of pranks by James/Sirius/Remus

** There's one I know of that follows this idea, iirc. It's not just the Marauders though, but lots of people who died during the wars.
