Hello there, I was looking through several communities for a story where Harry lives with Sirius and he gets an invitation to a school for prodigies in Greece. Harry is a prodigy in several subjects and get his own quarters with merlin. There is a scene where he encounters Neville Longbottom and Hermoine Granger in Diagon Alley. If you know the fanfiction please send! Thanks!
