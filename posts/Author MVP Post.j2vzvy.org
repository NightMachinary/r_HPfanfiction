** Taure, though none of them are finished. Shezza and Bolshevik99 have at least five completed fics I enjoy.

Now that I think about it, most of the authors I like only have one or two really good fics. Enemebee comes close with four and Nuhhuh has three I like. Joe has three as well. Jbern has three. I'm not sure if that says more about me, the authors, or the nature of fanfiction.
