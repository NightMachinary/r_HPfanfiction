I remember reading this story a long time ago where Harry blows Dumbledore off and returns to the waitress he met in the tube station diner scene in the HBP movie. It's similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9566537/1/Ten-More-Minutes][this one]] but I think it was a one-shot. Probably a long shot, but I figured I'd see if anyone else has run across it. Thanks!


** Is it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7955675/1/When-I-Get-Off][When I Get Off]]?

** I wrote the one that's linked (Ten More Minutes), but I can totally see how the other author didn't think about writing "African American." We're pushed everyday into political correctness, afraid that we're going to offend someone. I might have even used it myself. Lay off a bit.

*** there are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-with-muggle-OC-paring/111052/3/0/1/0/0/0/0/][some]] which explore the Harry/muggle girl paring; but not as much I wish there were... and I never saw any that would have Harry/ muggle boy so far...
