I don't remember the title but I know quite a lot about the fic: The premise is Harry is immortal because he is Voldemort's horcrux. When he's with the Dursley's he wanders off into a death eater meeting and gets killed. He then wakes up in his own bed but it is about 3 weeks earlier. This continues throughout the fic, and each time he is killed his life is reset to a previous point, sometimes weeks and sometimes months. Eventually he tells dumbledore, who is horrified about what he's experienced. Can't recall anything else but I really want to read it again so any help would be appreciated. I read it on ffn


** This sounds like /The Many Deaths of Harry Potter/ linkffn(12388283).
