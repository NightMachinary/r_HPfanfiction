  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

**** For the fanfic-play Cursed Child, yes.\\
Ironically, one of the books actually describes Hermione as white ("her white face peeking out from behind a tree"), although she could very easily be mixed-race and just pale through shock/concern/worry.

Not that I give a Scabber's Derriere about it. The books are fun to read, that's what's important.

***** All you need to do is look at how Rowling described other black characters. Dean Thomas and Kingsley Shacklebolt are described as black in their first appearance, Angelina Johnson is described as black the first time she gets any description, Lee Jordan is described as having dreadlocks in his first appearance, etc. And then there's the names - Cho Chang, really? Rowling never left any ambiguity when characters weren't white.

  Usually when Harry came home from an Auror assignment everything would be normal. Occasionally, however, within minutes of walking through that front door his world changed completely - sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
