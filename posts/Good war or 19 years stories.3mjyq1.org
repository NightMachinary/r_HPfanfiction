As the title somewhat states, I'm looking for stories that give solid accounts of what may have occurred either at Hogwarts or with the Trio during DH. In addition, any stories that have a solid 19 years theme would be appreciated.


** For the nineteen years part, try any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird's]] fics.

For what happened at Hogwarts during DH, try linkffn(The Enigmatic Headmistress). It's not meant to be realistic at all, but aside from A Call to Arms, it's all I've got.

  Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting. Danger, sabotage and sex at Hogwarts for Ginny, Luna and Neville. Smut in every chapter. Rated M for mature themes, language, and all that good stuff.

** These are all a little AU or a different perspective about the 19 years, but have that as a solid foundation nonetheless.

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there!
