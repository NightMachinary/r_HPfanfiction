X-post from [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] because I'm interested in seeing how fanon has affected your views on the characters. Also because you lot are probably more invested in the series.

Who do you think was the better/worse person objectively? Whom do you like/dislike more personally?


** Snape was worse. He made Harry suffer through school, tried to kill Lupin and Black by dementor's kiss, slagged off Neville and Granger, and was generally shit. Not forgetting how he screwed Harry with occlumency training but had a hissy fit when Harry saw his memories. He was an adult and theoretically one of the good guys, should have known better.

Draco was a twat and deserved to die a slow horrible death but he was raised to be a twat and he genuinely believed he was doing the right thing. And he was a kid for some of it which diminishes his responsibility. (Did he torture Dobby? I can't recall.)

*** I'm a little tired of the kid defense. I'm not judging him for running off his mouth, but he was 16/17 when he pulled off his most egregious acts (HBP). Also "he's a kid" just implicates his parents too, it doesn't let him off the hook.

***** So, basically, he is Dudley whereas Snape is Vernon.

**** I completely agree which is why I only said his kid stuff diminishes some of it. Getting Buckbeak killed because it shows off how powerful his dad is and how he got one over on his half-breed teacher I can see if he's a kid. Trying to kill Harry in the RoR when he's after the diadem is a serious dick move.

** What do you mean, objectively? By what objective criteria? By what measure of "worse"?

Since you didn't specify, for me it's Draco. Snape is an awful person, but he's a, well, brave sort of awful person, the sort of awful person that doesn't back down from their awfulness. Draco is a coward, and for all he's praised (or excused, whatever) for not being able to kill Dumbledore point blank, he's a coward that nearly killed Katie Bell, he's a coward that nearly killed Ron, he's a coward that led Death Eaters right into the heart of Hogwarts, putting other children at risk because he was too squeamish to do the nasty himself. Seriously what the fuck was that.

*** Draco did do these things but he did them under the threat of torture or death if he failed to perform the task he was assigned by Voldemort. He never had a choice to be a Death Eater or not. Snape made that choice, and killed people willingly until the person he loved became the next target of his Master.

He spied on Dumbledore and immediately ran to Voldemort to tell him what he heard, regardless of the consequences for the people involved in the prophecy. He even tells Dumbledore that he has tried to ask Voldemort to spare Lily's life in exchange for her son's. If that's not despicable, I don't know what is.

He was also a bully who seemed to enjoy terrorizing his students, not to mention the way he treated Harry in particular, just because of his name and resemblance to his father.

And when he did all that, he was an adult, contrary to Draco in the books.

*** Agreed. Snape is a terrible bitter person, who I'd sure as shit never send a christmas card to. But the things that made you truly hate him were ultimately done for a good purpose which makes them somewhat grayer.

Draco on the other hand, what was his most redeeming feature? Not being a complete coward once in his life? Not because of any implied change of character, but because he didn't have the guts to stand by his beliefs. He's a pathetic bully no more, no less.

** SNAPE - no questions asked!

Snape should have been an adult and should have let go of his childish grudge years ago, the fact that he literally tortured Harry (those Occlumency-Lessons! Not to mention all the other awful things, like wanting to get Sirius caught or showing Harry that his dad was a bully (what an awful thing to do to an orphan IMHO - it would have hurt nobody if Harry continued to think that his dad was the paragon of virtue that he believed him to be!) etc. etc.) tells us what an awful human being he is. Despicable really!

Draco is an asshole, sure, but he's also a teenager and has been indoctrinated by his parents (and their friends and the children of their friends) from the day he was born! Sure he should have questioned it, but then again: So few religious people question faith if they've been indoctrinated as chidlren (that's why I am against this exact thing - I don't know how to stop it, but I am against filling young minds with religious drivel...let them decide if they want to believe, don't force it on them when they are too young to defend themselves...in a way that's mental-rape/brainwashing!), so maybe that's to be expected...still he should face punishment for his crimes and not get off scott free!

** Snape. Draco is an asswipe when in middle/high school the way many people are. He was brought up to beleive in certain politically-racial ideologies and despite that seems to have turned a new leaf in adulthood.

Snape was a bitter, vindictive, creepily-obsessed man who couldn't let go of the past and took it out on children many decades younger than him

** Snape. He was genuinely dark, was malicious throughout his school years. He is some guy whom I'd never let to near students if I were headmaster. He was by far worst teacher among regular. His bias towards Slytherin unprecedented.
