Colubrina (popular fic: Green Girl) and ArtemisGirl (popular fic: New Blood) both update at the exact same time. I get the emails within minutes of each other upon waking up on Tuesday and Friday mornings. Proof: [[http://imgur.com/gallery/dGhKgW4]]

Supporting evidence:

‚Ä¢ They both love Hermione

‚Ä¢ They have politicking 12 year olds

‚Ä¢ They like plot twists

‚Ä¢ Luna is a much more main character than in the books

‚Ä¢ I don't have any more evidence ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Discuss my conspiracy theory

UPDATE: they are not the same person, ArtemisGirl contacted me directly and I almost fainted. Holy dear jesus.


** This theory is hilarious and hysterical and amazing all at once. It's entirely incorrect, but it's hysterical to me.

Colubrina has been a major player in the Harry Potter fandom, especially in Hermione-centric spaces (ex. Granger Enchanted), for YEARS. Her fic /Rebuilding/ is the #1 most reviewed Harry Potter fanfiction of all time. She is very, very well known. She has a tumblr, I believe, where people can message her directly.

I, by contrast, have dicked around in the Harry Potter fandom for ages, but only became a recognizable Big Name Author‚Ñ¢ with /New Blood/, which has found a lot of popularity.

If I were secretly Colubrina, Colubrina would, essentially, be competing with herself for most reviewed HP fanfic, as /New Blood/ is getting up their in the numbers. And she has no need to do that at all, given her popularity and fanatic following.

I read /Green Girl/, /The Muddy Princess/, and /Lady of the Lake/ from Colubrina before I started /New Blood/, along with a dozen other Slytherin!Hermione fics (/Applied Cultural Anthropology/, most notably, which was my main inspiration and broke my heart when it was abandoned). I enjoyed them, but they all veered a little too OOC for my tastes, many with a little too Dark!Hermione. So I started writing my own.

I am highly amused to hear that someone thought we might be the same person. Our writing styles are /very,/ very different, hahaha. I am vaguely flattered(ish), but I suspect Colubrina might be offended, hearing such a thing.

I kind of hope someone asks her on her tumblr just to see how she would respond.

*Vague proof of identity in my inbox*: [[https://imgur.com/a/xjDYI5g]]

(which, admittedly, we /did/ update very close in timing today. I suspect she probably just updates as soon as she gets to work, similar to me?)

*Spoiler from Friday's* */New Blood/* *chapter as proof of identity*: Cedric's lesson about compatible magic left Hermione wondering. Not so much about compatibility, but about magic itself.

She remembered over the summer, her difficulty with wandless magic lay within her magic having a strong identity as hers, and when she'd meditated on it, it had felt more like her magic was her than just part of her -- like without her magic, she wouldn't be a person at all.

*** Poke me if you want me to change from updating on Tuesdays. It was a random day for me and if it's at all bothersome I'm happy to change. And I've only got about 8 or 9 chapters left before I'm done with this thing. Happy to shift if you like :)

** I got told about this on twitter, and this is really awesome and hilarious and flattering, but I am not both me and ArtemisGirl! (and also, I am MUCH too lazy to write a 600,000+ word fic! That's an actual epic!!)

I just update on Tuesday whenever I get around to it, so the timing this week was happenstance. New Blood sounds fabulous, and I hope it overtakes Rebuilding in the review count soon :)

*** You flatter me :D

/New Blood/ is very long. Should you ever return to reading HP fanfiction, I recommend reading it in chunks, like one book or half a book at a time. I have reasonable chunks suggested on the A/N on Chapter 1, because I'm well aware that it's too long and insane, but I'm having too much fun writing it and don't care~ :D;

And /Rebuilding/ will stay in the top spot for a while and won't be overtaken anytime soon, haha. Not for a year or two at least, at current rates :)

** Nah. That theory is small-time. The real tea is this: There's only one author in the Harry Potter fandom.

There's only readers, and then one writer, sat in a basement under a log cabin in the middle of nowhere in Canada, hopped up on Monster Energy and typing. Always typing. And they write enough words that it actually has an effect on the universe (the illuminati saw to that) and can time travel unconsciously so they finish all their updates - it's like how every electron is really just one electron moving real quick-like. Every writer posting in forums and things claim they exist, but really they're just Black Box AI programs designed by the CIA to keep us living in cities so the 5G Towers can reach us and control our minds. Maintains their investment in the Canadian Basement Person.

That's why some fics just stop and never get finished - the timespace continuum demands it, and then the CIA AIs crash. :)

...

Wowzers. If I could play an instrument 'Canadian Basement Person' would totes be the name of my Indie Folk-Techno Band. :D

** On the other hand, what sort of crazy person writes two chapters per week? And even if they did, why would you post them on the same day? Surely posting them on different days would allow them to get more attention, especially if they are likely to have the same audience due to having the same ship or something.

They might have both independently decided that Tuesday at a certain time was a good time to update. Or they could be friends who decided to update at the same time. Or they could be the same person. ¬Ø\/(„ÉÑ)//¬Ø

*** It's Tuesday and Friday. And it used to be monday/wednesday/friday. Within freaking 10 minutes of each other. 10 minutes is just enough time to log out, log into new account, attach new chapter, check formatting, and post.

They're very different writers though. A lot of similar elements, different writing style. Different ships. Draco is characterized very differently. Hermione is grey in New Blood and dark in a lot of Colubrina. But both also feature Theodore Nott as a more complex and detailed character.
