I have a 27 hour car ride, ( taking place over two days) coming up this winter and I want to start making a list of fanfiction to read.

They dont have to be your favorite just things you think are worth the time reading! Short Long Stright Gay Crossover Au Anything!!!!!!


** Hmm... So You Want A Long Fic...

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is quite a long series, book 5 is in progress. Sirius escapes five years early and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. I like it because it's focused on the characters, who have both strengths and weaknesses, not on any secret Black family magic or just fixing everything from canon.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) sounded a bit ordinary/pedestrian when I first saw the premise, but it's actually a very rich and deep AU, lots of excellent world building and exploration of magic (especially potions and mind magic). Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, and now Harriett Potter has both her parents alive, along with "uncles" Sirius and Remus, but as a half-blood, she isn't allowed at Hogwarts. And worse restrictions are coming.

And for a laugh, I recommend linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). Lots of one-liners, great Snape redemption arc.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
