** In one of those "harry magically appears in azkaban" stories, a house elf starts bringing food and stuff. What I'd like to see is where said house elf gets Harry and Sirius out of Azkaban.

*** Ah man, when I was into the whole Harry was betrayed and sentenced to Azkaban phase, I do remember reading a story where Dobby showed up after Harry randomly called (I think Harry called him as a joke, not expecting it to work), and he ended up escaping, I can't remember what the story's name was, though.

  Sirius Black was shocked to find someone bouncing on his Azkaban bed. Who would dare? A baby Harry Potter, of course. Join Sirius as he finds a way to escape prison, raise Harry in the muggle world, & deal with the whole horcrux/soul shard thing before Harry's attacked by the Dark Nutter again. Who can help our intrepid hero? A few goblins, a few muggles, and Aberforth. Of course!

  AU Complete. Sirius is suffering in Azkaban with 4 yr. old Harry, but not for long. Harry needs to go to Hogwarts. What about the Dementors and house elves? What about Remus? Can certain secrets be kept? Can Harry be kept safe?

** I love it, when fics show Snapes reaction to some of the stuff the trio have been up to. Either through one of them telling him, or him being told through others...

“Headmaster, I am worried about the theft from my storage-“

“Severus, now I don't think we need to worry at the moment. It seems like Ms. Granger is proceeding with the children's Polyjuice Potion project just fine. Although I have been wondering once again, a Potionsclub would certainly be a nice addition to the schools extracurricular program. What do you think, can I convince you?”

** I love seeing Ron get his own thing going in fics where he's no longer friends with Harry. Fics where rather then turning him into a caricature of a moron, the author gives Ron a little bit of screen time with his own progression and improvement, be it training, studying or even just accomplishing stuff in quidditch. Hell, I remember a fic where Ron left Hogwarts after his fifth year to become a professional chess player. He was only ever mentioned via letters or Harry hearing about his achievements, but it was a lovely subplot and an interesting way to get Ron out of the way.

*** Oh I totally agree with that. Sometimes it's in fanfiction like: You can either be friends with the hero or you can be a villain. All the drama in fanfics when Ron isn't Harrys friend is ridiculous.

Ron is not a moron. He would have done fine without Hermione and Harry. Different, maybe, but he is not a lazy failure like people want to portrait him.

** I'm always for reading fics where Harry Interacts/befriends/has for a pet/is raised by/falls in love/whatever with a magical creature/being

Magical creatures (or Creature!someone) are something that I feel add magic to the HP world. Magic that sometimes I feel it lacks.
