I can't seem to find a fic I read a while back (and I'm starting to think I made up that memory).

I think Harry lived in Potter Manor for a while but parents are still dead. On the first train ride to Hogwarts, Hermione didn't realize she was wearing robes that supported a faction and wanted a different color so Pansy gave her a spare. Then after her sorting, she curtseyed to Harry in front of the entire school, making a statement.

If any could give me the title or link, I would be forever thankful.


** I've been looking for this fic for ages so I hope somebody finds it!!!
