:END:
Harry will be called the chester king or smth, with Ginny as a necromancer, Neville as a Water lordy and the enemies are surpisingly Hermione and Ron, who sought refuge in Durmstrang. Its not a short fanfic but not thaaaat long either.


** Pretty sure it's not [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15432591][Shadow Magic]] by Lomonaaeren. But it's the only one I know where Harry has Shadow powers
