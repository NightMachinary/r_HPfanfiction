We all know that Rowling wants us to think that using magic to take over the world is evil... but the alternative she provides is equally horrifying. What do these wizards who have the ability to alter reality do with their amazing power? They work as train conductors, pamphlet makers, and dishwashers.

I'm looking for anything where magic is used to its full effect. World domination, assassination, healing, anything. I know this is a broad request, but feel free to contribute anything you think fits. Magical exploitation, muggle/wizard relations, and alternative dimension fics welcome.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] is a good one for world domination.

*** While it certainly fits within the genre that the author is asking for, the story as such wasn't a good one. Especially after the whole emperor thing.

** There was a Hermione/Snape fic I read a while back where Hermione ends up making a bunch of potions to market to muggles and renting out a huge warehouse for production, but she's overwhelmed by the orders so she brings Snape in to help her out. He freaks out and explains to her why what she's doing is a horrible idea. I tried to look for it but I couldn't find it, maybe if it's something you're interested in you'll have better luck?
