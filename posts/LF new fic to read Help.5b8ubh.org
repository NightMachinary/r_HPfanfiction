** I've never heard someone unironically like Harry Crow before. You should maybe stick with more robst and then the fic Partially Kissed Hero.

They're not very good, but you might like them.

*** I like Harry Crow and a lot of Robst's other stuff as well. Just scratches a certain type of fanfic itch for me.

I really don't know what was going through his head with that one. Robst certainly isn't my favourite author, but he has some fics that I enjoyed (Don't look back in Anger for example). But Harry Crow is just so over the top with everything, it's not even funny... with this snot-nosed 11 year old Harry in Goblin armor strutting through Hogwarts and showing everyone their place. If Robst had been more self-aware while writing that one it might have been excellent as a sort of parody/crackfick.

** You need to put something between the fics your mentioning, I can barely tell what is what.

** For a good, very well written short, try linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont).
