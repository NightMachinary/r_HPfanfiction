Hello, My Name is M.

​

I am currently writing a well received outside my poor writing ability due to honestly writing disability. it is on Four sites, and has over 70 thousand views, Over 130 reviews <most which basically say great story but you need a beta>.

​

The Story is Dark inheritance from your enemy.

synopsis

A Realistic take on Harry gaining the knowledge and powers of the Horcrux during the beginning of the fifth year. Watch as a Harry with an adult life's knowledge and the power to match who knows who goes through school and the war. Planned, thought out and manipulative but caring Harry. Grey/dark but not evil. Pairings will come organically and based on the story. At start Fully cannon up to graveyard scene.

​

​

At 6 posted chapters it is over 50k words, with last few hitting around 11-13k a chapter.

​

It is a Minor crossover <As in i am Using the Endless from Dc/Vertigo Ala Death, and her siblings may show up as i always found the character fascinating>

​

I have enough notes, plans and chapter outlines to continue through this year of the arc <which ends in chapter 30 or so> and into the next.

​

The story contains currently sex, dream sex, mind manipulation.

​

With time : Abuse, Extreme Violence/torture<not fully described to all gruesome detail but enough it may be a lot for sensitive readers>. Rape, Death/ Character are all planned

​

and May Happen: Suicide <this one is possible, not in plans but i write organically as said> some more heavy fetishes/kinks not off the table Incest,magic used in sex, and gender swap/shape shifting sex

​

the death eaters will be more skilled and do more horrendous things, but same point I plan show their more human side at times. < I for example already have shown how Lucius and Narcissa are caring parents even if racists>.

​

No specific character will be bashed.

​

​

The Goal is to get 1-2 chapters out a Month starting middle of January. I can easily give a good beta the 10-13k biweekly and give them a week to read it.

​

anyone Interested or Know anyone who maybe. Please reply :)

** Would you be able to listen to criticism from the beta or would they be a simple spellcheck?

*** I would listen both ways. though i do have any idea where a few plot points are going. over all and wouldn't mind sharing them with the beta so they could see if its about the story.

​

as for learning to write better I am trying . I actually work on a topic weekly in my personal limited time, and the writing is improving from chapter to chapter, and been cleaned up.. you should have seen it before i worked on control of some tenses, and using conversations and showing, instead of telling.

​

I do not mind at all improving my craft. But people need understand I do have issues which can make it difficult

** I cannot possibly be the only person on here who despairs to see a work which is self-avowedly badly written and unbetaed get more attention and encouragement than many works which are finished, edited, betaed and polished.

I imagine this is why we see so many complaints that it's hard to find well-written fics. It's because bad writing gets more appreciation so good writers aren't going to hang around. Which is a crying shame.

Also if anyone is thinking of offering to beta this, do have a look at it first. As it is, it's not ready to beta.

*** I appreciate your opinion, and many have different tastes. I myself enjoy a lot of good fictions and some others will dislike.

​

My self avowed badly written fic, is partly due to a issue i have as i admit :) and please comment more. I understand you do not like my writing style. do you have any good recommendations for me to read? I always enjoy reading.

*** you do not have to, but you could to see how i write and the basic grammar issues i have.

​

I use Microsoft word, and check the work through it and Grammarly. the main issue is tense, and some use of verbs and more in general. youll see. the story is on any of the following four

​

An Archive of our Own, Hentai Foundry, Hp fanfictions and [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]].

​

The next chapter is only half written as i dealt with a lot from start of November till now, but would be ready to ready a little after Xmas.

**** Sure. I'll help you out. Are you open to working with Google Docs or will emailing word documents back and forth be required? I'm fine either way, Docs is just much better for collaboration.

** One thing to consider as you search for a beta to work with, and perhaps you already have this in place;

Grammerly. This app, with a bit of dictionary addition is a life saver.

*** thanks for the comment.

I do use grammarly and often all my chapters pass through it with a few instances of passive voice left.

My issue is i suffer from some stuff. And i don't realize when i write how the tenses, and other grammar rules are being broken in the writing cause my mind Sees them as right and fixes them for me.

so i sometimes use the different tenses in same paragraph or area, or use the wrong words.vowels or spellings cause my mind thinks it fits.

this is also my first writing piece in over a decade, so outside quick to point emails for running buisnesses irl, I havnt had to really write in this professional way, just entertainment online for last ten or so years.
