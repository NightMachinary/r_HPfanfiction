First, Sirius shipped into Azkaban. Regardless of Potter's got crucio-ed, it's highly unlikely that Sirius would go to Azkaban. Even if Sirius realizes that Warmtail betrayed them, the canon scenario of why Sirius was shipped to Azkaban unlikely to happen. Infact, I think it's unlikely that Peter became deatheater if Potter's weren't Voldemort's primary target. Potter's and Sirius getting crucio-ed together is likely situation than Sirius going to Azkaban. It is an interesting question in a non-bwl Harry situation, if Peter didn't become a deatheater during first war and Potter's survive, would he become deatheater during 2nd war?

Second, Snape was a potion teacher. If Neville were Voldemort's primary target, it's very unlikely that Snape would run to Dumbledore. The only reason Snape became potion teacher and took an unbreakable oath was to save Lily's son.


** Huh. The second point is actually interesting, in the sense that I haven't even seen it done in 15 years of FF. Probably because from a writing perspective, Snape is just a great character, and you want him at Hogwarts.

You can, of course, always spin this so both work -- maybe Voldemort decided, in order to be on the safe side, to kill both, and started with Neville; nothing in Snape's motivation would change, then. And Sirius can always be set up in some other way.

But you are right, strictly just doing the Harry-Neville swap, Snape has no motivation to do anything, and Sirius will be raising Harry, after James and Lily end in St Mungo's.

** I think the Peter and Snape things can be explained because the Potters and the Longbottoms were both Voldemorts primary targets it's just that in canon he found the Potters first because of Peter

*** Or that they waited to find the Potters and strike both at the same time, take down both candidates

** For your first point, Peter had been Voldemort's spy for a year before "betraying" the Potter, so before Trewalney's prophecy. He became a Death Eater because it looked like Voldemort was going to win and he is an opportunist, not because Voldemort pressured him to find the Potter's location.\\
As long as the Potter are "taken out" (dead, vegetative in St Mungos, obliviated . . .), it is not unlikely for the Canon events to happen again, though I admit it is a bit boring to always use this same plot (especially Since Sirius always escape in 3rd year even though he doesn't see Scabbers in the Daily Prophet).

For your second point, Voldemort never anounced a "primary target". Snape went to Dumbledore because Lily was a potential target, not a primary one. Nobody knew who Voldemort would attack before he went to Godric's Hollow. In a Neville BWL universe, Snape would have less reason to become the potion master, or to protect Harry (who should have less people wanting to kill him), but he would probably still be Dumbledore' spy.

I've always wondered about this in every Neville-BWL, also Snape being hateful to Neville for no reason..

In one of these fics with Evil!Potters , Sirius is still sent to Azkaban because .. Potters are evil and that's how it is..

** Yeah, the Snape one has always bothered me too. I also question if Harry would end up at the Dursley's at all, even if the Potter's & Sirius were out of the picture.

If Neville is the BWL then Dumbledore would be focused on him and Harry's custody arrangements would probably end up in the hands of the Ministry. I reckon it would be more likely that a distant magical relative from the Potter's side would agree to take him. In fact, even if the Ministry approached the Dursley's about custody they would have said no, and I think the Ministry rep would have accepted that.

*** I lean towards probably not. If he's not the boy who lived, then there's no blood protection issue, so no reason for Dumbledore to put his full weight behind sending Harry to the Dursleys. He most likely ends up with a distant magical relative or one of the family's allies.
