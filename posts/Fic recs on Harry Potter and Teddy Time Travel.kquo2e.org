Preferable long and well-written. If possible not slash.

Fic I've recently read is Laughing All the Way to London. Thank you.


** If it's just Teddy Time traveling you can try Teddy's Excellent Adventure by ReluctantSidekick

Linkffn(13021745)

If it is Harry and Teddy time traveling you can try The Disorder of the Phoenix by JacobApples (aka AppoApples) though the story linked is a rewrite. It seems he deleted his previous version. In this story Harry, Teddy,band Andromeda are brought back in time from 7 years after the war to Harry's 5th year.

Another Harry and Teddy time travel from the same author is called Laughing all the Way to London. Where Harry and Teddy are brought back in time to the Marauder's Era

** You have to read into the Arena. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680]])

It breaks me. Absolutely breaks me. Teddy is completely adorable I love him with my whole heart. He wears the goggles and has a bag and oh my God I love him. It's funny and cute and you'll bawl your eyes out at the Grimmauld place chapter.

It's decently long. Very very well written. Somewhat unfinished but it rounds itself off ok enough. But please. Please read it!! It's so good!! And Teddy is so so good I just, oh he's amazing. it's worth it just for Teddy

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...
