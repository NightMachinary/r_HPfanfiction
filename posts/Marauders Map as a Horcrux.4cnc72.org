Anyone. Seen anything like this other than the short one shot that pops up every now and again? Would you want to?


** I'm going to assume linkao3(Cartographer's Craft) had something to do with your question.

But aside from that, I haven't come across any 'the map is a horcrux' stories.

I'd love to read some though. I'd love to read about the Marauder's deep, dark secret. About how they are actually /incredibly/ dark wizards, hiding among the lions of Gryffindor. Half of them already fit, Remus the dark creature, and Sirius comes from a dark family.

***** No, JK has confirmed a while ago that's not true in her text about the potter family, but the fanbase seems to have mostly ignored it because they really like the idea of Sirius and James being cousins +which i think it completely undermines their friendship and is somehting i always hated since before it was proven false and still don't know why people cling to that idea but hey that's a talk for another day+ , so you can do that if you want.

********* Presumably the filmmakers took it all from [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/blackfamilytree.html][this family tree that JKR wrote]] so if you consider Word of God to be canon then it is. (Or at least, the existence of those people is canon, as is the fact that they had one son, so there's plenty of arguent for them being James' parents.)

But then, if you take that tree for canon you also have to accept that Sirius' grandfather had his first child at the ripe old age of... 13. (jfc I've looked at this thing a lot of times before but I only just noticed those dates, wtf.)

** Ooh. Oooohhh. /Whose/ horcrux? Are we talking Voldemort somehow inexplicably made the map into a horcrux, or are we talking about a fic where the marauders themselves aren't really fully dead because part of them lives on in the map? Like Harry reflecting back on destroying Voldy's horcruxes and thinking about Riddles diary and then suddenly remembering it's not the only magical item he had that someone from the past used to talk to him.

I like the idea.

I haven't read any fics with it in them so I have none to recommend.

**** The one big flaw with it though would be that Remus and Sirius would know about it when they find out Harry has the map in PoA and would know James could be brought back.

Unless there was a way that they didn't realise they had done it. Maybe someone died in an accident with Remus at the full moon, and it happened to be the day before they created the map, not really knowing that the spell they were doing to enchant it was capturing parts of their souls - if they did the spell all together then maybe it would be enough for only one of them to have killed someone, even unintentionally. It could be possible that Remus didn't even remember the accident happening, especially if them creating the map predates them becoming animagi and/or sneaking out to join him for full moons (which would make sense).

***** I was thinking they didn't understand how it worked. So when James died, clearly they fucked up and did it wrong. Or maybe Remus kills someone and they all feel responsible for letting him out and try the spell, then they assume it didn't work since maybe that doesn't count as murder for the spell. The one shot linked here just has them being trashed when they try it.

Alternatively that could be when the story starts but I kinda like the idea of them slowly taking over other students.

****** It would be interesting to explore the idea of the marauders' soul fragments influencing Fred and George in their time in Hogwarts. I feel like they had a closer connection to the map than Harry did really, I can imagine them talking to it and trying to get the map to make jokes with them and becoming attached.

Edit: Also, because I'm in a very Regulus mood lately, this has suddenly got me wondering if it's possible to make a horcrux where the murder/sacrifice is yourself. Imagine Regulus swapping out Voldemort's horcrux locket with a locket destined to be his own horcrux as he let himself be dragged into the water by the inferi.

****** I just thought of another idea about how this could have worked - Sirius put the spell on the map intentionally in their sixth year, to try to bind a part of all of their souls to it (maybe he had read about it while they were researching how to become animagi - it wouldn't be the first illegal ritual they enacted), and he had planned to use Snape as their sacrifice, which was why he had sent him into the shrieking shack. Except it didn't work because James had saved him, so Sirius figured the spell hadn't worked, and he never bothered to tell the others about it and hadn't thought about it again himself. Except at this point, they're all sixteen or seventeen, which happens to be an age that we know some students were becoming Death Eaters at the time - and it's not unreasonable to think that Peter Pettigrew was already working for Voldemort, and possibly already killing on his behalf. So maybe Sirius had gone through the spell/ritual but thought it failed because none of them killed anyone - but one of them had, or did shortly afterwards.
