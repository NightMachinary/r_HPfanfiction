A very annoyed upperclassman decides to beat said character up.


** I remember reading a really dramatic oneshot where Harry bought a guitar into the great hall and sang a whole my chemical romance style song about how much the weasleys, hermione, dumbledore, and the school had wronged him. it ended with him cooly swinging his guitar to his back and walking out of hogwarts, leaving the rest of the school gobsmacked at how OWNED they all were. mesmerising.

*** As he entered the great hall, all students and teacher alike turned their heads. One particularly bright first year student noticed that the great Harry Potter was carrying a guitar.

''Oh, oh, oh, how much have you wronged me!, oh, Hermioooneee, i cannot become cleeeever witouht upstettiiing you! Ron is a prat, and he knooows it, dumbledoor can eeeaat a door!! Thank you.''

As he walked out, the whole great hall population thought it was fantastic that the boy who lived could be so

** It's always been something of a disappointment to me that nobody but the Golden Trio and Neville ever take Draco to task for the shite he spews out his gob on a regular basis. You'd think one of the upperclassmen, from any house, would have given him a good kicking by second year at the latest.

***** I'm not even talking Slytherins, /any/ of the houses.

I mean, picture being a black senior in high school. Some psycho strings up the caretaker's cat, and the mouthy rich kid goes "Hah! You're next, n*****s!" And the teachers do squat about it, because they're probably prejudiced AF, too.

You just gonna roll your eyes and say "frigging rich kids"? Or the next time Mouthy McShitestain is out and about with his bookends, are you going to string him up by his underwear?

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
