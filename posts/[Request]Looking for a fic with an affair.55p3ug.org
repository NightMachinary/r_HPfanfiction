  Is it 3/4 or 2/4 marriages that end in divorce? It didn't matter, because no matter how adulterous Ron and Hermione were going to be throughout their "perfect" marriage, they weren't going to split up, no matter how much of a disaster their anniversary turned out to be. The tabloids would simply relish in it. Written for Week 4 of the Lottery Ticket Challenge. Adult themes.

  It was on the tip of Pansy's tongue to tell Weasley to beat it, that she was not so far fallen that she'd shag the likes of him, but, then, she began to think seriously about what sleeping with Weasley would mean. Soon enough, he would sober up, come to his senses, realize what he had done, and then... Pansy grinned in anticipation for what he would promise for her silence.

** The hottest Draco/hermione I've read is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/172217][The Wrong Man]]. It's really really great PWP although there's a bit of plot there too. Linkao3(172217)

  A man who looked very much like Draco Malfoy walked into Hermione's office, brandishing a piece of parchment and a pitch-perfect insult. That would have been right before she grabbed him by the front of his robes and dragged him inside, silently thanking her husband, the inventors of Polyjuice potion, and anyone else who might have had a hand in making her secret fantasy come to life for Valentine's Day. That also would have been one hour and fifteen minutes ago.7,000 words. Draco/Hermione, background Ron/Hermione. NC-17. Explicit infidelity. Written for dysfuncentine, a comm that deliberately wanted dysfunctional relationships for Valentine's Day. Keep that in mind when reading. ;) February 2011.
