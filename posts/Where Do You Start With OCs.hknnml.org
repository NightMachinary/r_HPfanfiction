Where do you typically like to start both as a writer and a reader? I'd like to create an OC at Hogwarts after the war, but writing an 11 year old seems very tricky and I'm not really sure much interesting would happen in their first few years.

Is it jarring to start a brand new character in their 5th or 6th year?

Edit: My question might have been misunderstood. I mean where in the timeline do you prefer (as reader and writer) to start with your OCs? Straight from 1st year at Hogwarts? From the middle?


** Okay so here's my two cents. Starting early seems to make sense because kids start Hogwarts at 11. But trying to come up with an engaging plot is really difficult, and well, kids can be hard to write for adults. Starting later is easier, but then you have to come up for a believable reason for your character entering Hogwarts so late in the game. All that being said, I prefer older OCs because I'm closer in age to them, so it's easier to write/relate to them. Hope this helps?

*** You wouldn't even need to come up with a reason for the character to enter Hogwarts as an older student unless you wanted them to be a newcomer for plot reasons. There's no reason that an OC couldn't have been going to Hogwarts all along, and we only start following them when the story gets interesting. We don't really need to see a sorting and experience all of the wonder of magic again --- we already saw all of that in canon.

Starting at the interesting part can be a much more powerful tactic than starting at the beginning.

**** Yes that's very true! I misinterpreted the question, and thought it said that they were starting Hogwarts at 5/6th year.

**** Really depends on the OC. If you want them having any real friendship with important canon characters then you'd need to start earlier as it would likely change a lot, whereas if you just want to tell the tale of an OC who never really spoke to the canonical main cast then you can jump right in.

** I support myself through writing, so when I'm writing a fanfic with OCs (I actually have a HP one set in modern day USA that is all OCs) I simply approach it like I would when writing an original work. I give them personalities and motivations that make sense. They aren't (consciously) based off anything but my imagination, and when writing in a fandom I purposely stay away from major similarities to a canon character.

(Just saw your edit.) Personally I started my fic shortly after the characters graduated. They're fully fledged young adult wizards making their way in the world. School fics can be great, but I honestly think it's a lot more fun to explore the world from a new perspective, especially with OCs. It would be hard to write a school fic without falling into the same plot devices as canon. I'm also not sure I would enjoy writing an 11 year old that much, at least not if it was realistic. Realistic 11 year olds are honestly kind of extremely annoying and dull (sorry, parents, I'm sure your kids are wonderful but I'm just really not a kid person), and if you're going to write an unrealistic, more mature 11 year old why not just write an older character instead?

** I usually get a idea for a OC when asking myself a question about the wizarding world.

What if a muggleborn student had close ties to the IRA? (was watching way too much SOA at the time). What if a muggleborn wanted to enlist during ww1 or 2? Could there be a vampire student at hogwarts?

The IRA one I started development around 14 or 15. The one enlisting during ww1 at 1 years old because I used the russian tsar daughters for helping me figure out age and birthdates of him and his siblings. The vampire one at 7 years old.
