:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi. I'm looking for a specific fanfiction story I read a while back and forgot to bookmark. Harry defeats Voldemort and ends up being chosen as the new Dark Lord. Lucius is the first death eater to show up when he sends out a call so he becomes his right hand and later more. Harry ends up recruiting many from the light side. That's all I remember. Thanks in advance.


** I don't know this fic but I'd love to read it!!

** Is it And the Knight Speaks? It's rather short relationship fic but has Lucius calling Harry â€˜my liege'.
