So in the story harry was kicked out of/ forced to leave the wizarding world because he was so powerful. He then becomes a hitman and along with his partner/ lover kills the British prince. Then he and his lover are killed by Hermione and then sent to the past. At this point he and dumbledore start finding and destroying voldemort's horcruxs. Does this sound firmiliar? Also he trades his unborn son for a new staff from a dark elf queen.

PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS FIC AGAIN!!!
