Arthur was only allowed to name two children, so he chose Percival, shortened to Percy, and Rhongomyniad, shortened to Ron, for his obsession with Arthurian legends, passed on by his father. Arthur Weasley's middle name is actually Pendragon, as Septimus was obsessed with King Arthur's legend too, due to the connection to Merlin as a distant Weasley ancestor.

If Ginny was born a male instead, she'd have been called Lancelot, shortened to Lance.

Good, because it would be really creepy to name his daughter Ginevra, the Italian of Guinevere, wife of King Arthur.

*** Ginevra is the Italian form of Guinevere. All the consonants are in the same order, only the vowels are different.

** This would actually be nicer, given poor Ron's the only one not named after royalty. Even Sir Percival was made a king in some stories. Unless he was named after the king of Buganda....or a Norse or Gaelic king.

Giving him a name that means ruler isn't quite the same thing, but I guess the sentiment is there.
