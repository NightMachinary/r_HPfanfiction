** Oddly enough, this is one of the tropes that annoy me less. I feel like there are so little decent new fics of the genres I enjoy being posted that I can forgive this one.

Unless he gives it some edgy name, in which case I nope out before even finishing reading the sentence.

*** "Aunt Petunia, there's going to be a few changes around here. This, is Venomfang!" The tiny garden snake turns it's head and hisses at the boy, "Er, sorry. This is SIR Venomfang! You will do my bidding, now fetch me cookies, wench!"

**** The two of them bond, and grow to be good friends (along with Hedwig, who for some random reason doesn't eat the Snake), leading to Harry repeatedly bringing the snake to Gringotts each year when he's doing his shopping.

He tries to talk to the snake in English, since people get all 'creeped out' by the Parsel-thing, so when he tells Venomfang how helpful he's been and how much he appreciates his company and how much he cares, other people can understand him and gossip about it.

There is now a Goblin at Gringotts also named Venomfang who is utterly convinced the Boy Who Lived is somehow head over heels for him. :D

I think this is pretty in line with canon Harry.

At the top of CoS, Harry tells us the Dursleys don't lock him in the cupboard because they're afraid he'll do something to them. He even goes as far as to mumble under his breath to scare Dudley away from him. He's barely 13 when he tries this again with Marge, Hogsmeade, and St. Brutus' and is successful the next summer with Sirius.

*** The difference tends to be that in canon he just does it to get them off his back/prevent Dudders from roughing him up while many fanfics make him a bit tyrannical. I've seen him be ~quite~ mean.

*** You realise that Harry is just messing with Dudley by muttering spells under his breath right? I can't recall any moment in the book series where Harry actually outright threatens to kill somebody and cause harm to someone else without good reason

***** Yeah Harry definitely has a good reason. He was abused all his life by his so called relatives that is reason enough to intimidate them, or even want them dead I think he could have easily gone down the same path Tom riddle did.

** The thing about this 'find a snake and keep it' idea is that it doesn't fit in with the British climate. Many of these stories have the snake showing up in the Dursley's garden, as if Harry lives in some tropical jungle country or something. You might find a frog in a British garden or a hedgehog, but a snake is highly unlikely unless it was kept as a pet and escaped - which would be fine, but that's not usually what happens in these types of stories. I still read them though, because snake fics are often interesting!

*** Well, I can't comment whether it is commonplace to see them, but the UK does have its native species so I wouldn't say it "doesn't fit the climate".

**** u/Grumplesquishkin:

  The adder is the UK's only venomous snake, but its poison is generally of little danger to humans: an adder bite can be very painful and cause a nasty inflammation, but is really only dangerous to the very young, ill or old.
#+end_quote

British snakes are small and weak. They're not suitable for intimidating big angry blokes like Vernon. Even Petunia would probably just smash it with a shovel.
