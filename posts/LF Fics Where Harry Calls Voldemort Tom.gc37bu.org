I just think it would be hilarious if Harry confuses everyone by calling Voldemort Tom. Imagine how confused everyone would be, they would think Harry was ranting about this man named Tom, who nobody knows.


** "I was kidnapped by Tom! He used my blood for a ritual and then tried to kill me! He summoned his army of followers and we dueled and I escaped!"

"Damn, this Tom is a serious dark wizard! We need to hunt him down!"

"Thanks Minister!"

*** "Tom... H-He had me tied down and made me bleed. He made me watch as he rises up once again and he touched me. Tom just laughed when I screamed in pain!"

Imagine the amount of phrasing you could do with this.
