If you have read Bungle in the Jungle (most of you people probably have, I mean its jbern, who hasn't), you might have noticed that the Luna there is using her "weird" personality as a mask, fooling everyone at Hogwarts, but is actually a normal girl underneath. Any stories recommended that have the same idea like that are greatly appreciated


** She comes off as almost normal in The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7 linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup). Its actually pretty reasonable why she behaves somewhat normally in this fic. If your uncomfortable with depression though, I would suggest something else, it does get a bit dark.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

** I can picture Luna being a bit like Jesus Christ in her personality. Jesus was really strait forward with people until the Israelites started to shun/accuse him of blasphemy. So after a certain point Jesus stops teaching normally and uses Parables when hes teaching because it messes with people who are to stubborn or ignorant to think about what He is saying. I can see Luna doing the same thing where she used to be normal or as normal as she can be and once she got to hogwarts some kids picked on her or made fun of her so she just uses Riddles and Parables and other things when she talks to mess with people

** Linkffn(Stages of Hope) has this, to some degree. While Luna maintains her dreamy persona for most of the story and largely speaks in metaphor, there's a specific conversation she has with one of the adults where she drops the facade.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

#+end_quote

We'd be more genuine, but no less sane, I don't think. Some people are naturally more genuine than others, but a lot of us can't stand to be our genuine selves all the time because we fear judgement from those around us. So people will alter their behaviour to fit the expectations of the people around them. I think that's ok. Maybe it's not all that healthy, but we're all a bit damaged...

Anyway.

In Luna's case, since she suffers bullying for acting the way she does, we assume that's her genuine self, because if she was following the expectations of the people around her she would act more "normal" (hide her true thoughts) to not be bullied. BUT it's an interesting twist to think that she acts 'looney' on purpose. I just can't think of a not-insane reason why she'd do it.

**** Its a matter of degree, a huge one for that matter. Everyone has thoughts that never go past that. We are who we choose to behave as. And, as you said sometimes we behave differently around different people. We use more vulgar language in casual settings with friends, than we would in a professional setting or with our mothers.

This can be called wearing a mask, but mostly its just editing our behavior. We aren't becoming different people, which is the behavior that is concerning. The only people that have to pretend to be someone else are the ones that can't be themselves. There are no good reasons for this.
