** The [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/writingcenter][writing center]] (specifically the Lexicon in your case) on the sidebar has lots of nifty tools for things like this.

Muggle is a common noun so it would not be capitalized. Beater is similar, as is mediwitch. Only if they are part of a title would I capitalize them, e.g. "Mediwitch Poppy Pomfrey" would be capitalized but "the mediwitch patched me up" would not.

Feel free and ask on the subreddit as well, that's what it is here for.

Edit: There is also a discord link on the sidebar in which we discuss and critique each others work rather commonly. It is pretty active and people give good feedback, feel free and join we'd love to have you.

** I go to canon and do it that way as much as possible, even though it's frequently illogical and sometimes inconsistent. Muggles is capitalised even though wizards is not for example. Makes no sense to me, but that's how I do it.

*** I'm fairly certain the pattern is that every word JK Rowling created herself is capitalized, while other terms that are already known in mythology aren't. This explains why some magical creatures are capitalized while others aren't.

**** That sounds daft enough to be right.

** There's always Potterwords, which was hosted on the Lexicon until the Lexicon's site rework.
