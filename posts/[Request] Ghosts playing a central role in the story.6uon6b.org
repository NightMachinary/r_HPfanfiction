** linkffn(Unfinished Business by Ramos) features Hermione dying in a Potions accident and ending up as a ghost. It's pretty good, though it's headed towards a Snape/Hermione. I personally find it non-icky in this particular instance because it only begins when Ghost Hermione is mentally an adult, but some people may still not like it.

I really like your idea about Ghost!Harry, but unfortunately I never came across anything like it.

Now on the difference between Wraith!Voldie and normal ghosts... Voldemort has more latent power because he still has his magic, allowing him to possess stuff. On the other hand, I don't think he's abel to ever really "relax", so to speak; he describes having to "cling on to life", and I think that's the key point. Because of his wildly unstable, shredded soul, Wraith Voldemort was itself unstable and chaotic, so that he had to constantly focus on keeping himself together lest he lose awareness and effectively vanish. By contrast, Hogwarts ghost are "stable" and can walk around, chat with friends, or even doze off, as if they were still alive.
