Not picky if Muggle/Magic-based really but if there's a pairing, non-slash and the story has to be complete and long. Yeah not picky at all lol


** It's far from the sole focus of the story, but there's some in linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh).

There's another I've read, but can't quite recall; I'll post it if I do.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** Isn't that the one with the genderbent Watson? Could be another Sherlock one, idk. All I know is, it completely turned me off of that fic. It's just too damn weird.

3 movies, dozens of Sherlock episodes, multiple books by Conandoyle, and now this rando fanfic author makes the mustached sidekick a woman for no reason.... Yeah ok. "necessary for the plot" my ass.

** linkffn(The Song of the Trees by Tinn Tam) is a fairly good example of this kind of thing. Quite sadly abandoned right at the climax but the mystery that is the story's main point is at least solved.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
