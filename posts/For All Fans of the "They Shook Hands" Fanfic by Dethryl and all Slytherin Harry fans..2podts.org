** Here I thought "I'll update when such-and-such term is met!" was restricted to bad tween writers. Not that I've read /They Shook Hands/, but I'd pegged it as being something reasonably well written.

From his fb page:

#+begin_quote
  If this page gets up to 200 likes before Christmas, I'll post the first chapter of Y6. I don't like making everyone wait, but I want to make sure the story is as good as it can be.
#+end_quote

Does he somehow expect that 200 likes will improve the quality of his writing?

*** If "good" refers to "good, according to those reading it", maybe he is counting on motivated reasoning? If someone is already committed to "liking" a story, it'll be harder, psychologically, for them to read the chapter and decide that it isn't very good after all.

*** The fics were alright but they didn't actually change the original plot that much. He'd have to rewrite them all to improve the writing, as it is he's stuck in pseudo-canon.

*** Now now, don't rule MPreg out so soon. It just hasn't been done by the right writer yet. I think there's a lot of potential in an Alien-like monster tearing itself out of Draco Malfoy's anus, brutally killing him in the process, then going on to terrorise the whole of Hogwarts from the shadows.

**** Dammit, I might have to read that. Someday you're going to have to make good on a few of those solid plot bunnies.

I think my one regret about getting into fanfiction a year ago is that I now know a) that there's such a thing as "mpreg," and b) what that thing is.

When I first ran across the term I thought it was some kind of fanfiction-only compression format, like .MPEG.

  Mpreg

Oh gods, seriously? This fic is on my massive To Read list, but if it's mpreg then it's getting kicked. One of the few things I absolutely can't stand.

** Ughhh what. I've been waiting for that fic for ages... and he's gonna sit on it for 200 likes? That's really lame, and pretty childish.

But oh hey he only needs 6 more! That's good I guess.

*** he will only post the first chapter, the rest will follow when the whole fic is finished. This is only to keep the readers interested until he is finished. I think he would still post it when it´s finished even if he doesn´t get the likes
