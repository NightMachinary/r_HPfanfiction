I am looking for a harry potter fic that is a crossover with 28 days later. Its starts with a wizard going to get his wife something from a butchers when he is attacked, and in the few seconds before going rabid he apparitd to saint Mungos and attacking the medi witches. I remember that Hermione gets trapped in London with a Syltherin after witnessing death eaters rounding up infected on platform 9 3/4. Everyone else is hiding at hogwarts.

Does anyone know what it was called or if it is still online


** I know this one. It's basically a Hermione-centric zombie apocalypse story. Let me see if I can scare up a link.

Found it! Took me a while because I thought the title was *Eleventh Hour* but couldn't find it anywhere. Turns out the title is *11th Hour* (which is completely different as far as a computer is concerned). linkao3(129845)
