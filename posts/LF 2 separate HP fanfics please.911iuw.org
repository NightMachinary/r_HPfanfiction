Read a fanfic years back and I can't recall the name. Points I remember below:

Harry essentially ages himself permanently to mid/early 20s.

NF made a poor stone but harry creates a "true" philosophers stone with blood from 1000 virgins given in essentially a blood drive.

He is involved with an O/C who is a muggle and has his own crib.

Sorry it's not a lot to go off of.

Also, if anyone knows the below I would be greatful, a fanfic where harry "creates" a Phoenix - they're made from people's own magic and his is a dark Phoenix - believe it or not, asking for a friend with this one!!

Not my usual read but been a long time and feeling ff.net is letting me down a little at the mo: any other recommendations welcome, preferably something long, new and complete!

Thanks
