*** I wish more fanfic writers just checked with this sub from time to time - many of them would realize sooner that there are plenty of fans of their work out there. It's just that not all of these fans make the effort to write a review on the website.

And a Harry/OC fic, especially where the OC is a muggle? We hardly ever get a good fic in this genre, so of course, we would wait for you to update!

****** Well I can't speak for the subreddit, but summaries are difficult to write. It's a different skill than writing an actual fic, but having poor summaries is a good way to ensure not many people read your fic. There are exceptions like Grow Young With Me, where the story is so good that the unusual summary doesn't matter.

****** It's the classic movie trailer conundrum.

If you show too less, especially for a movie with a completely new plot, you risk turning people off from watching your movie. If you show too much, you've basically given away the story, so people aren't going to come.

The fact that the movie people get an average of two minutes for a 2-3 hour movie to showcase their trailer and attract people, and they /still/ make a mess out of it should tell you how difficult it is for writers to write a summary for a fic with more than 30-35 chapters in not more than two lines. The other day, I watched the trailer for Batman Begins. Compared to the kind of classic that the movie was, the trailer was awful and would most definitely be ridiculed today. Contrast it with the trailer for Dunkirk, a movie from the same director with a story that most people from our generation would not be aware of, and you'll realize how far we have come in just around 10-12 years.

****** It's more about summaries that are clearly half-assed. This, it may not be a great summary but it certainly is an honest attempt at one that looks like something the author clearly spent /some/ effort to write. It certainly is creative, and if you look at it through that lens it means that the fic may be worth a try even if it is not the best summary.

And look at the examples of bad summaries that are spoken on on this sub. Usually it's stuff that looks as if the author just gave up from the get-go and didn't put any real effort into writing it, and that does tend to be a sign that the fic in question is going to be no better. A lot of the bad summaries talked about have some stuff in them that people who spent effort on it most likely would not put in, such as asking multiple questions in the summary just to fill space or over-filling it with tags.

****** Funny, I think it's one of the best summaries around. It instantly made me want to read the fic, way back when I found it. Summaries that go, for example, "will Harry ever find true love again?" make me skip right over the fic, I find them contrived and cringe-worthy.

** Definitely one of the best stories around; I'm really happy to see it being updated.

It's not for people who don't like OCs, as Abigail is a central part of the story, and the kids are more or less OC too given that we know pretty much nothing of this period of their lives from canon. But if you skip it on that basis you're missing out on a fantastic story.
