Over the years of reading fanfics I've seen some really interesting Parsel-anything in the Harry Potter universe. And I'd like to read a story that instead of casually having it as part of a larger whole, places a heavy or very large emphasis on its limits, how it works, and how it can change the tide of battle. Idk if anyone else is as interested in something like this as I am, but if the story itself has good Parsellore and/or magic then that works too.

Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

** Lomonaaeren's Deconversion features Harry slowly going insane from rejecting parseltongue magic and abilities. Really interesting look at pathways of magic and ways to specialise, infiltrating the Department of Mysteries, and Harry learning to follow a dark path with parseltongue.

FYI: Slash Harry/Draco, body modification (Harry transforming into a snake), and while not explicitly bashing, Ron and Hermione can't understand Harry as he succumbs to madness and are not supportive of his choices to heal and embrace Dark magic. Avoid if that bothers you.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
