** 'Seven Devils' is a self-insert where the SI's plan for dealing with voldermort is to help tom (the soul fragment in the diary) repent and reintegrate all the other pieces of his soul.

tom is chosen because he's the largest soul piece (the story subscribes to the theory that horcruxes split the soul in half) and as the youngest and least mutilated version of voldermort's soul, he's the most capable of being able to repent and feel remorse for what he's done.

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

** None that I'd take seriously that I've read. I've read one that was a crack fic that had him thinking, /I really shouldn't have made horcruxes/, and poof, no more horcruxes.

The other one I read seems to be super divisive due to all the bashing, and doesn't really involve him piecing his soul back together out of regret initially.

** Ninja Wizard by mad_fairy on ao3 explored this, Harry felt remorse from the senseless death used to make the horcruxes and the horcrux in him reflected that, undoing each one until Harry was the last

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Throwing Away a Hero by GredandForgeRock linkffn(8608572)

When Voldie possesses Harry in the atrium, Harry's remorse at falling into the trap and causing Sirius's death is sufficient to trigger the clause for reabsorbing a horcrux. The other pieces return to him as beams of light, which are later traced to find and confirm the objects were but no longer are horcruxes.

Voldie is ejected from Harry but the shock is enough to kill him. Dumbledore then tries to claim the credit, citing an unspecified spell he'd allegedly created which drew Voldie out of Harry and caused the seizure/death.

  Harry stopped Voldemort when he was 15. Less than a month later he finds not everyone is as appreciative as he thought. Bloodied and bruised he sets out to escape and runs into a little unexpected help, from several places. Updating THE LIST periodically. I compare Scotland and Florida to show how they break larger nation into smaller parts.

  "...The cure for Horcruxes, the only way to merge them with you again is feeling deep, intense remorse for what you did. When you so strongly regretted killing me, everything started, for I was directly tied to you through that piece of soul, and with that tied to all the others."

  From Harry's very first encounter with the Dark Lord, Voldemort has always insisted on using proper etiquette, not accounting for the possibility of escalation.
