Looking for a fic where Harry has to battle it out with the goblin king in order to get the goblin nation's help. After Harry wins, he seems to have earned the respect of goblins as they thump their chest with their fist in a salute towards him everytime he walks by. Don't remember exactly if the king bore the name Ragnok. Any clues?
