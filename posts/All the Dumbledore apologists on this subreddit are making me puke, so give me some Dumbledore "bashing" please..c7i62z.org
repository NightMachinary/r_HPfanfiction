** linkffn(Faery Heroes) linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) It's not that I don't understand the viewpoint, I really do, but unlike Snape, his character does have good to him.

I just think Rowling did that transition to an young adult series badly. You can't justify leaving Harry in an abusive home, but dismissing his concerns is something an adult would do. The Chamber is weird, but I always though Myrtle refused to talk to anyone except Harry. Not getting Sirius a trial sounds malicious, but a lot of death eaters didn't. It's a huge abrogation of responsibility, but it wasn't designed to keep Harry abused. Still, I'd rather read a competent Dumbledore & Harry fic with a super Voldemort.

Overall, Dumbledore in canon is incompetent, not malicious. He shouldn't be leading the effort, not because he refuses to kill (how would have exposing Voldemort worked if he had killed the death eaters and Voldemort had escaped ahead of time), but because he refuses to share information. The Horcrux hunt seems up Moody's and Bill's alley, not a trio of dropouts.

Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

*** I've read the first one (one if my favorites) and the first part of the second one.

I completely agree that Rowling never intended Dumbledore to be evil but she wrote him that way. If he isn't malicious then he's absolutely senile. The Chamber incident isn't weird though. Dumbledore knew Riddle was responsible and a thorough investigation of the bathroom where Myrtle was found would have led to the discovery of the entrance. It is rather irrelevant that other people didn't get a trial because none of them were Order members and Secret Keepers for the Child of Prophecy. Dumbledore should have at least spoken to him in prison. And Snape and the other Death Eaters knew Pettigrew was the real traitor anyway.

Dumbledore's senility is amply demonstrated in the people he trusts with his "plans": Harry and Snape. One is an abused child he's groomed to commit suicide and the other is a petty, bitter and vindictive child abuser and terrorist. This in spite of there being so many other trustworthy Order members around.

Snape was a dick, plain and simple. He's actively malicious and Dumbledore was a fool to keep him and Harry in confidence.
