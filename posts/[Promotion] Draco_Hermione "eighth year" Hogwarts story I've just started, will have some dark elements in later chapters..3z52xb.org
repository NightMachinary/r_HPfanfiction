** I am not big on Dramione in general, but it seems to be a pretty standard setup for a Dramione romance. What are these "dark elements" it's going to acquire?

Other than that, it seems to be skewing the characters in the usual Dramione direction. Things like Draco's callouses from Quiddich come off like you're trying very hard to give Draco a "Manliness" upgrade --- even though in the movies, at least, the players wear fingerless gloves, and, for that matter, /all/ wizards and witches probably have the same callouses from wand practice, Hermione more so than most. Along similar lines, while Hermione has a bit more personality than she has in most such fics, she's still "nicified". Where are her vindictiveness and aggressiveness when Draco shoves Lucius's release on the train? Where are her ambition and drive and her plans to change the world when she arrives at Hogwarts?

For that matter, when Draco goes on his creepy rant about how bad he felt that Bellatrix was torturing /his/ mudblood, why is said "mudblood", who was actually the one being tortured, suddenly comforting him rather than calling him out on his BS?

  In regards to Hermione being nicified, I definitely see what you are saying. I guess I imagine Hermione after the war not having the energy to get worked up about things like the word mudblood or Draco's attempts to get a rise out of her. I think she feels a lot of pity for Draco so its easier for her to just feel bad for him rather than let him get to her.

The thing is, suppose that we take it as a premise that Hermione is lacking energy. (I don't completely buy that, but it's your fic; then why is she back at Hogwarts? She could take a year off, go to Australia... but OK.) Why would she then have the energy to actively engage him, help him, comforts him, makes excuse before him, etc., rather than ignoring or shunning him? Why wouldn't this low-energy Hermione just politely tell McGonagall that she really just wants to have a normal, drama- and politics-free school year /just this once/, and that if Draco needs help with the legal defense for his mother, perhaps McGonagall could run a fundraiser.

  I also want Draco to come across as creepy and obsessive, he is far from perfect. I think that Hermione can be the grounded and sane one of the two of them.
#+end_quote

See, this kind of thing is the reason why I am not generally big on Dramione. Draco is creepy and obsessive, and Hermione not only puts up with that for some reason, but also spends her precious time and limited energy keeping him grounded and fixing him. Ron, for all his flaws, is at least low-maintenance and unlikely to suddenly snap and try to rape or murder her, which this Draco looks like he might.

** I really enjoyed this. I would appreciate Draco being slightly less creepy, an annoying prick still sure, but he was never this creepy in the books. And Hermione needs to be a bit more ferocious. Yes she might be tired, but that ferocity is a main part of her character and personality! but really really good! I'll be following :)
