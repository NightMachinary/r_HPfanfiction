Basically, looking for stories that have more complicated ideas (magic/politics/plot/whatever), but still fit cannon because when it was introduced in cannon, it was simplified for children.

I know a lot of stories do the "There was a bigger/more complex system but for some reason it wasn't exposed to Harry in cannon". But I'm looking explicitly for "Because he was a child it was simplified" (and NOT "Because dumbles is a manipulative bastard" or "No-one mentioned he had to claim his inheritance" or such).

Example:

(Simple, Unsure if Portkeys were ever explained more than the one scene they were in): Portkeys are really recall devices, you have to be at the destination to create them, but the kids never see the creation process until they are in later years of hogwarts.

Transformation magic with a more complicated system but still simplifies down to 'ye basic rules of transfiguration' when introducing it to 11 year olds

Politics (Fudge/Dumbledore) that is more nuanced, but would still simplify down to 'stubborn self-interest' when explained to children by one side.

Or whatever. Basically looking for a fic that creates something new and interesting and connects it to cannon through the 'unreliable narrator' angle.


** "Perfectly Normal" series by BrilliantLady

linkffn(11591125; 11656250; 11792471; 11990559)

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chrysalis][Harry Potter and the Chrysalis]], Harry is pretty smart but he is childishly naive about certain things, and definitely an unreliable narrator.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
