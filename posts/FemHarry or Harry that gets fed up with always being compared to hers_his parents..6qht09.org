** If I'm allowed to be biased and pimp my own fic for a moment, linkffn(10412141) fits the criteria. Fem!Slytherin!Harry, should that be your cup of tea, and she's quite over being compared to her parents by first year.

I do realize I haven't updated in over a year, but my life has been hell, and the much needed rewrite of years one and two is in progress.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter wanted two things in life; to escape from the Dursley's, and to make her mark on the world. When she is brought back into the world of Magic, it is that second desire that would change everything. Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry. Rated for occasional language, mature themes, and general future-proofing. Begins 31 July, 1991, planned to run through all seven books.

*** Thank you very much for your recommendation!

If you could spoil me for a bit, I'm wondering these things are in your fic. *1 Is she friends with Hermione? I personally hope not because frankly said, getting a bit tired and sick of Fem!Harry!Slytherin always being friends with Hermione. *2 will she get ''rid'' of the dursley's

**** She is vaguely friends with Hermione, but only vaguely.

Additionally, I have a Ravenclaw!Hermione who has turned into a very different person from canon already, and will only continue to depart from her canon self. No SPEW and such rot to be found here.

The Dursley revenge has not happened yet, but certainly will. And in a far more creative manner than simply killing them.

***** I'll be honest, Totally loving Harriet personallity when she's with her group. Especially since she's using Political power rather then ''Showing of her magic like she is some super saiyan''

but... I hardly could get past the chapter and stopped reading (for now), where you had Harriet forced back to the dursley's because of a old cunt saying because of wards.

****** Indeed, with her leverage she should have been able to kind of force Dumbledore to leave her alone (she after all has the freaking Sorcerer's Stone at that point, if I remember this right...hell, her just surrendering it is kind of strange (I mean can't she use an Owl to mail it to somebody to keep it save for her (or ask one of her allies to do that for her)?)

*** Any information on pairings? I know it might not even be a big part of the story but there's certain things I avoid at all costs, especially when Slytherin!(fem)Harry gets involved.

**** Pairing is minor in the future, and non existant at the moment, but if you're worried about Draco/Voldemort/other Death Eaters/Spawn of Death Eaters, don't be.

Planned pairing is actually Harri/Daphne, but depending on how my characters develop, it might well turn into an non entity.
