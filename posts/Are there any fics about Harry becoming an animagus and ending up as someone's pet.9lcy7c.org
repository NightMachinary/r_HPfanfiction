I'm reading one right now and I really liked it and I was wondering if there were others with the same premise.


** There are a couple of crossovers where that's how the pairing is set up. Harry stays with the girl as her pet until she gets beaten up/nearly raped/nearly killed and then he saves the day.

Would you be interested in that, and if yes, which fandoms?

  (Based on whitetigerwolf's 'Animagus Lover' challenge! Bashing!) Agatha Clay found an injured owl one day, and nursed him back to health. Two years later, on the day her story truly began, he revealed himself to be a wizard from another world...and he has vowed to protect her. But between Sparks, politics, dictators, and assassins from another world, will they survive?

  Draco retreated after the war. Despite the Wizarding world turning a smiling, forgiving face to any and all with a black name and stained reputation, he wanted none of it. All Draco wanted was to be left alone.Unfortunately for him, Harry Potter doesn't want to leave him alone. And more than that, he finds himself with the most unlikely of house guests that he just can't seem to rid himself of.Why is life never simple?

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah) is like that. NB! The last chapter is basically an extended synopsis of what the author originally planned and then never finished.
