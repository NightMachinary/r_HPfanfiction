It's been discussed in HP main as well as various other forums how the whole "evil wizards come from Slytherin" thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy--you put a bunch of kids together and treat them like they're already bad, they're probably going to only be loyal to each other and be ripe pickings for groups like the Death Eaters.

I'd love to read a fic that examines this and maybe features a Slytherin character speaking out against it. I personally think it would work really well as a post-war fic, where people are better understanding the importance of house unity, but something set during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts could work, too.

If this doesn't exist, I'm tempted to buckle down and write it myself...


** I think linkffn(hogwarts houses divided) handles the Slytherin prejudice pretty well. It's next gen so it deals with the post-war sentiment.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** I have seen stories based on that premises but then as they go along they fizzle out and lose focus. Voldemort becomes the greater enemy. Voldemort simply exploited the weaknesses the Hogwarts sorting system had. And I would encourage you to write down something. It is an interesting premises and I haven't seen it that well done.

** Oh they absolutely exist. As is always the case, now that you ask I can't pull them out of my head though. The vast majority that I read tend to eventually have Hermione paired with a Slytherin guy. But not all. I'll look through my list and get back to you. Unfortunately, this isn't a thing I tag for.

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix) deals with the prejudice quite well. Also, as a more general rec, a lot of harry/daphne stories feature that sort of thing (though it's probably 50/50 with it being blown out of proportion or not).

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Going to shamelessly self-promote here but the fic I'm currently writing deals with anti-Slytherin prejudice post-war through a character from a family that was closely involved w/ the Death Eaters. It's set in the Teddy Lupin era, and is linkffn(The Lost Children by nymphxdora) if you're interested!

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.

For canon era fics, anytime you see Daphne the Ice Princess of Slytherin, chances are she and her sister Astoria went against the Malfoy gang.

*** I was so excited when [[/spoiler][Albus was sorted into Slytherin]] and then so disappointed when [[/spoiler][he acted like a Gryffindor the rest of the play.]]

Are the Greengrass sisters generally prone to Mary Sue-ishness though? That's my impression. I'm not really looking for something that demonizes the rest of the house in the interest of promoting ~special Slytherins~. I'm thinking more of something with a more sympathetic light. The whole, "Why do bullies bully?" question.

** Anti-Slyterin-Bias? I don't know, Dumbledore might favor Harry (a little, I mean he did a lot of shitty things to Harry as well, so it kind of is compensation - for something Dumbledore CAN'T compensate Harry for (neither sticking him with the Dursleys nor finally making him sacrifice himself - without trying other things before asking that!)) - still, who else (discounting the Weasleys and Sirius) biased? Are they being treated unfairly by other teachers? (I'd say it's the other way round: Slytherins are treated fairly by everybody while their head of house is biased against everybody else!) Do they not find work later? Do people harass them in the hallways for being in Slytherin? etc. etc.

Sorry, but I just don't see it! (Note that doesn't mean it's not happening, Harry's POV is rather limited, so Slytherins might be feared, hated and treated badly, but we've never seen teachers actually sink to Snape's level of treatment with them!)
