Dumbledore is an old war hero who just wants to live as an old teacher watching kids prank each other. He didn't want to have to deal with all this shit, but he has to because he is the only person in the wizarding world (besides Tom Riddle) who has any intention to be anything more than a passive hampster as the world rushes by him.

It isn't his fault that prophecies tend to come to fruition as soon as both members end up fully informed. It isn't his fault that there is literally no political institutions in all of wizarding britian set to prevent such horrors. It isn't his fault that he can't tell anyone about this because 9/10 wizards would see a Horocrux and say "Cool, where do I get one". Including most of the Aurors.

He just wants to be a school teacher. They all think he is Gandalf, but guess what: He can't take on no Balor. He is just a broken war vet who wants to retire.

You think he wants three jobs? He has been trying to offload two of them for ages. Last time he left the Wizamont alone they tried to ban preparing food by non wizards. Muggle, house elf, magic, the like. By the time he got back they were looking into magical means of enforcement, he only barely got there in time to stop mass starvation. And the ICW? The last 24 assistants he has tried to train to take his place have managed to get killed when attempting to do things without his supervision.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\
Basically, I'm looking for fics that have a setup of taking Albus to task, but instead of it working, he unloads all the massive pile of shit that has been dropped on his plate that no-one else is dealing with. Maybe it is what seems to be an independent Harry starting to call out his role in things and Dumbledore responds by unloading 'all the shit of the world I'm dealing with for you' on him. Maybe it is Snape who comes at him when Lily dies and Dumbledore informs him about the vast mess the world really is. Maybe it is Fudge, who pushes him over the edge by insisting once more that he is after his job. Maybe it is the board, who are following Lucias like sheep.

But lets see Dumbledore lose his cool at being accused of being a manipulative bastard / mastermind when all he wants to do is retire.

Anything like that out there?


** I kinda just want to see some more fics where harry finds out Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard but it is pretty much okay and even supportive of it when Dumbledore tells him a bit of what's really going on. That mutual understanding and respect of eachother is absolute gold when its done right, really let's both of the characters shine. The ones where Dumbledore gets to be more straightforward are always home to my favorite versions of Dumbledore lol

****** I dont know if this would fit in your description. First it has slash (Harry/Draco), so only read if you are interested. And it starts right after Dumbeldore gets killed, so you dont see dumbeldore in action in this fic. However, Harry realizes that while the adults tell him that he is only a child, but nobody has taken active roles after Dumbledore has died. In this fic he matures, and he works on SO many things which help him to deal with voldemort. I love it because it's a more realistic take on Harry defeating Voldy, by way of his maturation and training. Also it has a VERY interesting take on "he will mark him as his equal" it's amazing. I sidetracked. The fic is called "Secrets". And Harry finds himself acting like Dumbledore by keeping so many secrets in different circles, and all of them for "the greater good". And he actually realizes this in the fic and says how much he understands Dumbledore now and why he had to do all these things that make him seem as manipulative, but are actually needed. Also this fic focuses on Snape as well as he becomes the sort of mentor and trainer. For me, this is the best fic i have ever read. It's called "Secrets" by Vorabiza

***** HPMoR isn't that bad, and the way in which it /is/ bad is almost certainly not what you've been led to believe. Harry is a smug smart-ass, but the story takes as many opportunities as it can to kick the shit out of him for that. The big message at the end of the story is that Harry was so much of an idiot that it literally took the combined effort of thousands of prophecies in order to stop him from tearing the world to pieces.

There are actual problems with HPMoR, including, but not limited to: the pacing, the fact that the nod to Ender's Game in the second act is /too long/, an over-reliance on fanon and the wiki instead of reading the actual books, strange, out of left-field assumptions that are thrown in and then just as quickly thrown out, (Sirius and Peter were gay lovers? The Weasley Twins are the heirs to Gryffindor?) and, /apparently/, not making it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harry's behavior largely isn't reasonable. This was exacerbated by fans not quite picking up the message either.

It's not flawless, it's not the best piece of fanfiction I've read. But the /meme/ that it's the worst piece of fanfiction in the fandom gets on my nerves, because it's just /not true/. Not only is it genuinely entertaining, but it's /not even flawed for the reasons people believe it's flawed./

And when you are finally ressurected... Well, Voldemort might be okay with the whole noseless and scaly look, but most people wouldn't.

Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Dumbledore, stares down at Harry 'You think I wanted this, its been months since I have been bowling I am always busy with some inane Task, If its not the ministry its something else, I am old and so so tired, In my youth I used to look down on my brother whose ambitions stopped at owning his own bar, but now I envy my brother, Owning a bar would be so simple and pleasant, Instead I run a school where the governors and ministry battle my every move. People call me manipulative and a mastermind, but the world is barely holding together, in the 70's a muggle student brought comic books to this school a story about one man holding the weight of the world on his shoulders, the story was framed as heroic harry, but it failed to account for how much damage it does to a person, Do you know the most amusement I get in my daily life is showing up to the ministry in a garish robe but even now thats getting old, and I am Just an old man left with regrets, I went to school with your great Grandfather, he was a few years older then me, I taught your grandfather and father, I watched your father grow from a boy into a man and then I had to watch the funeral, I have had to watch so many of my students be buried because of tom, because of my failings to set him on the right path.\\
My failings robbed you of a lifetime spent with your Godfather as well, So many mistakes harry'' Dumbledore Sighed and paused but was interrupted by Harry 'I am sorry for lashing out at you, You Do not have to go this alone professor, me, ron, Hermione and the order are here for you please let us help you carry your burdens''

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/]]) -- /Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals/ by mugglesftw. The self-insert main character is very afraid of Dumbledore because he suspects Dumbledore of putting Harry in an abusive home on purpose and doing other manipulative things. But when the protagonist finally has a conversation with Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/5/Why-Time-Travel-Should-Be-Illegal-and-Other-Morals][Chapter 5]], Dumbledore turns out to have very reasonable explanations for his actions and for why the Chief Warlock has much less political power than the main character had assumed. The main character presses Dumbledore on some of his other actions later in the story, but Dumbledore has good explanations for those too.

**** It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I will say that "the religion thing" is a pretty reasonable level of religion for a devout Christian. I mean, it's totally valid if you don't want to read about that in your Harry Potter fanfic, but I don't want anyone scared off because they're worried this is going to be Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles or whatever that was called.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** I present the most complex and ambiguous HP fanfiction Albus centric I have ever read

Title: [[http://geneticallydead.livejournal.com/211978.html][Möbius]]Author: MandyRating: NC-17Length: MediumTen years after the fall of Voldemort, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, celebrated as the saviour of the wizarding world. In the history books, Harry Potter stood over the hollow corpse of Lord Voldemort, vibrant and triumphant, and incinerated that withered old body to the depths of hell. The real truth was, Severus Snape killed Voldemort. Not Harry Potter.Pairing: Harry/Severus

​

Oldie but goldie, please, despite the pairing, give it a try.

Harry is just soul crushingly well written here. :>

** Then he should have stayed OUT OF IT!

Sorry, but making excuses for Dumbledore's poor leadership, keeping secrets, placing burdens on a kid (who's life he ruined by placing him in an abusive household and then using him as a sacrifice) and generally hindering the war effort ("Don't kill your enemies, stun them, so we can look them up!" - No, if someone wants to kill you you obliterate them and then later on collect the pieces, you don't use stunners on deatheaters (unless you want to interrogate them, but not as a main combat spell!)) simply piss me off!

Dumbledore should have protected his school, he should have fought when neccessary but he should have put someone else in charge of the order (Mad-Eye Moody maybe or Shacklebolt) and should have kept out of the war mostly (he should also have not protected Snape, because with another potions-teacher I am sure there would have been more Aurors, Healers etc. (all of them need a potions NEWT after all and Snape didn't make getting that easy, in fact he made it harder than it should be!))
