What Fanfics would you recommend in which Harry Potter is heavily influenced by muggles - I can think of a few, one where he becomes a rock singer and is in a gang, and the order tries to kidnap him (Bad writing, good story.) and a few others but I Cannot find the link! So anyone who knows of a HP fanfic with heavy muggle influence, preferred where he doesn't go to Hogwarts at 11 because he is in the muggle world, please share!

** Not quite what you're looking for but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]] Harry runs away from the magical world, meets a muggle girl and spends most of the story in the muggle world hiding from the Order.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at Once]]: "AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info."

Harry knows nothing at all about the magical world or the fact that he is a wizard until he's almost done with high school. It's pretty good, but it is incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2008.
