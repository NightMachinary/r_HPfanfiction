** 1)Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance Watermelonsmellinfellon

Summary: Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

2) Allure Immune Harry Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]]

3) Escapologist Harry Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry]]

4) Harry the Hufflepuff » Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story Harry refuses to lift his finger to do shit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

5) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Harry the mod becomes Bella and then starts beating the everloving shit out of edward anytime he sees him refusing to go with the “script”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10207646/1/Script-Bleep-the-Script]]

6) Triwizard Tales » - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best. In which Harry basically pulls the middle fingers and does fuck all to for the tournament

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]]

Albus and Harry's World Trip » After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** The champions champion:

Ron is the replacement champion for Harry in the Triwizard tournament

Harmony fic and a lot of characters act completely different from canon.

#+begin_quote
  “Tom, I know you're in there...” He said lowly, not battering an eye as Harry gave a pained gasp.“...I feel that I should let you know that have used a mere 4 percent of my power during this battle so far....” the bearded wizard continued, a shaking Harry suddenly seizing up as if the beast inside understood just how serious the situation truly was. Slowly, Albus leant forward until his breath ghosted over Harry.“...you do not want to make it 5” he finished with a dangerous edge to his voiceWitness Dumbledore's power level during the ministry battle.
