This maybe vague but all I can really remember in this fic that Dumbldore really trusted Hermionie and when he died she sort of took up as head of the order of the pheniox. I think it's Pride of Time but Im not sure, but I think it had time tuners involved in it. Sorry it's been years since I read this fic


** Was it a HG/SS fic? If so, linkffn(Sin & Vice) might be similar to what you're looking for.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
