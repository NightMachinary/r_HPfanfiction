I have been reading Harry Potter fics for the last few years and has run out of good fics. Now I'm in the mood for some fics where Neville is the protagonist. Not overpowered Neville. Preferably completed. Good character development. And not something that has too much romance. I know I'm asking for a lot, but anyone know any?


** I love this one.

  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.

** It's a classic, but "Neville Longbottom and the Year of Darkness" is Neville and everyone else at Hogwarts during year 7. But there is romance so idk if you'd like it! But a lot of it has 10000% been added to my head cannon

** Linkao3(181530)

This one has a bit of romance in it, but it's relatively mild. It's the farthest thing from an OP Neville, but that's for the better--it's a lot more character-centric.
