** The link 404s on my phone.

Also, there are enough "favorites"-Lists from our favorite authors there. If you want my attention, wrote 2-3 sentences about why a fic is readable and what flaws it has.

This is what actually makes such lists.

  I just realized I have a lot more Twilight on there than I'm strictly comfortable with.

I can understand that. Honestly, I wouldn't be comfortable with even one Twilight fic in my favorites.

*** Some of the spite fics are great. E.g. Linkao3(the wedding crashers by dasmervin) in which Leah takes the Supernatural guys to the magical baby's wedding and they fuck shit up. üòç

**** I'm sure there are, after all a good writer will make a good story, no matter the fandom, but as I'm not interested in the fandom the very least I don't read them. I've got nothing against those who do, though.

  After two years on her own, and two more as a hunter with Sam and Dean Winchester, Leah thought she'd escaped her old life at La Push. But when she's called home to attend Jacob and Renesmee's wedding, she brings a little company, and the stage is set for her old and new lives to collide.

** Instead of linking your profile (which isn't working for me either), I recommend creating a list with categories and giving explanation of why these fics specifically make your list. Check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6f1l1x/wiki_link_me_your_top_fic_lists/][this thread]] to see some examples.
