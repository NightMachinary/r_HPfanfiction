Or: Ginny becomes Harry's biggest cheerleader, wanting him to find love and happiness.

I imagine something like unrelated oneshots/drabbles happening with funny shenanigans going on. Doesn't have to be exactly that, though.


** I don't really like Harry/Ginny but I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a platonic besties relationship between them. There's so much potential in Ginny's outgoing, boisterous, and fun personality that just doesn't fit in when you're trying to balance a romantic relationship with them, but you can do so much with as friends.

**** A Rogue's Bet by Hufflepunk. My favourite Harry/Ginny relationship by far. Also has some of my favourite character relationships and interaction. It is finished, but I think the ending is a bit rushed.

** I can honestly see this happening so bad and I love it

I love the chill Ginny you do see in fanfic where she's a successful quidditch player and Harry's a bit of a mess of an adult, and she's like ‘Harry you need to get laid, and I'm going to make it happen' and ‘you should be grateful I told mum I was going to help so she doesn't start setting you up on dates'

** Check out It's Not So Grim, Really linkffn(13307340)

Harry is introducing his muggle girlfriend to #12 and is a bit nervous as it is. Then she gets caught up in a prank war between Harry and Ron (and Kreacher). Ginny is later called in to referee.

  One-shot, faintly absurd. Harry attempts to introduce his newly-enlightened muggle girlfriend to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place.

*** Yes, I suppose it does happen in one chapter, over 100 chapters in, where Ginny acts as a wingwoman for Draco, and Harry has everything figured out, not a mess at all, but yes, I suppose it's an option lol.

** That's a good idea. There's also the common twist in fan fic where Harry is gay and goes after Blaise, Draco, some random Gryffindor, etc...but it could be a twist where Ginny's a lesbian and not only is she's Harry's wing woman they playfully fight over women (like they place bets on if they thinks someone's bi or straight).
