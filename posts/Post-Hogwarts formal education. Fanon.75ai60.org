The so-called Masteries that are so very present in some fics, is there any mention to it in canon? I can't remember anything like that, other than the students having career orientation in... 5th year? but even then it was focused on which grades they needed in the basic classes.

And if there's nothing, does that mean that a Hogwarts graduate has all the tools needed to go look for a job?


** I think it's based loosely on Snape being refered to as the "Potion Master" in the first book.

The Aurors have the Auror Academy (or whatever it's called), so I assume that most "proper" careers at least require some sort of training.

*** It's worth noting that there cannot be any kind of permanent "Auror Academy". We know from McGonagall in OotP that the Aurors are so selective that sometimes they go years without taking on any new recruits. At any given time the number of trainee Aurors is probably 0, occasionally going up to 1.

** Completely fanon. From my understanding, most people get thier jobs at the end of seventh year if they had good grades. Percy imediately joined the ministry, if you recall. Oliver wood did some sort of quidditch related thing (I supposed that didn't had much to do with grades, now that I think about it)

Are those really our only example? Fred and George set up their own business with Harry's investment and Ron and Harry were hired as aurors due to their experience, since they didn't even had sventh year complete. I think percy is actually our only character who followed the "proper" education system.

** It's all based on a misinterpretation of Flitwick and Snape being referred to as "Charms Master" and "Potion Master", both Masters being actually just synonyms for "teacher" (like in "music master"). From Harry having "Auror training", I think wizards who pursue a 'special' career will require some more training (I imagine it's the same for Healers), but other than that, yes, 7th-years just immediately go look for a job.

**** Do you think so? I mean, unlike the uncommon "master" for a teacher, headmaster is a pretty accepted term in its own right...

***** And where do you think the term Headmaster comes from? It means what it sounds like - the Head (or leader) of a schools Masters.

I grant you it has endured while the generic master has faded but that doesn't really matter. It's another example of X-master being just a word meaning teacher and one many people will recognize.

****** Yes, I know that's where Headmaster /came/ from, I just don't think it played any role in the creation of the fanon "Masteries" in the way "Potion Master" did.

** It seems to me that the Wizarding world seems to utilize the apprentice system instead of the ongoing education system. Want to be a Healer? Cool, you're a trainee Healer now! There are definitely people in the Wizarding world who pursue further knowledge such as Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel, but it looks like they pursue more of an independent study course rather than structured academics.

** Huh, apparently potion master = potion teacher.

I'm guessing they don't have universities as such, perhaps due to small population. I suppose entry level work positions involve further training.
