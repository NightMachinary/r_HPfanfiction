** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring but it picks up to be something of an epic later on. Also, Sirius does not become a prominent character until later on halfway through the story.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Seconded, he's often either relegated to a romantic interest or Harry's wacky sidekick. Him really embracing the Lord Black role is one of the few things I really liked in "A Marauder's Plan" (not that I hated it... just kinda outstayed its welcome for me) and would like to see more of.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
