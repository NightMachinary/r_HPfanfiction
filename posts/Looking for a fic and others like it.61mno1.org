I once saw a fic in the DLP library. It was a horror fic about a creature Harry Potter that had been sealed away under the Ministry of Magic because he was so powerful and so violent.

That said does anyone know of this fic and any others like it where Harry has been sealed away because of his power?

It would be nice if James and Lily where alive in the fic but not his parents. Like a Harry that has crossed worlds or gone back in time.

Thanks
