I've just reread The Lie I've Lived and been wondering if there are other fics where Lily cheats on James? I remember reading/passing a few that James is the one who cheats, so I want to see if there are fics where it's the other way around. Would prefer if it would show how it would affect Harry/potential siblings. Thanks.


** Spoilers for The Psychic Serpent trilogy

[[/spoiler][So in the second book of the trilogy, Harry makes a deal with Voldemort. Using the power of the brother wands, they work a spell where they travel through time to 1981 and Harry puts Lily under the Imperius, urging her to agree to raise baby Harry to be LV's servant. Que flash of light.]]

[[/spoiler][In the alternate timeline they've created, sixteen years later, Lily is now alive and married to Snape and has three children with him. In the course of the story, it's revealed that Lily and James had troubles during the early part of their marriage (some Lily/Snape there), but not only that, Lily is currently cheating on Snape with Sirius. Good stuff.]]

*** linkffn(Red Sorrow) Yes, I was going to say this one too as that is given as an explanation as to why Snape has a daughter. Although Harry doesn't know and his (half) sister only finds out later in the story so it doesn't have that much of an impact.

Dimensional travel, set mid-DH. The cheating isn't a big focus, though it plays a part in one of the twists. And there are a lot of very good twists and payoffs.

** Oh man, this reminds me of a very bad fic where Lily cheated on James with Voldemort. While i didn't like it, at least this point of it was new and original.

** linkffn(To Reach Without)

So its not exactly what you asked for but its a story where multiple partner marriages arent too frowned upon/too uncommon. Its currently being updated so the whole picture isnt clear yet but Lilly marries both Sirius and James; Sirus for love and James for ulterior motives that arent known yet and its likely that James never knew about.

Takes place fifth year, of course no one tells Harry about this and he finds out through some of Lilly's journals, Sirius only sort of remembers because in the universe dementors literally feed off of your memories, particularly your happiest ones and they dont necessarily come back in full after you leave their presence. So yeah Harry coming to terms with that and with the insights/mystery of the person that Lilly actually was (via the journals) versus the person that Dumbledor and everyone else has always led Harry to think she was is interesting.

Also its a femHarry story. He unintentionally turns himself into a girl in the first chapter via accidental magic. Ive never read femharry before and was hesitant but ive been mostly really enjoying it. The writer sometimes goes a bit overboard with the exposition of how weird shit is when you suddenly turn into a girl/Harrys bologna baggage but thats mostly skimmable/understandable.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
