I know there are plenty of fics where Harry is sorted into a House other than Gryffindor, but I'm wondering if anyone has any fics of Draco getting sorted into a House that isn't Slytherin?

** Oh my gosh a non slytherin Draco? Le gasp! The shame! Can you even imagine it?! Draco being sorted in Hufflepuff and throwing a big fit. His dad coming to the school to say that the sorting hat got it wrong. Everyone in hufflepuff throwing him a welcoming party to make him feel better. Draco being slowly won over with food (lol apple pie? Drapple?) Draco becoming the biggest hufflepuff defender. Draco taking their quidditch team to the finals with top dog turned underdog storyline and learning the value of team work. Draco being told to do bad stuff for Voldemort like canon but when they wanted to turn him in before the big battle He defends Harry. Draco being on the good side during the battle and confronts his daddy issues.

** There is "A reluctant Hufflepuff" by Horrorshow Jane ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7269945/1/A-Reluctant-Hufflepuff]]), but it's abandoned and I can't guarantee it's quality since I only read some of it, and several years ago.

hmm, actually, while looking for a link, not sure that's the right one. I swear I read a ravenclaw!Draco somewhere, though. . .

** The Innocent series has Gryffindor Draco. Essentially Lucius hedged his bet and instructed Draco to become Harry's friend so he'd have a spy in Harry's circle. He didn't really take into account when you tell a kid to make a friend, he might become friends. linkffn(9469064)

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  AU. Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to go back, she can't resist getting involved when she realises her memories may be the key to thwarting Voldemort's plans. But can staying lead to anything but heartbreak for her?

  COMPLETE: Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron, how will she cope? [AU/Dramione] Prevalent alchemy.
