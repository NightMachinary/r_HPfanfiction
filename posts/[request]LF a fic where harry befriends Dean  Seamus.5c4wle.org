In fics where Harry isn't glued to Ron and Hermione, his replacement friends are usually Neville and Luna or Slytherins. Are there any where he befriends Dean and Seamus instead?


** Wow you're asking for something hard here. I mean the only fics with Dean and Seamus were, well, Deamus slash fics. I don't remember of a fic where Harry hangs out with them, sorry.
