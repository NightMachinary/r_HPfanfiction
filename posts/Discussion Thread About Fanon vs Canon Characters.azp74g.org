** My biggest complaints about mischaracterization ultimately come down to one thing: Wish Fulfillment. Aka, people twisting their fanfic protagonists and bashing the antagonists, all for the sold purpose of wanking themselves off. I'm all for using writing fiction as a form of self-expression or stress-relief, and playing around with an existing sandbox to do things that you normally wouldn't be able to do IRL. But when authors go overboard with the self-indulgence, it rarely makes for good storytelling.

Wishful Fulfillment is how we have so many Indy!Harry's who are super rich, powerful, high status, attractive, and have 11 inch wands that ejaculate phoenix tears. And so many Flawless!Hermione's who are super smart, super hot, is always right in every single argument, and has a magic vagina that cures racism, whenever she wants to hook up with Death Eaters or Voldie himself. (Where she doesn't cure racism, she is Shrodinger's Pureblood, able to reveal her secret blood status whenever the plot needs it.)

Other mischaracterizations are annoying, but these two in particular, since they're most often used as protagonists, are the worst cases and the most common.

Basically most of the Harry/Hermione fanfics. Let's not forget Potter-Peverell-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw etc etc etc with twenty different vaults. (Emma Watson)Hermione is never wrong either. The secret pureblood thing is also very annoying. Having a squib ancestor or being distantly related to a pureblood is okay, but other than that I'm out.

**** The secret pureblood thing is the worst, because not only does it stretch my suspension of disbelief, the way the authors go about in their stories is so ridiculous. The top three pureblood families that Hermione is a secret daughter of are the Lestranges, the Blacks, and the Princes.

These are people who care about their bloodlines so much that they make magical tapestries just to track the family tree. In Crimes of Grindelwald, the Lestrange family is revealed to have their own family tapestry similar to the one in Grimmauld Place. And yet we are supposed to believe that Bellatrix and Rodolphus had a daughter that they somehow forgot about for 15 years?

This is also why I find it ridiculous that Bellatrix had Delphini in Cursed Child.

  I'm talking about people constantly misinterpreting and/or contradicting characters' canon personalities way too much that you start to wonder whether these people even read the books or just read fanfics.
#+end_quote

Honestly I think they mainly read fanfics. Or follow the movies, which destroyed Ron and GInny's characters severely. This is the main reason why I think the books should be read (or listened to) before seeing the movies. Ron is my favorite character and he was nearly ruined for me. Dumbledore also gets a lot of flack but it's more tolerable for me because he's older and should know better. Hermione knowing everything is just a cop-out so the writer doesn't have to flesh out their characters or have them think.

**** Michael Gambon's Dumbledore was a bad interpretation of the character, at just about every turn.

It doesn't help in the slightest that they cut out massive amounts of Dumbledore's 1 on 1 monologues with Harry, from the post MoM Prophecy/Love speech, to the apparition of Dumbledore at King's Cross and about 80% of /that/ dialogue. Maybe it was a poor directors choice, or perhaps they didn't think the actors had the chops to pull off those scenes, but it drastically changes the story because of it.

No wonder people question Dumbledore's motives, since he never gets a chance in the movies to explain himself properly.

** Luna often gets what we might call "Reverse Bashing" if she's not portrayed as a Seer (which even then can be written well--/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ has a Luna who has visions, but they're often very vague and Luna's completely bewildered by them).

But often, Fanon takes Luna's role as a victim of bullying and exaggerates it.

In canon, Luna's schoolmates call her Loony, laugh at the way she dresses, and steal her books and clothes--but the narration never implies Luna is forced to walk around Hogwarts barefoot, so it's probably scarves and hats and whatnot.

But in Fanon, the bullying is horrifically extreme. Or if the bullying stays close to canon levels, the retaliation is often far more extreme. It turns into revenge-fueled stories.

Fanon also tends to ignore Luna's virtues--her compassion, exaggerate her quirks--anything involving the Quibbler, and disregard her faults--she's stubborn as a mule.

** I've been on a Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger high recently, and though Tom is described as "charming" (to an extent) in the books, many authors have him smirking, grinning, and going all doe-eyed with Hermione by Chapter 5. I think authors that have him do this are missing the point in that one does not have to grin or smirk to be charming. To me, Tom's charm came from his "humble" upbringing at the orphanage, to his stellar academic record. He'd probably participate in class, showed genuine scholastic aptitude, and had a thirst for knowledge of magic. (Granted, I'm not sure how much charm he showed in Transfiguration with Professor Dumbledore.) It's hard to place Tom's character, but many authors shove him under the romance limelight just because they want him to get with Hermione. It sells both of their characters short and completely ruins Tom for me.

And from what I've read, I've yet to see Tom Riddle "waggle" his eyebrows, and doesn't have sex. Perhaps this is copied and pasted from Draco's archetype because they are both Slytherin, and assuming most writers who champion a Draco/Hermione, Tom/Hermione story are female and they think all "bad guys" are alike?

- Birds of a Feather linkffn(13103526)

** Is it really 'mischaracterisation'? Fanfiction is, by definition, not canon. The whole point is to explore all different aspects of the originals, including if you changed what happened. So if Dumbledore is totally manipulative and evil, then that's just an AU in the same way that Harry being sorted in Slytherin is an AU.

If people were more willing to say "fuck canon, my Dumbledore won't do this", they would write more stories where Dumbledore actually is a wise, good man. So, ironically, it's trying to stay true to canon that leads to this "fanon".

******** Eh, fine... but I don't think it's such a stretch to say that there might have been more to Harry's placement with the Dursleys (and complete isolation) and that it - maybe - didn't just happen solely because of the wonderful blood protections. Quite the opposite in fact.

But Dumbledore defenders jump through quite a lot of mental gymnastics to make the blood protections absolutely infallible and incredible (which is also sufficiently explained by there actually being very little threat to Harry, which is also supported by the apparent incompetence of the remaining DEs), while simultaneously belittling and trivializing the viability of all other protective options, while also ignoring that Dumbledore the great Wizard should be even more resourceful than what I can come up with as a mere reader.

Obviously the placement of Harry with the Dursleys is convenient for Dumbledore in many ways. Other options might have taken a bite into his precious political capital or time.

#+end_quote

I think this was a viable theory up until the end of Deathly Hallows, but I also think that in hindsight, it was really the end of OotP that does the bulk of the clarification. Once we gained all the information and could go back and piece things together, it now seems very unlikely that Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys with anything other than his physical and mental safety in mind and it was ideal not because Harry needed to grow up abused, but because it required the least amount of personal interaction for Dumbledore (aka, I believe Dumbledore wanted to remain unemotional and apathetic towards Harry).

Dumbledore theories vary so much, so I apologize for generalizing, but I feel most theories about Dumbledore involve him needing Harry to be submissive or to "understand love" better than children who grew up in loving homes. From a psychological standpoint this has never made sense to me (because it seems like if either of those had been Dumbledore's goal, he ought to have made it his utmost priority to do precisely the opposite of placing Harry at the Dursleys), but even setting that aside, I still feel many of these theories work under the idea that Dumbledore's plan for baby Harry was the same plan for seventeen-year-old Harry. Kind of like OP says, sometimes I wonder if people even read the books because sometimes I feel like they're forgetting about whole chapters of Dumbledore dialogue. The books suggest that Dumbledore had a different plan for baby Harry that at some point stopped being the plan and then a new plan was created. The end of OotP is Dumbledore admitting that he had had an original plan for Harry, that this plan was not in Harry's personal interest, and that Dumbledore had just realized how utterly he was failing at following through with this plan.

I guess what I mean is, a reader can choose to interpret Dumbledore placing Harry at the Dursleys many different ways, but it's still one part of a larger picture of Dumbledore's character and plot arc and usually people don't bother to ensure their picture of Dumbledore is internally consistent. Many will assume the worst of his individual actions without stepping back to see if those actions make sense with each other. If it's a dislike of Dumbledore that people want, my interpretation of why he left Harry at the Dursleys does not reflect a very moral character, but it makes more sense to me because it accounts for Dumbledore's arc throughout the series, his dialogue in OotP about having failed at his plan, his dialogue in HBP about his discovery of Horcruxes and the fallibility of prophecies, and his dialogue in DH that made his "gleam of something like triumph" in GoF make sense.

I have read some very compelling arguments against Dumbledore in the past, but none that have convinced me for longer than a few minutes.

I'd argue more along the "isolated" route. A Harry who will see the grand old Wizard as his mentor and rescuer (similar to how Voldemort might have seen Dumbledore, if he hadn't bungled that up) is much more malleable. Especially if he has no adults in his life that he can trust or that could guide him in another direction.

Also again, convenience. If Dumbledore had taken more of a personal interest in Harry's situation, he'd have to do much more work concerning security, finding an appropriate magical family, dealing with eventual political fallout etc. pp. Dumping him with the Dursleys is way easier and not contrary to his goals.

Sure! That's irrelevant though. It's not necessary for Dumbledore to have planned for Harry to martyr himself from the beginning. He was just making sure that the prophecy child was under his ultimate control. And what is better for this cause than not involving said child in the magical world at all, housing him with muggles who despise his nature?

This is (mostly) what I said too. There seem to be at least one area we agree on, despite using the idea to get to different conclusions.

But why would there be political fallout? Dumbledore and the Ministry had a relatively diplomatic relationship until 1995, and we are not given any reason to think it was strained prior to that (ignoring the new FB movies anyway, and even if we included that, it was a different Ministry era and therefore still not relevant to 1981). There is no foundation to suggest that Dumbledore's placement of Harry was in any way motivated by politics. It could have been, but it just as easily might not have been and we cannot know one way or the other. Therefore I reckon we should stick with what the books give us (and trust that the books give us what we need in order to determine the answers to our questions). I do not think there is only one right interpretation, I'm only interested in internal consistency and that means accepting that there are multiple internally consistent interpretations. But inventing challenges for these characters is not something I'm interested in. If that is something you're okay with, then we might not be able to find common ground to analyze on.

This theory has never made sense to me either. It is dependent on the idea that Harry sees Dumbledore as his savior despite others being more present not only day-to-day but also at the moment of Harry literally being taken away from the Dursleys. Dumbledore undeniably plays a huge role in Harry's life, but he did nothing to save Harry from the Dursleys (in fact is the one that keeps putting him back there) and also does nothing outside the standard for any witch or wizard living with Muggles. I cannot see that Dumbledore ever attempted to gain credit for saving Harry, and I especially cannot see that he did so in such sufficient quantities as to convince me this was his particular goal. McGonagall signed Harry's Hogwarts letter, Hagrid picked him up from the shack and took him shopping, Hagrid invites him to Friday tea, McGonagall even signed the letter that gives Harry his broom. Dumbledore is as much a presence in Harry's life in the first four months of Harry's re-entry into the Wizarding World as he is to any other student. If Dumbledore wanted Harry to see him as his savoir, then Dumbledore was being remarkably inattentive to that goal. So inattentive, in fact, that Dumbledore didn't even attempt to have a conversation with Harry until four months after Harry enters Hogwarts, by which point being saved from the Dursleys has long since stopped being Harry's immediate concern.

Not only do I fail to see /that/ Dumbledore wanted or tried to be seen as Harry's savior, but I also fail to see /why/ Dumbledore would need to be in order to control Harry, and on top of this, I don't see why Dumbledore even require complete control over Harry in the first place. And Dumbledore never successfully gained control over Harry, in which case Dumbledore strikes out again (unless you think he did?).

A significantly better solution is to be part of Harry's life from the beginning!! And to raise Harry in individual care and support and love! Ah, I do not understand your theory on any level! You said that Dumbledore placed Harry in a manner that requires the least personal effort, but you also say he did this in an effort to eventually be seen as Harry's particular savior. In that case, what changes between Dumbledore placing Harry at the Dursleys and Harry re-entering the wizarding world? If Dumbledore wanted Harry to be neglected in order for Harry to trust him as an authority figure (and thus absolutely ignoring contemporary childhood psychology studies) and if Dumbledore /also/ fails to make any specific impression on Harry upon the kid's re-entry into the magical world, then surely /something significant/ happened within those ten years to change Dumbledore's plan. I would love to hear your explanation of what that change was, and, where possible, the canonical support for it.

You brought this point up a lot in this thread. I don't find this to be a very compelling argument: We know that these things are plot-devices. Yes, the "monster in the chest" is just a plot device to bring Harry and Ginny together. So what?! It's still awful and makes no sense.

Hermione acting completely OOC in HBP? Well it's just a plot device for Harry to be isolated, gotta accept that too, no?

Asserting that these things are plot-devices is a decent observation but adds very little to this kind of discussion.

If he were really of the manipulative!GreaterGood type, he would have neutralized Tom Riddle as early as in 1957.

A major reason why the war dragged for so long and cost the good guys so dearly was that Dumbledore wasn't nearly manipulative and ruthless enough.

With his power, he could have played total hardball politics after Halloween 1981 and nobody would have dared to oppose him. Yet he hadn't and actually let himself be outmaneuvered by Fudge and Malfoy. He was nowhere near as a brilliant manipulative politician should have been.

Those authors who wrote the usual manipulative!Dumbledore obviously have no idea what real manipulations are. "Sun Tzu's Art of War" and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Six_Stratagems][The 36 Stratagems]] are some of the beginner's lessons in manipulations, deceptions, strategies, and warfare.

I do not think he was aware that he was half-assing things until later. It's always in hindsight that these things become clear to him - usually with the force of a anvil to the face. In the moment, he thinks and feels very strongly that he is doing the right thing and also that it is his responsibility to do so and that he is protecting others. I think the first main fault of many readers is to assume Dumbledore is very aware of is own subconscious thoughts. Once a reader realizes that the flaw that prevented Dumbledore from realizing Grindelwald was evil was a flaw that never really went away, Dumbledore suddenly begins to make much more sense.
