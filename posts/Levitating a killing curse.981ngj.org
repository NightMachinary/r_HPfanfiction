Looking for a fic I read a while ago where Harry is on the roof of Azkaban i don't remember what lead to this but I think he's in a fight with riddle and he uses wingardium leviosa on the killing curse in mid air and it explodes. To me this was just crazy I'd never seen an author do anything similar it's quite unique as far as I can tell. If you know the fic let me know what it was! Also any other story's that are somewhat similar to this little interaction? Thanks!


** Linkffn(The lesser sadness by Newcomb)

This has a fight scene at Azkaban but I can't remember if Harry had fought off the killing curse with Wingardium Leviosa. But give it a read even if it doesn't have it. It is good.
