Hi there, Was hoping for some help looking for a fic I read a while ago.\\
I think it was a time travel or dimension travel fic but I'm not too sure. It started out with Harry in a world where everything had gone to shit and muggles, magicals and death eaters were fighting one another. The part I remember most is Harry skinning a muggle that he killed and then using that muggles face as a mask to get into some base that was on a boat. I think the muggles name was Bill or Bob or something similar.\\
I also think that the above happened in the first chapter or 2.

Any help is appreciated, thanks!

Edit: Never mind, found it in an old thread of reccs. Circular Reasoning is the story if anyone cares
