** Charlie does the Foxtrot or Damn the torpedoes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/405757/chapters/669332][linkao3(669332)]]. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with Charlie Weasley.

  Ku'Sox smiled. "I will give you Lucy. That is" - he looked at Trent, silent with Lucy in his grasp - "if Trenton Aloysius Kalamack agrees to take the place of his daughter as my familiar, and you take that curse from me so I might see the sun again."

  Trent stood ashen-faced as Lucy softly complained of nothing. He knew what it was to be a demon slave. I had rescued him from it, and he had saved my life. Now he was going to give his own again to save his daughter, to save two worlds. "Done," Trent rasped, his expression riven with grief as he pushed Lucy into my arms. "Take her, Rachel," he said, his arm stretched out to touch his daughter's hand as he stepped back, his eyes fixed to the little girl reaching back to him. "I say, done!" Trent shouted. "Send them home!" Ku'Sox owns Trent body and soul, a lesson he feels he needs to drive home to be sure the elf understands what it means to be his and the kind of consequences he can expect if he displeases his new master. He means to break his new slave, but Trent is a little stronger than either of them anticipated. Missing scenes for "Ever After". Trigger warnings for torture and Ku'Sox / Trent non-con.
