Dumbledore sighed as he rose to greet the boy who was both his most and least favorite student. "Captain Potter. Please sit down." said Dumbledore. Harry grinned rakishly as he sat in the indicated chair. "Glad to see yah finally remembered that. What's the rub today, Headmaster?" Harry asked brightly. Dumbledore rubbed his eyes wearily, causing Harry to offer him a flask that Dumbledore knew to contain a very expensive rum, likely not obtained legally. Under the circumstances, however, he didn't hesitate to take a generous pull, coughing only slightly as the alcohol burned its way down his throat.

"Thank you. I asked you to come here to discuss the recent shooting of Draco Malfoy. You have been accused of committing said act." Dumbledore informed him solemnly. Harry smirked as he took a pull from the flask. "That a fact?" Harry asked sarcastically. "Quite. Madam Pomfrey pulled a 54 caliber ball from his leg. It was noted that that is the caliber your famous pistols are chambered in." Dumbledore commented.


** "A pox on ye, scurvy-ridden scallywag!" Harry growled as he pulled his pistols from his belt.

Malfoy laughed at him again. "You speak like a mudblooded fool, Potty. What are you going to do with your little toys, hit me?"

Harry levelled his pistol and pulled the trigger. The cap ignited the black powder in the chamber with a huge CRACK, and Draco's wand arm fell to the floor, no longer attached to his ruined shoulder.

Harry repeated the action with his second pistol, and Draco's other arm fell to the floor as well. He pulled his wand and Vanished both of the arms.

"I'm disarmin' ye, ye mealy-mouthed flobberworm! Go be a superior wizard now, ye armless goon!"

*** I don't think you can remove an arm in that manner, at least not with anything in a pistol caliber. At the least, you'd need a shotgun with a very particular choke pattern on it.

***** And what would Draco learn from this? Now he's a cripple that society will have to support for the rest of his life, assuming he doesn't die in agony from either shock, blood loss, or infection in that order. By all means, have Harry shoot the bastard, then causally mention that Muggle arms have come a long way since Harry's smoothbore pistols were popular. He'll walk with a limp or have to make due with a painful left arm for a few weeks, or until someone thinks to Vanish the bone and regrow it. Either way, the memory of the pain will do far more damage than simply turning him into a cripple.

*** No. They dumped him in a port town somewhere on the English coast, and he ended up stumbling through a time portal to the Golden Age of Piracy. From there, he ended up serving as cabin boy to a privateer. When the privateer turned pirate, Harry just got caught up in the danger and excitement.

** On Harry's first evening at Hogwarts he was pulled into Dumbledore's office.

"Mr Potter, in all my time as a Professor at Hogwarts I've never been in this situation. I'm afraid I must expel you for a litany of offences, not least of which include smuggling alcohol onto school property, consuming alcohol on school property, and assaulting fellow students and your teachers with lethal weapons. I have never seen a child so wilfully ignore the most basic rules of civilised society, nor commit at least 3 infractions warranting expulsion within 3 hours of being sorted into their house."

Dumbledore confiscated Harry's wand and snapped it, before a limping Professor McGonagall escorted him off of the castle grounds. Harry considered what had gone wrong, but was unable to understand that acting with total disregard for societal norms was neither clever nor funny.

The end.

Dumbledore keeps dragging Harry back to the school because the prophecy means he needs to keep an eye on Harry and try and keep the Voldemort problem under control.

If people actually think it's shit, wouldn't happen. That's what downvotes are supposed to do - keep the bad prompts from being placed high up in the Hot page.
