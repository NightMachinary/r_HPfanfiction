** The longest single fic I know is linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), but I know for sure that there's another one that's longer still, I just can't remember it.

The Dangerverse is also extremely long. All main fics, one-shots, spin-offs, AUs and crossovers add up to around 3 million.

*** Going to have to tentatively recommend the Dangerverse, but more so Be Careful/other spinoffs. Main Dangerverse somewhat hits Stations of the Canon, and has issues with too many characters and too many plot threads and a certain amount of derailing canon characters and slightly Sue-ish OCs and hints of songfic. It is well-edited, most of the characters are either close to canon or have a good reason for being different, and pretty much every plot point does eventually get tied up, though. Be Careful is a sort-of crossover between Dangerverse (or a Dangerverse-esque world) and Canon, and it's much better on having a focused plot.

I've gotten a little tired lately because the chapters are really long and it's been so long since the last that I've forgotten some of the later plot lines. I think the story is only meant to cover 4th year. Most of the plots will be wrapped up by the end of the Triwizard tournament. The goal was to defeat him before he was resurrected.

** linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) is a fic where Sirius breaks out of azkaban when Harry is 8. The ~500k work fic stretches from that point to when Harry is about to go to Hogwarts. The sequel linkffn(initiate by marauderlover7) clocks in at 175k, linkffn(identity by marauderlover7) is 145, and the current WIP detailing Harry's 3rd year at hogwarts is 17k. So, all told, we're standing at 832k words and there are still almost 5 full books to go. I think it updates on Saturdays.

I am also a big fan of Shaylonnie's debt of time fic that has been mentioned by others.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet.
