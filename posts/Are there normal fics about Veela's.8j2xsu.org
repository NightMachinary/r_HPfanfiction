In Cannon veela's don't have destined mates or anything.


** I'd like to see fics that actually use the actual folklore about them: forest spirits who take the form of beautiful women who take vengeance on those who break the hearts of maidens.

By making them dance until they die of exhaustion.

The world needs a SpiritOfVengeance!Fleur. Or one whose grandmother is.

**** I personaly found it really bad, at least the romance part. Such a lackluster story overall imo.

** There are a couple I know of where Veela are relatively normal, although that isn't really the point of the fic and is just sort of included as background information and world building. The veela is almost never that MC but they are usually a prominently featured nonetheless.

*** Side note, both of these are relatively dark at times and are somewhat slow to build up, a cadmean victory especially. Also, in the Hero and the veela, veela do have some unique traits outside of standard firebird mode, but they are not the type of "mate" things that one normally sees.
