I know that this is pretty out of character for Ron, but I'm looking for a fic where he gets over his issues and proceeds to support harry and maybe even do more work against Voldemort than harry? He is supposed to be an amazing strategist, after all. If you have anything like this I'd be thankful.


** That fits most of my stories - Ron's generally a good friend and a hero in them. You might like "The Dark Lord Never Died", where he is a spy for Dumbledore in a Britain ruled by Malfoy.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Might not be exactly what you're looking for in terms of (canon) /plot/, but otherwise, the Ron in 'The Red Knight' is pretty damn good in terms of emotional maturity and strategy. He's also kind of a badass.

It hasn't been updated in a while, though.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
