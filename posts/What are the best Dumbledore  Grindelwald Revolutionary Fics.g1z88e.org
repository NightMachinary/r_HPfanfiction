I've never read any stories like these before, but I've also never looked for them. I want to see an AU centered around Dumbledore and Grindelwald where they are actively working to make the world they spoke about. Doesn't matter if it has slash or not. I'd prefer it be at the time they're actually starting out and doing this, not one where, say, it takes place during Harry's time after the revolution. I want to see how they go about it together!
