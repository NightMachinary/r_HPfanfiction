I started reading a fic a couple days ago on Ashwinder that I'd somehow missed, and was really loving it, so was excited to finish it up this morning, but the site appears to be down again.

According to IsItDown, it's been down for everyone for over a week, which is odd because I was just reading The Seven Year Wait last night. The livejournal hasn't been updated since May.

Does anyone know how to reach out to the admins outside of LJ? The site goes down fairly regularly now and I'm wondering if there's any way to help. I should've learned my lesson and started saving stories the last time it was down for a year, but I just started this one.

Meanwhile, off to The Petulant Poetess to see if it's archived there.

*** Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com has always been my favorite archive. It's where I first found fanfic at least 15 years ago, and it's where I go to find old favorites and new updates. Every time they have a site issue I'm terrified that it'll never be back.

Petulant poetess is also amazing, and there is some cross linking between the two, but I tend to stay in my SS/HG lane and don't venture out to compare.

Both archives have categories other than SS/HG.

*** Just got it to load. Maybe they had overnight maintenance or something. That's what I get for waking up bright eyed at 3am!
