Hi,

I'm looking for time travel fics, where harry travels back to the first war or during the original order of the phoenix.

Thankss


** As long as your okay with some slash elements, I highly recommend The second string. Harry goes back to the marauders era and just before the war really starts to pick up.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
