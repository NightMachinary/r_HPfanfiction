This subreddit, as a whole, seems to read many fics as though they were novels much more often than the average ffn reader. This is probably pretty common in fandoms with as much fanfic as HP, but as someone who's love of fanfic started elsewhere, this isn't the norm. Fundamentally though, that is not what fanfiction is. It is an episodic story, often closer to that of a TV show than a book or movie. From the author's POV, when they constantly uses similar phrases between chapters or continuously describes Harry as "the green-eyed boy", they aren't doing so every 4000 words. They're doing it every two weeks.

Take bashing for example. Some stories, when you read them all at once, seem like a bashfest. And really, they are. But when bashing is what you (and your readers) want, you're going to probably include it nearly every update. And when that guilty pleasure Idiot!Ron (I still hate this notation btw) fic updates after 7 weeks, you're happy to see Ron asking to fuck Fleur with his mouth full. It doesn't really become over-saturated until you read the same joke back to back to back to back.

I know this won't change most people's opinions, but hopefully it gives some of you at least something to consider. I do realize that the best fics don't have these problems. But the ones that do aren't nearly as bad as you perceive them to be, at least as a biweekly reader.


** Honestly I don't think fanfiction is 'fundamentally' anything - it's whatever you want to make of it. It's true that the majority of stories are posted in an episodic fashion - that's why a lot are never finished - but they are only episodic until they are finished. At which point how else do you approach reading one except as if it were a novel? I approach writing a fanfic as if it was a novel and don't start posting until it is already complete; and when it comes to reading I generally filter by 'complete' as well. I may be in a minority and I'm nobody's target audience, but there are probably more of us than you think.

*** I filter the same as you do. I read so much fanfiction that I like to read the whole story at once because if they're not complete or not updated frequently I confuse the plot and/ or OCs with each other. I generally have to go back and reread to get my bearings again so then I feel frustrated and would rather just wait for the whole thing to be finished.

**** When I'm actively posting I usually update twice a week, though I have tried posting at different intervals. I'm not typical and I don't have much of a readership, but my point is that reading a story chapter by chapter at longish intervals is a particular reading experience, but once the story is finished (and I know there are some that seem to go on forever and ever) it's not episodic any more. At which point if every chapter covers the same sort of ground it is going to be a pretty dull read overall. It's quite possible for a story to work as one but not the other I suppose.

I don't think author's notes are much of an issue unless they are very long, but in the case of 'Here's the next chapter' ones, they are only relevant on the most recent update and I imagine are a bit distracting on previous chapters, so would probably be best edited out in that case. It does surprise me how many people never seem to edit even for errors which have been pointed out in reviews. But that is another issue.

***** Lol it's actually funny that you mentioned this about author's notes. I tend to write (occasionally long) A/Ns at the beginning of my chapters. But every time I post a new chapter, I go back to the previous chapter an erase the parts of the A/N that aren't relevant to the story (which is the whole thing in most cases lol). If there is something relevant, I leave it, but all the "here's the new chapter, thanks for all the reviews, next chapter should be up on Tuesday" stuff that doesn't matter anymore, gone. I actually got really annoyed at the fic a few weeks ago because they had a paragraph at the beginning of every chapter talking about r/l stuff that happened over three years ago....

** I totally agree with this but... As a writer (and not a very good one by my own estimation) there are things we can do to alleviate some of this. For example, plotting out a story ahead of time so you don't end up with five chapters of filler. Posting warning that yes there will be shameless Ron/Dumbledore/Snape/whoever bashing. Or, one of the things I do is to read the entire story (or for a really long fic, the five most resent chapters) before writing/posting the next chapter. So I know if I just made that joke or used that reference. Honestly, my biggest annoyance with fics comes from things that could have been fixed with a big of attention. Obvious spelling/grammar/punctuation issues, too much filler where nothing happens, too much exposition (I'm guilty of that one myself), storylines that don't mesh well, time lines that don't line up... I've actually started keeping a calendar for my fics, so that I can look back and be like "ok this thing happened last Tuesday, so that's been just over a week for the character.

I guess my point is that I don't understand why people don't put more effort into what they publish.

At a guess (and from my point of view as well) it's because for a lot of fanfiction writers, it's a casual hobby. Don't get me wrong, I get annoyed by writers who don't bother to correct spelling/grammar/punctuation as well, and I generally don't read fanfiction that is riddled with such errors. But a lot of people post fanfiction merely as a casual past time because it's something that they enjoy doing. Obviously this has the downside of a lot of fanfiction being of low-middling quality, and often unfinished, but that's the nature of the system isn't it? No one is getting paid for what they are publishing, and therefore the only standards they have to live up to are their own. For some people the amount of time they would spend editing an entire 30-70K word work isn't worth said time because they are doing it for their own enjoyment, and nothing else.

I don't think that's all of it. Some people, even when they create stuff as a hobby, do not accept shoddy half-done thing as a finished product. So I'd say it's more about having creator's pride or not having it.

***** Well, it's like I said, because fanfiction authors aren't being paid to write, the only standards they have to live up to are their own. For some people spelling/grammar/punctuation errors aren't a big deal, and their fanfiction becomes a product of such standards.

I guess my take on it is if you are reading a story with lots of such errors then probably go find something else to read. Because unless they state in an authors note that they are learning English as a second language or something and looking to improve as they write, their writing is likely to remain pretty bad.

** In this in response to something? I agree that fanfic is actually serial in nature - in fact I've complained that not enough authors do some type of recap or transition to help re-acquaint the reader after a break. However, when I see people complain about phrases like "green eyed wizard" being used, it tends to be more about the fact that it's repeated several times within a scene or chapter and that it's a descriptive phrase that would only be used once or very sparingly in normal conversation.

** I'm actually thinking about writing a chapter of my fanfic on Christmas Day and also on Thanksgiving as a "holiday special" like how some episodic TV shows function. Of course, I should probably polish my story and make it presentable before then, but still, something to consider.

*** Exactly, Fanfiction is by definition, no more or less then what the author makes of it. I've never understood the fanfiction readers that open a story and seem to feel like they are entitled to seeing/not seeing certain tropes play out in the *author's* story. Or who feel like they need to complain every time a character acts OOC in a fiction despite author notes sometimes explicitly stating "this character will be OOC." If you see something you don't like happening in the fiction you are reading, then please, close the story and go find something else to read, but don't leave me a scathing and sometimes incomprehensible review about my story being terrible because of plot devices I decided to use.
