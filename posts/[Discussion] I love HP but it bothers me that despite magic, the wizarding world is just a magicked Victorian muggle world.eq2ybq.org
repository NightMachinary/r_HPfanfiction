Honestly, one of the things that makes HP so special to me is the sense of wonder at the idea of going to school and learning /magic/. That somehow secretly there's a world full for these fun ridiculously OP people and they can literally change reality for everyday mundane tasks.

But then, a few years later, I re-read the books a bunch of times and something started to niggle at my mind. For all the magic they can do, for all the limitless possiblities, the story rarely shows a world that's actually /affected by magic/. Sure they don't have common sense and they're basically ignorant of everything muggle, but the story treats magic like a tool despite alluding to how casually they're supposed to use it.

This is why certain fanfics attracted me in the first place, like linkffn(curls & kisses) or linkffn(to reach without). Their world building is gorgeous.

I can't help but feel that if magic was real and there really were wizards and witches, their history, their lives, and their culture would be different, and fascinating. Their social norms and regular lives would be... I can't find the word I want, but it would be different yet familiar, if you know what I mean? Like I sincerely believe their use of magic would mean their gender norms would be radically different. There would be equality but in a different way to ours. And no I don't mean that Lord/Lady BS. I want to see more of that in fanfic, or if you can recommend something I'm all ears (I prefer fics that don't focus on the Defeat Voldemort, and more about fluff and magic and ya know).


** My headcanon for why the Wizarding World looks like a magicked Victorian Muggle world?

They peaked early.

Think about it; by the Middle Ages when most non-magicals were still trying to figure out that showering regularly was important, the Wizarding world had magic. Magic brought about a higher standard of living. Even the poorest people we see in canon (Weasleys) have food, clothes and a roof over their heads. It's a /luxury/ poverty, not a /necessity/ poverty. This gave wizards a huge advantage, along with the equal rights for women, education for all and a stable economy. If anything, the Muggles copied wizards in those days (Wizard=wise and Muggle=gullible, so they must have been doing something right, according to the non-magicals) and wanted the comforts of magic. Comforts they couldn't have. During and after the Plague, the envy that non-magicals had for their wizarding counterparts must have hit an all-time high (the condensending attitude towards Muggles by wizards didn't help much) and so the witch hunts began. The beginning of the hunts prompted wizards to slowly start hiding away until the Statute was signed in 1689 and put into effect in 1692.

Afterwards, non-magicals had to find a way to 'prove' magic never existed, and then came the Renaissance. Enlightenment. Technology. Ways to at least try to replicate magic. And they did, so much so that wizards took notice (radio, Knight Bus, Camera, Hogwarts Express, etc) and took their inventions.

Not to take away from your overall point, but the frequency of the average person's baths didn't change between the early middle ages and the mid 20th century. Before ~1950 a common british house wouldn't even have had a proper bathroom, nevermind a shower or hot water from a tap.

The average englishman would take a heated bath once a week, usually in the same water their family had already used and would spend the rest of the week using a sponge. Quite in the same way a peasant in 1200 would.

If done properly, and to the best of my nonexistent knowledge, it's not significantly worse than the full bath, and uses less water.

*** Ooh that's genuinely a good counter argument, I still think there should be more differences in their culture due to availability of magic, but I will begrudgingly agree that you made Canon make a little bit more sense.

Reminds me of a fanfic actually that was canon-world compliant, but sought out to explain things like this. They get this DADA proff that tells them about the reason behind the secrecy statute. Can't remember the name though, it was incomplete.

*** That's where you're wrong though. For example, having magic alone would bring about gender equality for witches and wizards, the way technology has for muggles.

Being able to use magic means witches would be able to greatly reduced the time and effort it takes to take care of a household and children.

Being able to use magic would also mean physical differences are negligent since magical ability is gender-neutral and therefore wizards aren't inherently stronger than witches. As much as it pains me to admit it, physical differences between men and women for us muggles did bring about some of the inequality.

Furthermore, wizards and witches are extremely unlikely to follow sexist traditions brought about by religion, specifically Western Christianity in it's various puritanical forms. In fact is eager they'd do the opposite.

  Except that canonically that isn't the case
#+end_quote

except OP is arguing that Canon is fundamentally flawed. If magic has been around forever the whole foundation of magical society will be different. EVEN WITH living among muggles for the majority of history and pre-history, bits of magical only culture will form, and will rapidly expand and spread with the official separation with the implementation of the Statue.

Just the fact that in general magicals live longer lives would have drastically changed how magical culture developed and spread. multiply that by the 2000 years from prehistory and history before say 300CE when Christianity rose to prominence in the Roman Empire, and thus the hardcore opposition to *all* magic is spread to large part of the world.

I would imagine that in the 900s Godric, and other magcials would have been better at blending in with muggles as the worlds were tied much closer together and they don't want to scare off the muggles that they need to interact with. Hence he could use a sword and they built with stone and mortar. and maybe he just liked using a sword. Mad Jack Churchill famously fought in WW2 with a claymore and longbow. so just because better stuff is out there, wands/rifles doesnt mean everyone is going to use them.

  But I'm also a big proponent of reunified the two worlds in fics so I tend to view things through the les of ‘We're not so different, you and I' rather than elevating one or the other above each other. Just a personal preference.
#+end_quote

fair enough, but the magic discoveries being a progression doesn't mean that the worlds would be that similar.\\
people were still discovering things in prehistory, and just with magic giving magicals longer life magical research would surge ahead of muggle research, unless a magical dedicated themselves to muggle research and there probably were. Like Herpo created the first known horcrux in Ancient Greece, thats roughly 400 years before Ceasar. being immortal gives you a ton of time to experiment.\\
and if we accept that lack of common sense of wizards being related to the innate randomness of magic then the lack of a scientific method wouldn't be a detriment to magical research and might be a boon.

Add in ghosts that could remain behind and teach new magical researchers, like there's no way a magical researcher hasn't died in an accident and remained behind because he wasn't done with his experiment. there's no way the magical world and muggle world are that similar that after 400 years of pure separation the magicals are just living like muggles from 400 years ago.

I actually don't think an even more separated Muggle and Magical world would be a problem for a reunification fic because as you said, magicals are still humans, so the root of conflicts in both worlds and between them are the same and magic can't fix it in either world.

***** I think it's because all the powerful women I can think of are childless. The families we see the best example of - the Weasleys - are a very traditional family. Ginny isn't allowed to fly because she's a girl, Molly stays home with the kids, Arthur's the breadwinner, Molly doesn't go on missions but just cooks for the order and acts as a housekeeper. Even Molly vs Bellatrix was sexist - JK wanted Bellatrix put down by a loving maternal housewife to contrast the two women and their lifestyle choices.

Obviously Molly chose that life, and was happy with it, but we don't really have any other examples of working mothers apart from cursed child - and that's set today, where it's normal anyway.

(There might be someone really obvious I'm missing. But point is, if you want a career, you apparently don't have kids, for witches.)

That's not exactly representative of all wizarding culture. Most of the other characters, male or female, that we see during all 7 books are either school aged, or we just don't see much of their private life at all.

I can't speak to outside sources, like I know Rowling has given tons of background information that apparently never made it into the books, but canonically there's not really a lot of reason for us to see women with children.

We do know that Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all of whom prove themselves capable, all go to eventually have kids. Tonks had a kid and was an auror, and it didn't stop her from fighting in the war.

To my knowledge, we don't know what the familial status is of pretty much the rest of the side characters.

Umbridge is horrid, and I can't imagine anyone putting up with her long enough to start anything resembling a family. But to each their own.

Amelia lost a lot of family in the war, which would seem to me to make her the biggest candidate for wanting to grow a large family of her own, but like many career driven women, it seems like she might have wanted to put it off until a better time. She's unfortunately killed before that can happen.

Madame Maxine is a half giant like Hagrid, which likely makes any dating or courting exceedingly difficult.

I know nothing of Sprout's home life outside of the school, or any of the other teachers, really. Burbage is only mentioned long enough to kill off, Hooch only shows up for flying lessons and as a referee, Sinistra also pretty much only shows up for Astronomy, Pince and Pomfrey are both also rather older, similar to McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank is a substitute, and Vector is only ever mentioned by name. I don't think she shows up personally in the books ever.

And Bagnold, quite honestly, I didn't even realize was a woman. That character stops being relevant before the book even starts, more or less.

I also wouldn't label any of these women aside from McGonagall and Bones as being particularly powerful. They all seem very average at best.

** I think there's a few different responses to this.

*Wizarding Britain isn't very Victorian*

This is commonly stated in the fandom, but it's very much a fandom rather than canon thing. I'm struggling to identify a single thing in canon that is "Victorian".

For example, people often talk about robes as being old fashioned. But they're not really. At no point in British history did laypeople wear robes as their everyday clothes.

At most I think you can point to Diagon Alley being a cobbled street with lots of independent shops, or the Hogwarts Express being a steam train. But these are incredibly superficial things.

And in lifestyle, wizards are not Victorian at all. For example, wizarding dating culture is pretty much identical to Muggle dating culture in the 1990s.

*Most wizards are bad at magic*

Most wizards are fine with daily household spells and the magic they need for their profession, but it seems like most wizards can't cast most spells.

This rings true:

- It reflects Muggle levels of academic attainment, with most students being quite bad at most subjects.

- It is similar to how most Muggle adults wouldn't be able to do (for example) basic trigonometry once they're a few years out of school.

So when you look at wizarding society, you can't be looking at it as if every wizard is a Dumbledore. Rather, the typical wizard is probably a lot more like Lockhart (good at one thing, useless at most other things).

*The idea that wizarding Britain is backwards is often based on values that make little sense in the wizarding world*

People have a tendency to look at the most superficial of appearances and jump to conclusions. Wizards wear robes, they occupy buildings made of traditional materials, they don't build grand monuments; they don't build infrastructure - therefore they are backwards.

But this is a mindset very much embedded in a Muggle perspective, and a modernist, consumerist Muggle perspective at that.

So for example: yes, wizards could use magic to build giant skyscrapers which dwarf Muggle ones and choose not to. Is this really a sign of being backwards? Or is it rather a reflection of different cultural values?

Wizards do not seem to share the "bigger is better" mindset of Muggles, and why would they? Magic completely disconnects a thing's outward appearance from its utility. You could have a small cottage that has as much interior space a penthouse.

I actually like the idea that in wizarding culture, making things look shabby on the outside is considered a sign of class; only the most gauche of Muggle-lovers would think that the way a place appears from the outside is in any way indicative of its true value.

I conclude with a section from Victoria Potter, from the summer between first and second year:

#+begin_quote
  The Muggle world felt /wrong/.

  Hogwarts was filled with nooks and crannies, hidden alcoves and spiral staircases, but everything was neatly rectangular at Number Four, Privet Drive. The anemic electric lights were a pale imitation of a flickering, crackling fire, and the front garden was little more than a patch of grass, not a single blade out of place, its perimeter brimming with meticulously arranged flowerbeds. Just like everything else in the Muggle world, there was nothing wild there, nothing truly /alive/.

  Claustrophobia was setting in, and Victoria found herself longing for wide, open spaces---forests and valleys and sprawling castles perched atop tall cliffs. Little Whinging's park offered some respite, but even that felt cramped, the busy road never out of sight. She was therefore jumping at every chance to leave the house, accompanying Petunia on trips to the bank, post office or the shops.

  When they weren't out and about, she was put to work in the garden, weeding, watering and planting new flowers. It was awfully dull compared to herbology---the Muggle plants didn't even fight back when you pruned them---but under Victoria's magical touch the garden had blossomed to become the envy of the neighbourhood. As word spread, Petunia's friends began visiting for afternoon tea with increasing regularity.

  "Never seen roses that colour before," they would say, "bright purple! A new breed, is it?" Or: "Tulips in July! Well I never!" No doubt Petunia suspected that Victoria was doing something unnatural, but she seemed content to feign ignorance so long as the garden continued to draw admiring comments from the members of the Little Whinging Garden Association.

  For her part, Victoria hadn't intended to use herbology---it had just slipped out, an instinct that was difficult to control. She wasn't even sure if she could tell the difference, now, between magical and non-magical handling of plants. Was stamping on the soil to summon worms magic, or was that something Muggles did too?

  [...]

  Vernon left for work, and soon enough Petunia drove Victoria down to Great Whinging high street, where a number of charity shops were to be found. As they looked for a parking space, once again Victoria was struck by the strangeness of the Muggle world, all concrete and plastic and glass. It was as if the Muggles were determined to kill off all connection to nature.

  She had been thinking about this a lot over the summer. Muggle technology depended on the laws of nature, and yet Muggles seemed so disconnected from everything green and living. Meanwhile, wizards lived in close contact with the natural world, even though their powers continuously defied it. At first Victoria thought that it was simply because wizards didn't need things like electricity and roads, but her time in the garden had made her rethink that idea. Magic was supernatural, yes, but it was also closely connected to nature. It was an interesting contradiction.

  [...]

  The broom was just skimming the top of the white, fluffy clouds, so close that their feet could almost touch them. Through the gaps in the clouds she could glimpse the world far below, the buildings and roads so small that they could have been a toy model, and though the sight made her feel quite dizzy, she couldn't help but keep looking.

  As they made their way north over London, Victoria noticed something interesting: though there were in fact very few clouds, their route never took them into clear skies where Muggles might spot them. It was as if the clouds formed a constantly shifting network of roads in the sky, acting to conceal them from view.

  She began to relax. The sun and wind had dried her out quickly, and now the broom was level she could sit back in the saddle without having to clutch it with her thighs. At first she didn't think they were going that fast---certainly the breeze wasn't too strong---but when she risked another glance down, she noticed that the clouds where zooming past beneath them, faster than any car. They quickly left London behind, the urban sprawl giving way to farmland dotted with small towns. Victoria took a deep breath of the cool, clean air. At last she was out of the crowded Muggle world with its smog and litter. /This/ was where she belonged.

*** You made some good points. You're right it isn't Victorian, I guess I got affected by the one too many Lord/Lady fics. I do like what you pointed out about mentality.

Victoria Potter is one of those fics that have amazing world-building, the kind of world-building I want to see, but with a plot that I personally couldn't enjoy and bashing of characters that I can't enjoy. That said I've read up to the latest chapter anyway just because of the world-building. That teardrop potion thing was fascinating.

Most wizards are bad at magic, sure, but the way you described them, it's almost like they should live as muggles who can do a cleaning spell. That honestly sounds so mundane and... Well, it ruins the idea of magic.

I could be wrong, but what I find fascinating about the premise of Harry Potter is that this is a world where they use magic every day as if it's just a mundane thing, as if their wand is just an extra limb. The great wizards are those that invent new magic or research highly complex things, or can do fantastic battles, but the everyday wizard is a person who has his whole household automated with a wave of a wand, who can travel large distances with a thought, who for the most part does not have to worry about most muggle dangers like wild animals or starving, who can build themselves a house and manipulate the internal dimensions.

Maybe that's too OP, sure. But honestly? I'd rather that over a real-life copy but with Magic™ (that's practically useless for you unless you're then next coming of Merlin).

Honestly, when Im reading about the Magic world, I wanna feel like "yeah, I'd love to be a regular magical and go to Hogwarts" rather than feel like "well, you know this is kinda similar to technology and me studying a CS degree and it's just as boring and annoying".

Mini rant: but frankly, other than the spark of an idea of having wizards and witches in this particular way, JKR has fucked up too much from normalizing the idea of forgiving abuse, forcing kids back there, and literally insisting that blood relation is important, to fumbling up the world building, the glaring plot holes, the mis-characterisations (I mean really, the Hat tells Harry he should be in Slytherin then Harry proceeds to use 7 books to show he is not cunning or even attentive?), The disgustingly neo-liberal views espouted such as everything is instantly alright once the big bad guy is gone, not like there was a year of hunting muggleborns and killing off non-wizard-nazis. Also, Ron and Hermione is a clear example of what abusive or at the very least terrible relationships start off as. At best it's hate sex in a bickering marriage. It's not right that this is what we grew up with thinking is okay.

******* Yeah I figured, I will still try to read Patron at some point in the future, should I ever regain the ability to read painful things. I really do enjoy your work though, keep it up!

** This post will probably ramble on a bit, since I'm basically thinking it through as I write it, so here goes.

The magic of the canon universe seems to shift wildly between being whimsical/fantastical and rigid/predictable. A large, LARGE part of this in my opinion is how JKR decided to write her magic system. She wrote it as a hard magic system, but writes like it's a soft magic system.

In a hard magic system, there are clearly defined rules, costs, and limits to what magic can do. In HP, this translates to a spell can only do what it was created to do. Lumos cannot create a laser beam of light, nor can it lift a heavy object. There are other rules, like “it's impossible to truly raise the dead or create love,” things like that. Potions as a discipline is pretty much entirely a hard magic system.

In a soft magic system, the rules and limits to magic are incomprehensible. For example, in Lord of the Rings, it's never really clear exactly what Gandalf/Sauron/Sauruman can and cannot do with magic. When a soft system of magic is used, the writer must be very careful to avoid making it the solution to every problem the characters encounter.

Now, JKR takes her hard magic system, and just adds whatever bits she needs to progress the plot. There are so so many potions and spells that she casually adds out of hand that could be horrifically abused, and when she gets called on it, comes up with shit on the spot to explain it away. Veritiserum is probably the most irritating example (a truth serum that is able to be fooled easily enough to make it useless unless the plot says otherwise), but love potions are near as bad. Fanatical, illogical, all consuming need to please someone? And is easy enough to brew that the twins can mass produce it for sale? Absolutely terrifying.

Got off point there - SO to OP's point, I feel like the “magic” of magic died in small steps as the books progressed and JKR shifted from books for kids to books for young adults. She added more restrictions, took away the whimsy. There's a lot more mention of casual displays of magic in the earlier books - Harry's introduction to the Burrow stands out in particular.

As much as Fantastic Beasts is annoying story wise, it also gave us the best examples of what adult witches and wizards using magic should look like. The MACUSA was able to completely repair all the damage that was done to the city in minutes.

I think something people generally take out of context is the “shield hats” quote from one of the twins - where they comment that most people can't manage a shield charm. I think this has less to do with the aptitude of your average magic user and more to do with the curse on the DADA professor's post, combined with the fact that a large portion of students - those intending not to go into law enforcement, for example - probably drop DADA after their OWL year (or at least they would when there's no active war with a Dark Lord going on).

Argh tangents. MY POINT IS, magic was more magical before JKR decided it shouldn't be to drive the plot forward. Things like “magic can't make food” so that the trio would be starved so Ron would leave for a bit; “Veritiserum isn't infallible” because otherwise all the Death Eaters would be locked up and Sirius wouldn't have been. JKR was less focused on consistent world building and more on telling a story.

*** Yes yes yes! Thank you! You've verbalized EXACTLY what I've been feeling.

There's a bit more that I feel you didn't mention like the cultural and social impact of magic, but what you wrote is bloody fantastic and clearly expressed, thank you.

That said, thank you for introducing me to the concept of soft and hard magic systems. I've been trying to find a way to express what I see and my annoyances about this but I couldn't find a way to describe it.

** I think that if Rowling had intended for the series to be directed at an adult audience, she'd probably done a lot more regarding world building. But since it's (in the end) meant for children, there really wasn't any point in doing so because it would only confuse the young readers.

She is slowly building up on that world though, but through Fantastic Beasts instead. I hope the 3d movie will show us more about the international relations of wizardkind, even if it is set in the 1920s.

Fortunately there's always us fanfic writers who are ready to apply our own ideas on her limited universe. :)

** I like the idea that because we see things through Harry's (unobservant) eyes that there are things going on that we aren't aware of. I also headcanon that Gryffindor, as Dumbledore's house, and by extension, as much of the school that Dumbledore can influence as possible - is more accessible to muggleborns and less traditionalist in terms of magic than the other houses might be, following his lead or command. (conveniently enough for our muggle-raised hero)

Following my headcanon, this actually means that people like some of the Slytherins we see have a point - the kids, at least, and some of the adults. Of course, some of them take it to extremes of racism and terrorism, and they have attitudes of prejudice. But the same could be slung at Hermione 'wizards-have-no-logic'/'Divination is all rubbish' Granger - those are attitudes she has brought from her muggle upbringing and hasn't challenged within herself within a new environment where they might not be quite accurate. (for example, this isn't a bash - Hermione is the only muggleborn character we see in any depth)

For an in-canon example, I don't remember which fic pointed this out (probably whitesquirrel, it sounds like that kind of observation), but there's zero indication that there are separate changing rooms for boys and girls playing Quidditch. The Gryffindor team frequently have team meetings all together in the one changing room before going out. This fic took that as-was and suggested that there aren't actually such separate norms of gender roles in the witching world, and that those are a muggle quirk. (as an aside, a lot of that Lord and Lady/gender roles stuff is complete fanon, and quite recent fanon too)

Anyway, back to my headcanon, I imagine that actually in Slytherin and perhaps Ravenclaw, things /are/ done quite differently, and its only the moderating influence of Dumbledore that mutes them out in public. Where, of course, they see muggleborns being /indulged/ while their own ways of doing things are quashed. Naturally, that breeds resentment.

I guess the alternative is that 1 in 4 kids in this world is just all bad and rotten to the core.

*** For all we know the quidditch locker rooms are all separate bathrooms around a common room. Or at least separate showers.

The inferred egalitarian aspect there is a bit overshadowed by the dorm stairs not letting boys up(or is that fan on?).

**** True, but that might be more about bedrooms being a more obvious place for sex than what seems to be a public space - the orgies are definitely fanon!

*** That's an interesting headcanon, don't fully endorse it bc I think it's a bit of a stretch that Dumbledore would be censoring purebloods like the ferret, but I can see a fanon world built where we get more details like that with Little details like dorm segregation and stuff like that. and yeah I would say that a huge part of the lack of world building is due to Harry being an inattentive little Berk (and JKR being a shit writer).

Could you please find that fic you mentioned? It sounds right up my alley and I would very much like to read it.

** I agree it is frustrating when the wizarding world is treated as simply an underground society rather than an actual world

one of the best of fanfics is where we see actual world building and actual wizarding culture rather than a mirror of the muggle world

check out linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11502532/1/Breath-of-the-Inferno]]) its abandoned but it has a great start to the world building

I use Text to Speech so the slightly 'miss-spelled' names worked really well to create uncomfortable feelings, to me that whole world felt /magical/ in an unsettling way.
