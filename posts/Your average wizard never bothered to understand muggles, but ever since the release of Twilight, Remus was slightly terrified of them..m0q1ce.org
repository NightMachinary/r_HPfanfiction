** A sadistic part of me wants to read about Harry watching RWBY.

"Okay, so this girl with a special power she doesn't know about goes to a school where the eccentric headmaster takes a special interest in her. She keeps running into a villain's white-masked minions, and eventually the school is attacked by said minions, the mysterious, eccentric headmaster is killed, and she sets out on a journey to collect some items so she can kill the villain which killed her mother, aided by her dim but funny +best friend+ stepsister and a smart +muggleborn+ catgirl. The cast also includes a rich brat on a redemption line, a loser who suddenly mans up and wields a sword, along with a weird, quirky girl. Hermione, can we sue for copyright?"

** I think this could really work played seriously. Eg, Remus could be deeply split on the new growing popular conception of werewolves---happy that magical society newcomers are less likely to see werewolves as monsters and more likely to preconceive of werewolves as desirable and attractive rather than a burden on the people around them, but unhappy at the fetishization and the trivialization of the real life^{⟨f/ Remus's point-of-view⟩} plight and struggles of werewolves. It could really work as an element of a post-canon~Next Generation fic following post-war pushing to reform magical society.
