I recently read this wonderful fic by aethen I think on ao3, but it could have been on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

Idk if this is a spoiler or not:

Basically, it starts off with Harry and Severus having to continue their occlumency lessons, but Severus suggests they take out their memories of each other so that they can have more /healthy/ lessons, I guess. They get a lot closer and the characterization between the Severus and Harry is just amazing. It felt believable to be honest.

I really want to find more fics like this one. Help me out?
