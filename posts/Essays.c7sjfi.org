What are the best essays relating to HPFF you've seen? I know there are a lot on tumblr/livejournal so they're hard to search for. Primarily interested in discussion of character motivations, arguments for and against ships, apologism for shitty character behavior, etc


** Before the HP Wiki, there was the hp-lexicon.org, which remains a better-annotated and sourced reference to the HP canon, depending on your definition of it.

They have several [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/category/essays/][essays]] that cover a variety of arguments that have risen in the fandom over the years. One of my favorites is '[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/][Secrets of the Classlist]]'- the essayist proceeds from the assumption that JKR's original 40 classlist is meant to accurately reflect the population of the UK in the early 90's, and so allocates the regional, economic, an even the religious background of Harry's year.

** Another few essays I keep bookmarked:

[[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Location_Location/Spinners_End.htm][Spinner's End]] - tries to pin down Snape's home town and the layout of his house.

[[https://avphibes.livejournal.com/378048.html][Why ladies love Severus Snape]] - classic comedy piece explaining to the confused male fan why female fans carry a torch for 'a gnarly old goth who's a dick to everyone.'

** I enjoyed this [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm][essay]] which examines various fanon elements pervasive in the fanfiction community.

** [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][This essay]] is a very comprehensive argument for why Harry/Hermione wouldn't have worked.

*** I'm not all the way converted but that was really good.

I didn't really realize the extent to which Harry is a better person in nearly every fanfic I've ever read than he is in canon/ how much of a wanker he is in canon.

**** Harry can be quite mean. For example at beginning of OOTP, he was pissed at Ron and Hermione NOT writing him about what he wanted know (BIG MISCONCEPTION in the fandom: they still wrote him often, but was advised by Dumbledore not to write anything about the Order and Voldemort), so he retaliated by ordering Hedwig to peck on their hands. When they finally met, it was all caplock Harry.

***** Not to try and put too much effort into defending Harry there, but he was angry that their letters was a whole lot of words saying nothing. Which IIRC was what had annoyed him. The only thing he got from it was that Ron and Hermione was at the same place, and that was about it.

*** [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html][This one]] is specifically quite critical of the most radical Harmonians. It is from the height of the shipping wars, so it is quite aggressive, you should tone it down considerably, but it gets some quite good points in it.

**** I personally consider shipping wars ridiculous. Hermione and Ginny are both great girls, and given different circumstances, Harry could get together with either of them or even both (!).

***** I didn't mean it as a comment on the shipping wars (I agree, they are ridiculous), but just as a reminder that the essay is a bit over the top.

** All of Red Hen's essays! You can find them in the sidebar on [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/potterverse.html][their site]] under the "Concerning the Potterverse" and "The Potterverse UNhallowed" sections. Most of them were written pre-DH and a few were even pre-HBP, but they stand up remarkably well even after the series was finished.

*** This is awesome!

Interesting excerpt:

"And for those who sniff and mutter yes, but that for every clever Muggle-born or known halfblood that Horace ever adopted, there were probably a dozen high-status brats with nothing to recommend them but their family names, I answer; yes. That is the whole point of the Slug Club. Those overpriveliged little puppies are the kids who really need that Club. And throughout Snape's term in the office they haven't been getting it.

Which has only made the whole situation worse.

Who else is going to teach those little “scions” the responsibilities that their place in the pecking order entails. Their families? They are only with their families for a couple of months of the year. You don't turn out any kind of a viable future “ruling class” without giving it a solid grounding in the duties of their high position, as well as the benefits."

I can very easily imagine an alternate history with all seven years of Slughorn and a divide among the slytherins between pure-blooded bigotry and self-interested desire to invest in talented muggleborns instead of the obnoxious unanimity we got in canon.
