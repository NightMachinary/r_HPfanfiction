:END:
This one has been earwigging me for a week or so, but I can't remember the name for the life of me. I remember reading this a good 10 years ago, around the time Dangerverse was being finished. I remember it being AU, James and Lily survived but Harry is still BWL. He has a younger sister Rose, who eventually dates Neville. Neville himself dates Lisa Turpin for a while I think, before she gets killed in during a Hogsmeade visit. R/Hr date, break up for a bit and get back together again sometime around 5th/6th year I think? It's all a bit fuzzy.

I seem to remember the author had some personal stuff to deal with and the story didn't get updated for a while, and I've never found it since. Anyone able to lend a hand?

** Is it Harry Potter and the Twists of Fate by benperez? Lily & James survive, Harry is BWL, they have a daughter after him named Rose. Harry & Ginny, Hermione & Ron, and Neville and Rose are the 6 main characters, so it makes sense that Neville and Rose end up together. It's also an incomplete series.

  Harry's parents didn't die that Halloween night, they even had a daughter just after going into hiding, and the Weasleys took care of Harry and his sister after the attack by Voldemort. Now what?

*** YES this is it! Thank you!

Sad to see that it never got finished, but I guess that's the way with so many fics that we enjoy...
