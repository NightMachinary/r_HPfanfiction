I'm stuck with some bad writer's block and want to do a fanfic for HP but I need a good starting place. I've really enjoyed stories that are for want of a nail (where one small thing goes differently and everything changes because of it). I'd like to write a fic like that taking place at the beginning of Order Of Phoenix and Harry's fifth year. If y'all could give me some prompts for that I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!


** A pretty simple one, though not necessarily one implemented early on. Harry actually uses the communications mirror he gets. Maybe have Sirius give it to him during the Summer, or still during Christmas but have him explain what it is and not be so vague. Or have Harry actually open it instead of being worried about Sirius. Hell, he'd just been kidnapped last year, it might be good to have a way for Sirius to get to him. If Sirius hadn't been so vague and Harry so paranoid about Sirius coming out of hiding for him, the entire end of OotP wouldn't have happened, and Sirius wouldn't have died. That could have a pretty big impact on the rest of the series.

** What if Umbridge didn't go all "heavy-handed crazy torturing dictator" but worked to turn Hogwarts against Harry and Dumbledore by being charming and politically shrewd? And tries to use competent DADA lessons (with heavy involvement of Aurors every week to make up for her own lack of skills) to win the hearts and minds of the students?

Alternatively, Harry actually manages to keep his temper in check and doesn't blow up at Umbridge. Instead, the trio undermines Umbridge by fopcusing on her failures as a teacher.

** Or what if harry semi lost his trial at the minestry? He got kicked out of Hogwarts but didnt lose his wandrights (last heir potter, triwizard emancipation, whatever would alow it) and now has to figure out how defeat Voldemort, while doing selfstudy, or beeing "forced" to go to another school (reverse trope? Harry wants to stay and fight but is forced to change schools?)

** On the Hogwarts Express, one of the Ravenclaws quietly asks Harry what went down at the Graveyard because Dumbledore didn't give any details while the Ministry and Prophet all but imply that Harry offed Cedric, which said Ravenclaw didn't believe after 4 years with Harry. So Harry explains what had happened and the Ravenclaw is all supportive once Harry gets to the gritty details. So they keep talking, the topic changes, and without them noticing, it's dark and they are 10 minutes out of Hogsmeade station.

Can be used as the first step to a romance when said Ravenclaw and Harry simply talk more and more, become friends first and date afterwards. I don't think that this could work for a Harry/Cho fic though because Cho was too heavily invested in the situation and we saw that she didn't cope well with Cedric's death at all. Padma, Sue Li, Morag McDougal, Lisa Turpin or Mandy Brocklehurst, hell Terry Boot for all I care yes, but not Cho, not with that scenario.

Or keep it platonic and explore how the year would change if Harry had more people in his corner since the Ravenclaw would undoubtedly share that knowledge with their friends, if not the entire house. Harry would probably not be nearly as inclined to talk back to Umbridge, which means fewer detentions, which means less stress and angst from him. And if you make it a romance, well, Harry would certainly find some solace in that as well (as long as the girlfriend does not bring up Cedric all the time).

** The twins, in recognition of Harry giving them his Triwizard winnings, give him a stack of Extendable Ears. Playing around with one before his trial starts, he happens to overhear a DMLE representative questioning Umbridge on why exactly she ordered a Dementor away from Azkaban over the summer, but Umbridge brushes him off, telling him that she has a trial on underage magic to sit in on.

By the time Dumbledore gets there, Harry's in full-on Phoenix Wright mode, defending himself by accusing Umbridge.

** Umbridge is caught sending the dementors after Harry by someone who is both powerful enough and willing to take her to task over it, and they send someone to protect Harry, who only arrives in time to see Harry fight them off. When he hears that Harry was caught using magic outside of Hogwarts, Fudge is delighted at first, thinking that he can arrest and expel Harry, but once he finds out that a) Harry has a wizard witness who can attest to his having acted in self-defense, and b) a high-ranking Ministry official whom he personally appointed sent a pair of dementors to attack a child, he realises that he has no case and that his career is a dead as he claims Voldemort is.

People immediately lose faith in the Ministry, the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore ends immediately, and people start to wonder if maybe there isn't something to these Voldemort rumours, after all.

** What if Harry said no to teaching the DA?

Seriously, it was his OWL year and he was being tortured and mistreated the entire year.
