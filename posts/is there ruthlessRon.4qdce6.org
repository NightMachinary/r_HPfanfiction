** The only ruthless ron I ever see is an auror. In Forging the Sword he's getting there, but when he falls into the role of strategist (due to chess) he often comes across as coldhearted.

** I feel like so many people want to read Ron in various roles (Evil!Ron, come on!) but there are so few writers that actually enjoy writing him as the main character or significant side character. *Sigh.*

*** I usually write a heroic Ron, but I don't think a Ron who kills enemies in battle is what the OP means with "ruthless".
