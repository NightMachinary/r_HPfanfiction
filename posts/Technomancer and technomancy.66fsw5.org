  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)

*** It was Wednesday. Wednesday night is for getting drunk and arguing about random shit and playing m:tg. so you see what happens is I lose a game and make a shitpost on one forum/sub then the next guy that loses does it on another. I was rereading the 7th for the scene with luna and the ghost and on a losing streak so I basically made seven shitposts last night with three being on this sub. the whole point is to be as nonsensical and stupid while still bringing something interesting up so you can say stupid shit without looking like a stupid shit.

really the post basically is like so:

You know how when people combine magic and technology they forget to integrate them? yeah fuck that can we integrate them.

why you ask? cuz it's the good good hax hax. also, fuck yeah I just repeated a word after itself before doing it again take that Jorge-Dominik it was possible!!!

but yeah like if you modified a computer and made a spell to upload your consciousness onto the interwebs like a true ai rendering you either immortal or with digital ultimate power or something point is when you combine sci-fi and magic instead of putting them next to each other you get the most badass chimera ever.

...

...

or like jarvis cuz he's a wizard harry
