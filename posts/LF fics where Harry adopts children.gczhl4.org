I'd obviously appreciate if Harry were out of Hogwarts - and not Ginny/Harry (just not my cup of tea). Can be Gen(no romance), Slash(Homosexual), Het (Heterosexual). Can be a WIP/abandoned if good.

He doesnt even have to adopt children, maybe open/fund an orphanage? If there's any fics where he adopts and has no biological children, that would be preferable. This doesn't have to be the main plot of the story, can be a side, or even in an Epilogue.

Thank you.

** linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

It's a Peggy Sue, so avoid this if you don't like those. It's one of my favourite stories, though. It also has the rare Harry/Tonks pairing.

*** I honestly don't mind the pairing. I read a fic where Harry, Teddy, and (I think) Andromeda are forced back in time due to Fawkes and Harry ends up with her. Pretty cracky, I suppose, due to the whole Fawkes incident but it made me enjoy the ship. I like rare-pairs a lot and mostly don't request anything with Harry/Draco, Harry/Ginny, Wolfstar, ect. because it's so overdone and boring! I don't know if its considered rare, but I love Harry/Luna a lot!

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.
