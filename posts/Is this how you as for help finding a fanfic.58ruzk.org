I would like some help finding 3 stories. I only remember little bits of them.

+#1 There's a robot named Father, it gets sent back in time with future memories. There's a few "drones," that look like Harry, and the story starts off with one.+

* 2 I don't remember much, but Harry finds he has a sister years later, who has a scar like his, but on her stomach, and has been living the past few years under a different name after a woman adopted her by some sort of a baby in-womb transfering spell just a bit after Lily died.

* 3 it's an independent Harry one with him using the killing curse on the basilisk. Ginny also mentions something about being his "dark lady."

** Alright, so, first off, yeah, that works for asking for help. Now, as to fics

1. Goddamn, I know I've read this, and for some reason I'm thinking it's a Clell fic, but I'm fairly certain that isn't correct.

2. Holy shit, in a comment I can't for the life of me I called using switching spells to steal children in-utero. But I haven't read it.

3. Haven't read it, but sounds like a generic dark!Harry fic.

  The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before.

** I remembered something to add to the third one. Harry talks to Ginny in the chamber of secrets, and expains what happened, and I'm pretty sure that's where she says she'd like to be his dark lady or something. And later, Harry tells dumbledore, who is a bad guy in the story, at least to Harry, that he didn't know what the killing curse was, just that Quirrel tried to use it on him. Also, Harry isn't evil, he's just not on anyone else's side.
