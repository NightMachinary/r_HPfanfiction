  Harry gets tired of the magical world after he killed Voldemort. Mobbed when he goes out by the people in the Alley and Hogsmead. Molly constantly yelling at him to marry Ginny and her trying to run his life. The ministry telling him he is A going back to Hogwarts for his seventh year or B joining the Aurors to help hunt down the rest of the death eaters. So he forms a plan.

***** There's some minor bashing of the magical world (Ron and Hermione mostly) but otherwise it's not bad at all
