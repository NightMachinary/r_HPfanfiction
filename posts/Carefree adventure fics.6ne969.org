Can you come up with any of the ones where regardless of fate Harry manages to go on a grand journey carefree and jolly seeing the sights and meeting the people. We are looking for fics that warm you up like a good fire in the winter and make you smile of joy at the wonders of life.


** linkffn(Make a wish) is a long fic where Harry goes sightseeing around the world leaving everyone puzzled and amazed at his wake.

linkffn(Escapologist Harry) is a oneshot where Harry escapes the Dursleys numerous times even with the addition of strictest wards around him.
