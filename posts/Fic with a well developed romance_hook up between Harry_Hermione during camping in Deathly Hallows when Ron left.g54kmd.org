** Just did a quick search on the Unofficial Portkey Archive and there's a story called "the Tent" by Wilkes that might be kinda what you're looking for sorry can't remember if it's any good.

  A complete re-write of Book Seven:â€˜So why are you still here?' Harry asked Ron.â€˜Search me,' said Ron.â€˜Go home then,' said Harry.â€˜Yeah, maybe I will!' shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves. This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that her and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time.[Updated Sundays, with occasional extra chapters on Wednesdays]*note: this fic contains mature content

** After Ron abandons them in the tent (and the amortentia he was using on them wears off), Hermione has a thought: why are Harry and Hermione the only ones working to save a society that has no use or respect for them?
