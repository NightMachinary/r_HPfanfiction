*** I'm also interested in this concept. Is there anything you remember about these fics that I could use to find them?

**** Not really :( I've been reading one fic after another non-stop since November 2010... I suspect I've read hundreds of fics at this point.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4229739/Veronice][Veronice]] may have written one of them? Harry is definitely borderline immortal in these, but I don't recall why, other than that his amount of magical power keeps growing endlessly. This fics are pretty fucked up and disturbing, just FYI.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything][30 Minutes that Changed Everything]] might also be one. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] too.

Maybe ask over on DarkLordPotter?

** All the Immortal-Harry fics I've found are related to the Deathly Hallows, not this interpretation of the prophecy.

Maybe look over here?

** There's a crossover with Captain America/The Avengers, WIP, though that also very heavily featured 'Death' as his servant. Nothing else comes to mind now, though I am quite sure I read another crossover about this, possibly with Criminal Minds...

****** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8105674/1/Taking-Chances]] This one too, it's finished and better in my opinion... Took some time to find it though... There's two more like this one.

** I know its stupid as hell and whatever but there is a Twilight crossover that has him using a spell that has him giving up what means the most to him and that is his ability to die.
