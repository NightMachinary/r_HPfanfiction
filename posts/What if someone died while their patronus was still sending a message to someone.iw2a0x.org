I have been pondering over this. What if someone was dying, example bleeding out, and they had the strength to send a patronus to give a message to someone. Lets say the patronus made it to the person but the one dying dies while the message is still being relayed, what would happen to the patronus? Do you think it would just slowly disappear while it was still talking? Or just burst into a million pieces because the magic the person had was ripped out of the world? What do you think?

** I would think it would deliver the message, if it was sent off in time; whatever magic makes up the patronus is already shaped and moving, so I doubt it would collapse.

Fun Answer: If one dies at just the right time, with just the right conditions, one's spirit and soul latches onto the magical construct and it becomes an animal shaped spirit. Over time, if it gains just what it needs, it starts to gain mass in addition to energy, regaining the ability to effect the material world. (Unless you have a strong will or reason for living though, you tend to become more animal than human in mind.)

​

Fic idea: Third Year, after Sirius escapes, the Dementors come back. Harry, tired and weakened, casts the Patronus again, and the strain kills him. The stag retains its last order to protect Hermione, but everything Harry is remains within the Stag, and it doesn't fade. Couple options from there: A, Stag runs off into the forest where it exists off the ambient magic of Hogwarts until Harry regains his mind over the summer, or B, the spirit is too weak, and its command to protect Hermione makes the construct, instead of fading away, possess Ms. Granger. She gains an aura that upsets dementors, and most of the magic her body generates ends up being consumed by the spirit as it grows. She starts to have really freaky dreams, where Harry is a glowing Stag and they spend time together. She realizes its real when Harry tells her something she wouldn't have known and its true. Hedwig starts to follow Hermione around, and the various magical trackings/death notices etc. say Harry isn't dead yet.

​

Eventually Harry comes back as something that isn't just flesh or energy, but both. Maybe his friends and Sirius pull off a resurrection ritual, and Sirius blows his whole family's fortune and steals someone else's to throw in a bunch of regents so Harry picks up magical traits from every creature that doesn't conflict. At the same moment Voldemort rises again, so does Harry, but now he's got traits from phoenixes, thunderbirds, and a dozen other critters.
