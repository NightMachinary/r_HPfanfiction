** The doorbell rang, while Vernon Dursley was still hard at work in his office, so it was Petunia who opened the door to... she wasn't really sure. At first she thought it had to be one of the Freaks friends but... no.\\
'Hello!' the man said brightly, stepping easily past her. 'Does my cousin live here?'\\
'...Cousin?' Petunia almost stuttered.\\
'Yeah, silly bugger started calling himself Dudley or Dursley or somesuch boring name. Really large mustache? Born with it. I just thought I'd pop in and tell him we named our kid in honor of him. Pubert is born with a mustache too, you know,' he said, as if entrusting her with a great secret. 'We're just hoping he doesn't go his way, poor sod. Living in a /suburb/,of all places...' he grimaced. 'How does he /stand/ it?' Then his eye fell on their wedding picture, proudly on display. 'Oh you must be his /wife!/ Absolutely /delighted/ to meet you...'\\
'Petunia,' she muttered, realizing what was expected of her. He grabbed her hand and started pumping it up and down vigorously. '/So/ glad I have the right house,' he added. 'For a moment I was worried, they all look the same! Do you never get lost? Walk into your neighbours by accident? Wouldn't surprised if you all used the same /lock.../ oh, a cupboard! Can I pick it? Can I? Can I? That's a /exquisite/ lock, what do you keep here?' His face lit up as he saw the mess. 'Oh this is your torture chamber! It's not much but I'm /so glad/ he hasn't lost all Addamsness! Is this for carolsingers? It's a bit tame, but I am guessing you don't have enough oil for the whole neighbourhood! Where is the rest of it?'\\
'This is for -'\\
He held out a card, black-and-gold. 'Tell my little cousin there will be a clan-gathering, and he just /has/ to be there. You're /all/ welcome, in fact bring your whole family along!' She took it. 'Say, you wouldn't happen to have some nightshade tea, would you? I'm parched!'\\
'Not Nighshade, no, but I can make some tea and uhm, have some cake!' While she settled in the familiar routine of making the tea just so, the man kept babbling. 'My wife Morticia, she would /love/ you! Such refined torturing of your children! Chapeau! When will the fat one be ready for the stew? And the thin guy, will he be the soup? Oh, speaking of, I didn't forget to introduce myself, did I? My name is Gomez, Gomez Addams. You should visit us sometime, grandma can give you delightful recipes!'

** So, this leads me to the urge to recommend these two Harry Potter/Addams Family Crossovers:

Family Values by Ishtar, in which the Evans side of the family are distantly related to the Addams Family, who wind up raising Harry, with the eventual goal of him marrying Wednesday. pretty decent read, overall, though it is abandoned. as in the last update was over 12 years ago. been awhile since i read it.

[[https://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/Family_Values/index/]]

also, the Shadow Council series, by Tenhawk, assuming you can find a copy of it. It's a Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Addams Family, and Harry Potter (with a spin-off/future fic set in DC Comics) whose main characters are Xander Harris and Wednesday Addams, with Harry being a side character at best who's only really involved due to Xander and Wednesday's friendship with Hermione.
