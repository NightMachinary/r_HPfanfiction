Im just wondering, are their any fics with the main premise being Harry running a store? Or some other type of business? Preferably over 100k and no slash, thanks! :D

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

**** Yeah, I can vaguely remember a few where he runs a book store, but I think that's more in the epilogue of a H/Hr. And a one shot somewhere of him running a pottery store in Godrics Hollow, and that ends up being "the power he knows not". Buts that's like 7k words at best.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.

#+begin_quote
  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."

*** I think people are struggling to find stories that fit your demands at all. "Running a store" doesn't make for a particularly interesting-sounding plot, you won't find many real fiction novels about it, for instance. So when people think of a story, they post it no matter the length because otherwise they've got nothing.

*** Assuming you did not edit the post, it's “Preferably over 100k”. With that, I'm really not sure what is there to get, since nobody wrote anything along the lines of “I have stories over 100k but I won't post them because they are too long for you” and your words can't be taken to mean that you do not want any lesser stories.

So you might not want to be rude, but you do kind of sound that way. And I'll leave it at that since I don't really care (and all the stuff I have has already been recommended anyway).
