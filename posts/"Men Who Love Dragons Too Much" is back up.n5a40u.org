Hi all! As some of you know from a post asking where it went, the above-mentioned Drarry fic was removed from AO3 a few months ago. In the time since, I've been heavily revising it and invite all interested parties to check it out!

At 522,000 words and an explicit rating, it won't be for everyone, but I hope some will give it a go!

*Summary:* [Extensive re-telling of /Deathly Hallows/] ‘Kill Albus Dumbledore' is less a challenging task and more a suicide mission, so when Draco Malfoy is presented with the option to either dispatch his Headmaster or suffer an excruciating and most ignominious death of his own, along with his parents, he reaches deep into his black little Slytherin heart and manages to scrape together enough courage to go with option C instead: Spend Sixth Year secretly studying Animagecraft in the hopes he'll turn into something sufficiently imposing even the Dark Lord himself won't be able to keep Draco under his thumb. But just his luck, his Animagus form turns out to be a dragon, and a rather randy juvenile at that, intent on finding its mate: one Harry James Potter.

*** Isn't it? Merlin is responsible for some of the most gorgeous art out there, he's a legend. His non-fandom art is amazing too---I recommend giving him a follow on Twitter!

*** “Is this a completed work?”

LORD I HOPE SO! Yes, yea it should be XD it was originally created and posted to AO3 for the 2018 Big Bang (a collab between artists and writers to create complete works of 50,000 words or longer). This is a revised version of that fic :)

** I didn't realize this but I just finished reading Owl was well and when I went to go look I realized it was by you as well! At least I'm pretty sure it is because the epilogue is still up

*** Yup! OWW was my Erised fic last year. I reposted the Epilogue only as a way to direct traffic to the revised version off-site in case people were wondering where the fic went.
