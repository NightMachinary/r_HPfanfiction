Because I think a marriage law would be too unrealistic, both for the Ministry of Magic (because they wouldn't want to encourage pureblooded bigotry, at least not openly, although I could be misremembering my canon there, especially not after the second war with Voldemort) and Voldemort (because he'd simply want more pureblooded babies, pregnancy doesn't require marriage, they can get adopted by a respectable pureblood couple). The Nazi analogy is already there, I'm just extending it for a hopefully more realistic take on the marriage law idea.


** In response to the title; frequently.

I think the original 'Marriage Law' concept was introduced as a challenge prompt, in order to get Snape and Hermione together. Since then, there's been a bunch more fics that played it straight...and an absolute ton that subvert it in some way.

******* *Mary Sue*

A Mary Sue (if female) or Gary Stu (if male) is often identified as an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. However, with this definition, you rope in many common, good characters in mainstream media. More accurately, a Mary Sue is a character who warps the reality around them, making a Sue-centric story. Often, this character is recognized as an author insert or wish fulfillment.

**** In your story, what would be Muggleborns' position in a world ruled by Dumbledore and Grindelwald?

I've read several fics in which they were just portrayed championing the same ideology as Voldemort. I vehemently disagree.

Magical supremacy is NOT THE SAME as Pureblood supremacy.

Grindelwald might very well heavily promote EQUAL RIGHTS for all Magicals, and that would hold immense appeal to Muggleborns who were discriminated by the Pureblood establishment and disillusioned with the Muggle world (WW1, Great Depression, and continued religious persecution).

My head canon says that Muggleborns made up a huge portion of Grindelwald's followers, and atrocities committed by them were a major contributing factor to Voldemort's hate of them.

Dumbledore's own mother was Muggleborn, and it was not certain Grindelwald was a Pureblood. If they had treated Muggleborns like a slave caste, that would have been the equivalent of Dumbledore digging up his own mother's body and pissing on her remains.

Furthermore, both Dumbledore and Grindelwald spoke nothing of 'enslaving' Muggles, but more of ruling Muggles for their own good. Given how badly the Muggle world was messed up after WW1 and the Great Depression, I'm even of the opinion that millions of Muggles would find great appeals in benevolent tyrant with superpowers. After all, how many joined the likes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, KKK, Mao Zedong, and Japanese militarists during the 1930s?

  Let's just say shit goes down and Grindelwald dominates both the Magical and Muggle worlds. Magicals are treated as equals in terms of blood but are still segmented by way of wealth.

That's to be expected, although I also expect Grindelwald to reward his followers handsomely and major wealth transfers to take place after his victory.

***** Thank you.

Finally someone who understands that Grindelwald promoted magical communism and Voldemort magical fascism.

So you can say that like in the muggle world, fascism emerged as some sort of "knee-jerk" reaction to communism.

.

I find that linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King) is interesting because of this, and how Harry links various magical political figures to muggle ones.

If I recall correctly, the writer explain what he's aiming for in the 3rd chapter.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
