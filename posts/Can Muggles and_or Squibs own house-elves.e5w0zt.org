If they're aware of magic, can house elves bond with said people, or do they have to have a magical owner/household? Fics are generally divided with this.


** In the books, Ron specifically says that house elves come with large old houses and big properties. Hogwarts house elves also seem to serve Hogwarts more than any person.

I think you can argue that a muggle can have a house elf if they move into an old magical house or property, although they probably wouldn't be aware that there was a house elf there.

*** Not necessarily, maybe it's just that the people who own old houses tend to be rich and rich people tend to have elves, and if you inherit an old house you probably also inherit everything else the previous owner had including the elves.

It fits with Dumbledore calling Kreacher in HBP to see if Harry owned Grimmauld Place

**** Not only that, but the Blacks have had House Elves and near as we can tell, they've lived at Grimmauld Place for several generations.

Now, there's an idea...If a Wizarding family moves, but their House Elf doesn't come with them.

** presumably they'd be removed by the ministry if they were doing magic near muggles.

** Canon actually doesn't say really one or another. Typical use in fanfiction stories (e.g., linkao3(3721315), yes, that's Dudley Dursley being a master of Winky) is to make Muggles at least slightly compatible with the magical world.

Yeah that's what annoys me but it does make it flexible to have magic-aware Muggles have house elves and perhaps treat them better than most wizards do.

** In my headcanon, Elf-bonding was mostly focused on the Elf itself contractually. I have similar views on Time Turners.

As in, you don't need inherent magic to be able to interact with them to the extent where you need magic yourself. Obviously, Muggles are going to have a hard time getting an elf, but if they do somehow get it (inherited from a magical person who ended up dying or similar) and is aware of the Magical World, they're able to serve as Master/Mistress to them just like any other regular magical person would be.

** If you go by what little we know from canon, than the squibs or muggles simply have to be aware of magic, connected to the magical world in some way, and have enough money or connections to get a house elf.

However I know many fics also imply that the person or entity that the house elf is bound too, must also have enough magic to sustain the elf or elves. If that is the case than the elf would not be able to bond. And my personal opinion is that, going by how the elves at Hogwarts function, yes there needs to be some element of passive magic involved with regards to the entity or person the elf is bound to.

So my opinion is that no an elf cant be bound to a muggle or squib due to lack of magic in the bond.

** A lot of fanfics say that a wizard/which's core helps stabilise the house elves core So squibs maybe muggles no

** I think they can't command house elves, because the bond between master and elf seems to be magical, but if a Muggle/squib befriends house elf, they can serve the muggle/squib of their own free will, like Dobby, with them doing chores using magic and stuff

** Technically yes, but no. Let's put it this way they survive via symbyiosis they bind to the witch/wizard and draw from their magic in turn you get a servant. So yes a squib/muggle could posses one but they would be bonded to someone else
