Lets take Ginny as an aexample. Fanon!Ginny has her obsessing over the BWL fantasy and how she'll marry him at the tender age of 11.

I wanna find a fic that basically turns her into a creepier, obsessive, terrifying version of her character, without using Ginnymort.

Any character works, that was just an example.

- (/But Will1707, that's not canon!/ Yeah, yeah. I know. don't care)


** The best creepy obsessive Ginny I've seen so far has been in linkffn(Sympathetic Properties)

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.

  Shining examples of literary genius abound as Harry & friends do some stuff, and some other stuff, and some other stuff, and then some stuff happens, and some people do some stuff. And then Snape cuts his head off with a chainsaw, everybody is Luna, Oliver Wood plays Slayer out his mouth, and some other stuff... whatever.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
