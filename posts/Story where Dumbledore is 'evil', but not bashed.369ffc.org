I recently noticed that I've read both stories where Dumbledore was absolutely good (pure light), and where he is misguided/mad, and therefore hurting people with his bad decisions (which then mostly ends in either derailing into Dumble-bashing or getting him back on the pure light-path).

Now I was wondring if a story/stories exist, where Dumbledore makes questionable decisions, but gets away with it, either by backing up his decisions with good enough arguments that the protagonist has to accept them grudgingly, or by corrupting the protagonist until he also goes back to seeing him as the unfailable leader of light?

Anyone knows if something like this exists?


** There is a series of fics where Dumbledore makes numerous bad decisions and everything turned out alright, it's called Harry Potter.

In all seriousness, though, I can't recall anything that exactly fits what you're looking for, at least as far as an 'evil' Dumbledore goes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On The Way to Greatness]] by Mira Mirth, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] by AngelaStarCat both feature a reluctant/grudging relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, but Dumbledore isn't particularly 'evil' in either fic.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] has a Dumbledore who keeps making more and more questionable decisions and /tries/ to force Harry to conform to his way of thinking. He ends up being as much of an antagonist as Voldemort, all the while having convinced himself that he's doing what's best.

**** The Sacrifices Arc is hands-down my single favourite Harry Potter fanfiction. Bits and pieces of it continue to serve as inspiration for my own fanfic, which has been incubating in my head for 5+ years anyway. It's not everyone's cup of tea but I love it.

** I posted a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/352g7g/why_is_evil_dumbles_always_such_a_muppet/][Similar-ISH]] topic a while back, and the general consensus that I've come to agree with is that a truly evil Dumbledore in an otherwise unchanged world isn't terribly interesting. [[/u/MejiHao]] mentioned that Dumbledore making weird calls, but everything goes okay, is called canon.

In canon, Dumbledore is playing a /very/ long con so to speak. Not everything pans out the way he wants in the short term, but he manages to puppeteer everyone through what needs to happen to finish off Tom /even after he's dead./ The problem most people run into when making him evil is that his 'mistakes' then take on a nefarious ulterior motive. Now you have an even better puppeteer who doesn't make mistakes, he's just sadistic, and how does an 11 year old Harry fight that?

*** I think the wrong assumption here is assuming that a smart evil dumbledore wouldn't make mistakes. Smart people do make mistakes, the issue on evil dumbledore storyes a strawman is made of him . This cause the story to become boring and the plot trivial.

**** Yeah, what I should have said is that in constructing their evil Dumbledore, authors tend to take his 'mistakes' and assign malice aforethought to them rather than having them be mistakes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] actually handles it rather well, where Dumbledore is setting Harry up, and going so far as to use magic to edit his personality, but he does make mistakes and those mistakes are how Harry catches on. It then drifts towards what is looking like it may be a "misunderstood Voldemort"... and I haven't worked up the will to continue just yet, but it's earlier chapters are still a good example of an Evil Dumbledore being competent but not infallible.

** This is more of an all-out evil Dumbledore story, but it is very interesting and well written story with a lot of original content added to it. It's one of my favorites just because the premise is so different and the story is original.\\
It's called Partially Kissed Hero.
