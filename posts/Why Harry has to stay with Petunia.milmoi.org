Is more of a question because I don't understand how the protection work.I mean does he has to stay there because the place is safe as in he can not be attack while he is there or is it to maintain the protections that are in him as a person as in if he had not live with Petunia then in the confrontation with Quirrel the protection of love would not have worked because it would be lost if he didn't stay with someone with Lily's blood.


** There are two separate protections at work here:

1. Harry's innate protection against Voldemort, given by Lily's sacrifice.

2. The Bond of Blood Charm enacted by Dumbledore, which was basically a pact that he made with regards to Lily's sacrifice, and which was sealed by Petunia's acceptance of Harry. This functioned as long as Harry called Petunia's home his home (as well as Petunia willingly taking him in).

The first one is what caused the Quirrell-touch-burn thing, and which Voldemort thought he bested after taking in Harry's blood. However, in doing so, Voldemort unintentionally caused himself to become another vessel for Lily's protection, which is one of the main reasons as to why Voldemort couldn't kill Harry permanently in the Forest.

The Bond of Blood is why Harry was sent back to the Dursleys at the end of the year. It afforded him and his family protection against Voldemort and supporters/followers (as opposed to protection number one, which only worked to protect Harry against Voldemort), though canon isn't specific about how far it extended.

To answer this:

I'd say that it didn't really matter where Harry stayed. Quirrell was never going to be able to touch him (because that protection was linked to Lily's sacrifice itself). However, the Bond of Blood afforded Harry a more general protection against the Death Eaters and Voldemort during the holidays.

** I personally understand that as:

Harry has Lily's protection that is very powerful against Voldemort. But this protection only helps him against Voldie.

To avoid having him murdered a thousand times by anyone who could, Dumbledore found a way to extend that protection over Harry's home. But for him to do that the home had to be provided by Lily's family, and Harry had to think of it as a home.

** In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And the Shipgirls]], Dumbledore explains that putting Harry with Petunia was a last resort since the protection needed either a blood relative or someone who could love Harry [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/page-217#post-29064533][unconditionally]]. The latter would have been preferable, but Harry's fame would have diluted and broken the protection since almost any Wizarding family who both would and could take him in would have done so at least partially for the fame.

** Also considering Harry has to stay with someone who has Lily's blood does that mean he could live anywhere and have those protections, considering Harry has Lily's blood already running through is veins why would he need someone else?

*** Dumbledore calls the protection "bond of blood." If the name is anything to go by, (as all Harry Potter spells are) in order for it to exist he needed to have some sort of relationship with Petunia. Given that I don't know magic, I have to take Dumbledore's word that it required he live with her.

** Yes.

It keeps Lily's sacrifice alive and no one can touch him there.

** I have a bit of a headcanon that part of the protection shielded Harry (and those around him) from the horcrux inside of him.

To me, it helps explain why it was so critical Harry go back.

** When Lily willingly sacrificed herself for Harry, she unconsciously invoked an ancient protective magic which kept Harry safe, even from the killing curse (Harry, of course, invokes the same protective magic for everyone else in the final battle). Dumbledore recognised this and created powerful wards which utilised this magic, to sustain this protection and keep Harry safe. Petunia is like the locus or the keystone - because she shares Lily's blood, she can keep that protection going, and the wards work because she chooses to take Harry in, though they'd have been stronger if she'd been capable of loving him. The wards are centred around Privet Drive, and Voldemort cannot harm him there, or presumably anywhere else until he bypasses whatever magic Lily invoked by taking Harry's blood in book 4.

It's all very high-concept, vaguely defined stuff, and it's not clear what the limits are, how Dumbledore actually does this, how Lily's protection actually works, or how Harry is practically protected. All we know is that both Dumbledore and Voldemort recognise both the power of Lily's sacrifice and the wards around Privet Drive - which is Rowling pretty much telling us this it's legit and we shouldn't question it. I suppose you could say that this is just very, very complicated, genius-level magic that only Dumbledore and Voldemort actually understand.

** Yes it's Lily's sacrifice. It will no longer work if he doesn't stay with her blood.

** Nobody understands it because Dumbledore never explains it properly. Quite possibly Dumbledore doesn't understand it either and is mostly guessing, after all, if he knew exactly what Lily did to protect Harry from an (alleged) killing curse to the face then presumably he would have told others about it and saved many lives. I think the main thing is that the protection seen with Quirrell stops Voldemort specifically touching him, whereas the magic on the house keeps everyone inside it safe from being murdered in their sleep by anyone with a grudge against Harry, remember even the Dementor attack happens out of the house in a park.

But mostly it is poorly done [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum][Applied Phlebotinum]] to handwave Harry going back to the Dursleys for plot reasons.

** Not 100% sure but most common theory is that Lily's sacrifice was able to create a blood ward which is one of the strongest most ancient wards that can only be broken if the last living blood relative is killed (eg petunia) it would work with Dudley but he isnt a direct relative so the ward wouldn't be as strong :)
