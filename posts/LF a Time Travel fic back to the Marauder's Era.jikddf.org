:END:
The fic is one where Harry (and I believe Hermione) travel back to the Marauder's Era. Harry's grandparents Charlus and Dorea are some type of mind healers for the unspeakables. So while he is visiting them at Potter Manor, based on their oaths Harry tells them about his life.

One scene I remember is that they are at Potter Manor when Voldemort attacks with the older malfoys, LeStrange's (Abraxas, etc) as well as the younger generation (lucius, rudolphus, etc). Harry battles with Voldemort and cuts off Voldemort's arm. I believe charlus, arcturus, Sirius and james also battle their "counterparts". The ladies are all inside the manor calling for help and "prepping' for casualties.

Dumbledore and some order members and the ministry show up after the bad guys have left.

Dumbledore is upset that the Potters' et al used more lethal curses against their attackers rather than simply stunning them. Eg a pretty pacifist Dumbledore.

Now I've been searching my folders but either I turn up way too many options (over 8K stories in my folders) or it doesn't find the right one.

Anybody have any idea what story this may be?


** I don't, but please send me a link when you find it!
