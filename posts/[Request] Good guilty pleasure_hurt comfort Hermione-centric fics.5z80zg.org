** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6288599/1/Almost-Everything-I-Wish-I-d-Said][Almost Everything I Wish I'd Said]] fits your request. It's quite dark, but I do like the RW/HG. It's Ron-centric but obviously features Hermione.

  All Ron can think about is revenge. Revenge on the monsters that destroyed his life by taking hers...DH twisted by my twisted mind. Complete.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] might also fit your request. It's mostly Harry and Hermione focused.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** This is something I think you'd be interested in. Prepare to cry your eyes out. This focuses on Hermione, not helping her per se, but her effect upon them. It's well worth a read even if not exactly what you want.

  Waiting. He was always waiting. He'd already buried one best friend and now the other will follow. There was nothing he could do or say. There was no Harry without Hermione. Ron witnessed the beginning and now he must accept the end. HHr. 4parts Complete!

**** Glad to hear you are enjoying it. I feel like it's the most honest one out there. A war leaves no victors. Seeing Harry finally crack and come to grips with all the loss is powerful
