The obvious one is to change Cho's name apparently.

But I feel like showing Dumbledore in a gay bar is a bit much.

So what could be changed?

(As a disclaimed I think it's perfect for the time and wouldn't actually want anything changed but it's an interesting conversation and fanfiction seems to be the place for it)


** I don't think something needs to be forced to be "woke".

Take Star Trek from the 1960s, it had a very diverse crew of officers,(a black woman as the communications officer, a Japanese and a Russian as pilots and an Alien as a second in command). And there would be even more stuff if the studio hadn't put their foot down.

It was incredibly ahead of it's time and those things were treated as natural, no need to directly focus on then(the creator just said he thought humans in the future would be beyond such prejudices as to color and gender).

There was an episode however about a planet where the population was half-black and half -white(literally split down the middle of their faces) and they warred with each other depending on if the black side was on the right or left(they considered this to make them different), the Captain and the crew were fast to point out how stupid that was.

That said, I would probably make more characters more prominent, and bring some issues more to the front. Like the prejudice of the Blood Supremacists, the overt racism of the Ministry with the non-humans.

Perhaps how the system itself was wrong and how it allowed people like Voldemort to incite and practice violence through it.

All of this would have to be woven naturally in the plot and characters and not despite them.

Edit: Regarding Dumbledore, I don't think he's a good character for that, I mean, I don't see a way for it to come out naturally other than Harry learning it through memories and realizing how awful Grindelwald was for having abused those feelings to control young Albus. Since, from then on, Dumbledore seems to have abandoned any romantic pursuits altogether.

I also don't think every work of fiction has to be "woke" or rather tackle societal issues to be good, while many writers/artists can do that naturally and even subtly to escape suit censorship(ATLA, Percy Jackson, LoK) some just want to tell a story and there's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't spread hate.

I never said it did.

I think a lot of what you're saying would work really well in something like Star Trek but a lot less well with a childrens book aimed at 7 year olds initially.

**** I can guarantee you a children's book with clear societal critique won't undo the prejudice of a child who was raised by bigoted parents(because only such a child would already be prejudiced by 7) and the parents would remove the book anyway.

However, when you cleverly weave it into the material, like Star Trek and many children cartoons and other materials did/do, the child can associate that as normal and upon growing up it may even make them question their beliefs, since their parents didn't see any 'problem' with the material.

And OG Star Trek was very child friendly too, it inspired more than a few astronauts, engineers and actors(like Whoopi Goldberg), heck, Dr. Martin Luther King convinced the actress for Lt. Uhura to stay so she could inspire the children that watched with what they could achieve(again, Whoopi Goldberg has repeatedly said it inspired her as a child).

Today's custom of some media to blatantly and loudly tackle societal issues can be detrimental, because the people that need it the most will reject out of hand saying it has an 'agenda' or something, while for the people that don't need it, it will be like preaching to the choir. Doing it with subtlety IMHO is much more efficient, again, ST was very popular, even with people that were racist or xenofobes, and after several episodes or years watching it, perhaps they were more used to hearing different accents or seeing different people than when they started, to say nothing of the children, better results than if it loudly screamed 'DIVERSITY IS GOOD' and turned off the TV or changed the channel and dubbed the program 'too liberal'.

And there's also the fact sometimes people just can't do it in a way it doesn't hurt the quality of the product further reducing it's effectiveness. Most blatant attempts will also go right over a child's head.

And many of the people that would complain about that, wanted to bar it because it had magic. And I think they didn't even realize it because it was cleverly hidden in the Good vs Evil fight.

Heck the DE were practically KKK, they even had pointy hats in the movies, and again, that was woven into the plot and played into it. You can ask many and most won't say HP wasn't 'woke'.

It was subtle enough you could cast reasonable doubt.

But the whole act of an organization of masked racists conducting raids and thinking they are in the right is clearly more an American situation than British.

*** /Are/ we supposed to think that everything's fine? Maybe it's because I was older when I read the books, but I always thought Rowling was deliberately portraying a messy world with its own systemic issues that would be difficult to solve - the oppression of magical creatures isn't really subtle, nor is the classism, and even before Voldemort's return, the depiction of the Ministry and the press are pretty deeply cynical. Having Harry from ages 11-17 go to school, learn magic, defeat a dark wizard, AND revolutionize society seems like a lot to put on his plate.

The only thing I would change is to describe characters explicitly as white if JKR imagines them that way. Because she explicitly describes the race of non white characters. Not doing so would imply that the default race is white which I think is problematic.

Dean Thomas is a black Londoner according to JKR but we wouldn't know that reading from the books except that he supports a dodgy football team. She does describe Angelina and Kingsley as black.

I think that people forget that she wrote these books 25 years ago about a boarding school in Britain. Given that, I think the book is pretty representative of its time and society. What was also refreshing is that race, ethnicity etc. is never made an issue of.

Dean is explicitly mentioned as black in the sorting ceremony in the first book though.

I agree that a lot of causal fans forget how long JKR has been writing HP. She first came up with the idea in 1990 and got the first book published in 1997. I thought the representation was as good as it could be in the 1997-2007 timeframe.
