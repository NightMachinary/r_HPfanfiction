It turns around that Harry was fooled and Dumbledore is actually THE good guy?


** /Moments after Indy!Harry fatally wounds Manipulative!Dumbledore with a powerful withering curse/

"Harry my boy, I'm so sorry for all that I've done to you, but for the prophesy to be fulfilled you had to truly mean it."

'What are you talking about?'

"Harry, I'm the Dark Lord of the prophesy. I always was."

/Harry gapes at the manipulative old goat, having absolutely no clue what to do with this news/

'But you said the Prophesy was about Voldemort?'

"Harry, Sibyl could not have given the prophesy to me if I was not part of it. I needed you to hate me, to destroy me. That's why I had to make the decisions that I have, why I had to do things I'll never get the chance to forgive myself for."

'But why? The prophesy never said we had to be enemies, only that I'd be your equal, that I'd have the power to potentially defeat you!'

"Neither can live while the other survives, Harry. So long as I live you can not defeat Tom."

** It's extremely unpopular here, but in HPMOR Harry and Dumbledore clash a lot, particularly over Snape, the two's different opinions on Death, and a number of other issues, and Harry suspects at points that Dumbledore was insane.

And then it turns out that Dumbledore was walking on a tightrope of prophesy with the world at stake the whole time, and HJPEV's indy moments were often fuckups, which he only learns after he basically accidentally got Dumbledore killed.

*** Yeah, I appreciate that fic for the reversal at the end. I'm not a huge fan of how long it takes to get to that point, though.
