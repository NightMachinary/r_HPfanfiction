I have fallen into rereading some of my old favorites like the Bonds of Time Series linkffn(8076284) and finishing others like the Meaning of One Series over on SIYE ([[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833]]) and I would like to see what you guys recomend, even if I have already read them, as the title says, rereads welcome!

** *Seventh Horcrux* , linkffn(10677106 ), and *[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822&rewrite=true][Hermione Granger and the BWL]]* both have canon pairings. The Ginny/Harrymort relationship is quite hilarious. HG & BWL is one of my top favorites, because I really really love its plot development, but unfortunate, Harry and Ginny are not the main pair.

I think *The Changeling*, linkffn(6919395), will pair HP/GW together. Given how well the author is writing, I'm looking forward to Ginny's Year 7.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387), is the best soul-bond fic, period.

When it comes to canon-compliant stories, I can't go wrong with recommending *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126).

I kind like the new *Gothic* by Brennus, linkffn(11922116). The ending really threw me off though, and I now think a sequel is all but certain.

Finally, I have a few Harry/Ginny postwar smut fics to recommend:

*Dealing With Demons And Prats*, linkffn(7448513)

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848)

*It's Complicated*, linkffn(11567591)

*Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More*, linkffn(4291790)

** It's early in the morning so I'm not going to link these (I'll let you google them the old fashioned way) but I'll just copy all the stories from my HP/GW tab on my spreadsheet. Two things to note about this list. First, I only read completed stories, so you won't find any abandoned fics or WIP. Second, some of these are bad, I included stories that I didn't like and didn't finish. I did not include my ratings for each fic since everyone has their own taste and I will let you decide on your own.

Hail Odysseus by Brennus; This means war by jeconais; Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs; The Weapon by MK-ONE; Backward with a purpose part by Deadwoodpkr; Thorny Rose Trilogy by Brennus; The Return of the marauders by thelastzion; Ginny Duty by Count Westwest; Refiners Fire/Time of Destiny by Abraxan; my slytherin harry by hermyd; Abraxus by Brennus; Godrics Legacy by hermyd; Homecoming by Brennus; The Butterfly Effect by Brennus; The Namless Man by Brennus; unintended consequences by sbmcneil; remember by sbmcneil; After The End by Sugar Quill; The Awakening Power by sib-ff; Bonds of Blood and Magic by duelist; Taking Control/Free Life/Prevailing Counterpoint by 2 authors; Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs; Aspirations by megamatt09; The Strength to Fight by Nightflight; Birthday Surprises by Lolly Phoenix; Anything's Possible by sillycucumber; Elemental Harry by hermyd; Alphas trilogy by miz636; What if? by Vance McGill.

Edit: I forgot [[/u/Psantium]] was asking for HP/GW stories awhile back and I forgot to giving him my spreadsheet for the wiki (there are a few ship/no ship tabs). If you want, [[/u/Psantium]] just shoot me a PM and I can send you a link via dropbox.
