Any cool fics where the DADA teachers aren't the same Quirrelmort, Lockhart, Lupin (ok, Lupin can stay because he's adorable), Crouch/Moody, etc?

I've been devouring so much fanfiction, but I'm kinda tired of starting a new story and it's "oh, look, Quirrell wants the Philosopher's stone; what. a. surprise" "Lockhart? Incompetent? You don't say!" "Moody was a Death Eater in disguise? GASP!"

(time travel fics would be cool, if only to see Harry's "wtf have I done to the timeline")

oneshots, long shots, novel-length stories, unfinished, ongoing, shipping, bashing, angst, fluff, smut, crack; I don't care, gimme any story that's interesting~


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry grew up in a loving Muggle family, although Muggle authorities had ulterior motives. Quirrell still taught a bit, but the canon plot was quickly shot. This fic is only the first part of a trilogy and ends midway through Year 3 [[/spoiler][when SoS collapsed in a disorderly fashion]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart took the post in Year 1 and was very competent.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

*** Does anything ever happen in the sequels of Where in the World is Harry Potter? I read that and it was kinda funny and it's "mystery" was interesting enough to keep me invested. But really, nothing happened at all. I was kind of waiting for the shoe to drop and it never did. My only other issue was that every single character had the same exact characterization.

** linkffn(One World) has a pretty unusual teacher for... Second Year, was it? Also, in both linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) and linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Snakes), Quirrell's body is full-on possessed by Voldemort, so while it's technically the same character the results are rather different.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
