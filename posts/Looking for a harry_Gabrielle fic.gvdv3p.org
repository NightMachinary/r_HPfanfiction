:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read it a couple years ago. Gabrielle shows up at hogwarts in either 5th or 6th year. Apparently they had bonded when he saved her in the lake but someone(Dumbledore) and modified his memories. Also it was aluded to that hermione and ginny were in a relationship. I cant remember the name for the life of me though. Thanks in advance


** never read it, but commenting on this post so I can check it again later and hopefully read it

******* Only one I had issue with was the ending to Happily ever after. Great story but the end just felt...off to me. Still love the story and will reread it often but the ending always leave me feeling unsatisfied

******** Yea, that one is definitely the worse one of his Harry/Gabby fics. "Hope" is orders of magnitude better in my opinion.

********** True, but my biggest wish would be to see "Hogwarts Dawn" and the "Perfect Slytherins" series finished, both are so great. Sad that it will never happen.

Anyways, good luck with your search, can't say it rings a bell for me. And I hope you enjoy "Hope" if you decide to go for it.
