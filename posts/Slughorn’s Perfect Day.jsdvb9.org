While there, he starts out as the Wizarding Studies professor (while running his Slug Club on the side) but ends up teaching Potions while Snape shifts across to cover DADA. He finally retires and sets up a larger version of his Slug Club with financial aid from Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy (who were trying to one-up each other) with the results [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202563/4/The-Kryptonian-Grimoire][as seen here]].
