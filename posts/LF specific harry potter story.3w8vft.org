what i remember from that fic is harry cursing his money and giving it away.


** I can vaguely recall Harry cursing a knut and giving to a goblin as a bribe (probably a time/dimensional travel story), but nothing else helpful comes to mind. Did he curse /all/ his money in the fic you are thinking of?

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/2/Reunion][Chapter 2 of Reunion]] is the one that you're thinking of I'm pretty sure.

i remember he cursed the money so that everyone that take the money will get ill and slowly die, i think colin or danis creevy didnt touch the money.

** You may be thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5366030/1/Azalea-Potter][Azalea Potter]], which fits some of what you've written (though I don't know if the bit about the Creeveys bits, since I haven't read it in a long time).

However, a warning. From what little I /do/ recall about it, it was rather bad. It was written by Skysaber/PerfectLionheart/JaredOrnstead, so that should give you an idea of its level of quality.
