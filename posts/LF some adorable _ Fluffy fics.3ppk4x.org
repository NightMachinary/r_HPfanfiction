** Harry/Luna

linkffn(Contemplating Clouds)

linkffn(Protection from Nargles)

And maybe linkao3(Tomorrowland by winterfool). I'm not sure if this is fluffy enough to meet the criteria.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) is definitely fluffy and wonderful. (though admittedly not quite as adorable as Full Circle)

Most of canoncansodoff's work outside of "Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall" and portions of "A Boon for Bill" are at least somewhat fluffy as well, but they also lean nsfw/lemony, so fair warning and all that.

Most of apAidan's oneshot's are a bit fluffy as well. Unfortunately, I don't have much else to recommend. I suppose it's possible to argue that something like the Where in the World is Harry Potter trilogy as completely fluff, but I'd put more as a comedy with a splash of mystery

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.
