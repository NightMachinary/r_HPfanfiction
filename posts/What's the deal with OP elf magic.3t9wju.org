** Elves are one of many, many things in the series that make the stories infuriating at times... and make fanfiction possible.

The simple answer for why and how elves can do "X" in the series is "because JKR needed them to be able to do it for the plot to move forward." She needed Kreacher to escape the cave, for Dobby to apparate a whole crowd to Shell Cottage, etc.

The fact that these abilities don't get used anywhere else is infuriating if you stop to think about it.

However, it's the fact that elves clearly can do some interesting things, but it's not explained what their limits are, that makes fanfiction possible. *Every* explanation is non-canon. Some explanations are more consistent with canon than others, but the are all non-canon. This makes them a potentially interesting element in fanfiction.

Yes, even the explanations that make them little gods are potentially interesting (even if, in practice, they are used in a more lazy manner). Maybe they were once on the verge of conquering us, but a tricky wizard enslaved them, making them what they are now. Maybe they voluntarily enslaved themselves and are judging us. Who knows?

To be quite honest, I think such explanations have a lot more potential than the ones which greatly limit them in order to conform more tightly to canon. If done right, they require more imagination and can result in a more original and interesting story.

Anyway, my point is that this is one of the reasons why so much fanfic for HP exists - you can create a couple dozen different explanations which are all canon-ish, and dozens more which diverge even more from canon, all of which can be central or at least major elements in a different fic. And there are dozens of similar elements from the original series.

There are so many things where JKR explained just enough to make us interested, but left so much more unexplained... it's almost like she intended others to fill in the blank spaces she left open. The truth, though, is that she probably didn't think or plan about them all in such detail and we aren't intended to, either. So don't stress out trying to make everything work - you probably can't (rather like Roman and Greek mythology, another great source for new tales). Instead, just have fun with it.

The plot-drivenness of HP sometimes infuriates me...

** It's not canon. It started due to a couple of things showing up in canon, namely Kreacher's ability to Apparate out of the Infiri's grasp and Dobby's ability to Apparate into an Anti-Apparatable Malfoy Manor. People think little about it and consider this slave race to be gods of some sort.

There are explanations though.

It is my headcanon that elf-Apparition and wizard-Apparition are different enough that an Anti-Apparition Jinx is unable to stop an elf. BUT that doesn't mean there isn't an elf-specific version of the jinx.

When Voldemort set up the Cave, the idea of someone using an elf just slipped his mind, it happens to the best of us. Or perhaps, being Muggle-raised, he never learned the difference between elf- and wizard-Apparition so he just thought the wizard jinx could keep out elves.

Dobby was able to bypass the Malfoy jinx because, in case you dude's have forgotten, Dobby used to be a Malfoy elf. Lucius must have forgotten to take Dobby from the whitelist. It would certainly explain why Harry never summoned Kreacher (the elf forced to obey his orders without question and the elf that set up Sirius' death) and told him to jump into the warzone that was ground-floor and retrieve Hermione from Bellatrix.

How Dobby managed to Apparate to Shell Cottage without being informed of its location by the Secret Keeper (Bill Weasley) remains a mystery.

Or maybe Dobby was recruited into the Order of the Phoenix and already knew the secret before the debacle at Malfoy Manor.

*** This makes sense, it also explains why Lucius doesn't see through Harry sock ploy despite being a death eater who is totally used to tricks and double crosses (because why would somebody bother to help an elf) and what Dumbledore says about Voldemort not considering that anybody would bother to use an elf. (Wait. May be misremembering quote about boat only holding one adult. That was kind of an oversight, too, though. Didn't the prophecy say that Harry would kill him before he turned 17?)

Most wizards probably aren't used to elf magic, because the loyal house elves are so old and so bound that they only obey their masters, and there's probably a code of honour among old wizards or something that you don't use your elf as an enemy in battle. But they aren't used to free elves with agency thinking and acting for themselves and it takes them by surprise.

**** I figured the sock was only interpreted by Dobby to release him, as it was otherwise inconsequential. I'd imagine, normal elves not wanting to be free, would need an explicit command along with the clothes. Dobby was just being a weirdo, took it as being freed.

****** What? It fact that Dobby is abnormal for house-elves. Thus, he's weird. So then can be described as a weirdo. Is there some other association/connotation to weirdo I'm missing or were you making a joke?

** Pretty much everything about House elves in fanfiction isn't canon. Like Abyranss said, elf-Apparition and wizard-Apparition are different beasts. My thoughts are that elf magic is more "tricksy" than wizard magic, based on Dobby using his magic to simulate Harry casting a levitation charm in second year and all the subsequent "savings". Elves can't actually do anything on par with wizards, but they can do simple spells and kind of piggyback off of existing ones like, say, corrupting the targeting spell on a bludger or switching the Platform 9 and 3/4 archway from "Open" to "Closed". I think a popular theory is that they're enslaved brownies, and brownies were known tricksters when you upset them.

In the case of Dobby repelling Malfoy at the end of second year, that was probably the limit of his abilities, offensive-wise. Probably tired him out, too.

** I read a fic awhile back where the Death Eaters cast the Imperius on a bunch of house elves and tied them to their backs and forced them to apparate around Hogwarts during an attack. It was quite clever and made me sort of scratch my head wondering if that would work in canon. Nothing I can recall would make it not possible.
