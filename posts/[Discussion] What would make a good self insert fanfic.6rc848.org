I feel that, while most self insert fanfics are pretty dire, they don't have to be. Most of the self insert come from a place of wish fulfillment. The author wants to be super powerful, be Harry's best friend, romance Draco, etc. If the wish fulfillment was taken out of the equation or lessened dramatically, I feel like a decent story could emerge. It would take a certain willingness to make fun of yourself and see your own flaws.

Then again to play Devil's Advocate... If there is no wish fulfillment, would anyone write a self insert fanfic at all? Would the challenge be enough for someone?

What do you guys think? Is it possible make a good self insert fanfic or are they inherently terrible? And if they're not doomed, what elements need to be present (or absent) to make a good story?


** I would like to read a fic that really plays on the self-insert wish fulfillment.

As in, the entire first chapter plays out exactly like the author wants to. And then, at the end of the chapter, there's the big twist. Nobody in this world cares that you want to make this a wish fulfillment. You still gotta play by the rules.

It starts when you get the enormous pricetags of all those cool multi-compartment trunks slapped in your face and your wand isn't made of thestral hair and ancient mahagoni, but birch and unicorn.

You get sorted into the House you really don't want, because lets be honest - you ain't sly and cunning and the bravest thing you did was to kill that very big spider by throwing a book at it.

Then nobody includes you. That is - none of the important characters. You make your friends, sure. But Philosophers Stone kinda plays out without you. You try to interfere, but an actual troll is hella scary - magic is way harder than you thought, and why the hell would the protagonists include you, anyway? You're a weird-ish Ravenclaw, bugger off.

And then you turn it around in later years. You realize that the knowledge of the book is not enough. You have to make a stand and actually carve out a place for you in this world. You're not getting Hermione, Ginny, Fleur,... - but by Merlin, that barely mentioned sidecharacter girl makes your heart pump a mile a minute. In the fight against Voldemort you do what you can, just the part with the active fighting scares the living hell out of you. Have you /seen/ Bellatrix Lestrange? Fuck. That. But you send the position of and traps around the Horcrux anonymously. Where would you get that knowledge if you're not a Death Eater?

In the end you stand at the side, applauding Harry Potter - a man who needs a second to remember your name - and are content in being there.

*** I always saw myself as something like this. I'd make all these grand plans to get myself into the trio and help them and then get sorted into Hufflepuff and spend the next year as that weird hufflepuff girl who kept trying to talk to them during Herbology. And then probably spend half of second year petrified. lol

** What's the remaining stuff that makes self inserts interesting if you take out the wish fulfilment? Breaking the 4th wall? There are better and more interesting ways to do that.

I really don't see the appeal... what is there left to distinguish a self-insert with a fic featuring an OC? An OC which has the advantage that he can be interesting: Lets face it, most people are boring, I'm certainly not narcissistic enough that I as a character would be particularly intriguing in any story..

** I just want a SI where they insert into pre Harry years and then actually get a job and do something interesting like actually try and learn magic.. basically just a really big world building fix where it doesn't focus on the main plot

** If it were to work in my mind it would have to be an outside in. Magic exists, you're a muggle, prove it. Dodge the obliviators and work around muggle repelling wards to try and stay alive when Voldemort is raiding the muggle world and you can't say anything to anyone without dying.

Hindsight is the biggest curse on self inserts. Power wanks exist without SIs and while so does hindsight, its easily tempting in SI. The biggest part of the story is the journey not the conflict resolution. A self insert that knows all the loctions of Voldemort's horcruxes defeats the true purpose the hunt, to show the characters struggle and develop. A self insert that becomes the centre of the focus can go horribly wrong. Leave Hogwarts behind, delve into magic from the outside.

*** Seconded. The story ended in a decent way, all the SI needs to do is save the people that like at the last moment and all is fine.

All the while, you get to experiment with MAGIC! Screw the story, 100+ years of magic is way better than the risk of death from interfering.

** My biggest problem with SI stories is that the writer mostly knows the plot, this ends up with ridiculous fix-its.

** One way, I think, is to make your SI into an absolute nobody. I mean if we're talking about inserted into characters, don't have your SI become Ron or Draco or Dudley or Susan Bones or anyone from Harry's year. Do something creative and have your SI become Dirk Cresswell or Williamson the Auror or Ernie Prang. Don't stick to Hogwarts and branch out.

** Keep the stakes small, and keep the story short.

Write a small little adventure where the OC wants Harry's help to sneak out to visit a little first year that Umbridge has put into overnight detention.

Now you have a reason to spend time with Harry, you have a common goal to work towards and bond over, but because the setting is kept to one night, you don't become his BFF and usurp Ron and Hermione. Because you don't end up fighting Voldemort you can't make yourself too OP. Worrying abut whether that shadow around the corner is Snape or Flich or Umbridge still allows for a good deal of tension, and it keeps the plot grounded and believable.

What I'm saying is, at least save the sex for Chapter Two

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** They're not absolutely terrible, they just have to be approached properly, without idealising yourself when you create a character out of what you have. Better yet, if you are going to create a wizard/witch version of yourself, start with how you were at 10/11, all the good and all the bad and all the weird, and put that to writing.

A self-insert shouldn't take the spotlight, but it doesn't mean they can't influence things to /some/ degree, that they have to stay a background character. For example, and a big one at that, let's have a self-insert who wasn't really significant outside of believing in doing what's right who joined the DA and then managed to convince the others to let them tag with the group to the ministry because it's the right thing to do; sure, all that's happened there was a mess, but you only need one more person who would momentarily distract Bellatrix and Sirius has a shot at living (because she'd then proceed to crucio the offender, giving Sirius some breathing room), and even if the self-insert doesn't really do anything noteworthy from then on aside from being, it's still a change that really doesn't have to be bad. The key is restraint, don't have whatever the cahracter does be oh-so-great and the best thing ever and so on and so on and them the best friend ever, just have them be a /person/, with all the baggage that /that/ includes.
