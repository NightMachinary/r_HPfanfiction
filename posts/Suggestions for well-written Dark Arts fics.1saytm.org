Hey guys! I recently read and very much enjoyed Raining Ink's /Out of the Night/ and The Santi's /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/, and was wondering if anyone had any recs for well-written fics within this general space.

I think I specifically enjoyed the (somewhat AU) exploration of the Dark Arts and the academically-focused Harry, but I'm open to any suggestions. :)

edit: Raining Ink took /Out of the Night/ down some time ago, but you can find it archived in various places, or take a look at BekkaJane's (brief) attempt at updating it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][here]]. He/she wrote one additional chapter before abandoning it again. The first 32 chapters are both unmodified and convenient.

Also, the version of /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ that appears on fanfiction.net is not fully updated; the [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][darklordpotter.net version]] has several additional chapters. (It's still abandoned, though.)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] by Silently Watches is a pretty good one that I just recently finished reading. Be warned it is fem!Harry with Wrong Boy Who Lived and Lily and James being alive. Also, kinda disturbing on various levels. It's completed with almost a 190k word count, no sequel posted yet.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/][Sacrifices Arc]] has an original take on the actual nature of Light and Dark and is a complete, 7 book series. I haven't read either of the two that you mentioned (that's about to change) so I'm not entirely sure if it fits what you're looking for. Perhaps someone else can verify the recommendation? HPDM slash in the later years. Fantastic story.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oathbreaker]] series is phenomenal.
