PIMP Hearing the sound of 50 cents P.I.M.P out of the kitchen of potter manor, harry was wondering who was listening to it. Daphne Potter , nee greengrass, his wife of 3 years, normaly doesn't like hiphop so he was quite confused as he entered the kitchen. coming into the kitchen he saw dobby working on supper wearing excentric clothes as always, but at a second glance Harry recognized what dobby was wearing. dobby wore a white t-shirt which was by far to big, a black vest over it, a necklace with a cross charm attached to it and a white bandana. He just looked like the cover of the single PIMP by 50 cent. After his initial shock harry heared dobbys nearly squealing voice "... i dont know what your heard about me.." Harry lookimg quite shoked quickly leaves the kitchen and runs up the stairs of potter manor to find his beloved wife.  â€¢ Daphne, 8 Months pregnant, was reminiscing her life after the second blood war. Because she needed to return to hogwarts for her "8. year" because she got tortured severly quite early in her seventh year because she help a halfblood, she never returned that year. after Harry got the final blow, He and Ginny never got back together, stating the war changed them too much. Beeing Headgirl and Headboy Harry and Daphne grew quite close because of the shared common room. The fact that she helped Garry caring for Teddy when he visited during some weekends and other occasions when Andromeda wasnt available, helped flourish ther relationship, so halfway through theire 8th year harry asked her to be her girlfriend which she happily agreed to. she loved harry deeply, he was one of the most powerful wizards ever, was the most caring person she knew, the most loving husband a girl can ask for, even though his upbringing by the dursleys, but if there was one thing daphne hates about harry, it was his favourite music. HipHop, especially Gangster Rap by the likes of 50 cent, NWA, 2 pac and so on. while reminiscing Daphne heard steps running fast towards her. Daphne beeing heavily pregnant with twins, boy and girl, laid on theire shared bed. sighing she saw hearry storming in. "Ahh Daphne my everloving wife, do you remember when you reluctantly accepted to get a stereo to listen to muggle music?" Harry asked abit afraid. " yeah, you assured me that I dont have to listen to this abomination you call music". " well firstly 50 cent is an artitst who rivials the genius of Wagner and Da Vinci in his art, secondly, I may or may have not listend to the "abomination" while dobby was in the room." Harry explained Daphnes face lost all colors. "No.. please no" "Yes" " oh for fuck sake, what did he do" " well he's working in the kitchen for supper" "yes" "and he wears eccentric clothes" "yes nothing abnormal till now" "well you see, he wears the same clothes as 50 cent on the cover of his single" " noooooo" "and perhabs he may or may not quotes the song and raps it while working" In this Moment Dobby was walking inside the bedroom with 2 trays floating infront of him. also floating, but behind him was a magical stereo. out of the boxes came the sound of PIMP while dobby loudly sang " cause im a motherfucking PIMP". At a second glance Harry now saw a second Neklace which had pimp written in big gold letters. Seeing this Daphne broke in a fit of laughter. when dobby left Daphne still couldn't stop laughing. After 5 minutes she composed herself, still madly giggling she said " you still sleep on the couch the next week.... no transfiguration!." harry left with a big sigh...

"And this blasted thing gets out of the house i wont have my kids corrupted with this abomination of music!" " yes dear"
