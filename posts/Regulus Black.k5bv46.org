There are many fanfictions out there that portray Regulus Black in different ways. There are tons of head canons and all, but I really want to know what he is generally thought of by this fandom. Hence, this post.

What we know of him: Sirius' brother, sort of like Draco Malfoy, seeker, perfect heir, loves elves.

What I want to know: His personality, why he just offed himself for Kreacher - like was Kreacher his only breaking point, or were there more? why he didn't go to Sirius or Dumbledore?

I really wish there was a memory of Regulus shown or a letter he wrote to Sirius or something like that in canon.


** The beauty of Regulus is that he can be whatever you want. We know so little of him and everything we do know can be interpreted in multiple ways. My headcanons about Regulus change every other two weeks and depend on which fic I'm currently reading.

I see Regulus a little as the Marauders Era version of Draco Malfoy. I think he believed in the blood supremacy and got sucked in the idea of fighting for the noble cause and becoming a Death Eater, probably without a full knowledge what it would mean.

He was a proud Slytherin and a proud pureblood, and pretty smart (he knew about Horcruxes at the age of 18).

Lately, I started to believe him going to the cave was more suicide than an act of bravery. I think when he realised what it means to be a Death Eater, he wanted out, but you can't hand Voldemort a resignation and survive. Kreacher, the cave and Horcrux were the last straw, but also an opportunity to end his life in a way that would mean something even if no one would know what he did.

I think this is so spot on. Given the fact that no one seems to know what happened to him (aside from Kreacher), he didn't 'shame' his family like Sirius (which I believe required much more bravery) by defecting. It was a quick and quiet out that he hoped would help bring down Voldemort. He was going to die either way if he wanted out, and going into the cave was at least on his terms.

*** Oh wow! I didn't think of it that way! I mean yeah, the depression, all those people getting killed, and how he doesn't know if Sirius still considers him a brother or not, and just reaching his adulthood-- this has opened so many doors for me!

And btw, same here, my head canons keep oon changing lol. I think there is no end for speculation, but we may never get the right facts - ignoring the fact that he doesn't even exist lol. So yeah, he's a mixup of Percy, Malfoy and Snape.

....weird.

**** Somewhat, but not really. We could see Sirius (even if it was through Harry's eyes), and we know much more about Sirius.

Regulus was mentioned by three characters. Sirius, who spent 12 years in Azkaban, and before that ran away from home, so he wouldn't really know the person his brother was in the last few years of his life. Kreacher, who's not exactly sane and again, with Regulus away at Hogwarts most of the year, Kreacher could be a bit wrong about him. Slughorn, who only tells Harry he was in Slytherin.

** The photos and articles about the Dark Lord and his followers cut from the Daily Prophet that were on his bedroom walls let me believe that he believed in blood supremacy. He actually wanted to be a Death Eater because he admired the Dark Lord.

My guess is that he didn't realise the Reality of being a Death Eater until he actually was one. And I believe that Kraecher (bc he was important to him) and the fact that Voldemort made Horcruxes were the last straw.

I agree with that. I think he was really similar to Draco. Draco also wanted to be a Death Eater. Draco also really believed in blood supremacy and the cause until he saw Voldemort in action. Both of them had their moments of clearity when it was to late.\\
For Regulus that was when Voldemort mistreated Kreacher, for Draco it was when he threatend him and his family.

**** I wish redemption had been more of a theme in the books :') it would've been nice to see Draco slowly come to terms with his bigotry, maybe a few scenes where Narcissa mourns the fall of the House of Black, a conversation with Walburga's portrait where she learns that both her sons died because of Voldemort, etc

** I see him more of a Percy than a Malfoy, except that rather than falling into and then becoming disenamoured with the Ministry it's with the Death Eaters.

At first he does believe in the cause and their values, but as he gets in deeper he starts to see how warped their means are, which starts to make him question the organization as a whole.

I don't think he offed himself for Kreacher, he's a martyr that died trying to bring down Voldemort by (in his mind) making him mortal again. The thing with Kreacher was an important, but not the only factor, in Regulus' disenchantment.

I don't think he could go to Dumbledore or Sirius because neither trusted him and as much as he wanted to bring down Voldemort, he also wanted to protect his parents and that kind of betrayal would lead to retribution.

*** I agree with you about the cave, I feel like there definitely had to be some sort of suicidal ideation there or intent. The note left in the fake locket and just the general hopelessness of the situation- being apart of a terrorist group he no longer believed in, not being able to leave, etc. So sad. Wish we knew more about what led up to him making the note and what was said/alluded to in Kreacher's Tale.

***** I agree with you. Things were pretty bad during the Second War, but Voldemort's first rise to power sounds much more interesting and dangerous, not to mention much more tragic.

I feel like a whole generation was lost due to the War, and they were described as incredible, brilliant people. It's such a loss to the wizarding world. Lily and James dead at 21, Sirius sent to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, Gideon and Fabian dead, Regulus dead, Frank and Alice tortured to insanity. Snape bounded to Dumbledore.

If JKR ever wanted to write HP version for adults, the First War with Voldemort could be a great setting.

****** I know! She could start with how Voldemort tricked people into becoming DE, [like he does with Malfoy in sw and regulus too] or charmed them with promises of better future and they agreed, but regretted later on. The Black's home life, the political situation, the muggleborns, smuggling muggles out of the country - pun intended!, what happened at Hogsmeade and Hogwarts meanwhile, ministry's denial, how they cope /after/ his death, just more in detail and less PG-13ed. There's so so many possibilities.. ;C

uk if he hadn't gone after Harry, it would definitely have been a Voldemort Wins! era after that. And the main reason y harry is so famous is because everybody knew that he prevented them from an era of tyranny however illogical the thought is. +I mean it's just not logical at all..+

**** Well, if he drank the same kind of potion Dumbledore drank he certainly would have been in a hopeless/suicidal state of mind afterward. We don't know a ton about the long term effects of that potion either. Kreacher certainly wasn't in great mental shape even years afterward, but to be fair he likely had a variety of mental stressors to deal with on top of that.

***** Yes, but he had prepared for death before he went to the cave. He told Kreacher to destroy the locket and he wrote the suicidal letter, so he knew he's going to die before he drank the potion.

Kreacher's experience at the cave should have given Regulus a clue how to survive. Kreacher could have snatched the locket and Regulus and apparate them both out of there. Judging by what we've seen in HBP, there was time for that.

Also, I think Regulus had to give his orders to Kreacher before the potion and tell him not to listen to him after he starts drinking because otherwise, Kreacher wouldn't force the potion down his throat (at some point I expect Regulus begged Kreacher to stop like Dumbledore has with Harry).

****** Those are really good points! It does make one wonder what was so terrible that Regulus would have rather died than just tried faking his death and moving to Australia or something. Maybe Voldemort could have tracked him through the dark mark or something.

**** That's actually one of the more interesting points. Canon says Orion died the same year as Regulus, but not when. Was it after? A result of losing both of his sons? Was he in on the horcruxes? Was he just sick like James's parents? Someone mentioned a theory that most of the Blacks were in on it. Because we know that Regulus, Orion, and Alphard all died at the same time.

***** It's definitely strange how many Blacks died around the same time. Wizards were supposed to live longer than muggles yet in one family we have Lycoris (61), Regulus (53), Orion (50), Alphard (we don't know his exact age but he couldn't be older than 50) and Regulus (18). Like seriously, there was something shady going on...

******* Yeah, I've been looking for a fic that focuses on this but found nothing so far.

I guess there is some murder mystery or JKR just got rid of them for the plot and forgot what she said about wizards living longer :D

I mean, if it was just Orion or just Alphard it wouldn't be that strange, but when you look at the Black Family Tree they really didn't live that long.

Because he loved kreacher, I've always had a headcanon that he was a bit of a hermione. He might not passionately fight for the rights of elves, goblins, or werewolves, but he recognizes that they're not any less than wizards and witches.

** I always imagined he got a little ignored by the family as the younger brother, doubly so due to Sirius' very likely loud disruptiveness, so he probably ended up being pretty close to Kreacher and was possibly even mostly raised by him. Kreacher would've been the one there for him throughout his childhood, so Regulus tried his best to be there for Kreacher on the day he died.
