After his failed task, Draco lives in constant fear in the Manor, watching Death Eaters torture and kill muggles/muggle-borns every day. Narcissa notices this and arranges for him to attend his next year at Hogwarts.

There, the Carrows aren't too fond of him and publicly shame him for not being able to kill an old man. Also, Crabbe and Goyle have become very good at following the Carrows' orders.

Desperate, he turns to Neville Longbottom, new leader of the DA and helps him defy the reign of terror in Hogwarts.

Pairing: Draco/Neville
