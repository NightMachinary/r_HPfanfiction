I love Neville and I love Luna, but I get rather picky with the way they are written. I want to see them together written in a realistic way.

I love the ship a whole lot, the story can be close to canon or far away or anything in between.

For other pairings I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine
