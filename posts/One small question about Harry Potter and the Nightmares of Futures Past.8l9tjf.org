Hi! I'm new to fan-fiction. Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is the first I ever read, and there's one thing that bothers me.

I'm talking about the butchering of Snape's character. I'm only in the beginning, but Harry HATES him and Snape overall feels genuinely evil. Is this because the fic is older than the seventh book? Will this be addressed later in the story? This kinda kills it for me a bit, Snape deserves better.

*** Thank you! Snape isn't, and isn't even meant to be, a good person. Him and Draco are there to show that there are no clearly defined sides in war, and that there are no clear distinctions of good vs evil. He's one of the good guys but is in no way a good guy. He's a bully, an asshole, he's petty, and he clearly abuses a position of power all while still being one of the good guys. He is not meant to be a likable character yet so many people in the fandom expect him to be this secretly kind and caring person just because he jealously loved Lilly and wanted revenge on her murderer all while he kind of ignores the fact that he pointed Voldemort in their direction in the first place.

Edit: To the people downvoting me, would you care to defend your opinion on how Snape is even remotely a decent human being?

*** So Snape is plain evil in the fic? Well, that's a bummer, since we know that Harry didn't hate him at all in the end.

**** Up to its current state, Snape is presumed evil with no evidence he's secretly a double agent

So?! As you've been told the story was written before DH and Harry has every reason to hate him, since he believes he murdered Dumbledore in cold blood.

If you can't wrap your head around alternate universe (AU) and point of divergence fiction like this there's only a certain subset of fanfiction that will be of interest to you: They are usually referred to as canon-compliant and/or next-gen fics.
