In the mood for Long or Medium length Harry/Multi /not harem/ so, at most, it's Harry with 3 or 4 Girls and no more. Bonus points if it's girls that are rare /ie no Ginny, Hermione, The Usual/


** Linkffn(11898648) is a multi, it does have hermione as pairing, but it's really well written

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
