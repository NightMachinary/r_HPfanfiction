If you're writing a Ron-bashing fic, you mustn't forget these clich√©s. Trust me, it'll make your writing stand out from the crowd. ^{^{^{/s}}}

Let me know if I missed any.


** I think you forgot somes :

- "But she/he is a Slimy Snake!
- Ron's table maners are inexistant and watching him eat is an horific experience
- "This is not bashing, I'm just treating him how I think he deserve to be treated".

**** He doesn't have the best table manners, but it's more along the line of "Normal teenage boy in front of a feast" (usually only mentionned during the Sorting Feast) than "Caveman so messy everyone in a 10 meters radius just lost his appetite" like it's described in the Ron Bashing fics.

I meant when Ron (and/or Ginny) are potioning Hermione (and/or Harry) undetected for months or years despite Harry and Hermione being the ultimate power couple that can defeat anything in their path. /s

If Harmony is so perfect, then why are they getting potioned for months or years when they have Super!Harry tropes (Inheritance rings, magic trunk, portable potions lab, goblins on tap, Heir(s) of Hogwarts, etc) at their disposal? Are the Weasleys smarter than them despite all the tools they have, or are Harmony underestimating them? But try pointing this out and it becomes "Don't like, don't read." Make it make sense!

**** Hey now you're picking on plot holes. üòÅ

Most fanfics (and the books themselves) have plot holes large enough to drive a fleet of trucks side by side through.

A prime example is Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin Linkao3(18179480)

Even though Harry travels back in time and knows all about the potioning he still fails to protect Hermione from getting potioned and finally has to "kidnap her" and give her a massive dose of a flushing agent. And this is when he "came back" way before any potioning had started.

I think the problem is like computer programming. Where I could always spot the problem in someone else's program in half a heartbeat but took forever to find the one's in my software. Here the authors don't see the plot hole/lack of logic in their story and just assume you're being "mean".

Sexism and child abuse are nowhere near alike enough to compare them that way.

Molly /dictated/ chores as busywork/punishments and from what was shown, was out in the yard/farm, cleaning grimmauld and whatnot. She took care of the majority of the inside stuff.

I believe that you aren't sexist/racist /if/ you make comments in ignorance. Once that ignorance is corrected and you still continue the course? Then yes, you are a racist/sexist.

Ron bashing is the vanilla extract, a little goes a long way.

No, because she believed in her opinions and was still clever and did not openly assault anyone. Seen in the laws she makes right after the students do something that she doesn't like.

The 'subtle' bashing is making every character but Ron smarter, more powerful, more creative, etc than him, making him look like an idiot in comparison.

** I've seen exactly one fic that has good and actually minor Ron bashing.

It's linkffn(A Bond Of Family by Daily-Chan) and it's part of a series, I think linkffn(Home by Daily-Chan) is the first part.

In this fic, Ron is bad at controlling his emotions, but with help he realizes this and works to get better. There's a few other points but this is what sticks out the most to me. The fic's really good.
