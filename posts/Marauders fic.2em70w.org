** I read a few, but didn't bookmark all of them.

In the story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] two of the Marauders didn't take it well at first. This enormous fic is written entirely from Remus' POV. If you don't feel like reading all of it, there are also a few one-shot extras from other characters' POV's, including discovery of Remus' secret ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7693104/1/His-Overcharged-Soul][His Overcharged Soul]]) and following confrontation([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7881978/1/The-End-of-Reckoning][The End of Reckoning]]).

Also, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2207506/1/Man-on-the-Moon][Man on the Moon]].
