I wanted to put this idea out there because I'm not talented enough to write this. If there are any fics with this premise, I'd love to read them.

So we know that the only defense against the Dementors is the Patronus Charm, which only repels them. And in book six, Fudge tells the muggle Prime Minister that they can breed. That sounds like an absolute fucking disaster. We don't know if Dementors can die of old age, but if they don't, that means that their numbers will keep increasing until they completely take over the world. I thought it would be a cool idea to explore something like that from the perspective of the few survivors who are trying to find ways to permanently kill them, while having to deal with the effects millions of Dementors have on their mind.

Summary talks about zombies and they are around but it's the Dementors which are the real threat.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
