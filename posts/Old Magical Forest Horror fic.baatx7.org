I'm looking for an old, early 2000's fic where Draco and Hermione are accidentally sent to a foreign magical forest full of horrific creatures without wands and they work together to try to get out of there alive but by some botched directions they end up going deeper into the forest and for some reason not even dumbledore can find them. Notable scenes: plain-like grassy fields filled with carnivorous creatures, a lake with an eldritch horror, a scene with sentient vines, description of an ancient evil in the depth of the forest, slowly manipulating Draco and Hermione towards it.

The fic was amazing and truly original but I haven't been able to find it again, even more than a decade later.

Could anyone please help me find it?


** YES! The God of the Lost by gravidy. The fic that first brought me into HP fanfiction, and I've never found anything that scratched the same itch. I was so sad when it, and the rest of gravidy's fics, were taken down. If you PM me, I can send you the pdf of at least most (maybe not all) of the posted chapters.

**** It's honestly strangely comforting for me to know that someone else out there still remembers gravidy's fics from Dramione fandom more than a decade ago. :) I hope it's just as enjoyable as you remember!

***** I remember finding it in fanfiction.net and giving it a try, back when I was 12 years old and I was Just starting to read fanfiction. The story left me shaking, sometimes I felt so scared and confused that I didn't want to continue reading it but I continue because I remember it was SO well written that the scenes played like a movie. The images were so vivid!

Truly a masterpiece.

Thank you for sharing the pdf! ü§ó

*** Not a big dramione fan, but if it's well written i'll like it. That being said, Creepy magical woods get my fiction rocks off to the point of salivating, I love them spooky woods, i'd love to read this
