For example, around 60 - 70 thousand witches and wizards in Britain alone is pretty big in my opinion. 100 000 is ok but I don't want it to be so large, that the wizarding world has multiple cities, towns and even monarchies in their name. But there is more than Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley.

Does such a fic exist?


** How about fics that include the international wizarding world? I'd be interesting to see how muggle politics unknowingly influence the magical world, for example what happens to magical governments when borders shift? Also, how is the situation like for wizards in North Korea? Did they all flee to the South? Is there a tyrannical magical government cooperating with Kim Jong-Il? Do they all live in hidden places that the muggle government is unaware of? Or is it a tyrannical wizard controlling the country, and Kim Jong-Il is just a puppet?

*** Blending in too much real-life tragedies and events in a fantasy world is never a good idea. Although this is fanfic so it isn't quite as bad as when JK writes in a major WWll plot in Fantastic Beasts.

**** I'm kinda worried about it in fantastic beasts.

On one hand Magical Nazis sounds cool. On the other it might be done poorly.

***** It would make more sense to just have the Wizarding and Muggle Wars run parallell to each other. I imagine that by the time the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald takes place the latter already has control (like a Wizarding Emperor) over multiple Wizarding nations including that of Germany and Austria. It would make the most sense if Grindelwald just saw the Muggle WWll as an advantage to decrease the Muggle population but that he actually never affected the actions of Hitler and the Third Reich and instead just stood by and let it happen without intervening. What do you think?

** This one mainly takes place in Sweden and other European countries (Finland, Norway, Denmark, France are featured so far) and is centered around Durmstrang. It mainly portrays the wider wizarding world as being quite big although no exact numbers are given. 60-70 000 wizards in Britain isn't unlikely considering that birth rate in wizarding Britain is low due to Voldemort, hence why we see so few students at Hogwarts.

With this population and even taking into account the higher average age of wizards, a birthrate ten times lower than observed anywhere. 10 thousand seems to be a more likely number.
