Since I'm fairly sure we're never told Astoria's age,I imagine she's in Dennis' year


** That's quite a niche pairing. Good luck in your search. :)

** That's an interesting pairing!

JKR said in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/J.K._Rowling_PotterCast_Interview][an interview in 2007]] that Astoria is two years younger than Daphne, which is why she's usually portrayed as younger than her sister

So she'd be closer to Dennis than Draco in age

I'm currently writing a multi-pairing one shot..... this has given me an idea :D

** I think that I've seen it once, but don't remember the title.

It's an independent!Harry story where he's with Daphne in some way and he gives Dennis the shovel talk. They're at best minor characters.

*** I believe that's in *Angry Harry and the Seven*. (Ch 83 for that particular scene)

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** Astoria is usually shown as one or two years below Harry and Daphne, depending on how she fits into the fic. It's nonspecific in the canon, other than that she's younger than her sister.
