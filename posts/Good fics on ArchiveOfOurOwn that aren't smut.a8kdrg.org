Tried looking at old threads like this and it was slim pickings. Any suggestions on what I should be reading? I've never had much luck finding good things with the tag system.

I'd prefer not slash but if it's got a solid plot I'll read the shit out of it.

Please no Snape/anyone. I've never found a good fic in that category and frankly I don't want to at this point.

** There's plenty good on Ao3, just hard to filter out all of the smut. I mostly find an author I like and take a look at their bookmarks. I also browse through [[https://pinboard.in][pinboard.in]] since it has a huge number of fanfiction bookmarkers and many like Ao3. I included some excellent fics that happen to be slash, but none are explicit and frankly most don't get anywhere near the labeled slash relationship. Hopefully you'll enjoy at least one of these and it can be a springboard to finding more fics:

  Draco is off for his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

#+begin_quote
  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezor with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** People must be tired of me recommending these by now, but here goes:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - I don't remember any smut scenes in this. Harry prays to Loki summer after first year. Bashing is only because people take a while to adapt to a more independent Harry, and slash warning is for minor characters. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - There is a little bit of smut in the last two books, but really short scenes and can be easily skipped over. There is a whole book that can be read as a stand alone where Harry goes to the avatar universe and joins Aang and the gang on their adventures. Slash is for Harry. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/sunmoonandstars/pseuds/sunmoonandstars][sunmoonandstars]] - So far, this has been very age appropriate for pre-teen and young teen relationships i.e. We're in fifth year and there's been barely any dating let alone smut. It is WBWL, James Potter survives/bashing, lots of other bashing, political and Slytherin Harry, etc. but it's very well done.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13414074][The Problem With Soulmarks Is]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LadyAramisGrey/pseuds/LadyAramisGrey][LadyAramisGrey]] - 69k and nothing romantic yet. "The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular. Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15966983][Harriet Potter and the Meddling of The Fates]] by[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow/pseuds/ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow][ItCouldAllBeForNothingTommorow]] - 107k and no romance yet. Fem Harry is Loki's daughter - this is the best version of this trope I've seen yet and does a really good job of making Voldie be on Harry's side but in a realistic way (for a world filled with magic and Asgardians anyway). I honestly love it and can't wait until the author gets a new charger so that they can go back to writing.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] is my favorite Harry as DADA Professor fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12299451/chapters/27959679][Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow]] focuses around a conversation between Lupin and Hermione. Set early on in DH.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255?view_adult=true][Employee of the Month]] follows Remus after the death of James and Lily as he attempts to live in the muggle world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]] is slash, but very plot heavy. Unique story line and original characters that you come to know and care for as much as the familar characters we all know. I'd read the authors note before starting, however, as certain topics may be triggering to some.
