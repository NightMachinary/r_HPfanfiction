More or less what the title says, preferably without a huge amount of angst about lily and with a Harry that actuality behaves as if they have been raised by a more or less Canon snape.

Thanks in advance.


** I cannot picture a scenario where F!Harry is raised by Snape and there isn't angst over Lily, unless she looks like James in which case there is going to be misplaced rage over him in addition to the angst.

** linkao3(Red Sorrow) kind of fits? Snape raises Harry's half sister who is biologically his daughter (even though she doesn't know until later). Both Harry and Ariel are children who lived. It can get kind of angsty (although not always about Lily), but Snape actually does seem mostly in character.

  AU. Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, and Severus Snape is given redemption in a form he least expected. A Sibling!Addition story beginning pre Philosopher's Stone through Prisoner of Azkaban. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix will continue in a separate installment.

** Let a death eater guy, who probably raped tortured and killed people raise a kid who reassemble either the love of his life or the man he hate the most. GREAT IDEA MAN!!!

** No, no, no, nopity, nope. Sorry but Snape is just horrible. I don't think giving a terriost(and yes he's a terriost no matter what all you Snape lovers believe) a child to raise is in any way a good idea. This is the guy who joined an organization that proclaimed proudly how much they enjoy killing. There called death eaters for f**** sake, but joined them because he chose dark magic(by proxy death eater sympathizers) over Lily, so why not kill everyone. Seriously he condoned the murder of a child as long as that child's mother lived.

Basically he's a disgusting human being, and I can't see him raising a child without doing certain horrible things. Especially a child of his love that(if going by canon) will eithier look like a mini-me of his love, or his most hated enemy, both of which don't seem like they'll end well when dealing with such a character.

In the end, the only reason he sided with Dumbledore was because Voldy killed Lily. That's it. Didn't do it to save people, or because it was right, he did it because Lily died to Voldemort. I'm sorry but are we supposed to forgive someone who at the least helped known murderers, and possible rapists because his love died. Do we forgive Voldemort because it was his bad childhood that lead to him becoming who he was, do we forgive Hitler because it was mainly his mothers death, fathers influence, and failing to get into art school that drove him to hate the jews, and by proxy do what he did. The answer is no, and I don't paint Snape with a different brush just because he was only a supporter.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

*** I agree with most of this. However, this does not change my request. Indeed, I would particularly look forward to reading a story that encompasses all of these things and deals with them.

As such, my request stands.

**** How would such a story be believable then. Snape would probably be working at Hogwarts still, and it'd become public knowledge pretty quickly, and I don't see the public reacting favorably to it, especially when there would be much better families that'd be chosen over Snape, not to mention there are some families that are actually related to Harry more closely than Snape(if Snape is even related to her at all), and Dumbledore would not approve of this because she'd be in the public eye. It just wouldn't make a believable story without seriously skewing canon.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

***** If i wanted to read a story that stuck rigidly to cannon, i would just reread the books. As for his or would work, i do not know. I am not very good at coming up with plots. It is up to the writer to make it work as they see fit.
