Hello, everyone,

I apologize for being inactive for a few months, I was incredibly busy with work, but it's mellowed out now, so I can get back to working on the Project.

I am happy to announce that Chapter 1 is now up on YouTube, you can find it if you search for "HP FanFiction Audiobook Project". Chapter 1 of /The Accidental Animagus/ will go up sometime next week, with Chapters 2 through 5 of /Not From Others/ going up between now and the end of February.

I'm aware my voice pauses and falters a bit, and I've tried to edit a majority of that out, but I might have overlooked some stuff. Let me know what you think by commenting on this post. (And, yes, I am fully aware that that's not much better than "Please Review")
