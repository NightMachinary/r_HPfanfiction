** Well, you have the Alexandra Quick series, which I think does a fantastic job of building a world which is both familiar yet unique. Taking place in the States it's still western culture though.

I had plans to write a fic focusing on people/taking place in Scandinavia (the premise being that they separated themselves from muggle society at the arrival of Christianity, thus being further removed from it than, say, their British counterparts). It got all vikingy, pretentious and quite frankly /lame/ though, so I abandoned it.

*** One of the things I try to avoid is the "all Klingons are like this" trap. Next to Mainstream Britain, I've mentioned the Purists, who think magic should be restricted to important things, not used for one's convenience, and the Faithful, a sect that takes the pagan worship much more seriously than Mainstream Britain, who's mostly paying lip service. Another thing that can help with making cultures come alive is unreliable information. Other countries might assume Hogwarts is like that, while in reality, they are far off the mark. The same goes for their countries. And finally, customs and laws might not be as strict in practise as in theory.

For vikings, I'd have the Norse Pantheon and ideals be known to be followed in Scandinavia, with Berserkers able to transform into bears and wolves serving as aurors and werewolves roaming the forests. In reality, not many actually do think you should to die with your wand in hand to reach Valhalla, nor believe that much in gods, and the tales of berserkers have been greatly exagerated. But werewolves are not shunned, and there's always a few among the aurors who can match the myth. Add some internal Dispute that almost ripped the countries apart during Grindelwald's War, which has barely healed, and you've got a base for a different, but hopefully not pretentious setting.

** The /Alexandra Quick/ series is the single best example of this to date, IMO.

** I've got some material on Magical France and Magical Bulgaria in "Patron", and the most recent chapter features Magical Jamaica. It's an AU though, so Britain's culture is also a tad different.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
