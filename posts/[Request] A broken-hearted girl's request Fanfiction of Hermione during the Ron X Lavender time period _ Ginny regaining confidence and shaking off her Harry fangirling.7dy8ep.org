Might be a strange request. But I am going through a tough breakup where my ex got together with a close friend. (Both of them lied to me, led me along for quite a while etc). Struggling with not contacting either of them and humiliating myself further. Wanted to distract myself by reading motivating and comforting fanfiction. I've always admired Hermione and Ginny for their dignity and strength, and really enjoyed reading the little snippets canon HP had about how they overcame this period in their life. Was wondering if anyone had any fanfiction suggestions of

1) Hermione's life and POV when Ron was with Lavender

2) Ginny's life and POV post chamber of secrets- when she got more confident and less fan stalkery of Harry, dated other people etc

3) Ginny and Hermione's friendship


** I've got something that might be the exact opposite of what you need, but sounds very relevant. I'll give you a description, and you can give me a yay or nay.

Ginny leaves Britain to go to school in France after Hogwarts because of her unrequited love of Harry. The story picks up 5 years later when Harry happens to be in France for an auror conference and events conspire to bring the two together.

It dwells a lot on Ginny's feeling of self doubt and despair over Harry, and discusses in depth her process of letting go of him over the 5 years she was away, and how all the painful feelings come back up when he reappears in her life.

I think it may be very relevant to you, but it does end with Harry and Ginny getting together in the end, so given your situation, it may not be wise to read something that might inspire hope in a hopeless situation. It is the best romance fic of the fandom though, in my opinion.

Let me know if you're interested.

*** I like the sound of this fan fiction! It seems like a really good fit actually.

I don't mind having a bit of hope, after all I did choose characters (Hermione, Ginny) who both canon-ly got together with the people they originally cared for from the very beginning.

I like the idea of Ginny going elsewhere to study etc because it mirrors what I'm going to do next year as well.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

*** Ooh nice, I'm quite fond of canon-compliant fanfiction. I tend to find them quite "solid" to read. I mean I don't mind fluff non canon stuff exploring "what-ifs", but canon compliant fiction tend to be better quality I feel.

** This is probably not quite what you wanted, but I suppose it covers Request 3.

"Fire and Air" is a fanfic detailing Ginny and Luna's friendship, and Hermione is a strong supporting character.

And you mentioned an interest in canon-compliant fics? Say hello to "Not from Others," which is Ginny's POV of "Deathly Hallows," and frankly, the best Hogwarts-Hallow fic of the lot:
