Hi there,

I'm looking for a story I read a few years ago. I don't know the exact plot. All I remember ist a scene in which Harry wants a date with Hermione or maybe tells her he loves her and Hermione laughs at him. They are friends, bur Hermione expresses something along the line "she would never date a pauper" because of Harry's clouths.

So that's all I can remember and I even don't know how the story went from there.. Maybe someone knows this story?

Thanks
