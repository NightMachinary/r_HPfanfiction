Harry, Hermione or Tom are all fine. Linkffn(The Perils Of Innocence ; Fantastic Elves and where to find them) are my favorites of the genre so far.


** linkao3(Red Hair and Grass Blades by Flustered) and again heavy shortening would help here (but do not cut ducks!).

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I wouldn't exactly call him "independent," and he does eventually get a pre-Hogwarts teacher, but Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) features Harry having dreams of young Voldemort experimenting with magic in the orphanage before meeting Dumbledore and deciding to give it a go himself. Things spiral from there.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
