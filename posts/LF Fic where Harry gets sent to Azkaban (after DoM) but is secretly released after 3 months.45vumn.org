Here's what I remember of this fic's plot:

1. Harry was sent to Azkaban (maybe in a secret trial by Fudge)

2. +I'm 83% sure this takes place after OoTP+ EDIT: Beginning of OoTP, the trial is the one for using the Patronus.

3. Gets released secretly after 3 months, but is told he can't +do any magic or go to any magic areas+ EDIT: contact any magical person.

4. I think he gets a flat in London somehow?

5. Somehow Harry is allowed to go back to Hogwarts, but I can't recall how the machinations for that went.

6. Last scene is him entering Snape's class and staring Snape down.

Other info: I /think/ I saw it rec'd here a while ago. It was NOT on FFN or AO3. Had about 14ish chapters I think?

EDIT: Thanks to [[/u/Distaly]] for the extra info.


** I remember that one... searched it myself. It plays at the beginning of OoTP (atleast if we speak about the same). He is sentenced by fudge for the patronus and is realeasd out of azkaban under the term to not contact any wizard. But Sirius finds him and takes him (on Harry behalf, secret) to Grimmaulsplace number 12. Then he later visist the DoM, faces VOldemort and then reuturn to Hogwarts.

And as I said, i search it myself so maybe these addinonally infos ring any bells by someone?

edit: As this is the one, more infos I remember: The story does not use any pairing. It does not have a manipulative Dumbledore (as many azkaban story has) and also his friends are still by his side. As I said he returns to Grimmauldplace after it but asks Sirius not to tell the others. The fic stops right when he returns to Hogwarts.

** I remember a fanfic where Harry is recruited by Unspeakables after he is presumed dead in Azkaban. He takes a new name James Black and has a partner name Mary Sue. It was action/comedy from what I remember. Is this the one you are looking for? I don't remember the name of the fic exactly, maybe someone can point it out.

*** Nope. That is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2412808/1/The-Innocence-Of-Guilt][The Innocence of Guilt]]. The fic I'm thinking of has Harry going back to Hogwarts as a student, maybe partway through the year (?), is complete, and NOT posted on FFN or AO3.

**** /feasts on new Hedwig material/

The fic I was thinking of was linkffn(5666618) The Master of Assassins. Probably not what you're looking for, though, the Human!Hediwg was pretty prevalent.

***** Definitely not. The one I'm thinking of is more a study of what Harry is like after being put in Azkaban secretly by a corrupt regime and then secretly released. Parts of it were him trying to figure out whether he had as much right to be angry as Sirius did. I think Dumbledore and the Order knew the Ministry took him, but didn't know what they did with him, or when he was released? And he returned to Hogwarts after the winter/Christmas break.
