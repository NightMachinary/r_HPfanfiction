** linkao3(An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived) ... certainly O for the idea, but just A for the execution. It is just too darn long. The author got so enamoured with his idea, that he didn't know where to stop.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

*** Really hurts when writers do this, hey caught up in the moment by moment minutiae of the story that their plot just never arrives, and I eventually get tired of living inside their characters brains and move on to a story where something actually happens
