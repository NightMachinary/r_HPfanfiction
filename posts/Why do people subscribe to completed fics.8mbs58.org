I've gotten numerous notifications that people have subscribed to my finished fics, even ones that are part of an ongoing series I'm writing. What's the rationale behind this?

Edit: to clarify, when I say subscribe, I mean follow


** I use follow as a "Read Later" list.

** I follow when it's a fic I'm too ashamed to publicly admit enjoying.

All joking aside, it's usually because I wanted to keep track of it for whatever reason(one single quote I absolutely needed, certain plot points, etc).

**** I'm not that familiar with the app but I know authors can see who followed them or their fics, but you can't check this for third parties. I don't mind if an author knows I followed them or their fic -- quite the opposite -- but it's no-one's business what fics I choose to track in general.

Some people may not actually have that app, for one reason or another. And you asked a question, so I don't see what's the point of your reply because I answered that question and now you are pointing out ... something that seems to have no bearing on the question really.

**** Hm, I don't have the app so I never knew. It doesn't matter to me though, I doubt anyone actually checks my profile since I don't write anything and a lot of my follows are the same as my favorites. Following vs. favoriting is still a good way for me to differentiate between fics I really like and those that I would like to follow or are finished but not as good.

** I haven't followed an ongoing series per se, but I have followed completed fics before and it's usually because it's an interesting oneshot that I'm HOPING WITH ALL MY HEART might be expanded upon later... although they never do, which is sad. Other than that, I only follow stuff because the author might take it down, leave a note before doing so (which they usually do), so I could make a copy of it and keep it in my archive before they take it down (for reasons authors say like rewrites, fanfic being too crappy, wanting no connections with said fanfic, not in line with site policy, etc.).

I had one too many favorite fanfics taken down before without notice and I always bawl tears because I can't find them anywhere and nobody else has a copy. Following a fanfic isn't a sure fire way of alerting people of their fave fics being taken down, but at least it's something.

** Apart from the obvious and standard uses, I use follows for things I might want to read again later, or at least remember where they were, but weren't really great enough to list as favs. Or to keep track of stories I downloaded to read on kindle but might want to come back to review/fav later if they turn out to be good.

I prefer to keep my favourites list fairly small, since when checking others' favs for recommendations I usually can't get through more than a couple hundred, and I want to make sure each fic on mine is really a /favourite/.

** Far as I can find, Ao3 doesn't have a 'favorites' tag, so I've been experimenting with subscribe vs bookmark (and maybe 'mark for later) to see which one works best.

*** I use bookmark just as a "yes i read this" so that I can check later if I read it or not, and then if I want to make a note that it is a favorite, I just add "One of My Favorites" as a personal tag when I bookmark it. Then you can go back and filter your own bookmarked fics by that tag whenever you want to go back and reread a fic you know you really enjoyed.

** No harm in it, and sometimes an author will announce their return by adding a chapter to an old story and I am pretty sure only following gets you an email. That and I didn't know the difference between fav and follow to begin with so I just clicked both, never really seen a point in stopping the habit.
