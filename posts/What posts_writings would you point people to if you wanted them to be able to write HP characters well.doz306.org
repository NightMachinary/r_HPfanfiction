Inspired by the recent "Canon Hermione with her social awkwardness, insufferable know-it-All personality, and general lack of empathy ends up in a time travel romance" post.

I kinda want Luna writers to read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6p6169/luna_is_a_victim_of_reversebashing/]["Luna is a victim of reverse-bashing"]], for example.


** Potter Ever After for romance and fics that include goblins.

Thank you for linking this post! It has everything I ever thought and wanted to say about Luna in fanfics!

** The usual pet peeve posts would do. But you have to keep in mind what you want to write. A guide for "action" Harry will make for pretty terrible advice for a romance.
