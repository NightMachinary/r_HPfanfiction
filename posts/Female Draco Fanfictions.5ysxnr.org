I would prefer if they are completed through 1-7 years. If they are ongoing is fine too, but specify please.

Also, no Fanfictions where Harry's name is change for no valid reason at all. Sigh.


** Linkffn(The Malfoy Curse; The Malfoy Defiance) is on the second year right now.

** The serpent Lord by NHunter,

I remember reading one where he was turned into a female by Harry, but that was pretty much smut.

I dont read hat genre too much because it comes uncomfortably close to Drarry slash /eugh/
