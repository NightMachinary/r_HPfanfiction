In it, when Harry surrendered himself at the Forbidden Forest, he was kidnapped, not killed, by Voldemort.The fic starts a year later and that's how much I remember.

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.
