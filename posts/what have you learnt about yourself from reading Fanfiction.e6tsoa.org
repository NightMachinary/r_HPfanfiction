Odd question I know but popped into my head.

I discovered that I am a petty person for anything that includes someone who's been wronged by others they get revenge or just don't forgive the guilty party no matter how much they've changed.

I'm realising this is probably because of my irl problems lol. I also learnt that I have prejudice against muggles and a little bit against muggleborns I already feel bad about it I never used to feel this way. I blame reading a lot of dark and pureblood society fanfics add that to my already existing dislike of Hermione and walah!

This whole trilogy is amazing. You just gotta get through the first few chapters. And it features something unique...ACTUAL DATING. Believable too. And it goes into what Auror training entails and how the department is set up and it's the most in-depth and believable thing I've read. Hp also slowly grows in power as he learns to get a handle on more abilities. Everything is at a slow and believable pace. It's a dozy, over 1mil with all 3 but so so worth it.

There's a sequel called Bouquet of Asphodel too. It's a genius! Hermione focused story with a lot of the pure blood mania. AU with her returning in another form, all the other characters are the same. Very in depth, maybe a little too wordy for some, tonsss of focus from the Death Eaters and Voldemort's side of the 2WW. Highly recommended.

** That I'm not as hateful as I thought I was. I'm not a cheerful person by any means, but damn. There are a lot of people who seem miserable writing/ reading fanfiction. And I'm just not so passionate about made-up characters. Sure, I'll state my opinion, but I don't have the energy for prolonged arguments. As for the hate- I am astounded by how much of it there is. Especially for Ron and Ginny while the little Death Eater shit Malfoy is suddenly "misunderstood" and a good guy.

Also, I've seen lots of people complain about canon lacking logic with such vehemence. Some authors even have whole essays on their pages about how much they hate Harry Potter. The only thing I could think about was: "OK, but if you dislike/ hate it so much, then why write/ read about it?". It just seems counter-intuitive. I read Harry Potter fanfiction because I liked the original books and for entertainment. I don't expect to find the meaning of life or prose worthy of Tolkien in fanfiction. It's just a fun pastime and it's sad to see how much negativity there is around it.

*** People have some very strong opinion on characters - and what makes it weird to me is how fanfiction, which is pretty heavily based on /changing/ things, draws that same type of opinion.

The Weasley hate (which is usually extremely shoehorned in and badly written) is obvious, of course - no, I don't particularly find it funny when Ron is just a giant slob who's incompetent. He might not be my favorite character, but I do like him! On the flipside, I find people who are completely against redemptions for Snape and Malfoy to be besides the point, particularly for Malfoy books 1-4/5. They're not good people, but it's not particularly hard to see that they were both written to be sympathetic in later books, nor that it wouldn't take too much to flip either into a 'good' character, and exploring that is a lot of fun!

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That's true and what surprised me at first. I do have some opinions and likes/ dislikes, but I try not to go as far as love/ hate. I suppose the problem is the way said opinions are expressed sometimes.

As for Malfoy and Snape. It really depends on how well it is written. What I dislike is when someone (usually Harry or Hermione) suddenly and inexplicably falls in love with them. Without Malfoy or Snape going through some sort of redemption or even change. If the change is slow and gradual or it's an alternate universe, I'm fine with it. I think I've even read a couple of fics where Snape mentors Harry. I was a bit squeamish at first, but they were well written and made it work. On the opposite end, I remember one where Hermione became Snape's number one fan overnight and started defending him and got in a row with Harry about it. I don't think I made it further than chapter two.

So it's up to the author to convince me that Malfoy and Snape are redeemable. But if they are just like in canon and still portrayed as good or paired with one of the good guys... no thanks. Lots of people dislike Methods of Rationality, but at least Draco went through a believable change I think.

One thing I'm not willing to budge on is redeeming in any way Tom Riddle/ Voldemort. Or Harry going really evil and joining him. The moment I see a story tagged as Harry/ Voldemort I close it.

***** Oh yeah - jarring character changes without buildup don't actually work for me either. I tend to see it most in Indy!Harry ones - where the author starts it with, say, an explicitly canon first 4 years and then flips a switch in book 5's timeline and one day to the next Harry hates all his friends and speaks like an edgelord.

Any such situation needs buildup - I just happen to think that it wouldn't take /too/ much in the first few books to have many characters change immensely by the end of the series.

**** Oh yeah I've noticed that too. Even within the HP fanfic universe there's stereotyping happening, and the same characteristics in characters can be seen being duplicated across different fanfics as a result of this stereotype.

As you pointed out, Ron being a slob and incompetent, Malfoy is “misunderstood”, etc. This results in the fanfic being a “blur”, cause there's no unique quality to it. Not that it's not good or anything, it can be well written and thoroughly thought of, however they all start to look the same.

There's a Drarry fanfic that I've read a while ago that put your thoughts and mine into perspective. It's a time travel fix-it, and I'm sure you'll love Ron in this fic.

** That somehow I enjoy romance stories, at least in the right circumstances. Though so far ive not been able to find a non fanfic one that i didnt get disgusted with decently quickly.

Also, i seem to be more willing to read shitty/mediocre (and the occasional actually good) fanfics than experiment with new published books. i probably read 10-20 fics per published book and i read on average probably 10-40 hours a week not counting audio books depending on the week and ive kept this up for the last decade or more.

I don't know what it is about them but they just draw me in even with mediocre writing and a shit story im just super attached to so many of these characters (even outside of the hp universe). Once i get attached to a world or set of characters from a book or show i can just go off the deep end on the writing for it.

Im surpringly more accepting them as villains in a way or generally a manipulative characters. So I guess females in authoritarian position bothers me.

Amelia Bones and luna may be okay but Tonks really makes me easily acceptable as villain or thinking that her and Remus' relationship is her pressuring him into it.

Like im so more likely to assume or agreed that its the females fault or her being too domineering. In IRL fellow females scare me and I hadnt realized that if it werent for fanfics. Looking back im friends with mostly boys. The only female friends I have is 'one of the boys' girl or the little sister of male friends. Im more likely to speak to male teachers but not females. Id rather follow a guys lead than a girl or do it alobe than deal with females in general.

I went back to read the Harry Potter series (like the published books) for the first time in 5 years after nothing but fanfiction, and I cannot express to you how irritated I was by his stupidity and lack of determination to fix his problems. Like, I'm not into bullshit insta god wish fulfillment, but I really just want people to know what they're doing and for the protagonist to further the plot.

It also made me notice in real life that most of the time the reason I dislike people is because they're incompetent. Like, someone could be a sack of shit morally, but if they can get stuff done I'm fine.

Reading so many fanfictions opened my eyes to Harry's flaws, don't get me wrong having flaws isn't entirely a bad thing for a character but Seriously why the hat wanted to put him in Slytherin baffles me most of the time. Where's that Slytherin cunning and ambition??

You have a Dark Lord coming after you practically year after year and you can't be bothered to study more or learn more offensive and defensive spells. heck I would have started back in first year after that run in with Voldemort drinking Unicorn blood.

Also after being raised by muggles you'd think he'd be a lot more enthusiastic about his magical education despite the Professors (e.g DADA Proffs and Snape) again lack of Slytherin ambition

Maybe then he wouldn't have needed To use an Expelliarmus to kill Voldemort. It got the job done and there's probably some shocking, touching theory out there about the parallels between the two wizards. BUT an Expelliarmus???

** It helped me realize that I was not straight.

It's kinda odd because I grew up in a community where my peers had two moms or two dads but it never really hit me. Fanfic was the first place where I read about a romantic relationship between two women and realized that I wanted that for myself. Even better, it normalized it and didn't have any of the awful Bury Your Gays trope on TV. It's been a heck of a time figuring things out, but fanfic definitely helped me on that front.

*** Similar, fanfiction didn't really help me in the realization but it was great to be able to read so many stories with gay main characters. Even though most of them were male and I'm not, just the relationships being same-sex was enough for me. I didn't have that in published books when I was growing up, there was some representation there but not enough for how much I used to read. I wonder if I would have gotten as much into fanfiction if I went through that phase now, when there's so much more LGBTQ+ YA out there.

**** I like the characters in fanfiction, I like the stories, I like the cool ideas yes, but theres more to it. I like to see a story that takes influence from other ideas, or that takes its own ideas and expands upon them as far as they can go in a unique way. I appreciate not only the surface level attributes, but the subtleties of the pacing, of specific character moments and actions. The sort of thing where an author writes an entirely different set of rules for each characters behavior and bases their every action on them.

It's difficult to describe, but essentially I encountered some absolutely phenomenal stories very early on in my fanfiction career, and as a result of this I began to hold the stories I read to a very high standard, while at the sime time learning to always base my judgement of a story entirely off of its contents rather than what I wanted it to be. I didnt treat the stories like fanfiction, and I still do not. I read them, examined them, and appreciated them like I would any work other of literature, before I had even read any other literature. I treated 12 year old Slytherin politics with the same solemn objectiveness that an english professor would study 1984 by G. Orwell with. In this process of reading composed of seriously and ardently examining, absorbing, and critiquing every fanfiction I read, I was not only able to find and enjoy some truly amazing stories across a broad range of genre's, but I also was able to inspire a genuine appreciation of Literature in a way that Shakespeare and Dickens just never could. All through reading fanfiction.

***** Thank you for the lovely response! It took me a while to get back here because work suddenly got busy.

I was curious because I often see fanfic and literature pitted against each other, or genre fiction and literature, since so much of fandom attaches itself to genres like fantasy and scifi. It's possible to embrace both, but people often seem to sort themselves into for and against.

I do have different standards for fanfic than I have for literature, if only because fanfic depends on the reader knowing the world and the characters beforehand and thus isn't required to create those from scratch. Also, fanfic draws upon the reader's already existing affection for the canon, which isn't something available to litfic writers. And fic writers are amateurs without access to professional editors. And it's perfectly fine to post vignettes or character studies in fandom based on particular tropes. I'd say fandom has more license to indulge itself emotionally than literature does, where excess is frowned upon.

But I loved Dickens and Shakespeare long before I stumbled into fandom, and I've learned to love fandom for its self-indulgence.

****** I quite agree with you on pretty much everything, and though I personally prefer a larger story to sink my teeth into I do appreciate the smaller works like oneshots and vignettes. That said, I dont think that we really should have different standards for all of fanfiction when compared to literature. There are certainly many fics like oneshots and vignettes where it simply isnt a fair comparison, but there are also other much more ambitious stories that really should not be considered in the same categories as oneshots in the first place, stories that are much grander in both scale and quality. And while these stories are rare, likely comprisng less than 5% of the total body of works of the fandom, in a fandom the size of Harry potter that "less than 5%" is still thousands of stories. Stories of an equal quality to the literary classics we all study. And since no fanfic author is legally allowed to profit off their work, such masterpieces will be by necessity filled with a passion worth appreciating in full, or else they wouldnt exist. Because of this, I'd argue that it does a disservice to these rare stories to hold them to the same standards as most fanfiction. It would almost be like putting a professional athlete in an ametuer league. Its the same game, but the athletes potential is nonetheless limited. When it comes to fanfiction, if we approach those rare stories with our usual attitude then we may cry pretension, when what we are really reading is brilliance.

By analyzing those rare, incredible stories for what they really are, we are able to better appreciate them for the masterpieces they are. Something we never could have done if we had been as lax as we are usually. Take [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]] for example, (-----spoiler warning-----) the very name of the story explicitly describes the ending in a prophetic manner. The definition of "A Cadmean Victory" is a victory at the cost of one's own ruin. A victory, not at the cost of others, but of yourself. Over the course of the story, Harry grows slowly in power, outstripping all his foes and allies alike, until only Voldemort stands a chance against him. Truly the dark lords equal. But then, at the final hurdle, after the most epic battle I have ever witnessed written or on film (including LoTR, this final fight is just so well executed) after both Harry and Voldemort are exhausted on the ground, Voldemort catches his breath first. Harry cant keep up, and in the end he does the one thing that he has been trying to escape for the entire story. He sacrifices his life, just as Lilly did (btw, this story also has the best explanation of sacrificial magic ive ever read) and saves the life of the person he loves at the cost of his own. It is truly a "cadmean" victory in the full sense of the term. And to be honest, I never would have realized that, if I'd just seen the name, thought "Wow, the author found a cool, semi unique word for the title." and moved on. It was only by holding this story to the kind of high standards we hold great literature to, that I was able to look past the surface and appreciate the incredible levels of forethought and planning that went into this story. And it was planned out, throughout the whole story are subtle hints and foreshadowing regarding the ending, and yet, in a stroke of brilliance, the ending is entirely unpredictable, (dont worry, I didnt fully spoil it) it keeps you guessing until the very end, full of excited tension and anticipation for the final battle, and yet when the smoke clears, you feel unshakably certain that it could not have ended any other way.

By refusing to limit ourselves to thinking of these stories as "just fanfiction" we are able to far better appreciate them for what they are, and on the occasions when they are "just fanfiction" that mindset still allows us to enjoy those stories for what they are, and nothing less or more, than what they are meant to be.

Coincidentally, I learned that I don't like seeing French butchered ;)

More seriously, for me it's mostly on the quality of writing I'm willing to stomach. I've read a good number of good books in the past that had sections that were super dry or plodded on for a while - but reading some of the recommended fics out there, I've found out that my standards for what I'm willing to read are apparently fairly high.

Along with other readings over that same period, it did help to bolster my opinion of romances as well.

*** That comparison to "real" books is interesting.

I've always been a voracious reader, and was never terribly picky. I'd read Shakespeare and Vonnegut followed by a half-dozen crappy novelizations from a video game plot, then back to David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy all wrapped up with some Chuck Palahniuk.

I think in some level, my brain just always assumed, "well, this got published as a /real book/ so it must basically be good," even when it was the most shallow, ploddingly written Star Trek novel or whatever.

But when I started reading fanfic, it was okay to criticize and drop a fic and treat it as disposable, because so many of them can't even get grammar right, much less passable writing.

After like a year-long fanfic bender, I went back to "real" books - specifically the Darth Bane trilogy in Star Wars. Junk fiction the likes of which I'd read thousands of time before. And halfway through the first book, I dropped it, thinking, "this is boring, the characters are uninteresting and unsympathetic, and the writing is plodding by-the-numbers bullshit. I've read dozens of HP fanfics better than this."

It sounds ridiculous to say it, but it was the first time in three decades of reading I'd ever given up on a real book and not finished something I started reading.

It was like once fanfic gave me permission to stop treating published books as these semi-sacred things, I could more clearly judge them on their merits, and drop them if they sucked.

I think that reading all that fanfiction made me realize that if other people can do it, then so can I. And honestly, this might sound mean, but I've read some pretty trash fanfiction out there, so it made me realize that if people can put some really poor-quality writing on the internet for all to see, I should be able to write just for myself without worrying too much if I'm a good enough writer. And of course, I've read a lot of really amazing fanfiction that I think helped me learn what I like as a story progression, how to keep the audience entertained, how to do character development so it feels real, etc.

** I found out that romance and the whole idea of love just doesn't appeal to me as much as I thought it does. Back in highschool I thought I wanted to fall in love with someone and have that relationship be the focus of my life. I'm still bisexual and can see myself having a relationship with someone regardless of what's in their pants, but the past few years I've really avoided both dating and fanfics that make romance their main focus. I'm not asexual really, I just don't want to make someone else the whole point of my life. It's hard to explain and maybe I'm still figuring myself out a bit. But the whole loving someone else with your whole heart, I could take it or leave it. If I meet the right person I'm willing to give a relationship a go, but I wouldn't really consider it a tragedy if I didn't fall in love with anyone ever again. Maybe I'm semi-ace and semi-bi, is that a thing? Bi-ace? Whatever the hell I am, who cares. I've read plenty of romance fanfics, and even the really well written ones just don't draw me in anymore.

The main exception to avoiding romance that I'll keep coming back to is Whispers in Corners by Esama. Eventual slash, but not the focus of the story. It's hard to properly explain why I like that story so much. The whole feel of it, a worn and tired Harry who's lost too much, been through too much, learning to open up to others again, the story just pulls at me in just the right way. linkao3(Whispers In Corners by Esama)

But other than that I've really started to stick to stories where Harry overcomes realistic challenges with an actual struggle. The godmode Harry fics just feel like fireworks shows, look what I can make Harry do I'm so clever. And the romance stories just don't appeal to me at all anymore, slash or straight it doesn't feel quite right. Like I want to see something I could actually go through myself or I want to see a character struggle in a way that I relate to. Fighting through depression or loss, clawing their way out of the darkness to overcome the pain, and an actual development in the character throughout the story. I'm not the same person I was 6 years ago, why should Harry be the same at 17 as he was at 11? The problem I've found is it's hard to find really good fics like that. They either devolve into godmode Harry, Dumbledore bashing (with optional Weasley bashing), or dark Harry who substitutes silence and anger for anything that could be considered a personality. I want a protagonist who I relate to more than anything, who suffers and grows and is beaten down again only to keep trying to stand. Not someone who kills Voldemort with a witty one liner and a flick of his wrist then rides off with his lover in the sunset.

Romance and related drama just bores me, unless it's also part of a good smut. Mostly I'm just fast-reading or skipping through romance-related sections of stories, and if there's too much of it to define the story's genre, I'll more likely than not just end up dropping it altogether.
