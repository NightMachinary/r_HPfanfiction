I honestly don't like "Harry Potter the prank king". There are so many fanfics out there that simply copy the canon and/or fanon character traits of the marauders and paste them onto Harry and his group of friends. I just don't like it.

I feel like Harry wouldn't simply prank someone for the sake of pranking and humiliating others, especially considering that he was bullied in the muggle world and would not want others to feel this way. Harry didn't want to be friends with Draco Malfoy for similar reasons.

On top of that there is a fine line between pranking someone and bullying/humiliating someone and I think, that many authors cross that line a little too often. I do not think it's funny when someone removes every single hair of a person in the great hall. Maybe it's just me and my "German lack of humour" but I think that just mean.

Edit: Thank you, kind stranger, for my first award ever.


** Pranking is pretty juvenile. Like, most of it is bullying. A prank I feel has to be between friends and like, small scale. And easily quickly reversible. And if you do it vs a stranger it should be a momentary annoyance, like being Rick Rolled, something they can roll their eyes at and move on. The second you do anything intense you are a bully. I would say the twins were bullies. I mean, Ron has crippling fear of spiders due to them.

*** Yes. Using family as test subjects isn't healthy at all. I don't like pranking fir that reason. It's the whole 'it's just a prank ,bro' idea. And oftentimes it's worse then anything they did to deserve it. ..'pranks' are what seems to me the staff would call 'attacks on another house like muarders vs severus snape type deal, when telling parents what went on. It downplays the severity of what happened.

** Amuse don't abuse.

But really most of the “pranks” in fanfiction are awful and not amusing. And I hate the so called “prank wars”, it's just so forced. Plus in reality pranks are tiny things most of the time, moving things around, adding inconvenience. In middle school we were really into pranking, but I was stuff like turning someone's coat inside out every time they took it off without them noticing. Or hiding this little plastic squirrel to be found during class by a teacher. Hiding Monopoly money all throughout someone's stuff. It was small and amusing and didn't hurt anyone or embarrass them.

** Yeah, I'm autistic so I struggle with pranks at the best of times. Like I get that it can be funny and appreciate the genius of the twins' products when they can draw the line between fun for everyone and bullying or Muggle baiting.

I also agree that after putting up with Dudley and his gang for so long he wouldn't be as keen to humiliate people and stuff. He would be stoked with the fun stuff like ‘magic is so fucking cool' but the bullying end of the spectrum or elaborate prank plans, I just can't see him spending his time on that when he could be flying or something

** I hate them. I'm not the biggest fan of the pranks in Canon, but they are at least "believable" in a magical world, while Fanon pranks are often stupid, over the top and not even funny. And 9/10 times when pranks are involved, it's better to forget the canon personality of the characters and consider all of them are OC wearing their face (what's with the whole "and then everyone started to clap and cheer for the "prankster" thing. It's than an American thing? Because I can't imagine European do that in a similar situation).

Outside of Fred and George war against Umbridge (which was over the top by design, with the expectation of being expelled before the end), all of the canon pranks have the common point of being easy to use:

- Hex someone in the Corridor
- Throw Dungbombs somewhere
- Put something in the food like the Cream Canaries of the Twins
- Replace someone ink with an auto erasing one right before a class or an exam (not sure we see this one in canon but it's in the same spirit).

The preparation for the prank takes hours at worst (unless you litterally invent something like Fred and George, but most people would just buy them at Zonko or later at WWW), and the execution is a matter of seconds. In comparaison, fanon pranks (at least the ones I saw) would take a lot more time than what a normal team would be ready to spend, for at best lukewarm results ("pranks" truly seen in fics) :

- Harry entering into the Great Hall disguised as Darth Vader with the Imperial March playing in the background would not be funny in a Muggle school, in the Magical World where most people would don't know anything about Star Wars it would be even worse. I would personally expect confusion and second hand embarrassment to be the most common emotions but what do I know.
- The Gryffindor spending the night filling the Dungeon with water (using Aguamenti) is not funny. I would also expect all the culprit to be expelled just for the material damages, cause I'm sure Snape would love seeing both his potion classroom and his office flooded (with all the ingredients inside). Not to mention the risk of drowning cause you know, flooding a dungeon with people inside.

​

Also, it's a personnal interpretation but the Maraudeurs were not prankster. Depending of your point of view, they were the "cool kids" or the "jerks", but in both case they didn't try to make pranks. Sure they would sometimes hex someone (Snape), or at least one of them probably threw a dungbomb or a snakefanged frisby while at scool. But deep down, they just did what they wanted compared to Fred and George who tried to make people laugh.

** For the most part I hate pranks. Usually it's because the twins and/or James and Sirius can't go two sentences without shouting 'Prank!' and acting like assholes.

There's only been a few I like - like the time Harry tied Quirrel's shoes together.

** Put me under pranking is mostly bullying under the guise of slapstick as well. I mean, an occasional practical joke between (certain types of) friends is one thing, but beyond that, it's unacceptable.

It's not just OP's "German lack of humour," it's just that some people think they are entitled to treat other human beings as their playthings, and it can show up very early in life. It's incurable, IMO, though I'm not a mental health professional.

** Is the word pranking actually used anywhere in the books? Briton here and I can't remember seeing it used in any British context. Pulling a prank, yes. Practical jokes, yes. Bullying, yes.

But the idea that pranking is an activity or even a hobby strikes me as really odd.

I always assumed that The Marauders were rule-breakers, yes. People who got into fights and used humiliating jokes to win, yes. But I don't think there is any canonical evidence that they routinely turned the entire school's hair pink or charmed the dinner plates to do the can-can.

Even the twins don't seem to prank the school much. Things like Canary Creams are jokes, magical whoopee cushions.

​

I'm beginning to wonder if the entire pranking thing isn't an American-led piece of fanon

That thought crossed my mind, too! The fanon Marauders/Weasley twins behaviour reminds me a tad bit too much of 'influencers' such as the Paul siblings. And tbh, I really don't get how people actually enjoy watching their (and similar) content.

*** Like I said in my comment -- it's not (in that context). There is one instance in OotP where Mr Weasley calls the folks creating the regurgitating toilets "Anti-Muggle pranksters". That's it. The twins and James & co are "troublemakers" or doing "mischief".

And the same is true for "The Marauders". The Map is the Marauder's Map (sic!), and Ron calls them "marauders" once in HBP. Other than that, there is no band of "pranksters" called "The Marauders". Neither Sirius nor Lupin nor Snape ever even hint at that. They are four friends at a school, meandering between bullying and playing tricks on people to "get them back", not a secret pranking society with a group name (hear that, The New Marauders?), and if Rowling hadn't called them "marauders" on her webpage once (after it was a thing in FF, way back when, over two decades ago now) that word would have nothing to show for it at all.

** I think it'd be kind of funny if Harry found out about the Marauders, and decided to prank the hell out of Snape out of spite for the "Just like your Father" comments, by becoming "Just like his Father".

Everyone losing their hair when you can just flick your wand and reverse it is just a quick laugh. It's far less bad and long term than in real life where it'd take weeks/months to grow back. It goes too far if you target specific people that don't deserve it. (Targeting Malfoy in 6th year til he snaps is perfectly fine, he's a Death Eater. Pranking Luna's bullies til they leave her alone? perfectly fine. Pranking random Slytherins that have done nothing wrong and aren't marked Death Eaters? Dick move)

** pranks can be great, so here is a longer story about a prank I helped pull of:\\
the only real prank in school I ever helped pull was in year 13, most of us were at least 18 during that point. On that day I normally only had 2 lessons, and my day started at 2.15 pm and finished at 3.45 pm. Best day. On this particular day the teachers had a conference and lessons after 6th period were supposed to be cancelled but in their wisdom the school decided that the students doing their final exams in less than a month should still do the lessons in 8th period and if applicable 9th and 10th. Most of us were finished with school after 8th period, and many had free periods before the long lunch break so for them sitting around for 2+ hours to wait for one lesson seemed pointless.\\
Nevertheless, we were there and had asked the teachers for a key so we could work / study in the classrooms...

Teachers were happy because they thought we were so studious and well behaved but we had organized over facebook and while the teachers were in the auditorium we took all the chairs and tables we could get our hands on, and with ropes and brooms made what can only be described as modern art and a fire hazard. When you walked up the stairs to the classrooms / senior area you could not go on as we had blocked the entire floor.

We were all downstairs waiting for the teachers and then when they came out, we tried really hard not to let them notice anything and said "oh you go ahead, we will be right behind you". There was so much laughter when they saw what we had done. The headteacher went and got a camera and had us pose on the staircase in front of our work.

That was a lot of fun. Nothing was destroyed, no one was hurt and we cleaned everything up.\\
I want to see those kinds of pranks. Students ganging up against the teachers for a small break from studying without turning it into a revolt. Organizing a small disruption into their organized days.

Imagine all four Hogwarts houses sneaking out in the middle of the night to spell every step to play a different musical note when you step on it. Or add costumes to the statues. Spell all the classroom furniture invisible or shrink it. Transform the hard chairs into armchairs. Take off portraits and put them in other places. Hang all the cauldrons from the ceiling. Move equipment from one classroom to the another. Everyone changes the uniforms with a person from a different house and then sits at their new table and visit someone else's lessons.

So many possibilities to create chaos and laughter. And fanon is all like "I will make all of Slytherin fart during dinner" or "spelling malfoy's robes invisible so it looks like he is naked"...

** I don't dislike the idea, but they should be the magical equivalent of stuff you could buy in a real joke shop, not bizarrely elaborate barely entertaining schemes.

Most of Fred and George's canonical products fit, with the exception of some of the OotP stuff which was clearly over the top just to mess with Umbridge.

** In Harry's history he grew up bullied, and realistically, even though not stated explicitly in canon, was abused. I think that this wouldn't really make him a likely prankster as he wouldn't want the line between humour and bullying to he crossed as I think he is quite afraid of the idea that he could become like his muggle family.

** I think that if it's a prank, it's either small-scale but kinda targeted and a bit more severe, or a large-scale minor joke.

Like, if you dump a potion into someone's shampoo and their hair goes bright yellow for a day, that's a prank.

If you hide someone's notes or important things like that, that's not a prank.

I think it also depends on how much someone does it, because bullying is like repeated behaviour, while pranking is more like 'oh yeah this happens once in a little while and everyone has a good laugh over it'.

** The only Pranks that I would truly classify as such are those where even the victim/target can see the amusement value or understand that it was their own actions that directly (as in, had they done even one thing differently, the prank would not have worked) led to the end result.

The greatest pranks are those that do no harm, yet briefly leave the victim questioning the stability of their local reality. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvJZVq5_cGs][This prank]] (done by a team of pranking pros) is one of the better ones.

** A good prank will have the target laughing with you. For example, there's the time a guy in my Boy Scout troop filled my tent knee-deep in balloons (and this was one of those big 8'x8' tents, so not a trivial effort).

On the other hand, there's something to be said for "pranking" people like Malfoy, Lockhart, Snape, and Umbridge, but that's more the bullying-style pranks that aren't quite bullying because they're not "punching down" as the saying goes.

Two very different types and uses of pranking, distinct enough that they could use separate names.
