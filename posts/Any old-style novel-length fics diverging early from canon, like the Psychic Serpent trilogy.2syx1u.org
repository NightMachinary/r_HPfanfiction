I've had quite enough fics that stick to the canon endgame, involving horcruxes and similar lately. I want to experience a truly divergent fic that stays true to the characters, and is preferably quite lengthy, like the old Psychic Serpent trilogy, which is still my favourite fic of them all. Any good ones? I'm not really good at searching and rummaging through all of them :(

I'm open to older ones as well, I've only recently returned to reading HP fanfiction, I stopped in like 2007...? I must have missed a lot of good stuff.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1510989/muggledad][Muggledad]] on fanfiction is real good, generally writes Harmony, but has done Harry/Gabbi and Harry/Daphne as well. He's got a real good one right now that diverges totally from the beginning of GoF onwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][Chem Prof]] is from the old days of fanfiction, he writes really long fics (especially the older ones), all Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] is a totally AU novel length story.

*** I read the Firebird, don't like it at all. It's a sexual fantasy disguised in decent writing. The plot moves at the speed of light, all characters speak in the same way, and it's short.

The Chem prof stuff, all I'm seeing is 1 chapters everywhere, and those that are not, it's all Horcruxes, post-Deathly Hallows, post HBP... that's exactly what I'm /not/ looking for.

And Muggledad, everything that's not 1 chapter is WIP... I'm sorry, but none of these are what I'm looking for.

**** Oh you think it's bad /now/? Read the first few chapters of some of the other pieces by the author. Trust me, firebird is by far the best of the bunch.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]] is one of my favorites from Back in the Day.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/280542/1/Innocence-Lost-and-Found][Innocence Lost and Found]] and sequels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1167770/1/Death-Before-Dishonor][Death Before Dishonor]]

Caveat that I haven't read most of these in years and am not confident about how well they hold up. Also I really like Sirius and stories that feature him strongly.

** I am actually currently writing a piece like this. Its shockingly hard and time consuming. All the details are still available but the earlier you break from canon the more replacing you have to do.

** Heh i just wrote the following on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2syzqb/artistharry_fics/][a thread asking about Artist!Harry fics]]

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at once]] is a fic where Harry went to Stonewall instead of Hogwarts. It's very AU, writing started before Deathly Hallows was released. So yeah it's kinda different from canon but I really liked it (read it recently), apart from Harry being a bit too good at magic, it's really nice. (also warning, it's really long :p (didn't realise before i started reading)).

  But yeah in the fic Harry is good at painting and drawing and stuff, he takes art classes and all and the whole thing is really a quite prominent thing about him in the fic.

I feel like it stays true to the characters, though there's some differences, but i feel like the changes are explained enough by the changes in plot.

*** It doesn't look like it's complete, and the last update is from 2008... Why does it feel like completed fics are harder to find now than 10 years ago...

**** I recently read it and it is complete. Like sure they could probably write a couple more books in that world if they wanted, but the way it ends now works and is really an end imo.

edit: okay it looks like they were planning to write more from the AN but it felt like just the end of a story to me.
