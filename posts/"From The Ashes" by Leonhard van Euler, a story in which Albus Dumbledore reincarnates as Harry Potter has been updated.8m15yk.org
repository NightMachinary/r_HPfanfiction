A few months ago I had a thing for Albus-as-Harry stories, and this was among the best of them. It's just updated an hour or so ago, if anyone is interested.

Without spoiling too much, the story begins atop the Astronomy Tower before Severus Snape fulfills Dumbledore's request to murder him. Instead of going onto the next great adventure, however, Dumbledore wakes up in the body of Pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter.

*** I can't remember the name, but there was one where, after dying, Dumbledore wakes up in Harry Potter's body during the summer between his fifth and sixth years. It quickly jumps into the action, having Dumbledore decide that the "Seven Potters" plan puts people in too much undue danger. Something with Runes and Bill Weasley to hold off Death Eaters or something.

Sorry I can't remember more.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  On that dreadful night, Albus Dumbledore is struck down by his friend and fellow staff member, Severus Snape, whilst the Death Eaters watch on in glee and Harry in horror. Seconds after the Curse strikes him, Albus finds himself waking up in the seven year old body of Harry. Reincarnated as the Boy-Who-Lived he now has to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. AD!HP
