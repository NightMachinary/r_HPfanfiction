*** Either one is alright. I looking for fanfics that at least involve meeting at year 1, and eventually getting romantically involved over the years.

**** Well, my current story is a very slow-burn Harry/Hermione romance. It starts in year 2, though, and is now past Hogwarts, and they're still dancing around each other.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** linkffn(The Real Us)

Fingers crossed that the bot gets this right; I'm on mobile. But it's a story where they're together literally year one. Lemons from year one, too, unfortunately. But it is what it is.

  Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione. H/Hr Rating for language and mild sexual situations.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), has them get together right after the Troll incident, but becomes Harry/Multi later on. It's generally a fun story, but contains severe Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing.
