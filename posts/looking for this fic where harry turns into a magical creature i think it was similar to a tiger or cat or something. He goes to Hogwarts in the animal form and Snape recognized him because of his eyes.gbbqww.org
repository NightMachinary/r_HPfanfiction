** Sounds like Peorth by BleuDiablo to me. Don't think it's online anymore. Harry transforms into a "Panivco," a winged cat creature. Mentor Snape and eventual H/D.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.
