Hi! For some reason a while back I was with a craving to strange pairings, and then I found one fic in particular that I finished reading but can't find to read it again. It's Hermione/voldemort, with Hermione being this elite mediwitch that heals everyone, regardless of which side they're on as long as they have the means to pay. She's a member of a guild called Medicus I think? Or that's her title, I don't remember. Voldemort is ill and asks for her. The first part of the fic has Hermione being tortured and almost broken while the second part has Voldemort getting more and more sick until he dies. The author said that it was first the rise of voldemort and fall of Hermione and the second the opposite. It's really dark but I liked it for the sheer strangeness of this pairing. It's after the war.

I'm on mobile so sorry in advance for any mistakes or wrong format. Can you guys help me please?


** I think this was rec'd on here recently. Maybe look for TRJ/HG pairing posts?

**** Can't find it!... Maybe the fic begins not after the war but with hermione confiscating a snake from Draco (that's voldemort in disguise), keeps it and then voldemort kidnaps her? I may be thinking of another fic though... Any help?

***** No idea, sorry. Was it definitely tagged as a Voldemort/Hermione, or was it a Tom/Hermione?
