Because I've seen fics where he's pretty!Riddle before 1981 and fics where he's already red eyes scaly skin no hair before dying the first time. But the worst part is that /these fics never f---ing specify his appearance/ so I never know what I'm supposed to assume. I mean, he's either handsome or horrid, so you'd think either way it would be worth a mention.

Anyway, officially, did Voldemort get snaky because of horcrux-related corruption (we know that's how he got red irises, at least) or was it a side effect of resurrection (I think he used something of Nagini, I don't remember) or do we just not know?


** u/kyella14:
#+begin_quote
  They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet mask like, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.
#+end_quote

Harry's description of Tom's appearance when Tom came to the school to apply for the DADA position/drop off Ravenclaw's Diadem. I think we can assume from here that the change of Tom's physical appearance is due to the creation of Horcruxes and not a side-effect of the resurrection ritual Voldemort used in 1995. Note that Harry says that Tom's features 'were not as snakelike', implying that there are, in fact, taking on a serpentine influence, though the damage and corruption was not yet so severe that Tom has 1995 Voldemort's looks yet.

It's possible that the ritual used in GoF also exacerbated his snakelike features, but I've always thought that Voldemort's appearance was distorted due entirely to the creation of Horcruxes, and that the idea that Voldemort, previous to 1981, possessed Tom Riddle's good looks + red eyes is wholly a creation of fanfiction authors who want to pair Tom/Voldemort with another character and not have any sex scenes border on bestiality.

*** Further to this, in OotP Fudge and the Aurors immediately recognise Voldemort in the Atrium, implying that he looks the same as he did in the first war.

**** Or at least that his most distinct features (all black clothing, red slitted eyes, pale skin) were somewhat well-known.

To be fair though, they also had evidence that he was fighting Dumbledore, the only one who could actually do so apparently, and Voldemort didn't lose immediately. Plus Harry and Bellatrix would add further evidence to that conclusion.

*** Perhaps the his appearance in GoF is even more snakelike than in '81 because he actually made 2 more Horcruxes, albeit one being unintentional.

** I always assumed that he only became snaky after his resurrection - it seems like it would be a side effect of stuffing a semi-bodiless evil soul into a new skin suit? Wish JKR would clarify this though.

*** No, as documented above, it's the Horcruxes. He was already getting snakelike earlier, and he can't have been too different post-resurrection since everyone instantly recognized him on sight (the Death Eaters, Fudge in the Ministry). Mind, it /is/ possible that he was /somewhat/ more snakelike by /GoF/, but not because of the Resurrection: rather, because of his two additional Horcruxes (Harry & Nagini) that he'd made between his "death" and resurrection.

*** Please don't mock me :(

Lack of description on characters that have alternating or inconsistent canon appearances is unfortunately all too common in fanfiction, beyond the example specified in this post, however much you disagree with its relevance.
