:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have a vague recollection of enjoying the fic, and looking for it to read again, but I havent had any luck finding it. I vaguely recall there was a basilisk involved, and that about it.

Edit: As [[/u/yarglethatbargle][u/yarglethatbargle]] says, its Unsung Hero, this is the only place I could find it: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/1]]


** I want to say it's Unsung Hero.
