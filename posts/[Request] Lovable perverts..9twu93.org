Looking for any finished stories or series of one shots were:

- The main character is a lovable/chivalrous pervert, doing their best to get some at any time, but ultimately failing. (Small victories are ok though.)

- Bonus points for odd character choices (Pervert!Hermione?)

And... That's it. Can't be too hard to find... right?

** There was one story were Harry found some Parselmouths-only room that Slytherin created which Harry then used as a shag pad (with Cho or Romilda I think) only to find that Tracey Davis was also a parselmouth and was watching from behind a pervert mirror/painting that Slytherin had set up for that purpose. Can't recall the name of the fic though...

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

*** You assume non-con by default, but if the Internet has taught me anything is that you'll end up in a three way if you spy on two sisters in the shower and they bust you.

On a more serious note, if you look good, you can get away with a lot of pervy stuff because the perved-upon party might very well take it as a compliment or initiation instead of the sexual harassment they would assume if they don't find the pervert attractive.

A visit to any club will confirm this. Ugly dude walks up to a hot girl and start grinding? Slap in the face. Attractive dude does the same? They are making out a minute later and will visit the bathroom in five.

He can just /really/ love porn.

You wouldn't send a guy to Azkaban for liking porn a bit too much, do you?

****** I mean, outside of literal Death Camps, Azkaban ought to be the worst place on Earth and [[/u/rek-lama]] wants to send people there for, eg liking porn or imagining strangers naked. That place makes Guantanamo look like a vacation home, the average Gulag like a ski resort and Rikers like a good neighbourhood.

No, I meant for sexual harassment, like in your example where a man initiates physical contact with a woman without first asking for consent. Sexual harassment is /not/ funny, quirky, or cute, that's why I put "lovable pervert" into quotes - it's an oxymoron. I can't believe I need to explain this in 2018.

******** Then it would still be sexual harassment and not misogyny.

And as I also explained in my example, when the woman sees that she finds the man attractive, she can and probably will consent. It also works with reversed genders, but that is not nearly as common.

********* It is misogynistic to insinuate that women will be OK with what is, by definition, /sexual assault/, so long as the assaulter is attractive.

Some women might indeed react positively to such an approach, but that's irrelevant. Normalizing sexual assault - regardless of circumstance - is perpetuating rape culture.

********** I did say that the "victim" has to find the guy at attractive, which includes his behaviour. Therefore unwanted approaches do not fall under that scenario but under scenario 1: A slap in the face (and possible charges).
