“That is enough!” Hermione snapped as she climbed out of her chair and stormed over to the fireplace where Harry, a squeaky mouse toy dangling from his mouth, was glaring at Crookshanks and growling. “Put the mousey down Harry, you know it's not yours.”

Harry backed away from her and growled again.

“Don't you dare growl at me, Harry. Give Crookshanks his mousey back right now!”

Harry ducked his head and dropped the mouse on the flagstone hearth.

“Good. Now, apologize to Crookshanks for stealing his toy.”

Harry climbed to his feet and rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “I'm sorry Crookshanks. I shouldn't have taken your mousey. It's just so much fun and I can't find mine.”

Crookshanks trilled at Harry and head butted his ankle.

“Thanks.” Harry replied. “C'mon, let me make it up to you. I'll show you a real awesome spot for a sunbath. It's got lots of dust bunnies and cobwebs to play with and I was able to make a nest out of some old cloaks.”

As Harry spoke he led Crookshanks over to the portrait hole. Once the door was open Harry shifted into his cat form and darted out into the hallway with Crookshanks close behind him.


** So like Hermione did in that Starfox5 story- I think it was called Lady Thief. In that story animagus instincts transferred over, so Hermione and Sirius were (playfully) antagonistic and Hermione would chase around mice and knocked over a vase, lol.

** I'm imagining Harry as a tiger Animagus who has a new found love for stalking his friends and tackling them hard to the floor and screaming at the top of his lungs as he roars in their face. Then when he realizes what he's done he's just apologizing profusely and red in the face.

** Harry's animagus form is a nundu. People become too terrified to argue with him when he's being a grumpy cat, despite being able to fully control his poisonous breath.

** There's a bit of that in this, an adorable one shot where Harry turns into a housecat and accidentally becomes Daphne's familiar.

  Harry successfully manages his animagus transformation. And that's about all he's able to manage. Daphne's insistent attention seems entirely unmanageable for him and his poor heart. Slight AU.

*** His general personality is actually quite cat-like.

He hates being bothered but enjoys attention when he's in the mood.

More often than not he wants to be alone

His favorite pastime is a game where he chases something that is both shiny and flying

Plus him being a cat avoids a Sirius rehash kind og thing.
