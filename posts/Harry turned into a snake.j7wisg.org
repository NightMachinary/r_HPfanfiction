I want to read the fic where Harry becomes a snake.

It could be an Animagus, a curse, or something else. Harry must spend most of his time in this form or it must be given a lot of attention.

I like reading about human transformation, so if you have anything else on a similar topic, you can post links.

Please, no romance or that relationships are not the main part of fick.

Here are some good pictures I've read:

Cursed Blood

Snake Charming

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24466117]])

Dementors Are Not Dogs

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11245382/1/]])

(idk if it will work or not)

Sorry for mistakes Translated from Russian by Google Translate


** The Parsel series is all about Harry learning how to be human again after spending his Youth as a Snake. His Snake form is given a lot of time.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

  Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?

  !COMPLETE! He woke with a scream on his lips. Thrust so violently into wakefulness, it took him a second to realize that it wasn't a cold sweat that had him shivering in his bed; it was the three dementors. Without a wand in hand, his death was a foregone conclusion. (Of course, it was really just the beginning.)
