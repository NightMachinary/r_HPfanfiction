They then burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled for continental Europe. This Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean he's a nice guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]]: Raised by Sirius, this Harry never went to Hogwarts, and hires Ginny to accompany him on some postwar adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]]: Muggle AU, but a great Harry/Ginny romance. This Harry does have an interesting background, while Ginny has a tragic one. Written by the author of the sub favorite "The Changeling".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy seized power through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** This is the first in a series where Harry Potter is kidnapped by Snape and raised by Snape and Lupin. It is a very sweet and wholesome tale, but not without violence and action/adventure. It is Slash, but not explicit as far as I can remember. Harry does not adjust well to Hogwarts.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
