A kind of cracky idea, wherein Salazar Slytherin is the Wizard equivalent of Genghis Khan. Basically: He slept around. A lot. The end result of this is that, by the time of Chamber of Secrets, claiming that the founder was your ancestor isn't that impressive, and even a good deal of Muggle-Born can claim that with total accuracy.

So maybe Harry /is/ descended from Salazar. But so's Draco. And Luna. And Ron. And Dumbledore. And...

Everyone also being a Parseltongue is also an option.


** Imagine a weird muggleborn just hearing “rip tear kill” from the basilisk every so often and wondering if their imaginary friend/alternate personality/voice-in-their-head suddenly became a serial killer.

** It doesn't really have to be "Slytherin got around" really. Purebloods are interrelated and often intermarry. Over the millennium, it is easily possible that his descendants have intermarried among the British wizarding families and most purebloods and half bloods are Slytherin's descendants.

*** My bad, there's a lot of terms and I get confused sometimes.

Also, yeah, a few hundred years of a small gene pool would lead to most being Salazar's descendants.

** Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament has it acknowledged there's a lot of wizards that are descended from Salazar, there's only one Heir to receive Slytherin's personal teachings. At a time. Tom went crazy, but according to the Hat, he wasn't the first.

*** Huh, interesting. There being one Heir makes sense, because that's how words work, I just thought it'd be funny if the reaction to Harry talking to a snake in Chamber of Secrets is more "huh, another one".

** The wizarding world is small. Everyone is related to everyone if you go back far enough, and 900 years is easily enough that everyone is related to Slytherin.

If we assume that each person with Slytherin ancestry gets 2 kids on average and so the number of Slytherin descendants doubles with each generation (let's say 30 years) then there should be about a billion potential heirs running around.

*** You forget that like after about five magical generations the first ones start dying, so no billion heirs of Slytherin

That's assuming wizards live to about 150, which probably isn't right but whatever

**** Actually I assumed that everyone gets 2 kids and immediately dies. Doesn't make a big difference since it's still an exponential curve. But obviously that's assuming that there's no inbreeding ever, which is not a good assumption after many generations. A more plausible model for the spread of Slytherin ancestry through a population would be a logistic curve, which would approach 100% eventually.

***** Oh wow, so there would actually be more than a billion if you assumed everyone died after about 30 years

It'd be like somewhere in the 1.8 billion range

Of course then there are the lines that got killed in wars and stuff, but we could assume that everyone alive is an heir, but No one has any idea about the heir

******** Assuming that every Slytherin Heir "infects" their children to be Slytherin Heirs, the equations are very similar to those used to model a virus outbreak, except that infection takes an entire generation so it's a thousand times slower, and there is no cure.
