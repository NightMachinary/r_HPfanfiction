[Kill The Wizard]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21498865]]) This is a story set after the main events of Harry Potter in the year 2000 about an unlikely set of people tracking down the Deathly Hallows. Be warned, this is also more of an exploration of the Harry Potter world so the main cast from the books is much less likely to appear as main characters. please check it out if that seems even remotely interesting to you!


** This is a really intriguing start to a fic. I'm already pulled in by your characters even though they are OCs and usually those are hard to pull off just from the gate - and you did it - Yay! Your magic world-building has tendrils that are ensnaring me and I love the inclusion of other parts of the world, in particular, Mexico.

There are some technical details that could be cleaned up to make the reading easier... the formatting is really spaced out, the dialog tags aren't formatted in the standard way, and the ALL CAPS for shouting thoughts are disconcertingly overused.

I'm really glad you're exploring what it is like to be a Squib in a wixen world... so this is a story I'd like to continue reading. Thanks for self-promoting it and bringing it to my attention. I left the same comment on AO3.
