:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't recall the name of the fic, but i remember that Voldemort sent people after Mrs. Tonks, and she sent them back in pieces, over time, with all the pieces still being alive, prompting Tom to leave her the hell alone.

Any help?


** I have no idea what fic this is, but I really want to read it.

I feel like it could have been something by Nemesis13--there's a lot of badass Andromeda in those.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
