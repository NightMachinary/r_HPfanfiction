I mean it when I say this is my favourite I have read. It's on archive of our own and the story is called stumbling in love and the author is called waskeHD. They are a brilliant writer in themselves and have made to other fanfics which are more recently updated. The author is however suffering a depression and isn't posting ad much so I just want to give her some extra support. So basically, lily and James flee to America while lily is pregnant with harry. (Neville is the chosen one in this btw) harry has a failed job in America and decides to move in with Sirius at grimauld place, and that's 'll I can say realy. Main pairing is harry/tonks and as you can tell this is definitely not canon. The is a little bit of lemon and one or two kinks mentioned in there but nothing disturbing or disgusting as far as I can tell.

P.S. sorry for the stupidly long paragraph it is just so good In my opinion and believe that the author she be shown some more support and love. And also sorry for being cheesy lol...


** I love WaskeHD. I reviewed one of their stories recently. Really impressive work.

Easily going to carve a niche out for themselves in Honks. Quality Honks is hard to find but they are really hitting it out of the park.
