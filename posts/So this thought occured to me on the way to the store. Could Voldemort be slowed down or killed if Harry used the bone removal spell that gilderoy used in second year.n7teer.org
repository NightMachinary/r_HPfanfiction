** If he was hit with it during a fight, then it might kill or inconvenience him, depending on which bones are removed. Though Voldemort is a good enough duelist that it would be unlikely to work. And even if it did, as long as he had his horcruxes, he wouldn't be dead for good.

*** also about the question itself, voldemort would probably not be so easy to hit with a spell. and if we really /are/ trying to hit him with one, why not something more lethal (...like the killing curse)

** First of all, I have to point that, in CoS, Harry lost the bones in his arm because Lockart fucked up a bone mending spell. We don't really know if a wizard could potentially fail a spell "on purpose", and if each faillure would give the same effect. For all the know, the same spell failed by another wizard could just do nothing, and force the bones to grow until they litterally break out the flesch, or anything else really.

Now that this is said, I think the "consequences" of such a spell would vastly differ depending of the context where Voldemort is hit :

- During a Duel (or any other situation where Voldemort can't immediatly escape)\\
  I guess the spell would be effective into slowing down Voldemort. Even Voldemort should be at least a bit impeaded by the loss of an arm or leg, which may give an edge to the person he would be currently fighting.\\
  But at the same time, I can't help but think that if someone is able to directly hit Voldemort with a spell, there would be a lot of usefull one. Even basic hex like the /Experliarmus/ or the /Stupefix/ would probably be more effective than a failed bone mending one.
- Outside of a duel\\
  I don't think the spell would be that effective. We know from Canon that it barely takes a night for the bones of a whole limb to regrow, and even without that Voldemort could probably use some other spell like the "silver hand" one he used on Pettigrew.\\
  Also, same as during a Duel, if you can directly hit Voldemort with a spell, there will always be more suited one.

In Conclusion, I wouldn't really see the point of the spell. In most case, it would barely slow Voldemort down (stopping him for something like a day?) while other spells could bring better result. And even if we imagine that a caster makes a very lucky shot, removing something like his skull and "killing" him in the process, the existence of Horcruxe mean he can always come back.

** I feel like after having tangled with the Marauders on more than one occasion he might be more ready for something like that. Other death eaters would almost definitely be slowed down by it though, considering Hermione managed to get Antonin Dolphin with the â€˜ner ner you can't talk' at least once

(I did realise that autocorrect did that to his name but if decided to leave it, because he's a bitch)

** He will be hard pressed to land /any/ spell on Voldemort. Unless he gets the wand hand or something , the outcome is unlikely to change.

** Other than what people already said, don't forget that the guy could possess people so even if his body were to be somehow damaged badly enough he could continue to fight using other bodies. Dumbledore who is the most powerful guy in the stories with the most powerful wand basically admits that Voldemort could not be beaten in a fair duel.

** So, methods of dealing with Voldemort basically break down into two categories:

1) Breaking all the phylacteries and killing him for good

2) ignoring the immortality problem entirely and inflicting some fate worse than death. Then inviting the now harmless Voldemort to enjoy his eternity.

Stripping the bones doesn't stop Voldemort or someone else from regrowing them and most importantly, the change wouldn't persist through resurrections so it isn't a category (2) fix.

I guess a particularly cruel protagonist could strip out his bones, trap him somewhere and keep him alive, effectively I Have No Mouth and I must Screaming the old lich. But the logistics of setting that up seem seem complicated and the resulting torture prison seems like it would be unreliable, since for Voldemort, death is a valid means of escape.

I can't see the bone removal spell helping as much as Gilderoy's actual signiature spell, the memory charm.

** What if the bone removal effect was the result of a correctly cast mending spell with an added wand move with a scrambling effect? The result can be removal, or the fusion of all bones, etc. The scrambling effect can be added to any spell and always has to do something with te scrambled spell original purpose. And after discovering this Harry using this making his fighting really unpredictable...
