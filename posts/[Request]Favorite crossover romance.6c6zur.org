I've been reading some crossovers I favorited a long time ago, but I've been a little disappointed in the (mostly nonexistent) romances they tended to feature. Do you guys have any recs for crossovers featuring a good romance? The romance doesn't have to be the main focus of the fic, just extant, enjoyable, and not a little side note. If possible, I'd prefer Harry in a romance with a character from another fandom, that it not involve a harem, and that the characters be fairly realistic (so no true love soulmates 4 evah that agree on absolutely everything and never ever fight, both characters should have both strengths and faults, preferably not a harem of women who are almost identical personality-wise, etc). The MC doesn't /have/ to be Harry, but please don't let it be someone like Draco unless the story is the absolute best you've ever seen. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(5353683) and it's sequel. Harry/Sailor Moon with a twist. Also a very fun read. And the second time I've rec'd this fic today lol

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

** Linkffn(In All Things Balance) and its sequel linkffn(IATB: The Rise) feature Darth Nox x Tonks, and Harry x Asoka Tano. Knowledge of the Star Wars EU isnt required for enjoyment, but is recomended as characters are introduced with little exposition.

** Whispers in Corners by Esama ao3bot(1134255) is a surprisingly sweet Sherlock crossover that focuses on a Mycroft/Harry relationship, which is something I never thought I'd be into, until I suddenly was.
