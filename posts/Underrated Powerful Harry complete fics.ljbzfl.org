Please suggest complete underrated powerful Harry fics. No Slash though(Not against it, but not my reading preference)


** linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

Self-rec here, though I think that the stats show it's not well-known. Slow-burn powerup, gritty realism, kids act like kids (and thus make dumb mistakes), eventual OP!Harry.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

** linkffn(13377194) and it's sequel, Casting Shadows (which is being written more or less simultaneously, but the stories are obviously planned out quite well) are the best I've come across lately.

I especially like the believable edginess of Harry. It's not the typical written-by-a-teenager cringeworthy edginess, but a believable one (he is a massively powerful and bitter teenager after all).\\
And especially Casting Shadows is more about him growing up, rather then him struggling against foes who are stronger than him, but there is still plenty ass kicking.

If you care about parings, DoD's is Harry/Ginny, but it's barely mentioned and they break up in the beginning of CS, where the Harry/Daphne pairing seems to be more of a focus. That may change once the 'Astoria's Curse' Arc is done though, we'll see.

  Harry is destined to stop Voldemort and his followers from corrupting and overrunning the wizarding world. Unfortunately, the Horcrux in his head is working against him. His friends and family are heavily impacted by its influence. Harry is on a long path of power and mastery. Powerful!Harry, Lily finds a way to live on, Casting Shadows Prequel.

**** Can we really call this underrated when it's the 11th most favourited crossover ever?

Can we really call this completed when it's... not. And probably abandoned?

I guess one out of three ain't bad, or something?

***** Underrated doesn't mean unpopular in absolute terms. It means less popular than the speaker believes the thing should be. So yes, it's entirely possible that the person suggested it does consider this underrated, and thinks it should be the very most favorited crossover, rather than being 11th in line.
