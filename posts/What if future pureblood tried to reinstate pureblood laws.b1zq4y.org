Assuming every Pureblood on Voldemort's side was killed off during the war, would future pureblood (Parent's and Grandparents magical? At some point in the future, you'd see a few pop up here and there) ever try to reinstate pureblood ideologies/laws for the benefits they came with?


** I am sure this would happen in time, alas not for the benefits it would give the purebloods. What would move these people forward would be hate in its purest form.

You need to feel love to hate. You only truly hate things that harms the things you love. Voldemort hated everyone that tried to harm him and his immortality, because he truly loved himself and the condition of being immortal, even if he couldn't feel love towards others.

Now, imagine yourself being the next pureblood generation after the war. You keep hearing stories how good it was for your family during some twenty years ago, how your lifestyle was cultivated, respected and shared among all of your peers. One day your grandmother tells you how the muggleborns destroyed your culture, poisoned the legacy that was yours by right of birth. You keep hearing stories about relatives that died during both of the wars and that families that lived ever since the founding of Hogwarts were wiped out because of the conflicts.

All those things that were loved, cherished and shared by those that came before you are gone. They were all stolen from you before your birth.

That, my friend, would lead up to hate. Not in just a single pureblood, but every pureblood from the next generation that still possessed recollections from the time before, and what was stolen from them.

So, yes. Another war, or revolt, would come.

*** Do you think Voldemort, when he was sane-ish at any case, knew that? Because if he did then it'd make /more/ sense (Not that it'd make his decision-making remotely sane) why he did the things the way he did. In essence it'd mean he set out to make sure that fear was the main reason behind his success, as that would've made potential future revolts/revolutions far less likely to happen compared to hatred?

Which even then wouldn't change much, besides take up his /valuable/ time, something that likely would've angered him more then anything else (bar Harry Potter and Dumbledore's existence) considering how he saw himself compared to the rest of the world.

With Voldemort technically been 'immortal' /and/ extremely powerful, the odds of potential revolts happening drop /considerably/ if the rest of the world understood how dangerous he was.

Even in canon, he wasn't really worried about anyone but Dumbledore and Harry Potter actually been able to kill him which explains his fixation on the two wizards.

By defeating/killing Dumbledore, Harry Potter and by extension the light side, he would've cemented himself as the most powerful wizard of all time. Sure, there would still be a lot of people who would've hated him regardless but the fear of what he was capable off would've likely stopped /anyone/ from acting out against him?

Plus, Tom Riddle at some point more then likely looked into Gellert Grindelwald's attempt at taking over the world and just figured attempting things in a similar manner wouldn't work. Hell, I reckon had Gellert Grindelwald been more aggressive himself then in canon, he would've won. (One way been to threaten to tell Albus with the truth of who killed Ariana, something he could've /easily/ lied about to gain as much of an advantage)

** The scumbags trying this would get stomped - and rightly so - as hard as people trying to reinstate chattel slavery today would.

*** I am not so sure about that, the majority of canon's problems regarding Pureblood's was based on Voldemort, who the good guys knew about before-hand. What I mean by that is, had Dumbledore not been aware that Voldemort was still alive, he as well as everyone on his side would've quickly been caught off guard and likely would've lost altogether due to lack of preparation.

A future pureblood revolt is similar, in that if no one sees it coming, it could /easily/ snowball into a major problem. Voldemort, himself, made things easy because he was, both, the main face and the main power behind his war. Meaning all Harry had to really do was get rid of him specifically and the war would end. A pureblood revolt on the other hand would be more difficult to deal with because one, with most of them been the children-grandchildren of Muggleborns, no one would be able to see them coming because there's nothing to trace to them unlike Voldemort and his death eaters. The second been that because none of them are likely to be a one-man army (Voldemort and Dumbledore calibre), they wouldn't have one specific person in complete control allowing more opinions/ideas that would help them.

**** Children and grandchildren of muggleborns wouldn't support a pureblood revolution with enough numbers to matter. By the time such a revolution could take off, support would be reduced to a handful of idiots - which, lacking a powerhouse like Voldemort, wouldn't be a problem.
