I've read most around but I wanted to reread one where Harry was following Daphne in Hogwarts, annoying her a lot. She has the " Ice Queen " Persona but it eventually thaws. When he is following her it's in Hogwarts corridors and he is much more confident than Canon Thats pretty much all I can remember. Thanks in advance!

Also would appreciate any other harry/daphne :P
