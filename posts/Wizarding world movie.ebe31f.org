Hello everybody!

We are third years student of the Dutch Filmers Academy in Amsterdam. We are developing a film based on the wizard world of Harry Potter. With a large amount of volunteers we share a passion for filmmaking and for Harry Potter. We strife to combine these two things and to make something great out of it. But we need your help!

Summary of the story Durand is a wizard and a follower of Grindelwald around 1927. He discovers that the Ministry of Magic is using the three unforgivable curses to control the common people. By keeping control of these curses, they prevent Grindelwald from rising to a powerful position. We have done a fair amount of auditions and the cast of 25 is almost complete. The locations are almost assorted, as well as the crew. The only thing that's missing are the finances.

We would sincerely request to realize this film if you are interested in what you have read. We have started a crowdfunding in order to provide for these costs. We would appreciate if you would donate or shout out our crowdfunding on your social media. If you would like to support us in any other way, please let us know.

Why support us? We know that this film will reach a large audience, we can promote your establishment in the credits and in a newsletter we send out to all donors and fans. This way you will reach a large amount of potential customers. We will also promote your establishment on our social media.
