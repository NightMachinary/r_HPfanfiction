Reading Taure's "Victoria Potter" and apparently Professor Sinistra is the single most powerful witch to ever live.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sinistra sighed, raising her wand again to point into the night's sky. “Let's not tell the centaurs I did this, eh? Lumos ! ” Mars immediately shone brighter, a clear red dot in the sky.
#+end_quote

You see that shit? She just made Mars brighter. Mars is a minimum of 34 million miles (max of 250) away, moving at a speed of 53,979 miles per HOUR. And it's a planet. And she made it brighter with a first year charm.


** Canon one, sticking with the astronomy theme: we're told in PS that Dedalus Diggle made a shower of shooting stars i.e. he conjured a meteor shower.

I'm not sure that wizards consider these things particularly impressive. They're only impressive if you think of things in physical rather than magical terms. Magically, in that scene in VP, the light that Prof Sinistra makes is dimmer to the perception of the people viewing it than a normal lumos.

However, she could've just augmented the Earth's sky, perceived from the perspective of creatures inhabiting the Forbidden Forest. She'd have to do some planetary motion calculations and also tie her spell to some self-manifesting form of magic that wouldn't require constant attention from the caster (runes, perhaps?). Then the place where un-augmented Mars would've been showing normally would just become overlayed by her bit of illusion magic. Although, one problem with this solution is that it implies that Centaur divination magic relies solely on their eyesight, and that their entire population doesn't possess any other inherent forms of magic that would've allowed them to detect the deception.

Both OP (about making Mars itself brighter) and you (about overriding speed of light) are likely jumping to conclusions and ignoring Occam's razor, --- unless it was specifically stated by a reliable narrator in the story that those things were what she had actually done.

- TMR sealing the secret of "TMR"="Voldemort" in a Fidelius, and designating a horcrux as the secret keeper.
- a character's animagus form being a human. Also: a character's animagus form being of the opposite sex. Also: a character with split personality disorder; with the "main" personality not being aware that they even /have/ an /animagus/ form, and with the alternative personality operating independently on its own.

  - a character's patronus form being a human.

- prophecy targets being gradually / incrementally corrupted just enough to not fall under the prophecy's protection, and cumulatively enough for the person to become unable to fulfill the designated prophecy.

  - prophecies being tame-able, with the tamer then using the prophecies under their control as additional sources of reality warping powers / magic.
  - prophecies being infectious and cognito-hazardous. The moment someone hears them in full, their mind becomes permanently affected by it, and they also become an infected "carrier" of that prophecy and a risk to other non-infected people.

- suicide bombing, booby-trapping of still-living people, magical bioterrorism.
- horcruxes being able to use "empty" humans as shells.

  - horcruxes gradually merging with their wielder. The idea by itself isn't that original, but the execution was pretty well done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] has a ghost animagus, but I wish I knew what the others were. They could be explored in very interesting ways.

#+begin_quote
  a character's patronus form being a human.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] deals with this, and like so many other concepts it brings it to the table in an interesting way. Fun fact, this fic is likely the origin of the fanon idea for impermanent transfigurations, or at the very least it brought it into the public consciousness.

#+begin_quote
  prophecy
#+end_quote

Prophecies as cognitohazards is such an interesting idea, the fact that I have no idea what fic you're referring to makes me think that said fic is either terribly short or terribly written. Same with the reality warping interpretation. I'd like to check them out though, just to make sure.

#+begin_quote
  suicide bombing, booby-trapping of still-living people, magical bioterrorism.
#+end_quote

The second one is done in HPMOR, as Voldemort at least semi-intentionally overwrites baby Harry's mind with his own there, but without memories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort?]] sort of has magical suicide bombing, if you include rituals that should have killed the caster. I can't say I've seen magical bioterrorism done before, though.

#+begin_quote
  horcruxes being able to use "empty" humans as shells.
#+end_quote

Another interesting idea that I'd like to see. Same with the merging idea that you've said is pretty well done.

**** No, it is a result of the inherent logical flaws of Harry Potter magic. Light needs approximately 7 minutes to reach Mars, meaning that even if the spells travel at light speed, we would not see the effects of the spell for 14 minutes.

An argument I hear often in those discussions is, that magic does not follow physical rules, and it is possible for magic to affect its environment instantaneously, no matter the distance. But why is it then, that spells in combat can be defended against, if they work instantaneously?

If magic is that powerful and rule-bending in some instances, it has to be in all instances.
