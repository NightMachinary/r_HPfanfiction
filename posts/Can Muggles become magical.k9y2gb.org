Muggles can have muggleborn children and if a muggle has kids with someone that magical like a wizard or veela they can have magical children.

But I mean like muggles becoming magical in their own life time. Like for example , if muggle is turned into a werewolf are they now magical?

Werewolves are magical right? Sure doesn't seem they get extra magic outside wolf form in canon. But canon only really talks about werewolves turning witches and wizards. Witches and Wizards can't turn magical they already are. But a muggle isn't. So could they become a wizard through becoming a werewolf?


** Muggles can't no. There was a whole thing about it in the books when the Death Eaters took over the Ministry and Umbridge was involved. Claiming that Muggles could steal magic when they couldn't.

I'd imagine if a Muggle was bit by a Werewolf, instead of turning, they'd just die.

** In one of the fics I read, if a muggle was bit by a werewolf, they wouldn't necessary be magical but they would still become a werewolf, albeit the muggle version of what werewolves are in folklore. I'd like to think they'd survive the process instead of just *dying*

** There's no canon way for muggles to become magical. It's Pottermore canon that when muggles are bitten by werewolves, they just die, don't transform.

If you want to contradict Pottermore canon in your own fic, feel free of course.

** I think Muggle bit by werewolf would die, but it is possible that some people considered to be Muggles are actually equivalents of Squibs (with a little magic, not enough for wand use, but enough to see Leaky Cauldron, Hogwarts, or dementors), so they can survive. That's at least as I understand “Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters” linkao3(10294436) (of course, it is not canon, but it is my headcanon).
