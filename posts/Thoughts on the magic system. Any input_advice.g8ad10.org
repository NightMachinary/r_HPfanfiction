"Why, Mr. Potter, any Unspeakable, or any upperclassmen from Ravenclaw for that matter, will be happy to tell you that magic is not simply an extra tool in your arsenal, and to treat it as such is disrespecting it. Not only that, but it also shows your ignorance of our world. You can sneer and claim all you want that wizards have no logic or common sense, however, one would argue that we are but a small part of a very large world that completely defies logic and common sense. I can not even begin to explain the intricacies of magic itself or any of its various forms. There is a reason that we are so separate from the non-magical world. One cannot claim to have any sort of logic or common sense when dealing with anything magical unless they choose to simply skim the surface."

"Of course, one could argue that not everyone has the ability to so deeply explore the very nature and ways of our world. It is true that that is generally a trait found solely in Ravenclaw if one could simplify this to Hogwarts' houses. Your method is very straightforward and, if I may say so, brutish but effective. That may work splendidly when dealing with the general population, but with Voldemort... well, I believe I have told you before that Tom Riddle has delved very deep into all sorts of magic, not in the least his knowledge and application of the Dark arts. One can not simply overpower or outmaneuver him in a fight to truly defeat him, no, magic is more than that. There is a reason that our world holds duels of any kind in high regard, and why I believe, as do many, that dueling champions are so much more than simple fighters."

This was a small exercise in writing as well as the only way I could think to express my thoughts on this. I can respect all the writers who have an OP fighter Harry who takes on Voldemort and kills him in a game of skill (especially Harrys who mow down Death Eaters and fight with Dumbledore on principles), but I find that in the books, movies, etc, it is proven that there is more to magic. In canon, it was a mess of a prophecy, horrific soul magic, ancient tales of gifts from Death, blood rituals (how Harry survived the killing curse the second time), and sacrifice that led to Voldemorts' ultimate demise and Harrys' triumph.

JKR has left us with such a contradictory and open-ended magic system that I have rarely seen utilized fully. Enchanting, Arithmancy, Astronomy, Divination, Wandlore, etc. There could be so much more.


** I agree with you that magic should have an essential mystical aspect where actions, the meaning of events and objects, etc all play a role.

However, I have never been a fan of wizarding reverence for magic. This isn't the Force from Star Wars. This is a world where wizards use their powers for cooking and cleaning. Reverence does not sit well with the nature of the world, I think.

Wizards can be delighted by magic, fascinated by it, etc. but I don't think it works to have them act as if magic is to be conserved and used reverentially rather than as a tool.

** What is magic? Where does it come from? The wise man would say that those are wrong questions, yet the wiser would say there are no wrong questions. It is like asking the musician where music comes from, or asking a painter where does art come from. Magic is creation, magic is spontaneity. It is order, and it is chaos. Imagine an orchestra. A multitude of people sitting down and playing their instruments, all in unison. Yet, off-rhythm it is a cacophony. It is clamorous. However, there is one thing that saves it. A conductor holding a baton, a mere stick. The stick is not power unto itself. It's a sign of authority. Power belongs to the conductor, but the baton amplifies it, symbolises it. The conductor takes control of the disordered elements present around him and sets them into his own rhythm. That, is a wizard. The stick, a wand. And the rhythmic beautiful sound produced, Magic. Inspired by Steelbadger.

** Magic should be magical. Unfortunately, authors tend to forget that.

*** Far too many authors are seemingly obsessed with giving it intricate mechanics, often so that their protagonist can find loopholes to gain power-ups. I blame the influence of gaming.
