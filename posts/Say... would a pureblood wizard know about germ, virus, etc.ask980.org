** Assuming that germs do exist in the HP world (as opposed to Muggles having misunderstood the true cause of illness), one would imagine that wizards are aware of them, given that cures to magical diseases like dragon pox have been discovered.

**** Well, the idea of something being contagious isn't limited to germ theory. Laughter is also described as contagious. It's similar to how inheritance isn't limited to genetic theory.

******** I thought 'brain wave' was a term used to describe a stroke of inspiration. I don't know what you mean by alpha, delta, etc. Possibly, that's how much the wizards know too.

  If they can cure anything by using magic, would they actually try to learn deeper about diseases?
#+end_quote

Uhhh /yeah/. Muggles don't have a monopoly on curiosity.

#+begin_quote
  And adopt muggle terminology?
#+end_quote

A lot of magical things, including magical diseases, are named after a muggle counterpart. Of course, from a writer's point of view, this is to make the reader feel already familiar with the new world while still giving it a magical flavor, not for any in-universe reason.

** In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal Series]] Harry wants to become a doctor and talked to Pomfrey, who started talking about Aristotles and the four humours like it was groundbreaking science, and did not know about germs.

And honestly? The way it was brought up rang true.
