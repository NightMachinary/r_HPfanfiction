I look for a fics where muggle aristocracy interact with the wizarding one. See, Justin is an upper-class boy - Eton, right? His folks are notified about Wizarding World due to the Statuts. Yet, he is just another badger, nothing else. In Russian fics about complots between the muggle and wizarding aristicracy are very common, mostly in SI fics.

Can you recommend me some in English?


** Hm. Closest I can recall is a scene where his parents out-snob the Malfoys in chapter 22 of "The Perils of Innocence".

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** You might like The Best Revenge linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]]) It doesn't primarily focus on Justin/muggle high society but, especially in the sequel there are some really interesting plot points that cover what you are asking for. Also, the summary really and truly does not do the story justice, it's much better and more neuanced than you would expect.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
