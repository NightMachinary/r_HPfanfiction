I've read a few fics where it's completely AU and James/Lily are alive & raise Harry, But I don't think I came across one where Harry from the original fic goes to a world where James & Lily are alive... If you know fics like that could you recommend? I read all pairings!


** James and Lily are alive in these dimensional travels:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where its Harry was killed long time ago, but Voldemort got trouble from a 'fucker'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where Tom Riddle was good, but there were different bad guys. No Harry in this world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): During the Horcrux hunt, Harry ended up in a much worse place where his counterpart was quite bad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483): Harry and Ginny ended up in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] universe, linkffn(5511855), and 20 years into the future. They were kind shocked to find Bellatrix as the Minister and married to the other Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadows Walks]], linkffn(6092362): In search for Hermione, Harry embarked on a long dimensional travel and encountered many different outcomes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville ended up in a different world where Snape and Sirius were best friends, and Lily was married with Remus. No Harry in this world.

** There are tons.

My favorite is /Stages of Hope/ linkfn(6892925)

​

Also /A New Life/ (HP/SB slash) linkffn(4345742) eh.

/A Second Chance/ linkffn(2681873) no idea if I've actually read this.

/A Stranger in an Unholy Land/ linkffn(1962685) really like this one

/Across the Universe/ linkffn(4180686) excellent oneshot

/Deepest Reflections/ linkffn(3959072) third in a very long series of AU Harry stories. AU Harry meets Canon Harry. There is angst.

/Dimension Father/ linkffn(4144226) Lily is dead. The grammar, oh the grammar.

/Disappear/ linkffn(1677882), like /A Stranger in an Unholy Land,/ only not as good and very unfinished.

/Harry Potter and the Phoenix Burning/ linkffn(6820445) inoffensive and entirely predicatable.

/Imprisoned Realm/ linkffn(2705927) In progress for 13 years, it looks like. I've decided not to read it until completed.

/Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/ linkffn(2477819). I like this one.

/Passageways/ linkffn(8378840) I don't care for Harry/Bellatrix, so I was tepid about this one, but it isn't bad. Might be abandoned, might not (author note at end ambiguous.) Has Harry go to 1970s AU (or maybe it was just time travel? Anyway, Lily and James are there.)

/The Second String/ (eventual slash advertised) linkffn(13010260) 1970s time travel, not the typical plotline. I like it, ongoing updates.

/Too Far from Home/ linkffn(5757945). Angsty but I really like it. Very irregular updates.\\

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

*** It's rare that competent writing irritates me this much. The style is decent with the exception of one incredibly obnoxious thing. They constantly use three different words to describe-explain-clarify something, in the way I just did, and it's so unnecessary-excessive-pointless. Not to mention they use different versions of the dash sometimes, which makes it all the more irritating-annoying-irksome.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. But this is nothing to what awaits him in the future. A future that he will do anything to protect.

  Harry Potter fulfilled his destiny, but it cost everything he held dear to him. As Death's Champion he's being asked to do it all over again, and this time he'll get the chance to have the family he always wanted. Will Harry once again emerge victorious or will his friends and family pay the price for his failure? Alive James/Lily. Super Harry vs Super Voldemort. Harry/Daphne/OFC.
