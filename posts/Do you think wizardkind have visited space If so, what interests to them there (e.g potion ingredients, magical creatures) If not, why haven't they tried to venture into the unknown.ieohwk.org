** I imagine sometime in the 1400s a wizard may have visited the moon to test the cheese. Upon tasting said cheese and finding it to be of inferior quality to Wensleydale, the wizard returned to Earth to share the sad news with the rest of wizardkind. Ever since then, wizards have held no interest in travelling to space. After all, what's the point if the cheese isn't good?

*** A personal headcannon of mine is that only the earth-side of the moon has werewolf powers. So, you set up a werewolf colony/moon base/research center on the other side.

Related question: Can you travel around the world so you miss the full moon? Canonically, werewolves turn with the rising moon over their part of the world, so can you take a speedy jet to Australia, then back to England, avoiding the whole thing altogether? Can you take a series of portkeys or disapparate internationally to the same effect? Why don't wizards do this???

**** You can think of things like this for a lot of stuff in canon. Like “why doesn't quirrell use the Killing Curse on Harry?”

***** Quirrel was carrying a very notable reminder of what happened the last time someone cast the killing curse on Harry. Being wary of the results of it would have been self preservation.

** No indication that they have, but it should be within their capabilities. They have astronomy, so they know what's up there, more or less, plus they'd know from Muggleborns/half-bloods. Levitation/weightlessness charms would be immensely useful for getting into orbit, bubblehead charms on a larger scale for life support, enlargement spells to fit a lot into a small ship, maybe a modified portkey spell to get you to your destination. Unless there's some metaphysical reason why their spells can't work beyond Earth (no evidence of this), then they should be able to at least reach or even colonize the Moon.

** No.

Because Ptolemy cast /Homenum Revelio/ on the universe, found it was empty, and wizards found an empy universe uninteresting.

** I don't think Draco Malfoy realizes the planet orbits a star tbh. I think that magic can't tell you everything and most purebloods don't understand solar system models because they never bothered with muggle means of observation. It's just a hc, but the idea of rich Slytherins mocking a muggleborn for offhandedly saying the Earth orbits the sun to awkward silence is just too funny to me.

*** You can buy a complete model of the galaxy at Diagon Alley (PS).

However, in more interesting tangents, you do realise that "the earth orbits around the sun" is the perspective taken for convenience? The laws of motion governing the solar system become very easy if you look at things that way; however, that is the only way the sun as the centre is distinguished. Not least because the sun itself would be moving through the galaxy, and the galaxy through the universe etc.

In principle, it's no less wrong to assume the standpoint of the earth at rest. You have to calculate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle][epicycles]] (or even worse, do the full-on General Relativity treatment with weird-ass gravitational fields), which is arbitrarily complicated, but yields equally good results; and I always found it charming to consider that wizards might look at the solar system that way, because they can use magic to help or replace the calculations.
