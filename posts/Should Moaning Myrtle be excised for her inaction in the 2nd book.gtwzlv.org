I struggle to conceive of a scenario where Myrtle wasn't at least somewhat aware of Ginny's comings and goings.


** Myrtle is not always in "her" lavatory, she also spends quite a lot of time crying in the pipes, swimming in the Black Lake or being a creepy stalker in the prefect bathroom.

Even in the case when she was in the lavatory, Myrtle seem to be perfectly happy to ignore whoever is there and just cry in a stall (the main reason why she approached the trio was because Ron and Harry where boys and boys are not supposed to be there). And if Ginny had a bad timing and came when she felt social, well the difficulty in talking to Myrtle is to not make her cry and leave, not the inverse, one or two sentence should be enough to be alone.

Finally, Myrtle is a ghost. From what we saw in canon, Ghosts (and Living Portraits) may show signs of sentiance, but they are not alive. As an example, how many time did the Fat Lady found a student out after curfew (when they came back in their common room)? Yet, no students ever been punished after being found out of bed by a living portrait (or even a ghost for that matter). So even if Myrtle did see something, she is a ghost and doesn't have to go to see a teacher. I'm more interested about why nobody ever bothered to ask her how she died in 50 years that the fact that she didn't fly to Dumbledore.

** She was being possessed by Voldemort. He probably figured something out to get rid of her when needed.

*** Just hand waving it away by saying "He just figured something out" defeats the propose of the thread. What's your case? What did Tom do? How does that absolve Myrtle?

**** Be mean to her? Myrte was very emotional she would cry and leave over perceived insults. Call her names or make a comment on her looks and personality even a benign one and she would flush herself down the toilet.

**** Why should Myrtle be absolved of anything? There's nothing in Chamber of Secrets that indicates she was even remotely aware of Ginny's activities. The only time she interacted with Ginny, even indirectly, was when Ginny accidentally threw Tom's diary at her in an attempt to flush it down the toilet.

***** True, and that wasn't even an interaction... the book went through Myrtle's head (she was in the U-bend, not in the lav itself) and she didn't even know who did it.
