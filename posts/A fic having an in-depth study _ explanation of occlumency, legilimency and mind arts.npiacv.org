So I remember reading a fic where Occlumency was explained in a long and complete way.

Some important points I remember are

- You need to create a whole world, like a mindscape.
- Harry has the mindscape of the Hogwarts castle with advanced defences like dragons, basillisk and multiple versions of himself in the mindscape
- Everything is controlled from a command centre

I remember atleast two fics having a really good description and having the above three points.\\
Also if you have any fics having a good description of the mind arts, please recommend them in the comments.\\
Thanks.

** I would check out core threads by theaceoffire it focuses extremely heavily on the mind arts and building a whole space in your head, it literally starts in the end of chapter one/start of chapter two. It's so good and I can't recommend it enough. It's very much an OP Harry fic, largely due to how he perceives his own magic and basically creates his own form of occlumency.

** I don't have a fic for you, and I feel bad commenting on request threads without a fic, but I really hate these descriptions of occlumency. This doesn't gel at all with the canon description of it requiring intense concentration, emotional control and focus. Nor do I think it would be such an immensely rare skill if it was just "lol build a mind castle and put moats and shit everywhere". I always preferred The Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived description of Occlumency, where it was a constant mental vigilance of your emotions and thoughts, not a passive defense you can just set and forget about but an active effort to notice and root out foreign influences in your mind. Something that required constant effort, honest knowledge of yourself, your emotions and your thoughts, as well as willpower and all the standard jazz.

*** True, canon occlumency is wayy different than the fanfiction ones, but the ones explained in fanfics are detailed with a pretty logical explanation. Ill try to explain it as i know it.

Most of the passive occlumency is actually an involuntary action, like raising your arms when you are attacked or pumping of your heart. Everyone has an inherent amount of occlumency, just the way babies get scared when something approaches them quickly and they try to shield themselves. But you can train your reflexes in a way that it becomes almost on a spinal level and hence very easy passively. Also it needs months, maybe years of training and dedication to achieve that. Fanfics generally skip those training part. Also I guess it feeds on the magical core (unlike heart muscles which draws energy from the food we eat)

And about the mindscape, i find it easier to remember a flashcard if i imagine keeping them in a folder or a box in my head, not unlike how we store it on a computer. Not foolproof, but a bit better than rote memorising. Mindscape is, I think, an extension of that stuff.

Canon description of occlumency is VERY lacking, even official sources say very little. It feels like an untapped resource which we can extrapolate to make sense of it.

***** I think part of it is other places that have the mind-arts often use some sort of mind-scape, as they tend to be more visual forms of media. The one that immediately comes to mind is X-men, and other comics. They often utilize mindscapes to display and search for a person's greatest fears, etc. That being said, I don't think it works as well for Harry Potter occlumency, as it seems to be an entirely different thing. Also, the Xmen one isn't usually a chosen mindscape, rather its a manifestation of a persons mind, and only the super advanced telepaths could alter it. Either way, I agree, I'm not a fan of fanon occlumency

***** It's a very interesting story, but I personally cannot get back into it. I read it once, finished it, and have no chance of getting back into it. For me, there's simply too many sidestories and irrelevant subplots that make it interesting, but a bit too messy, long-winded, and all over the place at times. It's not my cup of tea, but some may enjoy it.

** occulumency is not a mindscape. occulumency is just clearing your thoughts so that if someone tries to read you they'll find nothing. basically it's just 'head empty, no thoughts'. it's not about barriers and defenses either. the second and most advanced form of occulumency is hiding only certain thoughts and memories so that if anyone uses legilimency on you they'll only hear the thoughts that you didn't hide and they have no way to know you're using occulumency.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It borrows some ideas from linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) but it expands on them and makes them it's own. It's a really well thought out take and even subverts a few of the common mind arts tropes. Doesn't really go in depth until year 2 though.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
