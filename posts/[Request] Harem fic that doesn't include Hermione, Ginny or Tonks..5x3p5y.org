So I hate Hermione with a passion, I literally can't read fics where she's an important character, Ginny is a horribly meh character in most fics and I dislike the weasleys enough that Ginny pairings are a no. Tonks is just meh and way too old. I don't care if there is bashing or not, having Ron/Hermione as irrelevant is fine as well. No dark lord potter fics or slaves for that matter. I prefer Gray Harry because fuck the light are retarded 90% of the time in fics and the books. Harry can also be dark as long as he ain't evil. I always hated the fact that pairings stay in house, like why can't Harry end up with a nice Raven or a Snake(or multiple in this case).

Thanks in advance!


** I don't mean for this to sound insulting, but it probably will.

Do you even like the Harry Potter franchise at all? The main reasons that those three females (and Luna) are chosen is that they are the only girls anywhere near age appropriate that have any characterization in the books and aren't presented as antagonists.

*** Did YOU read the franchise? If you did you'll see that we learn almost nothing about Ginny, Tonks or Luna. Hermione is the only female character who is good characterized. And she is annoying as hell.

*** That's what fanfiction is for. We all started off reading 'canon'. The fact that there are so many characters that are just names with vague appearances and not much characterisation is what makes it possible to write them the way we want. And of course to change the way the main characters have been 'characterised', add plot variations etc. (Also, technically Ginny isn't really given much of a personality in the franchise)

After reading a lot of fanfics, it is possible to want a change(HGandGW as pairings specially are EVERYWHERE)

Just because that is the case, doesn't mean that someone doesn't like the franchise. We wouldn't be on a fanfiction subreddit otherwise.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** From what I've read no matter how OOC Hermione is she's still annoying as heck. Always a know-it-all or acting like a mother. Every time I saw "Language Harry!" I pretty much gave up on the fic until I avoided fics with her like the plague. Ginny is just a no 90% of the time because the same boring Griff pairings are bland and boring to me at least. With tonks I just don't understand the fascination people get pairing her with Harry the same way I don't get Fleur and Bill but I can gloss that over since they're unimportant.

Also thanks but I've read that one before and I don't think I enjoyed it much.

** Does it have to be a harem fic? Or is single pairing with no Hermione ok?

Check out Rise of the Wizards, it is a harem, though the focus is more on Daphne, and there isn't much focus on the pairing in general. The story is anti-Hermione too, so it should be a good read.

** I think you might like [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]]. While Hermione and Ginny are mentioned as being sympathetic to his cause, it's primarily a Harry/Gabrielle/mythical hotties harem based on Norse mythology. NSFW and proud of it.
