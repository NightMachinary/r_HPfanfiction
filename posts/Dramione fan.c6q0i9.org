Hi :D I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for a year now and I am a really big Dramione fan. So I was wondering if any of you could recommend me their favorite HG/DM fics,I read all the most popular ones and then some and I would really like to read something new. Thank you for your time :D


** If you go to dramioneasks on tumblr you can search on tropes and themes you like within the pairing, or find ‘if you liked this fic, you'll also like...' type recommendations. That'll be a much better resource on finding fics, and no one will lecture you for liking the pairing.

** Looking Glass on FFN is a really great Dramione

Well written and plausible

I'm an unashamed Dramione fan

** Hey, welcome to the fandom. Draco/Hermione isn't really promoted/accepted here and I don't personally support it (Draco's too big of a bigot to me, and Malfoys are blood purists after all) but check out Colubrina's works on FF.net as she's a big Dramione writer. Her work is pretty well-written.

*** I hate Dramione but at least Draco feels like a human being in some of them,which is more than can be said for Daphne.

*** Oh wow. I did not know that, sorry. It's just I'm a big believer in redemption, second chances and all that which is why I like the idea of them. But really thank you for your help.
