So it's a reasonably well-used trope to make Harry and/or Hermione be/turn out evil. Hermione is often the secret daughter of Voldemort, is betrayed by the order, and then of course seeks bloody vengeance. Harry, meanwhile, either tries to break free from the manipulations of Dumbledore or just gets fed up and goes on a rampage.

But why is there little showing a darker side of the third member of the trio? Generally, Ron's only job is either as one of the scheming evil masterminds behind Dumbledork and the Order of the Sheep's plans, or he's totally innocent and horrified by what his friend(s) have become. With that in mind, I'm interested instead to see stories where Ron is the bad guy, and stories where he becomes interested in the Dark Arts, because there seems to be a noticeable lack of them.


** I don't know what Fanfictions you've been reading. I have never seen that happen with Hermione. However I usually see Ron is working for Dumbledore trying to get Harry to die at the right time.

*** I've read a few stories that had Hermione being the secret daughter of Bellatrix and Voldemort but neither of them had her go off on a rampage. (Though I don't often read Dark Hermione stories.)

Though like rule 34 I'm sure if you look hard enough you find a story that matches the OPs request.
