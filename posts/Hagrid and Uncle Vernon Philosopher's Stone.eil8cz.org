I'd like to see a fan fiction where when Hagrid breaks into the cabin to tell Harry he's a wizard and Vernon points a shotgun at him; the gun goes off killing Hagrid instantly and it turns into a gripping procedural court room drama, depicting Vernon's court case in painstaking detail.


** In Canon, Hagrid stayed in the cabin over night and then took Harry to Diagon the next day.

If Vernon killed Hagrid, he wouldn't be noticed missing until the next day when he was supposed to return to Hogwarts after the shopping trip.

Once it's noticed that Hagrid isn't back, Dumbledore would be quite busy finding out what happened, and by the time he found Harry and Hagrid's bodies in the cabin the Dursleys would already be in another country and Quirrel would have succeeded stealing the Stone from Gringotts.

***** I would think that Vernon would have an excellent self-defence case. For the prior few weeks, they've been getting letters from a mysterious stalker who seems to have become obsessed with his nephew. For everybody's safety, they decide to hunker down on an island in the middle of a lake. A large man barges in, won't leave when asked to, is clearly deranged, ranting about taking their nephew away. His wife and son are also there. They are on an island in the middle of the storm, and so they can't run. (This is assuming I'm remembering canon correctly.)

I think that even British law would find that lethal force is justified under these circumstances.

It's a good point that /wizards/ won't miss Hagrid until two days later---but the Dursleys wold call Muggle police, which would arrive as soon as they were able, and they would be well into their investigation by the time the Obliviators get there.
