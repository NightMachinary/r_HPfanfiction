  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

****** Yeah, I dismissed it for ages due to the dreadful summary too, but when I finally gave it a shot it sucked me in immediately. Fair warning: the writing takes a pretty sharp turn downhill after the final battle. All the wonderful description that makes up the first 75% of the story is gone, and it's pretty much entirely somewhat stilted single-line dialogue and disjointed scenes. I still recommend because it's excellent up until that point.

****** It's got its upsides and its downsides. The premise is interesting, and the romance is quite well done and avoids many of the sexist clichés that fics like this often have, though I admit I skimmed the sex scenes. On the other hand, the author strikes me as the sort that puts almost no effort into plotting the non-romantic parts of the story.

I can understand the need to stay on canon rails until she caught up with her own time (because they would want to avoid a paradox), but beyond that, a skilled assassin working for the Order would /change/ things, dammit! (Not to mention that a Dumbledore willing to use someone like that would have been a bit more ruthless with dealing with the likes of Lucius Malfoy.) For that matter, since Hermione had the Time-Turner, but I'm pretty sure that the only way she actually uses it was to make extra time to have sex with Snape, and in the meantime, we get exact same plot. Same thing for the Camping Trip, the Malfoy Manor, and other Stations of Canon: the details are a little different, but to no consequence whatsoever. Controlled Fiendfyre is alleged to be Hermone's signature spell --- and at some points, she even shoots people with it without line of sight, but she seems to forget it as plot demands.

I also think that the author made some poor choices in characterisation. Snape is white-washed: apparently, he actually /likes/ teaching, and his rough handling of his class is merely to impart the importance of safety in Potions; and he actually has good relationships with the other Hogwarts staff, and McGonagall in particular. Hermione, after a long training-montage-like enumeration of her time-travel adventures is absurdly sentimental --- arguably more so than she were in canon --- to the point of giving her targets a fighting chance.
