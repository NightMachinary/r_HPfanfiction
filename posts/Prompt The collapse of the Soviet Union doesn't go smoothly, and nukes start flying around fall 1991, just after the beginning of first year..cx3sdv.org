** Oooh, Harry Potter and alt-history, two of my favourite things. So let's say there is a military coup in the USSR around the middle of December 1991, weeks before the Soviet Union is formally disbanded, but several Eastern European states have already broken away from the collective. Let's say the new Soviet leadership moves to annex these new states, which triggers a NATO response.

Let's then postulate that Dumbledore, as leader of the ICW, plays some role in the diplomacy of the conflict; nuclear warfare between the two superpowers is not something any wizard wants. This would necessarily draw Dumbledore away from the castle for several weeks, meaning Voldemort suddenly has a clear path to the stone, as the Mirror wouldn't be placed into the third floor corridor until after Christmas.

Let's also say that all efforts of diplomacy fail, and nuclear weapons fly shortly into 1992. I would imagine Scotland to be a low-priority target, so let's say that while London is devastated by nuclear blasts, the North escapes direct bombardment, but is still vulnerable to the nuclear fallout. That said, I am no expert on British military base layouts, so if there are significant military bases that a nuclear strike would target, this could change.

Hence, I see Hogwarts and Hogsmeade remaining the last major bastion of Wizarding Britain, as the Ministry and Diagon Alley were no doubt destroyed in the attacks. This would make it a hotspot for refugees, and the centre of the remnants of the government. I assume some sort of shield from radiation could be added to the protective enchantments on Hogwarts, as well as some magical hydroponics, etc. to mitigate the effects of nuclear winter on the food supply.

Now, this is where an interesting story can be told. Dumbledore, no doubt saddened by the conflict, would be thrust into the seat of power to prevent a total collapse of wizarding society. In addition, Voldemort has returned, and suddenly the idea of Wizard rule over the Muggles to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again, suddenly seems a great deal more appealing. Then, you have all this over the background of struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.

*** The British base their missile subs out of Clyde, near Faslane in Scotland. And there is an American submarine base at Holy Loch, as well as important airfields which would allow NATO to draw a defensive barrier to stop Soviet subs from breaking out into the Atlantic to raid NATO shipping. Definitely a few priority targets up there, which ought to make life a lot more "interesting" in Hogwarts.

***** Certainly about the airfields since the Iceland gap would be their prime approach for submarine warfare and they'd have played plenty of war games to find the best strategy. Although admittedly, nuking all possible locations would be impossible (knocking out the largest ones would be impactful enough). They had reconnaissance satellites, spies and publicly available information, so they should have a good idea where to find them. Sub bases are rather difficult to hide after all, and you can even see the subs in Google maps today.

**** I agree, but that appeared to be the most likely source of conflict around 1991 I could think of. I doubt it would go to a hot war, we'd probably just see sanctions on the USSR, sort of like with the Crimean annexation we saw in 2014.

***** 1991 also had Yeltsin's election, if you change that result you could stoke tensions higher with a more gradual change. 1993 or 1996 are probably better options, though, with the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and the US involvement in Yeltsin's reelection.

1993 would also lead right into GoF and the Triwizard Tournament, which is obviously a good avenue for exploring international relations if you want to remain somewhat close to canon at the start.

*** First of all, there /was/ a military coup - a failed one (the Kremlin coup). Second of all, in the 1991 referendum, aside from some states, most citizens actually wanted to keep the soviet union, albeit as a decentralized, democratic entity. And yes, i have little doubt that some states like Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and possibly Armenia and Georgia would have tried to split, i doubt they would have done so without significant internal support (no-one wanted WWIII; No one). So if you want full scale war, then you'll have to get creative.

**** Most citizens actually wanted to keep the soviet union, really? Well, Russians certainly did. All the other states that are now independent, not so much. I can't say for referendums in other countries, but in the referendum in Ukraine in 1991, 90% voted for independence.

No one would blink an eye should Russia decide to keep any of the countries through military force then, though, let alone start a nuclear war.

******* Fair enough. that said, i do feel the need to point out that the Ukrainian referendum happened in December '91, and and the soviet one in March '91. There was also a failed coup from conservatives in august which dramatically raised the tensions. So from what i understand, a fair portion either didn't want the union to dissolve or were still on the fence, but by december most of them were swayed by separatists. (no idea if that's true; it's just a guess)

******* Oh wow, Soviet Union was moral. Yes, they were very moral when creating an artificial famine that killed millions in my country, or taking hundreds of thousands Crimean Tatars out of their homes overnight and deporting them in cattle trains.

You wouldn't be able to have "different perspectives on "controversial" positions" in Soviet Union. And not only during Stalin, you know. Political dissidents were arrested and sent to prison camps in Siberia up to late 80's.

The USSR was a shitty place and I cannot be happier that it fell and I don't have to live in it now. Most people in my (post-Soviet) country agree, other than some old folk nostalgic for the times they could still get a hard-on.

I personally know people who were targeted for their political opinions in Soviet Union, I know people whose grand- and great-grandparents were political prisoners, were killed, were deported. I could direct you to check out people like Vasyl Stus, a great Ukrainian poet, who spent 13 years in a labour camp for political prisoners until his very suspicious death in 1985. But that would be lost on you. It's all "propaganda".
