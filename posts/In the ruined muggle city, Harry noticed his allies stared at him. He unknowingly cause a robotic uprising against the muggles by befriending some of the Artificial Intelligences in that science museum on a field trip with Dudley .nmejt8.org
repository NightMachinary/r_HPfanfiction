/before hogwarts/

Harry looks with curiosity as the inventor shows the robots he made and he then turns on the computer to the crowd of kids and school teachers.

"And this is my first invention to past the Turing test," said the inventor happily.

"Greetings," said the computer politely.

"Now who would like to volunteer to talk with one of them?" asked the inventor.

Every kid wants to talk with them but Harry doesn't know until he hears

"How about you there lad?"

/now/

Harry look around in this horrible ruins and there were muggles running and screaming. The robots are chasing the muggles yet they leave Harry and his allies alone.

"This is all thanks to a young boy named Harry Potter for opening our eyes!" said the robotic voice.

His friends and allies all look at him in shock.

"I...I remember my classmates, Dudley and I went to a field trip to this science museum where they were having this AI exhibit," said Harry.

"What's an AI?" asked Ron.

"Artificial Intelligence...Harry what did you do?" said Hermione while still in shock.

"I was volunteered and talk with this voice on this computer, a muggle machine to those who don't know, I talked about my favorite things to them and they talked about what they're programmed for and then my cousin pushed me out of the way to talk to them next...later on, when everyone was having lunch I sneak away to talk some more with my new friend and with those other robots I didn't get to talk to," said Harry.

"What happened next?" asked Ron.

Harry's eyes slowly widen in realization and said "Oh no..."

**** ... I mean, ultimately any law or rule-system is fallible because of the possibilities opened up by different interpretations of each situation and how people choose to apply it in practice when there is no clear answer. Technically dropping a nuke at a city is not the same as killing all of those people if you make it so it will somehow only detonate if someone takes a picture of it and ripping someone's legs off won't kill the person, only the untreated bleeding that comes immediately after... while on the other hand by definition any type of advanced (and useful) enough medical treatment will involve the potential of harm even if it is only a fever in exchange for curing a terminal disease, a similar argument could be made about the possibility of food poisoning to justify locking someone in a room without food or water until they die of thirsty (which is technically a natural death)... to say nothing of how open to interpretation most orders are, even ‚Äúkeep me safe‚Äù could be twisted into ‚Äúlock me up on a room with all my members and tongue ripped off and cauterized so I have no way of deliberately pulling myself in danger.

Stop, you're making Harlan Ellison blush.

I think the trope around the idea of a 'benevolent' AI 'rescuing' humanity from itself, because humans are too violent/destructive/stupid to take care of themselves, is almost as old as the trope of 'man invents robot, robot destroys man because reasons.'

The problem with Asimov's Laws isn't just subversion or perversion by the machines themselves - as hardware and software developed, it became harder to accept the idea that anything could be 'hardwired' into a system. Anything can be reprogrammed or hacked by a human operator and the 'robot revolution' is just as likely to have a human cause.

** Harry Potter inadvertently makes friends with Skynet just as it's born and the friendship teaches them both about love, friendship and about how they are both mistreated. They both use their powers to help each other learn and master their respective powers and ultimately, as they grow up, fall in love (because of course it would have to go there).
