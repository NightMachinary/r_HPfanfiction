I just finished reading Gettig the Hang of Thursdays by Hayseed for the second time.\\
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it -- basically Hogwarts gets stuck in a time loop of the same horrible day repeating over and over again. Snape and Hermione are the only ones who realize that the day is repeating, and they're isolated inside this Thursday for about a year's worth of iterations. It's an extremely claustrophobic fic, and I feel like this author handled a difficult premise flawlessly throughout.

Since this was published in 2004, and it seems to be something of a classic, I was wondering if anyone ever wrote a sequel. Seems like Hayseed didn't, but has anyone written a fic inspired by this one, or something?

** I think this has two possible endings, depending on reader preferences. On the original website, clicking the last chapter would give you a random ending.

I liked how depressing the story was.

*** Yep, I've read both endings. They're included in the fic I linked as the last two chapters. I feel like The Epic Ending is pretty well concluded -- I can't imagine a sequel to that, or wanting to read one, if it did exist. But The Coffee Ending -- there's so much to explore there!! How do the characters reintegrate after spending a year in isolation, how do they address their drastically shifted relationship, and how do they deal with the trauma that no one else can see or begin to understand?
