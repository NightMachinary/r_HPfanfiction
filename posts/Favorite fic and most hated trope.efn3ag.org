Heya all. I've been rereading fics I favf on FF and wanted to know any of y'all favs so maybe I find a new one to read.

One of my favs is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6813258/1/A-Midnight-Weary]]

Still think it's one that deals well with what should be in honesty people with PTSD in a way.

As a side note, recalled one of the most hated tropes I've found in fics: memory loss / amnesia. I absolutely despise that as a way to move the plot. IIRC, a fic called, I think, 'H J Potter' does that at 3/4 of the fic and I had to speed read all that.


** Don't think I've come across an amnesia fanfic actually which is weird.

** My 2 favorite stories are Prince of the Dark Kingdom(s/3766574) and Unatoned(s/8262940). IMO they are at the top of their respective genres.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is more standard type of a fanfiction, the writing can use work and it's unfortunately unfinished, but as far as plot and characters are concerned, it definately won't disappoint. On the other hand, Unatoned is written really well, but it's not for everybody.

The trope I hate the most is the "Harry inherited this and that, so now he's the coolest, the strongest, etc.". The moment I read the words Lord Potter/Black/Peverell I just skip it. On top of being the laziest plot device, it seems people have started a contest about who can write it in the most unoriginal way.

**** Yes and I stay away from Sinyk's stories. If "Heir Harry" is my number 1 hated trope, harems and bashing are 2nd and 3rd and Sinyk uses all of those.

** I can't pick a single favorite Of All Time fic, though I ‘do' have an ever growing list of fics that've held the title at one time or another (on ffn). It's not only HP, but that does account for about half of the list.

Feel free to browse it, to your hearts content. Though it's My favorite kind of fic's, so it may not be to your liking. Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Those-Less-Forgotten/124884/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

X---x---x----

As for most hated trope... I'm not a fan of Slash, and I despise Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione. Though I ‘have' found a Slash fic I can read. It's on the list above; Again and Again.

** I just read A Midnight Weary from your post. That is some amazing writing.

edit -- I mostly read crack-fics or time travel stuff that generally turns into crack-fics. I can appreciate stories that feel real like this but they are usually too much for what I can handle normally.

*** I can empathize with that. I have favd some really dark/depressing fics that I read the one time, and perhaps some other day, but not something I'd read often. The one I linked is kinda dark, however ain't so much.

As a sidenote, that author has good fics on HP.
