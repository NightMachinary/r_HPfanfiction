Preferably no slash. No pairing is good. I'm just asking for fics I normally wouldn't have time to read that I can now read with my newly acquired free time.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - Complete. I never know how to properly sell this one. It's a raunchy, lowbrow comedy that nevertheless has one of the better plots out there. Harry travels through the Veil and is reunited with Sirius in another dimension, and they act exactly as you'd expect two newly reunited Marauders to act. It's better than it sounds - it's one of the most recommended fics for a reason. If you haven't read this already, put it at the top of your list.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] - Incomplete, seems abandoned. Another one of the top recommended fics, this one features a Harry who's pulled into another dimension where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. It's primarily character-driven and is one of my (and many others') favorite fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] - Incomplete but actively updating. A HP/Star Wars crossover. This will eventually have a multi pairing but I'd urge you to read it anyway. It's 225k+ words in and the romance hasn't been a huge focus, so don't worry about it. Then again, it's 225+ words in and the /plot/ hasn't been a big focus either. It's still a good fic, and the other Harry Potter story by the same author ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]) is also worth taking a look at if you enjoy it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][000-Rent-A-Hero]] - Incomplete but actively updating. Harry's pulled into another dimension and asked to solve their Dark Lord problem, but things went wrong during the summoning ritual and he's /not happy/. It manages to make Divination badass, need I say more?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] - Incomplete. A classic that still mostly holds up. This fic was started after Half-Blood Prince, so Snape is a blatant villain written with the lack of subtlety and cunning usually associated with Evil!Dumbledore. Aside from that it's a very good time travel fic that's not just a retread of canon, though since it's old and popular much of what it originated has since become clich√©. It actually updated a few times this year, the first new chapters since (IIRC) 2012.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] - Complete. A HP/Firefly crossover. A rare (mostly) serious fic from nonjon, the same author who wrote A Black Comedy above. Aside from having Harry as a character this is mainly a Firefly story (though some Potterverse elements show up late into the fic). If you haven't at least seen the movie Serenity you'll be completely lost.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] - Incomplete, updates rarely. A HP/Avengers crossover. If I had one problem with it, it's that it strays too far from the movies. Harry's incredibly powerful, so to compensate the author threw in as many Marvel villains as he could think of and the story suffers for it. On the other hand, at least it's not a line-by-line +plagiarism+ rehash of the first Avengers like 90% of HP/Avengers crossovers.

All of these are over 100,000 words. Yes, I have a thing for time/dimensional travel fics. Sue me.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

One of the best stories I've read; and probably the best high-powered Harry and the best Soul bond portrayal of any fanfiction I know of.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall.]]

Anything by this author is worth reading, but this story of Hogwarts under Death Eater control is surprisingly overlooked in favour of Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5354628/1/So-You-re-a-Masochist-the-Art-of-Sidekicking][So You're a Masochist: the Art of Sidekicking]]

This one's a bit short compared to other options, but the quality cannot be doubted as Ron Weasley guides you through all you need to know about heroism.

The Weasley Twins Trilogy; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2506841/1/Surviving-the-Weasley-Twins][One]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378737/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Sect-of-Kai][Two]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4634460/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Kosa-Assassin][the Incomplete Third]].

Follows the hilarious exploits of the Weasley Twins in their first three years of Hogwarts; if I had to pick a writing style that most closely matches Rowling, I'd choose this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7232137/1/Unspeakable][Unspeakable]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]

Pick any story from this author and it will probably be a good one; but this story of Michael Corner and his RANDOM system is the one I'm going to recommend.

**** I really liked Delenda Est. Some portions were a little... unexplained? But it kind of goes through explaining it through plot development. It's just implied stuff you kind of have to get.

*** Okay, I just wanted to let you know, I started reading the Secret of Slytherin and it is absolutely brilliant. I mean, truly, truly brilliant. And deeply satisfying in a way that concerns me, really. Also, the chapter title [[/spoiler][Remus Lupin Versus the Establishment]] is an absolute treasure.

**** Yay! I'm glad you're enjoying it. It's great when you find a new, not so well known story that's amazing! (it maybe time for a reread...)
