Unrealistic as they are I've read a few I've enjoyed, but I wondered if anyone has ever written a fic that has a logical explanation for their abilities. One idea I had was they have the sum of their family's knowledge in their heads. But then why would they need to go to school? Perhaps they may have the knowledge but their body needs to be trained to use it? Perhaps the more powerful families have members who can maintain a link with the child to enable them to function at a higher level? Just thinking out loud here, but I'd love to read something that has a decent explanation for kid politicians.


** Murkybluematter's Rigel Black Chronicles talks about this at one point! There's a scene where they explain that magic impacts children's psychological and emotional development so that they have the maturity to handle their magic, so that they end up seeming older than muggle children of the same age.

*** Also, it's an important survival trait, because without that maturity, magical children would be dangerous to themselves.

** Tbh I dont think theres a problem if they are super smart or politicians and we just accept that.

I think problem is just that story becomes more ways to show off smarts the kids don't get good chatacter development/doesn't matter because story is about showing them figuring shit out with their smarts and they already smart.

They just need problems that they not suited to and need help from other people who equally as useful as them and need their character development to matter
