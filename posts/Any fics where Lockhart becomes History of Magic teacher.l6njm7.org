Sure, he's a scumbag. But clearly he can tell stories and gather facts. He would be a good History teacher.

** That happens in New Blood by Artemisgirl linkffn(13051824) It's a long fic, and it's not a very big part of the story, but it is very well written. I absolutely love the story, it has incredible world building and a really interesting magic system and characterization. The chapters are pretty short, but it's still updated consistently every Tuesday and Friday.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** He probably would be, if he could keep his ego in check, and not try to convince muggleborns that he is someone of importance.
