every time I see the words “Dumbledork” or “order of the fried chicken” I'm out of there.


** I don't think there's many - or any - that I'd say are terrible per se... But many are associated with pretty poor quality fics.

The two that you mention would be very hard to make work - but the worst is excessive bashing of any character. It's /very, very/ hard to make a fic that's fun to read despite bashing someone - say Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, etc. An author can make a character an antagonist or obstacle /without/ bashing them - particularly since bashing tends to make them laughable.

For the major other ones, I think that people generally associate Lord Potter, Indy!Harry, Manipulative Dumbledore, Magical Cores, Friendly Goblins, Veela allure and a slew of other such tropes as terrible ones/bad fics - however, I tend to subscribe to the idea that there are good fics using each of them, and that it's more poor writing that makes the individual fics fail.

*** I agree with this. On most of these bad cliches/tropes threads, people are so quick to jump on the stuff that you mentioned, while ignoring the fact that it's the execution that's bad, not so much the trope itself. Tropes and cliches are just conventions of writing, and a work that tried to steer clear of using any tropes or cliches just wouldn't be that interesting.

One of the main issues with the tropes that are most commonly disliked within this community is that they aren't used in ways that are very interesting. Friendly goblins are mainly there for a convenient means of acting on tropes and then quickly discarded, but it could become really interesting if the goblins were written into other parts of the story that had a lasting impact. Manipulative Dumbledore gets stale because he becomes some caricature villain void of any empathy and human emotion who's version of the Greater Good™ is an oppressive dictatorship, but it could be interesting if he was still portrayed as a complex individual who struggled with personal feelings of concern for Harry's well-being while trying to do what he believed to best for everyone, even if there might have been other paths he could have taken to ensure that the DEs didn't win (/wait a second/...). Vella allure, soul bonds/soul mates, and marriage contracts used for instalove isn't the best way to write a romance (especially due to issues of consent), but using these tropes to create tension within a potential pairing, where the parties involved have to work to form an organic bond to assert agency within their relationship despite fate/nature/etc forcing them together at first could make for excellent character and relationship building.

Basically, the real issue isn't really the cliches/tropes, but the fact that the consequences of said tropes and cliches are often poorly conceived. Stuff like what the OP mentioned could work if they ultimately came back to hurt Harry or whoever says the lines, or if the work is a satire poking fun at stuff like Indy!Harry, but come off poorly if author intends them as witty comebacks or lets Harry get away with disrespecting his allies like that.

*** I agree with all your points except Daphne Greengrass. But I don't like the version of Daphne, where she acts too smugly and almighty, belittling Hermione or other characters and political mastermind.

Ron bashing was my favourite when I started reading fanfic. I watched all movies in 3 days and read all books in next week. And I was so in love with Hermione character(Emma Watson didn't hekp it either) and badly wanted them to get together. But damn JKR shipped her with Ron. And Ron's betrayal in fourth and 7th year were very fresh on my mind. So, I read lots of H/Hr fics with Ron bashing. But it old now. I hate all bashing fics not just Ron.

So mote it be was worst thing happened to fandom.

Lily and James sacrificed themselves so that Harry can live. No way they were gonna abusive to him unless they were under potions and spells.

Love potion was canon, as long as it was not main point I don't care.

Twins are good fun but they were bullies too. And irresponsible, ffs they they tested their experimental products on first years. Their twin talk was worst. I mean sentence by sentence speaking was ok, but damn not word by word. I never got fandom fascination with it.

Lord Potter- I like those as long as he didn't get all the witches and wizards in his harem and 12x Europe GDP as his wealth. Or demanding everyone to call him Lord Potter Black. It was basically against Harry's character. He was a simple guy with very common name, clueless around the girls, never liked his fame who sacrificed himself for his friends. Not some Hadrian who bullies everyone and flashing girls and money. Even worse, he be friends cool girls and boys (namely slytherin racist scum who insults his mother ancestry everyday) and belittles his old friends.

Genius Harry- I had no problem as long as he don't spend 23 hours in library or can outsmart Voldemort and Dumbledore at age 11. I like more of Hermione level intelligence.

The slytherins how much I hate when they were portrayed as right people. Slytherin was basically boot camp racist and death eaters and their entire ideology was only rich and superior blood had right to live.

I hate when authors say Slytherins only hate muggleborns and bloodtraitors because they come into their world without any respect for traditions. Yes, traditions are very important as without them any society loses its identity. But you bully, insult and attack them and then whines about not following your traditions which meant nothing to them? The only traditions I read in fandom is calling people heir or Lord and remaing people bowed to them. No self respecting person would bow to another in this age and day. I read in one fic where Hermione father greets Daphne father while extending his hand for a shake. And Hermione internally freaks out that how his father was not Lord Greengrass equal and he shouldn't do that...etc. But her father was well educated and works as a doctor in 70's and 80s.

Friendly Goblins-- In first line author writes Goblins are very prideful creatures and immediately as soon as Harry says a Goblin name or says he was Lord of some bullshit house every goblin bends backwards to help him and calls him my Lord.

I don't think this is canon, we don't see any Slytherins other than Draco, Crabbe and Goyle(and they are more Gryffindor and Hufflepuff than Slytherin) having any meaningful roles, what we have is two or more generations corrupted by Riddle, JKR needed a villain house and Slytherin was ready-made one. Don't forget that Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were just as fast to turn against Harry every time, and half of Gryffindor joined the sometimes too. JKR even went on record saying being Slytherin did not mean being evil.

I don't know where people get that Ambition and Cunning are always evil, Death Eater ideology was what you say, Slytherin House had no stated ideology other than maybe be Machiavellian or something.

Eh, many countries still have traditions like these, but I agree with Europeans it doesn't make sense because even in the Victorian Era these customs were only important when dealing with Royalty, not Nobility.

Some fics do this tradition part right, with the purebloods being divided, between the crazy supremacists who only want an excuse and the traditionalists that think muggle-borns and such should get classes or something, or just that their millennia old customs should survive.

Imagine trying to celebrate Yuletide and being mocked because people say "It's Christmas, idiot!", I would get pissed too. Hermione is often used as an example because she comes up as being very condescending and sometimes arrogant, even if some fanfics blow this to absurd levels, it would be the same thing as if an American went to Japan and started complaining about the food, how people dress, how they greet each other, how they say names and everything else.

** *This is going to be scatterbrained, so buckle up:*

- The inclusion of "what if..." in the summary. My response is always /"Well, what if I don't read it instead?"/
- Alternative BWL but with nearly the same canon plot-line.
- Ice princess Daphne with flibbertigibbet Tracey.
- "Not all Slytherins are bigots! Stop judging us! You're the bigot!" True, not all of them are (probably), but we don't need to be lectured or have the hatred blown up so the author can "talk down to the audience," and vicariously thrill at being a moral crusader.
- The bad students are always Marietta Edgecombe, Zacharias Smith, Cormac McLaggen, Romilda Vane and/or on the Slytherin Quidditch team. Where is the bad Cedric Diggory, or Luna Lovegood (that sounds fantastic actually).
- Following canon despite massive changes occurring because its easy and cathartic.
- Tom Riddle was a misunderstood teddy bear that just needed a little hugging as a child. Allow me a moment to retch in that bush over there.
- Any reference to orbs for eyes. If Rowling used this even 10% as much as this fandom, I would be shocked that Harry wasn't a master [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_gazing][Crystallomancer]].
- Ancient runes being this under-appreciated magic that is incredibly useful, if only someone had mentioned it in canon. Obviously thats why the Vikings stopped using it - the language was just so useful.
- Ridiculously abusive Dursleys just so the author can make everyone fawn over Harry and how much of a trooper he is.
- Love potion Ginny and/or Molly. I'll admit Rowling timed all this rather poorly, but its just such a lazy way to break a couple up or bash characters.
- Time-travelers not realizing that they literally will never be able to keep the timeline accurate just by existing. Only events unaffected by them at all could reasonably be controlled, and loosely at best.

There is more, but I think the proverbial horse has been beaten to death already. I hope these were funny though. I laughed writing them.

*** In the abusive Dursleys trope my biggest annoyance is how writers think physical injuries take as long to heal with magic as with muggle medicine. Also, bones are not healed by Vanishing the bone and regrowing it with Skele-Gro! Neville's broken wrist was healed in less than a minute, which suggests a simple charm might be all that's needed. I imagine, since there isn't really a ward at St. Mungo's for mundane injuries, many people (like Mrs Weasley) would know how to heal them themselves.

** Honestly the worst for me is that sooooo many fics spend the first 4 chapters just badly retelling Harry getting his Hogwarts letter, traveling to Hogwarts, getting Sorted, and going to classes for the first day. A LOT of people don't even try to make that different enough to be interesting. Most plots don't start until chapter 5.

The second worse cliche to me is the VERY LONG FIRST CHAPTER EXPLAINING YEARS OF BACKSTORY GOING BACK TO THE FIRST WAR AND DETAILING EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER'S MOTIVES AND ACTIONS. It's never interesting. It's always dense. And most of it doesn't need to be included in the story.

** - calling Hermione Mione. Where... where in the books was that? they didn't call her that. is it so hard to write her whole name? it's just three more letters.

- Lord Potter, lord Peverell, lord Whatever. this I only found out in time travel fics (cause I love those). but the moment he is goes into Gringotts and he is like... I want to verify my lordships and then 10k words dialogue with goblins follows... no one wants to read THAT!

- in time travel fics, where Draco(or whoever) wakes up 11 again after dying and the story is THE. SAME. AS. CANON, only with Draco with the trio. nothing changes, because Draco doesn't know anything. even the dialogues are the same, but this time Draco is saying them. ugh. we want original content, please. also, that's plagiarism. the whole point of that story is just putting Draco in it.

- after the war fics that make Draco be a spy in the war just to redeem him. I don't like Draco, but... in canon, Harry was ok with forgiving him just like that. why can't we too. he doesn't need to be a martyr.

- Dursleys being more abusive than canon. they were actually pretty abusive in canon still. like, removing children from household and jail sententence abusive. they starved him.

- renamed characters. I really don't see any reason to do that.

- regendered characters. Harriet. ...

- veela/omega verse and such. or other Harry beings, ultra dark piruette bird person... or whatever they want to make him. a sphinx maybe. any incubuses (incubi?)... well, you know.

- weasley bashing. don't like that. I don't like Harry/Ginny pairing, but they can be always friends. esp. when all the family is being bashed, maybe except the twins. and of course, Ron was only his friend for the money.

- not getting side characters names correctly. how hard is it to google the names of the teachers, or some parents...

- mpreg, though tbh, HP universe is one of those universes that mpreg could be at least justified. don't like it still.

- stories that have nothing in common with canon. being it in muggle word where magic doesn't exist, or maybe in wizarding world but the character don't know each other and meet at a cafe. and the only thing related is their names. these are original stories disguised as fanfiction.

- characters having glaumors, and suddenly Harry has... red hair? what?

- OC's. when it's not told and you just realize after reading a lot about a random mary sue. why not write it in description.

- everyone is gay just for the sake of being gay. I do read slash. I only read slash actually. but if you read Drarry and then they just mention, in one sentence, yeah, Ginny married Luna and Neville is with Blaise blah, blah, without it being in the story or them being a side pairing (with a storyline), then why add it at all? the only pairing like that that I'm ok with is Dean/Seamus, because they are almost canon. I'm fine with multiple gay site pairings, but they need to be present and contrubute to the story.

- twins. Harry has a twin, Draco has a twin, Hermione has a twin. a twin for everybody! this is usually done if someone doesn't like slash and wants to make a gay pairing. almost like a gender bend, but not quite.
