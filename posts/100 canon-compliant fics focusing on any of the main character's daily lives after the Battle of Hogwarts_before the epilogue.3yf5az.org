I'm entirely sure this has been asked before, but I rarely ever read things that aren't thinly-veiled smut or romance-based (don't get me wrong, if the main focus of the fic you're recommending has elements of romance like Hermione/Ron, that's totally cool with me!), so I'd like to give canon couples a shot and this time period seemed like the most interesting.

Edit: Oops, typo in the title. Meant characters' not character's.


** Little0bird is my favorite for post-book fics. Its canon compliant to the 7th book since JKR released the family tree a bit too late. Start with The First Day

** I like 'These Cuts I Have' by Melindaleo - it's very canon and realistic up to a certain point where it rather lets itself down with a bit of a silly plot line. But certainly the first half of the story is very good, and has realistic reactions from the majority of the characters. I especially like the portrayal of Ron's grief - he becomes very overprotective, which I think would be quite likely in canon. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129968]]

** Well, there's /Dinner With the Weasleys./ The fic is set about a year after the war, during the summer following Luna and Ginny's graduation. It's told from Luna's perspective, and it's mostly just her musings on the Weasleys. And musings on Harry and Hermione and Dean. And musings on life in general.

There's not much in the way of plot, but for this fic, it doesn't really matter. This fic is like going to your grandparents' house for Sunday supper after church.
