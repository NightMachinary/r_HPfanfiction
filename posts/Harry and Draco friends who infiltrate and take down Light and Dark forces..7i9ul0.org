Looking for Harry and Draco in a secret friendship. I'm looking for them to fool Dumbledore/Voldemort into thinking they are their most loyal and second in commands before they turn on them and build a society in their own images. Looking for inspiration for a story I am writing. Thanks! (If a post like this exist please let me know because I searched and couldn't find something like this)
