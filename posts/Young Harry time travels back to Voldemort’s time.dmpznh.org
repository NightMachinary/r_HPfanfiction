Is there anything like 11 year old harry is thrown back in time without any “future knowledge” and inadvertently sets Tom Riddle down a different path by befriending him when they're both sorted into Slytherin?


** There are plenty of fics like that, though few without Harry having future knowledge.

!linkao3(19906510)

!linkffn(Riddles and Inquiries)

Neither of these have a Harry with future knowledge.

!linkffn(When Harry Met Tom)

!linkffn(Fire Born)

Both of these have a Harry with future knowledge. I'm just including them for completeness's sake

  When Harry and Voldemort died at each others hands, Harry awoke in an alley as a ten year old girl. Perplexed at this turn of events but not overly surprised, she is taken to Wool's Orphanage. Now known as Iris Black, she is roomed with Tom Riddle, who she decides to befriend because honestly, why not see how things unfold from the other side? It might be fun.

  Tom Riddle wasn't the only "different" one at Wool's Orphanage. He wasn't the only one who could do the things he could. He wasn't the only one who could speak with snakes. He wasn't the only one who got sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turned eleven. He wasn't the only one. The other one was none other than Harry Potter. (Fem!Harry AU)

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter
