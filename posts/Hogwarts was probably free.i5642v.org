So I'm writing a fic and in it Harry mentions a neighbor's son going off to college and having trouble finding a job to pay for his room/board and books. Originally I was going to say tuition, but apparently from the mid 1970's to the late 1990's there was no university tuition. That's not to say that nothing was to be paid for but it might explain why a family like the Weasleys are comfortable sending every single kid to what's essentially a private school. They still had to pay for their books and supplies but Hogwarts didn't really have them pay for room and board, so maybe that was rolled in as "tuition" and isn't something to pay for? It's two separate things where I go to school so I don't really know but it's interesting that it happened and lasted a good long while.


** It is. The ministry covers tuition.

** Canonical answer is it is free.

Of course, Canon had absolutely bonkers economics, so.

My personal headcannon is the wizarding world is a post-scarcity society. With Land and Food being essential free through magic.

This I call the 'heirloom' economy: There are rare goods (most magical artifacts are hand-crafted) and you might expect a wizard to create only a few of them in their life.

Thus 'rich' families are those who have multi-generations of magical artifacts, or having raided artifacts from others (clocks, wands, statues, whatever) built up, and 'poor' families only have what they themselves have built in the most recent generation. Thus being disowned (like Andromeda) is essentially banishment to poverty, all muggleborns are dirt-poor.

Those who are not creating new magic and the like (working for the Prophet, Ministry, etc) are paid to compensate for the fact they are not off building things that are worth value, but it is a small part of the economy. Rich families would have to sell artifacts to fund their needs.

While you could view Hogwarts as a traditional tax-and-provide education, through the lens of a heirloom economy, I'd like to think of it as a school based on philanthropy. Hogwarts is essentially itself super rich, with teachers 'paying' to teach there (by working at a the school for say a decade, and with the school retaining any magic you imbue into it, it is essentially increasing its wealth without the individual professors increasing their wealth.). Of course, in a post-scarcity world, it means people can afford to do something like that.

Any outside needs the school has would be met by philanthropy, giving the 'board of governors' power over the school (as they would buy the brooms, etc). But without needing to pay staff or for food or other basics, those costs would be minimal.

** Hogwarts is a state school. There are no fees.

This is however inconsistent as in UK state schools you don't have to buy your own textbooks, lab equipment (cauldron, ingredients, and telescope in the magical universe), or paper, so I can see why people may get confused.

Buying the uniform, your own pens and pencils (so quills), sporting equipment (broomstick) is consistent with the UK secondary school experience.

Tbh I think JK had them buying the books and cauldrons and that just to world build somewhat. It's a nice touch that to go off to wizard school, one must own a cauldron.

*** Wait a minute you didn't have to buy your own supplies either? That's so cool. That only applies to public schools where I live. Which are technically state-run schools but I have a really hard time imagining Hogwarts as anything other than a private school.

**** I mean, we had to buy our uniform and sports equipment - like tennis rackets and so on (but my dad worked in a gym so he just brought stuff home for me ðŸ˜…) and your schoolbag and your pens were your responsibility. But textbooks, notebooks, special lab equipment and so on, nah that was all provided by the school.

We had to pay for our dinner though, the one thing that seems to be free at Hogwarts! She's clearly got it backwards!

Hogwarts is absolutely based on private schools, that's really clear (or more likely based on the traditional "English boarding school novel"), but JKR has said both Hogwarts and St Mungo's are free at the point of use - which, when you consider she's a member of the Labour Party, is not surprising.

In fairness, it does explain how the Weaselys managed to put seven kids, five of them at any given time for many years, through the system on one persons wage. Some school provided textbooks would have been a blessing to Molly's budget, though.

** It even makes sense for it to be free - they only need to pay, what a dozen and a half salaries? Not that much. Everything else is cost free or relies on elves to do their work.

The ministry might have some sort of exchange of goods with muggle world or even be funded by muggle government, being technically a part of it, to have the cash for paying their employees and for Hogwarts

** Yes, as I've pointed out many times; Hogwarts is free, because its a direct parallel to the State Education System in the UK, though from a more English than Scottish perspective. How is this still a debate?

*** Honestly, there are holes in the canon worldbuilding big enough to drive a train through.

In this case, Economics and population size.

â€‹

A lot of fics go the route of "There are a lot more wizarding schools Hogwarts is just the best in the state". In that case, Hogwarts is an 'exclusive' school and there are two easy ways to make the school exclusive: Either you make it expensive (needing money and/or connections), or you have academic barriers (testing).

Usually the path that ends up down is "Expensive school + all muggleborns go to Hogwarts", thus justifying a larger wizarding world.

Plus there is the whole "Lets make wizards culturally backwards", which would lend to a more archaic funding system (ie, no progressive income tax).

My personal preference is a small wizarding world (ie, one that can survive on a yearly class size of 35-40, meaning a total British Wizarding Population of only a few thousand)

Anyway, I don't find this a problem. Filling in the holes in canon is kind of what fanfiction does, and while simply slapping tuition on the school to justify its exclusiveness is kinda lazy, eh.

*** Because it's a boarding school not a day school and boarding schools (even /state/ boarding schools which do exist) are not free. You can get scholarships to them, but that doesn't make them free.

*** It's not a debate. Everyone doesn't live in the UK. Private schools and colleges in particular have students pay tuition to attend. I previously classified it as a private school because of how the worldbuilding made it look and feel. Like something special. But if it's a state-run school then the rules of state-run schools in the UK apply. You probably get so many "debates" because of how schooling works in other countries because, again, everyone doesn't live in the UK.

**** I understand. My basis is that, from my own experience at private school in Scotland, Private schools in the UK have a very specific culture surrounding them, and Hogwarts shares next to none of that culture. To me it always made sense the Hogwarts was an Academy (State funded but with a lot more freedom from the government, with a board of governors), and was funded from taxes, especially if we accept the low population and accept that Hogwarts is the only school in Wizarding Britain, then it stands to reason that it could be funded by the State. Couple that with the dangerous nature of magic, Education seems more of a requirement than ever. It seems to be incredibly short sighted, even for an incompetent Ministry, to remove access to that education.
