What it says in the title


** I'm not sure if it's actually a romance or just UST, but linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by kathryn518) features the two.

*** Yeah the author has some really great ideas, but the pacing is tortuously slow with her stories, I don't think any have made it past 2 months despite their length. That story seems to be heading towards a harem fic I believe, though at this rate it will be years before we find out.

It'll be abandoned before that. Current updates are at least 6 months apart.

*** There's no romance in it. In fact, there's not really anything. It's just Harry going around, collecting all the interesting females to his "crew". Like as soon as one gets acclimated, the next one shows up. First, it's Ahsoka Tano, then Aayla Secura, then Shaak-Ti, the Asaaj Ventress, then Fay (and I didn't even know who that was until I looked on the wiki). If there's any actual romance, it's such a slow burn that it's going in reverse and it's impossible to invest in it, since it'll inevitably turn into a harem anyways. There is a very slight hint that something may happen, but it's really hard to decipher it from all the lechery that Harry displays constantly. And, the only wanking that is done is power wanking.

**** God, the first part of that story seemed so promising, then we got to Kashyyyk and everything promising about it died. If it just stayed with archeologist!Harry and Ahsoka going on adventures it would've been amazing.

Edit: Apparently I was kinda combining /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ & /Equilibrium/.

****** It's been so long since I read either of those that I somehow combined them into one story in my memory.

I suspect that I can blame the slow update schedule, I probably forgot the first part of /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ and remembered /Equilibrium/ as the Coruscant part instead.

Definitely would explain why I remember thinking the quality dropped an absurd amount, as /Equilibrium/ had way higher quality than /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
