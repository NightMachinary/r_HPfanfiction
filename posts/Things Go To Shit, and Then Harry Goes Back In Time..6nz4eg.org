** Most time travel fics I end up wishing for exactly this. The interesting part isn't actually the how of fixing anything, but the why and where things go to shit.

** I tried to do something similar in my own - notably worse than whatever good shit you're reading - work, and I only get to the time-travel at chapter seven, which is about 21,000 words in. I didn't have a full progression of time like you suggested, however, and picked up only a few days before Harry ends up going back, with a fair few flashbacks inserted and some narration-y stuff to explain where it deviates from canon in this future-timeline, as well as show off some of that good ol' fashioned cruelty from team Voldemort.

Unfortunately, it seemed that many of the people who read my story thought I was taking way too long to actually get to the time-travel, and although I could've written more future stuff I found myself agreeing when I took a step back and had a long look at it.

For me, the character of Harry isn't fully-formed from the events in the future. Instead, he's now in the past, trying desperately to remain below the radar at Hogwarts until he can exonerate Sirius (in my story he returns to the summer after second year) and begin his hunt for the Horcruxes. At the same time, he's stuck surrounded by people that he's seen die, or people who ended up on the other side, and is in some seriously bad head-space right now, not helped by the appearance (and subsequent discussions with) a hallucinated relic of the future that won't leave him alone.

The main character arc for Harry is yet to really happen, but when it does he's gonna get let off the chain, /big time/.

**** Thanks for expressing interest - I'm always nervous about promoting it because I keep finding better stuff that makes me feel bad, but I've posted it on fanfiction.

linkffn(12220797)

It's currently at about 94,000 words, and is still very much in progress and being currently worked on - at the moment I'm updating about once every three weeks (3,000 word chapters on average), but it fluctuates based on how quickly inspiration comes to me, or when I'm writing a difficult scene and being a perfectionist about it. It's my first story, so I don't know if you'll find anything you like, but if you want to take the time to give it a look, be my guest!

#+begin_quote
  Time travel, AU. When all that Harry Potter ever loved is taken from him, when he cannot fight alone against the tide of Voldemort's evil, he has to take his one last chance. A lonely, damaged Harry returns to his past, in order to save his future. Rated M for violence, death and trauma. Will eventually include Harry/Ginny.

** linkffn(9474009) Is a bit like this, although it starts with Harry being back in the past, it shows via pensieve memories exactly how things went to hell. About half the fic is of the former future. Of course the other half is kind of crap, but hey, can't have everything :P

** The closest fic I can think of would be Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8639269/11/Harry-Potter-the-Ritual-of-Merlin-s-Choice]]).\\
I haven't finished it yet, but I'm at chapter 11 (close to the half) and no time travel yet. Instead, we see why Harry is trying to get back, and trying to reach the time travel device.\\
It's an interesting fic so far.\\
Begins during the battle of Hogwarts.

  What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone? What if Harry decided that such an outcome was unacceptable and set out to change things, to re-write the prophesy that had always defined his life? WARNING: not JUST about time-travel.

** I like this premise. I'd add to it and say once Kingsley goes back in time Harry should be the main character again. I think this would be really funny from Harry's point of view. Harry has a trial in front of the whole wizengamot and guess what, the day before the minister for magic disappears. Dolores Umbridge comes to Hogwarts to cause trouble and the next day no one can find her. So we as the reader know that Kingsley is in the past but we only see the story play out from Harry's confused point of view. Of course Kingsley has to throw in a prank or two, maybe leave behind some confusing notes just to mess with Harry and his friends.

** For me, time travel is the ultimate deux ex machina or the cheat code. It gives protagonists too great an advantage. (I don't bother with fics that try to maintain the 'timeline')

I prefer dimensional travels that pitch 'very good' worlds vs 'very bad' ones. A better one vs the Canon world is also acceptable. An AU Dramione taking down the Canon Draco should be fun, Tom Riddle vs Voldemort can be great, but there are hardly any good, finished fics here. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is the only one I could think of.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
