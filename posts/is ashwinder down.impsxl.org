** Go to the [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][homepage]] and check the message about "Spam Issues and Accounts" for how to finish getting access.

This has, unfortunately, been an issue for a long time. If you know any web devs who specialize in updating defunct CMS frameworks and/or dealing with the spam issues around sending automated emails with PHP, please consider having them contact the Sycophant Hex admins.
