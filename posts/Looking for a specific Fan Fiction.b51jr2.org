I'm looking for a specific fan fiction whose title I don't remember and I hope you can help me. In this story Harry, as Death Master, begins another life in another universe at his death. In the passage, however, he loses the memory of the actions he has carried out, the people he has met, but can bring with him either the knowledge or a particular power he has learned in the course of each life. In this fan fiction he had accumulated a huge number of lives and started another. This is Harry going to live with Sirius, but he is a Sirius very different from the canon because he is more cynical and paranoid. Physically Harry is tall, thin, has Lily's green eyes, but blond hair (like Petunia). At Hogwarts he is sorted into Slytherin and excels in all school subjects, causing a conflict with (I believe Ravenclaw, but I don't know if I remember correctly) Hermione. He starts to found his small circle of followers and in a few months they destroy all the Horcruxes and the spirit of Voldemort (I think, but I don't know if I remember correctly) Harry absorbs the magic and the knowledge and some dark secret of Dumbledore. The school continues as if nothing had happened, while Harry begins to study a plan to eliminate the non-magical population from the planet. Jul


** Honestly that sounds like an epic fic and I think I might be able to find it. What'd you read it on? Like ffn or ao3 or something else?
