** *TLDR: If you like reading fanfiction about Pureblood politics but are tired of the usual players, then this might be for you.*

I just finished reading 10 chapters of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27581501?view_full_work=true][Toujours Pour]], a crossover with the anime & manga [[https://youtu.be/9du5oHqrWwA]['Moriarty the Patriot.']] This, in turn, is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories but the protagonist this time is Holmes' nemesis, Moriarty.

An understanding of the anime's premise is needed to get Toujours Pour. The main character is William James Moriarty, professor of mathematics and crime consultant. His two main supporters are his brothers Albert James (older, adoptive) and Louis James (younger, biological). Collectively, they are known as 'James Moriarty,' the antagonist in the original Holmes books. Their goal is to destroy the unjust class system in Victorian England, where the rich nobles can get away with oppressing the poor commoners. The Moriartys do this by planning crimes on the nobles that would expose their depravity, hoping that the ensuing scandals would disgust and awaken the masses so that they would revolt against the upper class and thus change society. They're very good at what they do so the crimes are never traced back to them. The ironic thing is that the Moriarty family is part of the nobility.*

Now take this premise into the Harry Potter world, where the Moriartys' vendetta is against the purebloods who stifle progress in the wizarding world. The characters, whose backgrounds have been tweaked a bit, are placed at the time of Voldemort's first rise. We then watch William and his brothers scheme and try to change the world, with the Harry Potter characters as people in the background. Will they succeed?

To be honest, the fanfic is not stellar--there are spelling and grammatical mistakes. The dialogues can get too wordy because the author was trying too hard to make readers see that William Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes were geniuses. The first chapter was a bit of a mess but the later chapters got better. Readers should treat the 'chapters' of this story as a series of related one shots because they definitely aren't arranged in chronological order. I overlooked these small nuisances because I was after the unique ideas presented in the story. Some gems were found, like the conversation between William and Albus Dumbledore.

The author has read the manga so s/he has more knowledge about the Moriartys' plans that haven't been covered yet in the anime and these schemes were incorporated into the story. It was interesting to see how s/he blended the two worlds together.

So there, if you like reading political Harry Potter fanfiction with a twist then this might be for you.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13766542/1/The-Perplexities-of-Strange-Pretenses][Perplexities of Strange Pretenses]]: Growing up is never easy, especially during those awkward moments when your Yule Ball date would step all over your feet during the slow dance or when you're now forever in debt to your brother for naming their owl "Pigwidgeon." Throw in a few nargles, a sadistic DADA teacher, a Dark Lord on the rise, and you have Ginny's very perplexing account of the year 1995.

This fic is pretty new, but it seems to have potential. The quality of writing is high and it seems interesting so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7183762/1/The-Ones-Left-Behind][The Ones Left Behind]]: Sirius wasn't looking for a new best friend, but James was now spending all his time with his new girlfriend. Sirius was the one left behind, and I was the one he found. And neither of us expected what we found in each other. JamesXLily SiriusXOC

A classic. And don't be scared by the OC tag; this has lovely characterization. If you're interested in the Marauders era, this is the one for you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3730491/1/Three-Deaths][Three Deaths]]: What if Harry, Ron, or Hermione had died at the end of the Harry Potter series? Three scenarios are presented for each death. A tongue in cheek, alternate ending for the saga.

Another classic. Short, hilarious, and sweet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5498748/1/Simply-Irresistible][Simply Irresistible]]: Draco gave a cocky grin. "I am going to give you a makeover." "I'm sorry what?" "You heard me Granger, I'm going to give you a makeover that will make every man want you,and make Weasley die of regret. You will be simply irresistible."

Even though I really like Ron and don't actually ship Draco and Hermione, this fanfic is simply iconic. A classic feel good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

This is incredible. Amazing characterization and wonderful descriptions as well.

Well, that's all I have so far. Hope you enjoy!

******* Well, this isn't "Harry but female"; she's basically an original character. Both her parents are alive and well, and she grew up in a society that officially excludes Muggle-borns from many types of employment (because Riddle launched a political party instead of a war). So she's a /very/ different person from canon.

Actually, the whole thing feels like a new story that merely takes some inspiration from canon elements. The fact that Harry is female is only one part of the changes; what she really has to hide is her blood status.

Just finished Too Many Champions, and I loved it!\\
I can recommend it to everyone that likes some nice comedy.

Currently, I am reading Silver King and A Flower for the Soul since they update quite often, every 2-3 days or so. Both are quite nice.

Put Harry Potter and the Artificer Legacy here as well since I finished it 2 days ago. Quite the nice story.

They bond over their respective grief of losing their only relatives (not counting the Dursley here). The story flows nicely and is still in the early stages where the characters are getting established. The author does a good job making Harry and Susan a believable couple, which I think will pay off later in the story. linkffn(13736378)

** *Title*: Chasing Snowflakes\\
*Author*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]]\\
*Rating*: T\\
*Link*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13777689/1/Chasing-Snowflakes]]

*Summary*\\
Harry gradually falls in love with a fellow Gryffindor Quidditch player.

*The Good*\\
Okay, I'm biased. I beta this story and I love it. TE7 and I threw ideas around for a while but he's taken all that and turned it into something brilliant as ever. It's a character-fic, a slice-of-life fic, albeit one with several slices at different times, and it shows how romances should be written. There's no "Oh wow! Did I just think of X as beautiful?" idiocy here; it's a gradual build up where two people fall in love. The third chapter in particular is one of the finest things I think I've seen in fanfiction.

There are some genuinely funny moments, some incredibly touching moments, and in general if the story doesn't make you want to hug something then you're pretty much dead already.

*The Bad*\\
I missed a couple of spelling mistakes when beta-reading it. My bad.

*Verdict*\\
It's brilliant.

There was a potential stopping point after ch3 but I think I talked him out of it. Of course that means I get to miss more spelling mistakes for people to complain about.

Sirius Black and the Goblet of Fire. Sequel to Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

I'm loving this!! Loving this more than the Remus Lupin story which was brilliant. We're jumping viewpoints a little more. There's a bit more background into Lupin dealing with the Ministry after his episode at Hogwarts and Changing infront of the trio. Sirius is still on the run and can't get a hold of Harry. There's flashbacks to Marauder Era. Everyone is still very mad at Peter.

High recommend!!

** I am reading "Partially Kissed Hero"

Sorry for the wrong link!

Written well, but very drastic changes to Harry in the course of a few months. He's very eager to learn, and almost seems like a rewritten Hermione. Nevertheless, I'm enjoying it so far. I don't see any Ron-bashing yet, which is a breath of fresh air from the heavy bashing I often see of the Weasleys (except Fred and George).

It starts from Prisoner of Azkaban, and that's about all I could tell you!

** I just finished reading linkffn(The Return of the Marauders by TheLastZion)

It was a cool premise, kind of outlandish though. Harry is OP and just really extra as a person in general. The writing was difficult/tedious (in my opinion) to get through due to the author consistently mis-using words, being incredibly repetitive with their descriptions throughout the entire story, and occasionally seeming to get their tenses mixed up. Sometimes I found myself mentally saying "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

It was still an interesting idea. If you plan to give this one a try, keep in mind it is very AU and the characters are very OOC.

** I just finished reading Harry Potter and a Galaxy Far Far Away by kossboss. It's a crossover with Star Wars. In which, Harry winds up absorbing Voldemort's memories via the scar horcrux and basilisk venom. He then promptly decides to plan his escape from the war. He gathers supplies, knowledge, house elves, etc. , and then jumps through the veil of death only to wind up on the desserts of Tatooine.

It's not exactly an action thriller, or even that romantic (if you're into the social aspect of these stories), but the world building is incredible. Expect a lot of breaking down of the magic used/ force abilities, and long long paragraphs just explaining Harry's latest invention in technobabble.

This is actually fairly common for kossboss. He has two other serious crossovers with the same premise, and a third he left as a one shot that I really enjoyed too.

The other crossovers were set in the ASIOF and SGU universes. Whereas, the one shot was an HP AU universe.

I'd recommend any of these stories of you're interested in a world building kind of fanfic. Kossboss is definitely one of my favorites on that front (just behind vimesenthusiast).

** Just finished what has been written of linkffn(Too Far From Home) By far one of the better dimensional travel fics in the fandom. Stages of Hope comes close but those characters are simply too broken to be engaging. The characters in this story are both realistic and emotionally engaging. Almost canon perfect characterization for most characters. An OC sister who is likable despite her flaws and the only Dumbledore in the fandom who is actually manipulative and pragmatic instead of following some tropes and being incompetent at it. Gets a bit too dark at the end. Hope it updates soon.

Linkffn(Paradox) For a less darker Dimension travel fic. Complex plot with an original AU interacting with canonverse.

Read everything by NauticalParamour starting with linkffn(Red Right Hand by NauticalParamour). All of them have very interesting premises with very similar but competent execution. Good for some casual side reading.

Plot was zippy and moved along briskly with lots of interesting twists and turns and surprises. The story has very little of stupid/dark characters doing stupid/dark things. The story has a nice maturity and is mostly Light and little Dark, and focused mostly on positive believable characters doing positive things (which is my fav kind of story). Harry has a nice character arc. Definitely recommended.

** Well, at the risk of sounding like an entitled dickhead, there's been a disappointing lack of updates of most of my favourite fics. Still, I figure why not make a slightlier meatier post about what I'm reading lately:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][Loose Cannon]]: An overheard joke means Harry changes careers to quidditch. This is a great post-book AU, with a completely transformed Harry. Yes, at this point he's out of character really, but so much of the transition makes sense. It allowed me to look past the constantly getting laid bit, because again, it makes sense in this fic. The world is wonderfully crafted, and it's a world in which Quidditch is well-written, Harry makes friends, makes love, makes money, and acts to transorm the most noable etc House of Black out of love for his godfather (although I am getting irritated with old pureblood traditions that make no sense being respected). What this author captures especially well is the move into adulthood, and how old school rivalries can seem quite petty when you turn 19. Give this a chance even if it isn't usually your bag! linkffn(13452914)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13694344/1/No-Fate][No Fate]]: I love this guy's writing style, having absolutely adored Ghost of Privet Drive, and this is another fun one. Allegedly it will be a timetravel fic eventually but we're still building up to that. The general premise is that Harry was obliviated of all knowledge of the magical world and sent to live as a muggle. So he goes to the military... It's not "muggle wank" as such, but it explores some of the fun concepts that wizards and witches simply do not pay attention to. Also loved what they did for Dobby! Highly recommended, funny and action-packed, and even a little tragic. Very cool for those who want a fic that is very British. linkffn(13694344)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12963901/1/Cursed-Be-this-Soul-that-Ties-Us-Together][Cursed be this soul (that ties us together)]]: Kneazle writes fun crossovers, and in this case an older Hermione and Teddy end up in the world of a game of thrones. Also, Ned Stark is her soulmate. Having Teddy in there gives the story a different dynamic than the Winter Witch, also because it begins before the big war. I'm excited to see where they take this. linkffn(12963901)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13644134/1/The-Black-Family-s-PR-Nightmare][The Black Family's PR Nightmare]]: I'm getting a bit tired of this fic but I hope it picks up again. It's quite a fun fic about a Black who takes over the family immediately after Harry's parents get killed, and tries to improve their image. linkffn(13644134)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][Shadow of Angmar:]] Hardly unkown in these parts, easily the best harry potter x lord of the rings crossover, and one of the best fics I've ever read full stop. linkffn(11115934)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12830596/1/Yesterday-is-Tomorrow-Everything-is-Connected][Yesterday is tomorrow (everything is connected)]]: Kneazle again, Hermione timetravel reincarnation, tries to lay low but eventually becomes entangled in the world of marauders and gets the attention of one james potter... linkffn(12830596)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young with Me]]: if you don't know this fic yet, just read it. If you think you won't like it, give it a go anyway. I promise you there is a very high chance you'll like it. Muggle waitress falls for widower-who-hangs-out-at-her-cafe Harry Potter. Being introduced to magic etc has to wait... she has to get his attention, and he has to realise what is going on. Very well written, loving depiction of the characters, everyone makes sense and shows real human ways of reacting to situations. The levels of bullshit here are spectacularly low, whereas there is so much to love and enjoy. Like I said, even if you don't normally go for romance, give this a go. You might well cheer when they kiss. linkffn(11111990)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves most fabulous]]: absolutely hilarious HP X Lord of the Rings crossover. If you have even a hint of knowledge of Tolkien's world, you'll love this and potentially howl with laughter. linkffn(11120132)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12588838/1/Poisoned-Apple][Poisoned Apple]]: Hermione's parents are terrified of her when she shows accidental magic. She gets sent to an insitution... and horrible things happen. She misses Hogwarts completely, and is thrust into a world where magical society lives parallel to the Avengers' world. A very dark, but very cool take on a HP x Avengers crossover. linkffn(12588838)

Hello my name is alastor moody. You get that wrong, prepare to die: What can I say about this. Man, I absolutely loved it. Moody is trans, and this chronicles his life dealing with that, with rather a lot of humour added to the mix. Give it a go! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17516828]]

Howl: Warning, Molly and Ron bashing abound, but it serves a purpose. Molly sends Hermione a howler, changing the course of the Harry Potter world. I enjoyed this, and it's done in nice big meaty chapters. Enjoy: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18633070]]

Of Clones and Wizards: rapidly becoming one of my absolute favourite star wars crossovers, Harry is thrust into the world of the Clone Wars. Wary of giving a kid away who saved their lives, a Clone unit watches over him as he attempts to make sense of the world around him, first of all by learning the language, and then more as he discovers he was not the only one who joined the Star Wars universe. Goes in very unexpected directions for me, but that keeps me on my toes while reading. Enjoy! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25133773/chapters/60896737]]

*** I'll second No Fate wholeheartedly. It's probably the fic I've been looking forward to updating the most recently. I'm a little worried about how well the story will go once the time travel actually happens but I've loved everything about it so far.

**** One of my theories is that there won't be any timetravel, or if there is it will not go well/will be at the very end and quite short.
