Even though he's duller than dishwater in the books, I've always liked Percy. I was wondering if there are any good fics about him?

I've read Percy take the wheel, mr and mrs Percy Weasley, and then one fic where he makes an appearance as a yogi seer.

I like long fics, that are moderately fluffy, or humorous. I'm not a big fan of the bashing that seems to happen when people don't like characters. Anyways! Thank you in advance! :)


** Search for Percy in the search bar, I remember a post in the last 2 months where there were several links to some great Percy centric fics. One I remember specifically was detailing his unknown role in the 2nd war secreting muggleborns away from the snatchers.

Linkao3(Percy Take the Wheel) -- It's not complete yet, and it does get sad, but it's such an interesting take on Percy and the Weasley family identity. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) has been technically Harmony story, but Harry/Hermione relationship was so boring (as it is in many Harmony stories), that readers in review were quite excited with Percy and his growing relationship with XXXX NO SPOILERS! Thus the author wrote now openly Percy-centric version of the story as linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities), which is really good.
