I saw this [[https://vinkunwildflowerqueen.tumblr.com/post/168056958312/wingedcorgi-anyway-remus-straight-up-researched][cartoon]] on Tumblr today the beginning got me thinking: Are there fics where Lupin and Snape do put their past behind them during PoA?

I would just be interested to see how that would change PoA and beyond.

** Stages of Hope, it has Lily Marrying Lupin, and Sirius and Snape are best friends. It's a great story, and the relationships between the characters is really nice.
