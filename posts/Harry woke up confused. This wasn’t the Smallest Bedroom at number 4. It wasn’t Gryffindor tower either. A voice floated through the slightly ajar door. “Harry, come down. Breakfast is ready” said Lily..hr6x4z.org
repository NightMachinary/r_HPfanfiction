*** There are at least two that have Harry replacing/joining his AU self with a loving family like that, but in both cases the family was estranged from Harry. (In one, they try to capture him when he shows up. In another, I think he gets sent to Azkaban, as Voldemort's chief enforcer).

**** There's also one (explicit with a Harry/Draco pairing) where, as a result of no Voldy, his AU self grew up a privileged rich asshole. So his family is estranged from him because he's difficult to be around. Harry deals with incredible guilt because his family doesn't want "their Harry" back.

  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.

** Harry hesitantly descended the stairs, his strange, pale wand in hand.

"Harry, it's going to get cold!" the voice said again, and Harry's heart skipped a bit.

That sounded like his mother, the same voice he heard at the graveyard, but it was different, alive, happy, and...a tad impatient.

He navigated the unknown but strangely familiar house, it was big, bigger than Privet Drive, and more spacious than the Burrow, but it was cozy and had a homely feel to it he hadn't found anywhere else.

Was this a dream? An illusion? A trick from Voldemort? But it didn't feel like it, it felt real, and Harry felt completely at home.

He followed the voice(and the delicious smell) through a large corridor until he reached the kitchen, it was...lovely, soft colors, homely appliances, but all that was forgotten when he saw his mother, his alive mother.

Beautiful red hair and green eyes just as his, and oh so alive that Harry felt his eyes tearing up.

Lily looked at her son for a moment, noticing the wand "You ok, sweetie? Why the wand?" she frowned "Did Sirius did something? I told him no spells on your room, next time I'm gonna-Oof!" she was interrupted when Harry barrelled into her and embraced her, feeling her touch and smelling her hair, it was a familiar smell, one he hadn't felt in thirteen years, he couldn't stop his tears from coming out.

Lily hugged her son back, surprised, Harry had stopped being so touchy after going into his teens, especially after going to Hogwarts, and only hugged her when distressed, or very happy.

"Sweetie? Harry? Are you alright?" she lightly pushed him back and framed his face with her hands, eyes widening at seeing the tears and quickly brushing them off. "What's wrong Harry? Why are you crying?"

Harry had always been good at thinking quick, even when under pressure, so at that moment, he decided, illusion or no, he was going to jump headfirst into this.

"It was just a...nightmare mum, a bad dream." he hugged her again "But I'm better now, especially with you here."

Lily squeezed her boy a bit harder, filing this under hormones, apparently, Harry was a bit more sensitive than she thought, which made her happy; she had always thought he needed to hug people more!

"That's good to hear, Harry. I will /always/ be here for you." she kissed his cheeks and caressed his hair, unknowingly making him happier than almost any other time he remembered.

She directed him to breakfast, porridge, sausages, and eggs, which were delicious, he kept stealing glances at her, as if to see if she was still there.

Lily laughed, a musical sound Harry wanted to hear more, "What's all this Harry? Nervous about your /date/?"

Harry flushed, why was he blushing? He didn't even know with whom it was! Or if his mother(!) was just teasing him.

He decided to wing it, "About that? Nah, I'm going to..." he remembered something he once heard Seamus saying in the dorms "rock her world." he smiled.

Lily looked surprised, before chuckling, "Well, don't let Sirius hear that, or he will probably jinx you for real!"

Sirius? What Sirius had to to with this?

His line of questioning was interrupted by a chime from the fireplace(that he just noticed was in the fairly big kitchen) and with green flash, James Potter came out of the Floo.

Harry gaped at his father, he was wearing the red robes of an Auror and he had that same grin of the photos in his Album, only with mischievousness instead of arrogance, his eyes lit up at seeing his wife and child.

"Ah, Good Morning, everyone! Or Good Night for me." he proceeded to ruffle Harry's hair and kiss Lily in the lips, before waving his wand and making his robes fly to a nearby hanger.

"Good shift, James?"

"Eh, the usual, Mundungus was at it again, some drunks playing with muggles, nothing me and Tonks couldn't deal with."

Harry smiled at his father, so he was an Auror? He liked that.

James looked at his son, finding him a little bit pale. "You okay there, Harry? Looking a bit peaked."

Harry smiled and decided to go with his story, "Nightmares...Dad." he was very proud of himself for not choking at the word.

James raised an eyebrow, "Nightmares? You haven't bought into that crap Pads were telling you, right? I think you are the only boy he will let near Cassie without cursing them, well..." he placed a hand on his chin, as if in thought, "depends on how near, you do know the right charms, don't you?"

Harry flushed as red as his mother's hair, just as she thundered "James Fleamont Potter!"

Now, Harry wasn't known for his deductive mind, but combining what he heard about Sirius, and this girl, Cassie(Cassandra?) he had a good guess of just who this date was with.

He had no idea how to feel about that, so he decided to continue riding this wave of what was probably shock he was having now.

Lily was continuing though, "Harry is a gentleman unlike /you/, at his age." she looked at her son again, as if to gauge his intentions, "And this is just them knowing each other, perfectly normal for their age."

James just snorted before ruffling his son's hair again and giving Lily another peck on the lips, "I'm going to catch a nap, honey, I ate before leaving the Department, Amelia gave us the day off tomorrow, so we'll do something fun." he stopped at the entrance and grinned at Harry, "or visit Harry at St. Mungus." he left before the stinging hex could hit him.

Lily huffed good-naturedly, reminding Harry of Hermione, he wondered where she was, "Don't pay attention to him, Harry, just be yourself," she winced "perhaps with a little less Quidditch."

Far too soon, his mother left to go to Diagon Alley, apparently to buy ingredients for something, refusing Harry's help by saying he looked like he could use more sleep.

Left by himself, Harry decided to explore the house, his house, where he lived, with /his parents,/ it was probably a dream, but Harry just went with it and decided to enjoy it to the fullest.

The house was big, and lived in, and Harry smiled and teared up at every piece of a true family life he saw in it, photos of a much younger him with his parents, flying a broom, on a zoo, with two people he guessed were his grandparents, he stopped at a photo with a bigger group of people.

He recognized them, but they were looking so much better, first was Sirius, healthy, hale, and smiling, his eyes alight in a way Harry had never seen them, he had a beautiful woman with brown hair by his side that Harry didn't recognize, and his hands on the shoulders of a smiling girl with hair as black as his, and eyes a silver-blue. Harry guessed this was Cassie.

On his side where Harry and his parents, in similar positions to the other couple, on their side, was Remus, looking much healthier and happier than Harry had ever seen him.

He noticed the distinct lack of Peter Pettigrew, what had happened with him?

"There were only three Marauders here."

Harry quickly turned back, and pointed his wand in the direction of the voice while stepping to the side.

*** The person raised an eyebrow, "Nice reflexes." they replied in a distinctly feminine voice, and Harry took their appearance him. Her appearance. A woman, with pale porcelain skin, beautiful facial features and long hair that looked blacker than his own.

She was wearing muggle clothing, black pants, and a sleeveless shirt, but what called his attention was her necklace, it had the Egyptian symbol for Life, an Ankh if he remembered...something...right.

"Pleasure meeting you, Harry." she smiled at him and Harry felt an odd sense of comfort, "Do you like this place?" she gestured lightly at their surroundings, "I thought you would." her smiled widened at the suspicious expression on his face, "It's real, all of it, a different universe, I guess you already noticed some of the differences." she pointed at the picture.

"Who-"

"An Old Friend." And somehow, Harry believed her.

Harry took a deep breath, having a very hard time believing this, but hoping against hope.

"Oh, don't worry, you will struggle a bit with the differences, but tomorrow morning. For today I've...helped you calm yourself a little, just so you wouldn't scare your mother."

Harry looked at her, she too was familiar, but in a strange, more primal way.

Unbothered by his scrutiny, the woman smiled, "Don't worry Harry, you won't see me again in a long, long time." she gestured again around them, "this is my gift to you, a universe where you won't have to worry, you will have your family, friends and even find love."

Harry thought this was too good to be true, "How long will this last?"

"For me, just a moment. For you, more than a lifetime."

"I don't understand."

"You will return to your other life when this one is finished, and after doing what you must, you may go wherever your heart desires."

Harry frowned, "You said I won't have to worry. What about Voldemort?"

She grinned, "He's still skulking around, but he's not your problem, have you checked your forehead?"

Harry did so with his hand, and almost in a daze, looked at the picture of himself, seeing the utter lack of a scar.

"H-How?" he asked in a whisper.

"Without Pettigrew here, a lot of things changed, you were born a year earlier and Tom Riddle never attacked your family on that fateful Halloween night."

Harry nodded, for some reason he believed the woman, but still..."Then who?"

She gave him a sad smile, "Young Neville Longbottom had to grow up without his parents, with a scar on his forehead and a burden on his shoulders, he's supposed to be Riddle's foil here."

Harry's knees wobbled "Neville?" he said faintly, remembering the quiet, loyal boy from the D.A., who followed him into the Ministry, he couldn't imagine another having the burden of the prophecy, but if what his "Old Friend" was saying was the truth then...

"I see you've already figured it out, you are free from the prophecy here, Harry Potter. This is the year of the Tri-Wizard tournament, where many fates intertwine and change, but yours is freer than most." she gestured with her hand and many tendrils of silvery light formed, dancing in the air.

"Here you will have the choice of staying out of it, of having a normal life, even with your father's profession, you can choose if you will involve yourself or not, unlike in your other life, the choice is yours."

"But, Voldemort..."

She shrugged, "Not your problem, unless you make him."

Harry was floored, he had to support himself on the wall to not fall. An entirely different world, and he wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived, he had a family.

"Makes you think, huh? Now for today, you have a date with the lovely Cassiopeia Andromeda Black, Sirius's daughter, be on your best behavior, don't worry, she likes you and you will gradually regain your memories from here." she looked at him in mirth, "I think you will find them most fun."

A /date/, she had just told him all those things and now she was talking about /dates/?

"You have to sort out your priorities, Harry." Harry looked back at her just in time to see her smile widely.

"I think this is where we part ways, some final tips then: Some people here are /very/ different from the ones you know, for good or bad. My Cloak will be most useful for you, ask your father for it, he will deem you old enough to use it now, and last but not least." she waved at him, "Do try to have fun before playing hero, and the photo to your left will explain a few things."

The woman then vanished, not with an apparition, or a portkey, she was just there one moment and then she wasn't.

Harry looked at the picture she indicated and promptly dropped it back on the table. In it, he was raising the Quidditch Cup, he looked thirteen and very proud and happy.

And his uniform was green and silver.

I can't say if that's true or not, but I do know that there's a difference between casual conversations (usually those between friends and family members) and formal conversations (job interviews, court appearances, and the like) with the casual ones being much more relaxed, and therefore more prone to the use of contractions and slang than the latter. On the few instances where contractions aren't used in a casual setting, it's either the person speaking using it as a way to give themselves time to think up a responce, or as a way to create emphasis on what they're saying.

If this gets enough traction, I may expand(until after the date) and post this on my ffnet account, I am already writing 3 other stories, so I may store this one on the 'write later' category.

I imagined Sirius' daughter as kind of Tonk-ish in that she doesn't conform to standards and likes to cause some mayhem in school, while being chastised by her extended family(many of the Blacks are still alive)

He ran to the nearest street he could find and held out his wand hand. With a bang, the Knight Bus appeared.

"Where to, Harry?" said Sirius, from the driver seat.

"M-M-Ministry of Magic," stammered Harry.

Harry didn't know how he did it, but he got to the Ministry of Magic, made his way to the Department of Mysteries, and jumped into The Veil again.

The fics where he replaces a version of himself also open up a whole can of worms because could you fuck over a version of yourself to have the better version of your life knowing full well what you've gone through...like even if the happier timeline Harry is a dick he still has to deal with the loss of his friends and timeline and like everything familiar all at once AND the death of his parents.
