I kind of really want to read like, a good fic where Harry's in a mental hospital, if there is one. (Has anybody ever read A splitting of the mind? It's an MCR fanfic but I'm really hoping for something at least a tiny bit similar to that) I want to write one myself but I don't know anything about mental hospitals and I don't want to get things wrong and possibly offend anyone

But if you know any fics like that please drop the link ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸŒŸ

*** Second or third time I've seen that comment, and the last I remember was him getting ready to go back to Hogwarts. Is that something I should go back to?

**** Up to you. I've never finished it, so I don't really know. The vampires were just a bit weird to me.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?
