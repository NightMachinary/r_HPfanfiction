*** Or simply have the first war end roughly a year later and have the prophecy be about the seventh magical child born to the seventh magical child or some other such thing and imply Arthur had seven siblings as well.

Sorry op I haven't seen anything like that but it'd be interesting to see, especially how the fame could effect her family etc
