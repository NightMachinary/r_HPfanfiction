Can be set in any era, any length works, though I'd prefer it to be longer.

Only requirement is that it isn't set in Hogwarts. Thanks in advance


** It's not a school JKR came up with, but it's a non-Hogwarts school all the same.

  When Harry is badly treated at Hogwarts the Dursleys see the light and take him to a wizarding school in Australia, far away from Britain. But with Dumbledore and Voldemort lurking around, will he be able to live there in peace? Warning: Some OOC

** [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=79611][Marissa and the Wizards]] is a really good, but incomplete, fic starring an OC at Castelobruxo.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is set in a non-canon version of Wizarding America that's frankly a lot more subtle and fleshed-out than Rowling's. There are five complete books and the sixth is in progress.

The author of Alexandra Quick has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/America_in_the_Potterverse/55015/][C2 dedicated to Wizarding America stories]], but he hasn't updated it since 2016.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
