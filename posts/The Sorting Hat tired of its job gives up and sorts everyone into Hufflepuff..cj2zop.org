Harry's year of course.


** "Fuck you, hat," said McGonagall. "You know Albus is going to make me sort them into Gryffindor Hufflepuffs, Slytherin Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaw Hufflepuffs, and Hufflepuff Hufflepuffs, right?"

The hat laughed.

*** Ron's own year is funnier. He still hates Slytherins and stops trusting anyone. Turns into a remake of the Black White Supremacist skit from the Dave Chappelle Show.

**** In some ways i'd agree that having all of Harry's year go into Slytherin would be funnier, Ron distrusting everyone (maybe including himself) Dumbledore worried that tom is doing something to turn all the students "dark", and Snape slowly going insane as he tries to manage all these children, a lot of which hate each other.

The hufflepuff variant popped into mind first and felt more compelling to me so I went with it.

***** When Harry went into slytherin I was worried because he seemed to be an ok sort

now that I am slytherin I am freaking out, and worried I have no judge of character

snape would be partially happy as there is no way they could lose the house cup for seven years

** Alternate Idea : Due to poor test scores the past few years,The Hat thinks the kids need an environment that fosters learning and puts them all in Ravenclaw

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
