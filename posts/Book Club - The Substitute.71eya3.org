What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/][The Substitute]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/][The Unforgiving Minute]]* by /Voice of the Nephilim/. I think it is a must-read adventure fic for any Harry Potter fanfic reader (in fact, it's on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/new][my Intro to HPffn Wiki page]]!).

Hope you enjoy!

** Gotta say, it's probably the most depressing fic I've actually ever finished. Goddamn.

*** I will not lie. I started the first chapters and couldn't finish. Wasn't my cup of tea and just depressing in a way I don't like. The writing is good but not good enough to not make it feel "cracky" at times.

** Well the premise is certainly original.

I'm not wild about the OC siblings - they're basically cardboard cutouts with "The nice one" and "The dark one" written on signs and hung around their necks. The constant use of prefixes for the two Harrys got on my nerves too.

I don't find the story as depressing as others seem to. For a start, his closest friends stay true, and he picks up a couple of others. It's also pretty clear by the end that his nightmare scenario of being experimented upon isn't going to happen. Yeah it's a crappy thing to happen to someone but I think he'd get over it given time.

Of the two endings, I prefer the original. It did what it needed to do, and got it done quickly. The alternate ending had some really awful dialogue from the Marauders and managed to drag on while also skipping much detail.

** Good, novel idea, but I hate the ending. I much prefer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4784970/3/The-Substitute-Omakes-Epilogues-and-Alt-Endings][the alternate ending Baja posted]].

*** Didn't know about this. I thought the original ending was much better because it created a sense of closure to Harry (Golem)'s character arc.

*** Wow I feel like I'm the opposite.

Really really disliked the concept but the ending was really nice. I guess for me, there wasn't much you could go for with the idea, so giving it some sense of closure was good.

Im also a stickler for poetic endings though (in all kinds of media, not just literature) so it could be that too.

** I was afraid that Golem Harry would die in the end, though I allowed myself to hope that the real Harry would die instead. Didn't like the characterization of the Potter siblings. They felt too generic. The interaction between Golem Harry and Hermione was heartwarming.

*** I so agree about his relationship with Hermione! It definitely tugged at my heartstrings. It's made me want to read other fics about them developing a closer friendship or more (though I am very satisfied with purely friendship fics as well).

** I'm a bit biased (for obvious reasons) but I've always thought it to be the author's best work of fanfiction.

It's not a happy story; it wasn't meant to be.

** I liked it, but I would have liked it more if some things would have been shown instead of being told, for example Lily and James reacting to Garry

** I might be in the minority but if it had been slightly longer I would have stopped reading. Some of the chapters to me dragged on. I wasn't even sad at the ending as I didn't feel attached the characters in the story. Overall I enjoyed this fic and really respect the originality of the story. It ended at just the right time.

** I liked the fic back in the day simply because it was /different/. Mostly these days its usually just brought up when discussing depressing fics.

** Although I enjoyed this fic when I first read it, upon a reread, some things annoy me more. Foremost, it's almost Weasley bashing, but doesn't even give them enough attention for that. I would have liked to have seen Ghary at least spend some time feeling the rejection, since he viewed them as family. Instead, they were brushed aside.

** The warnings had me really prepared for a depressing story and though it was, it wasn't as much as I was expecting. Overall the mood seemed to be one of melancholy and elevated from just being depressing by the fact that Garry had a group that stuck by him from the beginning. I was really happy for that and that the ginger twins also came around. I did enjoy the story and was pleased at the little differences here and there from the canon triwizard results. It kept thing fresh and it was interesting to see other ways Harry could have gone about succeeding.

The ending broke my heart but it seemed inevitable. A particularly poignant scene to me was once he entered the maze and turned around to see Ginny holding the clothes she had fetched for him. I could picture the scene so vividly and it was so sad I paused before continuing. I haven't yet read the alternate ending and I will soon. I just wanted to stew on the original ending for a bit.

** Original premise, but execution left me wanting. Could've used more polish. And props for sticking to the theme and ending on a downer.
