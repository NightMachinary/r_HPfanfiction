Hello, I have been trying to find this one fanfic for quite some time now and it has been driving me crazy. I remember quite a bit of detail but not enough apparently to find it through all my searching. I'm going to post as much I can remember to try and make this easier.

I know that it was at least a two part series, possibly with a prequel that I skipped of the first I read. There was definitely a squeal to the one I will be mentioning first, and there was possibly a sequel to that one as well, so up to 4 fics in total but no less than two. Now I'll start my memory of the first fic I read/possible sequel to the actual first fic.

It starts off with Ginny entering the Ministry. She eventually becomes a Liaison to Romania and at one point in the fic spent some time in Egypt as well if I can remember. I do not remember if Ginny was immediately working for the Ministry but I believe so. Hermione is working there as well. In the opening chapter, possibly two, a masked figure in black clothes does a robbery at the Ministry and the figure eventually kills Charlie Weasley on the way out as he was attempting to stop the man. Later on the item turned out to be Lord Voldemort's wand (it could have been the Elder Wand but I do not remember, fairly certain Voldemort's, obviously ignoring that he had the Elder Wand at some point in the seventh actual book). Throughout the novel Ginny swears she thinks she's seeing Harry and her friends thinks she's just delirious as Harry is dead, supposedly. Throughout the book, she spends a lot of time in Romania, Britain, and if I remember correctly briefly in Egypt dealing with some kind of brotherhood. For some reason I think it was the "Brotherhood of Shadows" but cannot remember the name for sure. The leader of this group was something along the lines of Igor Tavus. My memories of the details are very strained but the person in black at the beginning who killed Charlie turned out to be Harry who was once in this brotherhood and there turns out to be a Veil like the one in the MoM in the Romanian government's equivalency. Tavus (or whatever his name was) eventually gets Ginny, Harry, himself, and others into the Romanian room with the Veil trying to push Harry in to balance out the power of dark and light or something like that. Fairly certain some monster came out of it and swallowed Tavus, though that could just be faulty memory.

The next part of the series I remember very little of, but mainly that there was supposedly a ghost haunting Hogwarts and various people like Lupin and McGonagall thought it to be Harry's ghost. There was an odd ghost in Harry's house, may have been Grimmauld Place, which left when it was seen as well. At one point Hermione and Harry had an odd surge and had a brief passionate embrace they couldn't explain. The last two parts were very vague recalls and just more to add on for someone to possibly help me out with. The only other details of this second novel that I remember is that Harry was supposedly going to come out of hiding and show he was alive at some Ministry held event, and at some point one of Harry, Hermione, or Ginny were coerced into their job due to a minor blackmail but better option than 'being forced by [insert name here] forcing you into this position'. There may have also been something about a female Dark Lord (Lordess?) in China who had a big control on floo powder. Whether or not this is some other story I'm mixing in I forget, and she may not have turned out to be evil either if it was this story.


** Sorry for putting the [Discussion] tag in the title if everyone is seeing that as I do, first Reddit post and just getting the hang of the flair and site as a whole!
