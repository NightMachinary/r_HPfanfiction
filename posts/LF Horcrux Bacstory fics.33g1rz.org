Really looking for some fics about Riddle learning about Horcruxes, how he made it happen the first time, why he chose what he did, why he hid them where he did, how having his soul split affected him, etc.


** The closest story I have:

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10785698][Transcendence]]/ (60k words, last updated 26 days ago): In the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle snatches the diary Horcrux from Harry before it can be stabbed, becomes fully corporeal, and flees to Malfoy Manor. He puts a fair amount of effort into investigating why his older self went insane, and also starts retrieving his other Horcruxes. A funny quote from Chapter 9:

#+begin_quote
  Hiding Horcruxes in places intrinsically connected to himself was sheer stupidity! It was a good thing he'd come along when he had, or else surely his other self would have been defeated eventually because of his utter madness. Tom was considering now whether it was even worth it to bring the man back, if he was that insane.
