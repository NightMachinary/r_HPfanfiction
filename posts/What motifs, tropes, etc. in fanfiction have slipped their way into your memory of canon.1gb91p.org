For example:

Wards. I honestly can't remember if they are canon or not. I like them. They seem like they could be canon.

Other examples could be a common plot device like Lily & James being HG and HB or characterizations, like Pansy being insecure.

***** The most basic explanation of an MS is a character who has no real flaws, who suffers no genuine consequences for their actions, and whose interactions with other characters is implausible.

Commonly, MS's have extreme powers that no one else has, they're loved by everyone except a scant few people who only dislike them because they're ~jealous~ (or, alternately, hated by everyone except their best friend/one twoo luv, and even then everyone else only hates them because ~jealous~ or "they just don't understand me in all my teenage uniqueness"), and regularly they are extremely attractive (or if they're not, the author will still manage to make regular mention of their features in a positive manner, or a negative manner designed to elicit sympathy). Often they will also have unusually coloured hair or eyes and sometimes extra bodily features like wings.

*BUT* the mentioned traits by themselves *do not* make an MS. The distinguishing feature about MS's are consequences. If a character has extreme powers (as we're in the HP fandom, we'll define "extreme powers" in this case as their ability to cast spells wandlessly and non-verbally with unpractised ease) there should be downsides--tiredness from overuse, a "price" for the magic, and/or a realistic reaction from other characters. For example, in my own fic HP gets uber!powerful by selling his soul to a demon and ten years in the future that demon is going to come and take said soul and drag it to hell for eternal damnation; there's also characters who fear him for his power and want to control it/stop him using it at all; and because he's a teenager and emotionally unstable, that power occasionally lashes out of his control and hurts people.

Extremely attractive characters are also not automatically MS's, though it is something that most writers would fail to provide consequences for. If the characters is female, they're unfortunately going to suffer from more male harassment (cat-calling, unwanted butt grabs, etc) than a less attractive woman. There's a strong chance they'll be insecure and think that people only like them for their appearance--this is a fear that could extend to even their closest friend at times. Also, if they've got ~beautiful flowing locks of honey-golden blonde hair~ that's fine but if they're going into battle that hair better be tied back (in a braid or something, not a bloody ballroom fancy hairdo) because otherwise it's going to be a hindrance. But extreme good looks is something that a lot of writers make as flawless and cause them to be loved by everyone--after all who could hate me when I'm /this/ good looking... except those jealous ugly people, obviously. On that issue, yes there are going to be people who are jealous of physical beauty, but it doesn't make them bitches. Jealously is an ugly but natural human emotion. As long as someone doesn't act on it, then there's no reason to vilify someone for feeling it.

Appearances also become an issue not only in and of themselves, but because authors will go on and on and on about it and it's fucking annoying. We get it, your character is beautiful and has swirling rainbow coloured eyes, we don't need reminding every bloody paragraph.

As I said, the important thing about avoiding an MS is consequences--on everything from snapping at your best friend because you woke up on the wrong side of the bed (they'll be annoyed and want an apology before forgiving you) to deciding to take on twenty death eaters by yourself (yes, you're powerful, but there's more of them and you're 15, goddamnit, they're smarter than you so you're not necessarily going to win, and if you do you're still going to have taken some hits and need to recover afterwards).

That ended up a touch longer than I expected, but hopefully it's helped explain the issue.

***** Mary Sue means that an author (usually female) includes an original character (usually a girl) in the canon that is goddamn perfect.

It means she has no flaws whatsoever, looks absolutely beautiful, is intelligent, funny, nice, humble, has a deep and mysterious past... In other words: she is extremely boring and two-dimensional.

Calling an OC a Mary Sue is an insult to say the author has no idea how characterization works.

notes:

When talking about a male they call him a "Barry Sue" instead.

Instead of an OC it can also be an OC-standin (that is a character that is technically canon but plays no part at all in the original plot and is an unwritten page just the same)

** Re: Wards, I think the idea mostly comes from the fact that one cannot apparate into or out of Hogwarts grounds. A persistent magical barrier of some sort is the only feasible explanation I can think of. IIRC there was also a defensive bubble of some sort over Andromeda's house (and all the other houses involved in the 7 Potters gambit, presumably) at the beginning of DH, but the details of it escape me.

Fred and George finishing each other's sentences I don't think happens in canon much, if at all.

*** He does refer to them as "Head boy an' girl in their day." I always assumed that he simply meant they were the top students, not necessarily Head Boy and Head Girl, particularly since JKR capitalizes both words in the Heads' titles in the series.

Maybe they were, and I'm being pedantic. But that's how I interpreted what Hagrid told Harry.

** I don't know if anyone here has read it, but like ten years ago my favorite fic was called "I Am Lord Voldemort," by Nemesis, and it was about Tom Riddle Jr.'s childhood and Hogwarts years, and a bit post-Hogwarts too. For the longest time it was just part of my head canon, basically up until his story was revealed in the books, and I got confused sometimes even after that!

As for wards...weren't there some in the Gaunt house when Dumbledore went there? Damnit, now I'm confused! Lol.
