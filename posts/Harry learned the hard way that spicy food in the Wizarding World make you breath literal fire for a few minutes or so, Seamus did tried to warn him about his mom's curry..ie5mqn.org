** While that is a funny idea and brilliant for a funny oneshot

In my headcanon, wizard meals are actually a bit blank. Spicy food was needed to conserve food longer and for wizards that is just not needed, so while some people that are close to muggles may eat a bit spicier, traditional wizards just can't deal with spicy food at all
