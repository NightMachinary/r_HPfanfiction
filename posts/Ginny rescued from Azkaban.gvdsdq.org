I'm trying to find an old favorite. Despite the events in the Chamber, Ginny is still blamed for the petrifications throughout the year. Fudge has her arrested and sent to Azkaban. Harry, understandably, doesn't accept this. So, he calls up a friend from the Muggle side of things to pull her away before she gets there, and, officially, goes missing. Harry's friend, being both Muggle and of questionable morals, agrees to help and protect Ginny until such protection is no longer needed. I don't remember what the payment was, or if there was a payment at all.

At the very least, I THINK it was Second Year, but I may be remembering wrong.
