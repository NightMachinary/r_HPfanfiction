Brooms are the least dignified method of travel you could ever imagine, and it's just /so/ funny how probably all of the characters in the series have to have flown a broomstick at least once.

I dare you to imagine Severus Snape in a broomstick and keep a straight face. I certainly can't. It is now canon that Voldemort learnt how to levitate to not have to be on a damn broom while in an air battle. It'd just be impossible to maintain all of the respect you had for your cult leader after seeing them doing something so silly.

There's a whole SPORT based on the things, and it frustrates me how no one in canon found it at least a bit laugh-worthy? i'd be snickering the whole match. Maybe i just laugh easily? Does anyone else find it absurdly funny?


** Headcanon: Snape is rubbish on a broom. That's why he begged Voldemort to teach him how to fly without brooms.
