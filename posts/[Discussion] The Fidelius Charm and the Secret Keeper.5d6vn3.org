Why could't Potters (James or Lily) be their own secret keeper? It worked perfectly fine for the Weasleys in DH:

/“How are they protected?” asked Harry./

/“Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here.”/

Excerpt From: J.K. Rowling. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” iBooks. [[https://itun.es/us/70L09.l]]

The only explanation I have is that JKR didn't really care about consistencies if simple solutions interfered with her plot. She had to kill off Potters so they couldn't be their own secret keeper. Later she needed to keep Weasleys safe so they could suddenly become theirs.

Now when it comes to writing fanfictions, what two versions of the canon are you going to use? If you go with the Potter version, how do you go about protecting the secret keeper? My solution is to hide two properties under the Fidelius. For example, Potters hide in Property A, with their secret keeper Sirius hiding in Property B, whose secret keeper would be one of the Potters. I call this scheme "Mutually Protective Fideliuses".

JKR had the following to say about Secret Keeper:

#+begin_quote
  New from J.K. Rowling

  The Fidelius Charm is extremely ancient and still used to this day. It involves the concealment of information inside a living person. The chosen person, or Secret Keeper, is the only person who is thenceforth capable of revealing the protected information to others, however many previously knew it. If the Secret Keeper shares the hidden information, the person to whom he or she has confided it will be bound by the Fidelius Charm and find it impossible to pass the information on.

  The Fidelius Charm is not without its weaknesses. If the Secret Keeper wishes to do so, they may divulge the information at any time (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily). If the Secret Keeper dies, anyone to whom he or she has confided the information will become a Secret Keeper. This could involve many people, any of whom might be more willing to share the secret.

  Generally speaking, being a Secret Keeper is a dangerous position to occupy. It is such a serious and binding enchantment that few would undertake it lightly. In spite of the fact that the secret can only be given up voluntarily, many have been subjected to the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in an effort to make them share their information.
#+end_quote

Basically, the secret cannot be forced out of the secret keeper, it must be shared voluntarily.

Now suppose you are going to write the villain trying to force the secret out. How do you do that? What is the limit of "forced" or "voluntary"? Can the secret be bribed?

I'm looking forward to your opinions.


** Honestly, I think that if you do something that impairs the secret keeper's ability to make rational decisions, like ply them with enough liquor, it should still count as their voluntary decision.

** I use the interpretation I described in this post:

** The only reason the Fidelius worked like that for the Weasleys is because they did not own the property. In the movies at least, Aunt Muriel owned Shell Cottage, which is why the Weasleys could be each others secret keeper. In the books, it is never actually said that Bill and Fleur even owned Shell Cottage so Muriel being the one who legally own the place wouldn't contradict canon.

James and Lily couldn't be each other's secret keeper because they were the owners of their house. It would only work if they made their secret keeper someone who wasn't already living there. The only way James and Lily could have been each other's Secret Keeper is if they had been living in someone else's house, and that person wasn't living there despite owning the place. The only place that really fits the bill would be where ever Lupin lives (does Lupin even HAVE his own home?). Grimmauld Place wouldn't work since the entire Order have been there already and know about it. However if Lupin went off to live with Wormtail while James and Lily were living in Lupin's home as the secret keepers, it could have protected them.

Besides, there is always the possibility that the Fidelius Charm was developed even more following the death of James and Lily. We know this type of thing is possible because Dumbledore developed the Patronus Charm even further so that it could be used to deliver messages. That wasn't a thing because Dumbledore came up with it.

Either way, its not really a plothole because it can be interpreted that Bill and Fleur only lived at Shell Cottage but didn't actually own it legally (i.e. they were living at Muriel's place while Muriel was hiding in another place). The only way it would be a plot hole is if it was outright stated that Shell Cottage was Bill and Fleur's actual house.

** Maybe it's because the fidelius charm was developed further in the following two decades. People would try to improve such an important charm, especially as the the faults in it were so widely seen in the attack on the Potters. How many people 'know' that Sirius betrayed the Potters? How many of those know the fidelius charm was in use? How many of those would have liked a safer version?

** Maybe its because the Potters might have needed a visitor like a nurse or someone to visit without endangering themselves. An external secret keeper can bring guests without the Potters exposing themselves. Mr Weasley however regularly has to leave the Burrow so can spread the secret when needed. Maybe it deteriorates when the secret keeper is in the location for a long time thus Dumbledore not Sirius was secret keeper of No.12 Mr Weasley working each day is enough downtime I guess.

** I like to believe that after the tragic events of Halloween '81, Dumbledore set to modifying the charm so that the secret can be contained within itself (i.e. the secret keeper can reside within the area protected by the Fidelius). I believe it's safe to assume he succeeded in this endeavour pre-OTTP as the Fidelius on Grimmauld Place would fail after his death. Either that or the "multiple secret keepers" thing from the death of the original secret keeper creates a loophole for it

*** You do not have absolute protection. The very existence of the secret keeper means it is not absolute because humans can make mistakes.

** I have yet to hear any reasonable explanation for why the Potters wouldn't choose Frank Longbottom as their secret keeper and why the Longbottoms wouldn't choose James Potter. They hide each other and all fanon and canon rules towards the fidelius remain unbroken.
