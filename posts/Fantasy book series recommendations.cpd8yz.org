I don't usually read authors notes that have the usual "sorry for the late update" but I have found some really great fiction recommendations when authors have listed their inspiration. Have you found any?

For example, I was turned onto Naomi Novik from a random authors note.


** Naomi Novak is one of the founders of AO3 and a prolific fic writer, so she's quite popular with the fandom crowd. Plus when people criticize slash (or fanfic in general) it's fun being able to say that you've read slash fic written by a Nebula award winning novelist. :)

*** What's her name on AO3? I love her work and love even more that she's a software dev by day (like me!) and have looked for her fics online but haven't been able to find them.

** The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher is /almost/ like a grown up HP living in Chicago and becoming a detective. Really bad childhood, people thinking he's evil, massive saving people thing, etc. Obviously there are differences but it's a really great read. The first two or three books are not great because they were the first ones he had gotten published. They get far better as the series goes on.

He's also got a few other series too that are great too.

Other Urban Fantasy series I enjoy\\
Sandman Slim\\
Magic 2.0\\
Monster Hunters Inc

I could go on but that's off the top of my head. You might also want to check out [[/r/UrbanFantasy]] for more recommendations.

*** I used to say that Dresden Files was like an adult version of HP, but 15 books in, and that's just not really the case any more (if it ever was). I think it's always been just a catchphrase used as a selling point to try and get more people to read the books. I used to love the series, but I'm completely over it these days. Maybe it's one of those things that you're only supposed to read once, but I think with 15 books, there's 7 good ones and 8 bad ones, and I have a feeling we will be getting a 9th bad one.

**** They're all fantastic, definitely prefer fools errand of the two, but love the liveship traders as my favourite, however I couldn't get into the soldier son at all, got to were he had a chunk of hair ripped out and that was it, one of the few books I couldn't finish.

***** The /Soldier's Son/ series /is/ pretty weird. It's the only published fantasy series I know of that focuses on a character struggling with body image issues and obesity. It's well written, and the author deserves a lot of credit for having the creativity and courage to explore that topic, but I stopped reading part way through the second book because it reminded me too strongly of feeder/feedee culture (even though I know that was not the author's intention).

****** I've no idea as to Hobbs intentions with soldiers sons, I just couldn't get into it in the slightest, it was struggle to pick up and in the end I just couldn't be bothered at all, that's only happened with two other books, trudi canavans magicians court and the shannara chronicles.

** When the series was still being published, my local library gave out a list that said "Like Harry Potter? Try these while you wait for the next one!". I'll see if I can find it and post it here.

Patrick Rothfuss - The Name of the wind

If you want an absolute epic series - The Wheel of Time.

If you want a big fanfic community for a bit of reading (don't make me delete my account) some twilight fanfics are better than the books.

** I learned of many great fantasy (and scifi) series from reading HPMOR. That fic contains tons of shoutouts/homages to books, TV shows, movies, other fanfics, etc.

In particular, HPMOR set me onto reading Lois McMaster Bujold's books. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_Chalion][The Curse of Challion]]/ is my favorite fantasy book by her, and her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga][Vorkosigan Saga]] is now my favorite scifi book series. Bujold has a flair for writing about atypical heroes, which I love.

Unfortunately, it's "wrote" - Eddings died about 10 years back.

** The Wardstone Chronicles (AKA Spooks Apprentice/The Last Apprentice)by Joseph Delaney is a pretty good one. It is a Young Adult adventure series, but it can get a bit grimmer than you may expect, though not too [[https://much.It][much. It]] follows the main character in the Titular role as the Apprentice to the Spook, who deals with ghosts, ghasts, witches, boggarts and other phantasmagoria and things that go bump in the night.

** Most of my reading list is sci-fi or fantasy that emulates sci-fi. Admittedly HP was always at the very end of my reading spectrum, I actually considered the books only eh, with much better literature out there that got less acclaim.

I still have The Magicians on my reading list :|

*** I read the first two books of the Magicians series by Levi Grossman, and I didn't like them much. The first book, especially, purposely sucks the fun out of magic as a way of evoking the malaise of adulthood. But this atmosphere makes the main character's triumphs seem pitiful and meaningless.
