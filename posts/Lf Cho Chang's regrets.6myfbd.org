A fic where Cho realizes that Harry was right about voldemort and she should have believed him and shouldn't have had so much resentment about Cedric's death.

Pairing and reconciliation optional


** I think Cho believed Harry when she joined the DA. The reason their relationship fell apart was because Harry scheduled a meeting with Hermione after his date with Cho, and because of the Marietta Edgecomb affair.

Cho was kicked out of DA as a result, but she nevertheless returned for the Final Battle and risked her life for Harry's cause against overwhelming odds.

Cho was further maligned in the fandom and often became a bashing target. I have yet to find a good Harry/Cho fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3717885/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Autumn-Swan][Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan]] is basically abandoned.

A meeting which, in a case of exceptionally bad timing, took place on Valentine's Day. If Harry had known more about how to interact with women at that point in his life, he would have brought the meeting up to Cho and made sure she understood that Hermione was only a friend. (Cho, we should remember, very likely read the salacious article in /Witch Weekly/ the previous year and assumed Harry and Hermione had been an item.)

In summary: Cho's Valentine's Day basically consisted of "My ex-boyfriend is dead and now my boyfriend, instead of comforting me, is going to go see his ex-girlfriend." Harry's Valentine's Day consisted of "I'm being a bad boyfriend right now and I don't even realize what I'm doing wrong because I've never been in this situation before." This is why, while I don't ship Harry/Cho, I really like them as an example of everything that (usually) goes wrong in your first attempt at a relationship.

**** Ok, I agree with you on most things, but it was neither Harry's job to comfort her nor was he the right person to even try - why? Because he himself still feels guilty for Cedric's death and, while Peter killed him it was his sense of fair play that lead to Cedric being there in the first place, he's not totally wrong (unlike the situation with Sirius later on, sure he should have used the mirror, but he was stressed and it was Sirius who decided to risk his death in a fight (he knew the risks, Cedric didn't - in fact he couldn't and neither could Harry of course))

As for Hermione being his GF? Come on everybody who went to school with them should have known they never shared that (they didn't cuddle up together in the common room etc. and they had no reason to keep it secret at that stage: Voldemort didn't have a body or followers when that article came out (ok: He had that weak baby-body, but they didn't know that!))

Actually, when you're a boyfriend or a girlfriend, it's /very/ important that you're able to comfort your SO whenever they need it. By that same token, however, Cho should have realized that Harry was facing the same trauma as her - even worse trauma, in fact, since he'd actually seen it happen.

Cho wouldn't have known that, being from a different House than Harry or Hermione. But now that you mention it, most of the /Witch Weekly/ hatemail came from outside the school. I agree that most students inside the school probably knew it was a fake story - although Cho might've still second-guessed how fake it actually was when Harry told her, "Hey, I'm gonna go meet Hermione today after our date."

*** Hey, thanks for the rec. I just read the first chapter and it seems to be quite good. Is it really abandoned? It's tagged as Completed.
