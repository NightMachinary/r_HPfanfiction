It's been a while but I read this fic, don't remember the plot but near the end Dumbledore ist "incarnated" with his magic lost/bound in a home for (senil) seniors as a punishment. Any ideas which story that is? I can't get it out of my head...


** I can't remember the name of the fic, but I think it's a Robst fic or a Rune Stone Path fic. The Flamels approach them anonymously (and one of them guesses it based on their similar names - winning them a trip to San Diego Comicon) and offer to take care of Dumbledore when he oversteps. They bind his magic and put him in a care home that he repeatedly tries to escape after receiving charmed newspapers telling of Harry's exploits.

I think it's probably Rune Stone Path, because I remember one of the articles being about Harry's 'necromantic habits', which is a minor plot point in Rune Stone Path.

*** You are correct! The Story is *Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path* by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1057022/Temporal-Knight][Temporal Knight]] and I highly recommend reading it (again)!
