Two stories that I have read and love are:

1: Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity 2. Albus Potter series by Velkin87

I am looking for stories within the world that JKR created, but are not centered around HP. Thanks


** Do you like stories about the Marauders Era?

** "On the last day of our world" is a fantastic Drarry fic. Not sure if that's what you're looking for, but it's one of my faves.
