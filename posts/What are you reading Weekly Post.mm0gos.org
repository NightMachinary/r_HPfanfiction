** Title: Bad Education

Rating: T

Link: [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888]]

Oh man, I cannot recommend this fic enough. Magicspacehole is truly a hilarious author, and I love how she makes this crazy plot so engaging and funny! Tom Riddle is somehow sarcastic, selfish, murderous, and INTENSELY HILARIOUS, and I've really ended up rooting for him as he tries to be a professor and still follow his dreams of becoming powerful and immortal! The side characters are vivid and interesting and there's never a dull moment!

** I have no idea how i stumbled upon this but I'm reading linkao3(Flowers by the Wayside by TalaRae), which is a Petunia Dursley/Severus Snape fic. Basically, after catching Vernon cheating on her a couple years after the 2nd war, Petunia commits suicide and thus ends up travelling back in time to 1978 to her then-body.

I really am a sucker for Nice!Petunia in fics, and her characterisation is somewhat believable; she's regretful about how she spent her first life and aims to change for the better. Snape is still a bitter twat but I suppose more toned down with the addition of a genuine friendship/relationship.

The author also tags Alastor Moody/Regulus Black as a pairing; it hasn't come up yet but I am curious to how that will work out, what with the large age-gap.

Regular updates, but still eagerly looking in my inboxes. pretty cool :)

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** Moving some stories which bored me to death from my reading queue:

- “The Peace Not Promised” by Tempest Kiro linkffn(12369512) ... I liked good description of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lumg8r/all_our_kin_snape_and_evanses_flight_from_the/][actually poor working class]] Severus and Evanses, who are actually really poor. I am a bit fed up with all characters being upper-middle class with BMWs, large houses, and travelling all over the world in a drop of a hat, and this story had really realistic picture of working class families struggling with mortgage etc. The big problem is length with a plot which is clearly unable to support it. 723,342 words, 93 chapters? That's whole The Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, and Silmarilion combined! And there is story for longer Pride and Prejudice most (that's however just 122,685 words): Severus is sorry, returns to Lilly, tries to fix Slytherin house, they live happily ever-after (or something, I gave up in 50+. chapter from 90+). The only tension is that Severus still behaves like an idiot and lies to Lily all the way until they are married and after. I expect it is going to blow up eventually, but I really cannot care. Characters behaving like idiots is a horrible replacement for missing plot.

- “Falling Through Time” by wittyhistorian linkao3(4475078). Hermione returns in time fix-it story, except Hermione doesn't fix anything and just observes how The Stations of Canons flow by. Just in order to make any tension she lies to everybody ... all that in 353,137 words (that's longer than Middlemarch by George Eliot). Just why?

Who really is capable of reading this?

** I'm reading Harry Potter, Squatter. I really liked the wholesome vibes at first but he's getting a bit too Mary Sue for me. Practically everyone likes him and his problems are less problems and more excuses to give him more powers/cool things. It's also very slow-paced - apparently the author's over 300k words in and still hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet, so I don't know if I'll be continuing the fic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23263648/chapters/55709014]])

This is a very excellent fic. The main premise is this: Young Tom Riddle and Harry from different universes meet in the RoR and accidentally travel 50 years to the future in Tom's dimension.

There's some pretty cool druidic magic, it portrays Slytherin more realistically than canon and the Romance was pretty good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22127926/chapters/52816285]])

This fic is also pretty good. It's an exploration of how Cedric could have become a death eater in Cursed Child and that's pretty much all you need to know.

  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a scarred boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter falls with him into a reality untouched by Voldemort's reign. Taken into the Potter household, the two form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, governmental plots, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.(In which Tom learns to be kind, Harry learns to be cruel, and ancient magic sings to them both from the woods. Meanwhile, a war of metal and secrets brews in the shadows, threatening an end to the fragile peace.)

Summary: What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

Opinion: I seldom laughed as much while reading a story as I did with this one. Tom is OOC but the world building and the plot is great for a humor-based fic.

Do you like a good but fallible Dumbledore? A powerful but not overpowered Harry? A story that doesn't depend on ships? A story that follows canon but in a unique and original way? Good grammar?

** It's been a few weeks since I've done one of these. I've been going through a real drink-whiskey-and-play-Rock-Band-every-night phase. Trying to recapture my youth. Been drinking some pretty good whiskys. Way better than the swill I drank back when I was poor. If I had a time phone and could call myself in 2010 I'd tell myself A) to buy bitcoin; and B) that Buffalo Trace only costs $25 a bottle and tastes better than every bourbon under $50 (including Eagle Rare, Buffalo Trace's label in the $40 price range) and a lot of the ones that are over $50.

Of course, I always have time to stop drinking and strumming a plastic, baby guitar to read the new chapter of Unprecedented Competition by BrilliantLady. The latest entry in a series that started off (five fics ago) as something that was nearly a canon rehash and has slowly and logically gone completely off of the rails of canon. Those butterfly wings be small, but they are strong. Right now we're at year 4, and Harry has actually managed to be popular enough that the school has rallied around him and he has study groups helping him learn spells and troubleshoot strategies for the tournament tasks. At a rate of two chapters per week, the second task is coming up fast, but this series ramps up into such a page turner that if you start now I don't doubt you'll be all caught up by the time we get there. Start on the first (very short) set up fic: The Definition of Normal. A true 1/1 series.

linkffn(11591125)

I'm also still reading and still wholeheartedly recommending Loose Cannon by Manatee-Vs-Walrus. The fic that taught me what EWE means. Before I thought it was some kind of smut indicator because of the similarity to the more widely known PWP tag. So I guess this means Loose Cannon is educational too. One more reason to give it a try! One thing I really like about this fic that I don't think I've mentioned in the last 10 comments I've made recommending it is that the author seeds the story with future events all of the time. The fic is advertised as "No mortal peril" and completely lives up to it, but even without the stakes (and perhaps more importantly the cliffhangers) you'd get from a combat-oriented story my interest is always piqued, because I always have a vague idea of what's coming soon. Like right now I'm looking forward to Harry attending the annual WORF (an organization that helps werewolves) gala, where he'll be auctioning off for charity his old glasses, a broomstick that was broken out from under him during one of his first matches playing for the Chudley Cannons, and a date with himself. Hopefully I've managed to pique your interest too, the story is an absolute blast that has been going strong for a staggering 994,537 words and shows no signs of slowing down. Come enjoy new chapters of this 1/1 story every Wednesday.

I also read A Simple Act of Vengeance by Frickles, and the sequel (as much of it as is currently published) Wrath and Remorse. This is just about the exact opposite of Loose Cannon. This fic makes A Storm of Swords look like The Very Hungry Caterpillar. It is intense, brutal, and ramps up to a degree that you really don't see in anything else. The closest comparison I have is, if anyone reads Wildbow's stories (not fan fiction, but they are published online for free), it reminds me of Pact after arc 9 where the story is just pure insanity, ramping up from one mind blowing fucked up situation to another, but I honestly think Wrath and Remorse in particular is somehow more intense and more brutal than Pact was. Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the story starts out like a nice little Super!Harry story where he has wandless magic, and is going to be in a cute little love triangle with Susan Bones and Daphne Greengrass, and everything is going to be a great predictable canon-rehash cakewalk, and then all of that is ripped away from you and what's left is a bunch of horribly broken people just trying to keep it together for one more goddamn day. This Frickles cat is definitely someone to watch. The kind of dude that the "follow author" check box was made for. Relative newcomer, but already super prolific and very creative and original with a bunch of great WIPs that are being regularly updated. I would give the story a 1/1, but my immersion was shattered when a character ordered a whiskey that wasn't produced for ~13 more years after present day in the story, so that's a goose egg for you, A Simple Act of Vengeance! You get nothing!! I said good day sir!!! Ah whatever, you know it's a 1/1.

To quote the author from the final A/N:

  Last shout-out (until the next story) has to go to Nauze, who's been with me for the last 20-some chapters of this story, as well as to anakvita, though their tenure as my beta was only for 3 or 4 chapters. I should go back and edit some of the earlier chapters, and I will someday. Cheers!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate]]) which was fun. Some chapters were really hilarious.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun]]) is a harry/bellatrix story, a little bit like Delenda Est but it's quite a lot boring. I had read that it was boring before starting it, but I kinda like this ship so I read it anyway and yeah there isn't much happening. And it's not complete.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back]]) is also a harry/bellatrix story. I liked the beginning, but it turned into an endless loop of ultra-emotional/power-wanky which spoiled it.

** I read 'Psychosis' by SnowWhiteOwl ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis]]) and because I"m feeling maudlin and the story reminded me of 'Digging for the bones' by Paganaidd ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]]), I reread it as well.

Those are the best hurt/comfort stories I know that feature a Harry/Snape bonding relation. Well written and deeply disturbing in an emotional way (Digging more then psychosis but it's close.

Read the update on 'Road to power' by Chaos65. (h[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13701999/1/Road-to-Power][ttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/13701999/1/Road-to-Power]]). A more than decent HP-Marvel crossover SI that is starting to get traction action wise. I'm really curious about this fic and recommend it despite it meddling with tropes.

I've started reading 'Mendacium' by SomeoneFromBrazil ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13850007/1/Mendacium]]) on account of it being mentionded last week. Its a WBWL story with a somewhat more novel approach. It hasn't quite found it's feet and I'm not really convinced of the story. There a lot of things bothering me but I'm waiting to see what happens.

I'm trying to read 'Serpentine advice' by ubiquitouslyverbose ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13653786/4/Serpentine-Advice]]) and find the author's name to be what's bugging me about this story. I'm 4 chapters in and it feels like an info-dump and hardly anything happening. In contrast to that the hart of the matter of this information is really interesting as a foreshadowing to what might happen but storywise the pacing is off. I'll pick it up and try to get further in the future, maybe.

** I'm currently about halfway through linkffn(The Shock of it All by Fairywm) and I'm not sure whether I like this or I've just committed to it and need to know what happens. It's definitely one of the more unusual ones I've read. It's an OP!Harry story in which Harry ends up an amnesiac which basically ends up working in his favor as it erases all of the conditioning through his life to make him a good BWL.

The whole story is like a pinball game of bashing, which is kind of fun as it never focuses too too long on just one character being written as a giant a-hole, so it doesn't get monotonous. You'll get a little blurb of Ron bashing, then life happens as normal until you get a little tidbit of nastiness towards someone else, etc. It's kind of funny now that I try to describe it.

Harry and some of the other 14/15 year olds are portrayed as uncharacteristically horny in an ill mannered and hormonal sort of way: ogling someone's beasts while they bounce up and down in excitement or just in general getting distracted by the fact that the girl is attractive or has attractive attributes.

Also, Harry builds a mind palace to keep things sorted and it's the Enterprise, complete with crewmembers from the original Star Trek and TNG. It's just a weird little journey that this story takes you on, I have no other way to explain it 😅

Irksome things: the author refers to Harry as "our hero" or "the dark haired wizard" a lot and I find it obnoxious as it doesn't match the narration style, but whatevs. Creative differences, yeah?

** I have been reading Renascentia for a few days now linkao3(renascentia: from the ashes)

About what might have happened if Regulus Black had survived his encounter with the cave and run away to France (so presumed dead). He returns when his dark mark comes back to life along with Voldemort. It started off strong, real strong, but I'm starting to skip entire massive chunks of text. Way too much dialogue and not enough action. Like, Reg and another character are outside on the street after witnessing a Death Eater attack and decide they need to return to a safe home. Okay, good, apparition crack and they're there. No. They exchange whole ass paragraphs of vaguely flirty overly polite chitter chatter instead before going. In real time it would probably have been 8-10 min of chatting. Totally unrealistic and destroyed my immersion in the moments-before highly charged action scene.

It's the first of a series apparently and I'm unsure if I will attempt to read the next work or not, especially since I just saw an AN saying the co-authors are branching off into two separate timelines for continuing the work? No time travel involved, just can't make up their minds as to plot.... I don't think I can endure it if they continue on with this excessive dialogue thing.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

** Finished reading for probably the 4th time this weekend The Black Heir and its sequel Vindico Atrum by FirePhoenix8.

This fic is what first got me into the dark harry trope. It's very long, over 1 million words total, but when I was first reading it, I just couldn't stop reading. It had me hooked after reading the first few chapters. Now, it's changed my mindset to where it's hard for me to read a fic that isn't dark or grey harry. Anyways, the fic features a powerful and manipulative harry. I was absolutely devastated when I found out the fic is not completed and hasn't been updated in over 10 years.

But yeah I highly recommend reading this fic if you've got time to read 2 fics that totals over 1 million words.

A novel-length fic written post-GoF that envisioned life for Harry & crew after the defeat of Voldemort. Very strictly loyal to canon through book 4 -- it was considered by many in fandom at the time as THE definitive fic, during the long hiatus between books 4 and 5.

Frankly, I consider it a better conclusion than the one we actually got. Lots of pain, lots of joy.

The fluffy and loving care between Dumbledore and Harry is heart melting. Not to mention he is slight more OOC and so has a wide variety of friends that make me squeal because large friendship groups in Harry Potter fanfics are my favourite. There is a lot of dramatic tension most definitely, but occasional spots of warm fuzzy love. Admitting that I did cry my first time reading it...

** linkffn(The Changeling).

Despite the near-universal praise it gets, I actually, well, dislike this fic. The third-person present narration feels rather distant. Ginny's character is often inconsistent, and the “lessons” she learns taken to extremes that make no sense. Harry's character is a brooding, self-blaming hero taken to a length not even present in canon - really just a depressing drag to read. The Harry/Ginny romance does not flow well here either - it has no buildup, begins abruptly, and just reads awkwardly.

Ginny is perhaps the only three-dimensional character against a variety of two-dimensional foils that exist simply to illustrate how nuanced she is. Her presence does not prevent the fic from stopping at every station of canon, even in scenarios where it naturally would have. I also wasn't really a fan of the Parlor - a group of witches that form a sort of secret cabal because they don't fit the traditional definition of Slytherin ambition/power. It feels unnecessary, a concept that exists only to highlight that the members of the Parlor are “not like the other girls”, but rather more valid and more genuine. The Parlor is, in my mind, a false dichotomy - realistically, I do not feel that any of the Parlor members would be outcast or unappreciated for their (supposedly nontraditional) ambitions.

Is The Changeling written well, technically speaking? Sure. The writing quality is excellent. But I found the content itself to not live up to the praise.

It is a good fic, well written and the plot WOW I love it !, but I think it is wrong that CC has plagiarized other books and TV programs of that time (2000/2006), there is even a whole conversation copied, sometimes it gave credits, but other times not, creating controversy, causing it to even be removed from Fanfiction net, but I got it through Wattpad (/translated into Spanish because I'm Spanish-speaking haha/), anyway the fic is good despite everything, and I just love it .

The reason i got into harry/bella ship. Good fighting scenes, good dialogue. I haven't read it for a long now so i can't be 100% sure but it's a time-travel one with a harry that goes back to the past and reconciles with some people that killed his freinds/family from the future. A good read and enjoyable. If you find it deterring the ship in the beginning just give it a try. It comes off naturally and it's now centered around the ship.

** I've been read The End Is The Beginning by Nitraz.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28115205/chapters/75373699#workskin]]

It's basically a master of death and necromancer harry time travel fic. It features a manipulative dumbledore, and a morally grey harry.

A main thing in the fic involves the Resurrection Stone, where harry uses it to summon and talk to various dead people, mainly Regulus Black, Lily Potter and Ignotus Peverell.

Anyways, this fic is probably one of my most favorite fics that I've read so far, mostly because I very much enjoy reading master of death and necromancer harry fics, along with manipulative dumbledore (who I'm absolutely not a fan of if you couldn't tell), which this has all 3! Another thing that I like a lot about this fic is because the peverell brothers are in it. I've always wanted to read a fic with the three brothers but I hadn't found any until this one. Anyways, to sum it up, this is like a dream fic for me.

It's not completed but the author updates regulary. So if you're into these types of fics then I highly recommend reading it.

** I've been rereading Innocent death by Yunaleskah on ao3. It's a WIP.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18207455]]

It's femalash, Bellatrix/Hermione so not everyones cup of tea, but even though the beginning was a bit slow, in a few chapters the author got into a rhythm. I'm really enjoying Hermione's characterization in this fic, she's written as morally grey but I do feel like the writer still made sure to not write her ooc.

It's definitely one of my favorite's, Hermione as the main character has a good reason for siding with Voldemort, and the author tries to push her morally as far as they can while simultaneously keeping her character traits and values from canon. The action takes place a bit after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Bellatrix has more personality than just a crazy fanatic, which I appreciate a lot as well. Nagini and Narcissa play important roles in this as well.

Might not be for everyone, but it's a really good read.

** I had despaired on finding good Harmony fics until I stumbled onto these:

Linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick): Quite possibly the weirdest soulbond fic in the fandom. Once you are close enough to someone you /teleport into their beds nightly/. Completed comedy. Ron is likeably characterized in this one which scores major points for any Harmony fic. /Snape/ with a sense of humor. It's been quite some time since I have laughed so much because of a fic.

Linkffn(A Good Day in Godric's Hollow) By the same author. Two-shot. The writing style is a bit dense/antiquated with respect to you average fic but totally worth the effort. Bittersweet EWE post-war fic with a well written OC's from different walks of life. /Poignant/ is the word I would use to describe it.

Just in case all the fluff was rotting you metaphorical teeth:

Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort) Voldemort regains his sanity just before killing Lily. The entire fic is from his POV and gets dark real fast. Tons of murder, scheming, lying, torture and human experimentation. Basically a day to day account of being a Dark Lord. Lots of magical fighting and dark rituals. OP!Dumbledore who acts on the front lines. Abandoned.

*** I really wanted to like Thresholds, but I just can't quite. The concept is great, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again, but the execution in this case just isn't for me. The comedy seems to be almost completely of the 'let's laugh at other people's awkwardness' type, which I don't really enjoy. (some of Ron's lines are pretty funny, though.) The writing style also seems ... overwrought? (purple?) It's a bit of a tough read.

**** Agree about the prose being a bit denser than average, reads like something from the 40's. But the story feels quite original..as if the author hasn't read much fanfic. It's really rare to find a well written pre-war Ron. Even if a story doesn't indulge in Ron Bashing, one of his most endearing character traits : his easy-going humor, is rarely replicated.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  On his way home a man whose name can hardly be called a mystery around these parts encounters three people at three very different stages in their lives, his own in many ways connected to each of them. All the paths he treads, however, always and without exception lead him back to one fixed point: the place where he belongs, the place he calls home.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

** Just finished reading Introduction to the Wizard World by: MSgt SilverDollar and Snake. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7472143/1/Introduction-to-the-Wizard-World]] linkffn(7472143). Another typical story by this author. At the very beginning Harry is adopted by the Goblins who help Harry step into his power. The story has a fair amount of macho energy by it's presented in a reasonably positive way. I have a soft stop for these kinds of stories where people mentor Harry and build his confidence so he can be like a typical good guy superhero character. I also like the buildup to Harry eventually defeating the bad guy near the end. And, in his superhero way, Harry is a good and fair partner to his love interests. In a few places there was too much irrelevant detail and I skimmed/skipped over those parts. Otherwise, a fun story. If you like the Robert Heinlein juvenile books, you'll like this.

  This is an AU/Fantasy and a bit funny story. It includes a super powered Harry. It does not follow canon. It includes some bashing of my less than favorite canon characters. HP/HG/SB UPDATED: 10/14/14

** Another fic I've been reading recently is The Guile and Devotion of a Black Heir by Starlight Massacre.

This is a post-OoTP AU fic. It's where harry learns of his inheritance and then gets adopted by Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. He then becomes friends with many slytherins including Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott. It features Granger, Dumbledore, Order and Weasley bashing. Lastly, the pairing is Harry/Rabastan Lestrange.

Rating: 10/10. I can't even begin to describe how much I love this fic. Let's start with the Harry/Rabastan pairing. The author wrote their developing relationship so wonderfully that I can't find myself wanting to read fics with a different pairing. Now, I'm gonna say that I vastly enjoyed the Granger, Weasley, Order and Dumbledore bashing in this fic. This is probably an unpopular opinion but I just don't like many of the main characters in canon. Especially Hermione, Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore. Anyways, Overall, I highly recommend reading this fic. The only bad thing I have to say about this fic is the fact that it's not completed and hasn't been updated in over 6 months.

** I'm about halfway through this fanfic, and I'm really enjoying it. It's been around for awhile, and the author recently completed the story. I love Marauder era, especially Sirius-centric stories. It is 39 chapters long.
