:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this one fanfic where "Harry Potter" was actually a group of twins, and they took turns going to Hogwarts every year while the other traveled around the world taking care of business and learning magic. The truth comes out at the Triwizard Tournament however.

*** You just type it as a comment exactly as you see others have. For example, if you wanted to come back to this post in five days all you have to do is post a comment saying “Remindme! 5 days” the bot will automatically take care of it for you, there's nothing else you need to do.
