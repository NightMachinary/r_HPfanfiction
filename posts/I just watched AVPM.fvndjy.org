** AVPM is great. Its sequel might be even better. I put off watching it for years because I thought it would never be able to compare, big mistake. The 3rd one is by far the worst, even though Evanna Lynch is in it.

*** In fairness, the 3rd was supposed to be a staged reading before it grew larger and they actually performed, performed it. Considering there was next to no rehearsal (Darren Criss flew in, had a few hours to get almost off book, and flew out right after to film his most intense /Glee/ material at that point), they did a great job. And I enjoyed the meta-ness, and the way they used the final untouched material from the books, and the scene with the ghosts (also the Spiderman stuff). That being said, it was a shame that Bonnie Gruessen wasn't involved.

**** There were a ton of great ideas in AVPSY, for sure. It has a few of my favorite jokes in the whole damn trilogy, honestly. And Criss's sincere ‚Äòtake it easy Hogwarts, it has been totally awesome' as he knew that would be the last time on stage with Starkid again outside the odd concert, is heartbreakingly sweet. But you're right, to judge it with their other shows is entirely disingenuous since it was clearly not ready to actually be one.

** Oh, the second one is a real treat filled with great one-liners and one of the most hilarious plot twists I've ever come across. Probably my favorite of the three, though I do like the ending of the thread very much. AVPM is definitely one of my favorite fanmade projects, it's so fun.

****** The guy who didn't like musicals. It's their original production and it's bloody brilliant. It's more horror comedy, kinda? They also have Black Friday which has many characters from TGWDLM, but it's sorta different universe? Time line? There are a lot of theories. StarKid was also making the third one that was supposed to explain it, I think? Anyway, Black Friday is a little more serious, but still has that awesome crack humor.

** I've seen every single StarKid musical at least 5 times (excluding Me And My Dick, it's good even with the shit recording, but I'm not the biggest fan), and some 10h livestreams. I adore them so much. If you like AVPM, firstly check the Sequel and Senior Year, of course, secondly you may also like ANI: A Parody (Star Wars parody, they have a live band instead of signing themselves, so they made it with a lot of montages which is so freaking cool), Twisted (Aladdin parody but with a ton of callbacks to other Disney movies and Disney itself), Holy Musical B@tman (I don't have to explain, and it's bloody awesome, best batman ever, it's also a favorite of StarKid writers and most actors), Starship is also pretty nice (kinda sorta Star Trek vibes). The Trail to Oregon and Firebringer are more original productions, but they also rock.

BUT but the most awesome things ever are The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday, which are the original productions in the same universe, more horror parodies than anything else, but are so cool I can't even.

** I watched a bit of AVPM, and to be honest I don't see the appeal. The only "joke" I saw that was actually funny at all was Dumbledore complaining about the loss of his ticking sandwich. Most of the "humor" was either low-effort or just random nonsense that made me wonder what the writers were smoking. To this day, I have no idea what the point or humor was supposed to be in the whole "Pigfarts is on Mars" scene with Draco randomly rolling on the floor.

The play "Puffs" was substantially better, IMO.

*** It's really down to preference. The Potter musical humor in general can be very random, and I can see where it may come off as low effort. I personally find them hilarious, but if you're willing to try something else I would recommend The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday. They're both originals rather than parodies, and they have a more serious overtone as they make fun of certain aspects of horror. Still very in your face comedy and jokes but you might like them more.
