*** And he only gets the last laugh at the end, because Voldemort didn't realize in 7 years + a complete possession of the boy, that he was trying to kill the bearer of his own soul.

*** Lol, too true but yo be fair, I think what he is asking for is a fic in which Quirrel steals the stone, the basilisk kills Ginny, Sirius is kissed hi the dementors, ern... I don't know how you would adapt the 4th one that's when everything started to go FUBAR anyway, then maybe Neville or Ron die in the ministry but Harry still manages to win, I confess it would be interesting

**** Year 4 could have his hostage die in the second task, year 5 would have to end differently if Sirius was kissed though.
