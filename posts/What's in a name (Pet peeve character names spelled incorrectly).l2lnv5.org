I know some people are working from just the movies and not the books, but let's try to get the names right.

- The only double letter in McGonagall is the L at the end.
- While squirrel has only a single L, Quirrell has both double R and double L.
- Also, while there may be a lot of "iuses" in mythology (as noted in Disney's Hercules), Quirrell is not one of them: it's Quirinus, not Quirinius.
- Ginny's name does not rhyme with McGonagall's: it's GinEVRa, not Ginerva. (I grant leeway to stories written before her formal name was revealed---not until Book 7!---when it was thought to be short for Virginia.)
- There is no M in Blaise Zabini. (Although a crackfic with Blaise Zamboni is welcome.)
- Madame Pomfrey is an F, not a PH. Memory trick: she's not a doctor (no PhD).
- Umbridge the teacher often took umbrage, but they are spelled differently.
- The caretaker is Filch, not Filtch. Memory trick: nobody wants to have tea with him.
- Dumbledore has too many middle names, but in order they are Percival Wulfric Brian. If you've got a good mnemonic for that, let me know. (Just looked up the acronym PWB: Urban Dictionary says it means Party Without Boundaries. I guess that could work, considering his fanon love of outlandish robes.)
- There is an apostrophe in St. Mungo's Hospital, but not in Gringotts Bank or Ollivanders shop.
- The Dursleys live on Privet Drive (it's a type of hedge), not Private Drive.
- Add the E: Hogsmeade, Surrey, (Diagon or Knockturn) Alley, Dudley and Dursley
- Do not add the E: Leaky (Cauldron)

Edited to add:

How coud I forget that Lily Potter is not lilly? Or that Lockhart should be listed in the "don't add the E" section?

***** Yeah, I got that it was a joke. And it's totally ridiculous that a fairly major character essentially got a name change in the last book. I definitely cut some slack for Virginia, but not Ginerva.

***** Technically you can probably pronounce it half a dozen different ways and be able to justify it - English is a weird language - but the most common ways we pronounce Lucius are 'Loo-see-us' and 'Loo-she-us'. Luscious is like 'Lush-uss'.

*** Spelling Tracey's name wrong I can forgive at this point, because her name /literally isn't in any of the books/. She basically only exists on Pottermore and in interviews - so it's easy to get wrong if your first exposure to the name is a fic with the alternate spelling. IRL, Tracy is just as common a name as Trac/e/y from what I remember, and the canon books do have Roger /Davies/.

I've seen versions where Roger Davies and Trac(e)y are brother and sister.

***** Pansy Parkinson's name is actually in the books (in fact, it's in there quite a few times - especially book 3 and 4), so that's a little harder to forgive.

... Okay, a lot harder. She's named after the flower, or the insult.

This is just nitpicking, but technically JKR wrote it as 'Madam' Pomfrey in the English version. Not sure about others. Same goes for Hooch and other Madams. Maxime is the one with 'Madame'.

In terms of more misspellings to add to your list:

- It's Fleur, not the often-seen Fluer in fanon. Fleur is not sick. She does not have the FLU.

- Hermione, not Hermoine or whatever else you get. Say it like Hermione said her name to Viktor: HER -- MY -- OH -- NEE.

- Dolores, not Delores. This is not /Back to the Future/. There's no DELorean around.

- Viktor, not Victor. He did not get a VICtory at the Quidditch World Cup final.
