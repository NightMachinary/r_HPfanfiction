Dont care if they're harem soulbonds, harry and hermione fucking up and creating a borg hivemind, or harry being a weird controlling demigod like character, or some character has five hundred bodies and just one mind.

Would it work if the three chasers all have their minds linked and become one?

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

  Harry is fed up with watching memories about Voldemort in Dumbledores pensieve. Watching movies in holographic quality doesn't help him survive whatever the Dark Lord has planned next. Looking for help, Harry stumbles into the Room of Requirement, finding a mysterious book about summoning rituals... The Zerg are a mighty help indeed, but this help doesn't come cheap. Please R&R.

** In linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence), there are several Basilisk who form a hivemind. Word of warning, though, the story is an unofficial sequel to HPMOR, and far from the best one at that.

  Continuation fic of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. It's Ginny Weasley's first year at Hogwarts, and before she knows it, she is caught up in matters too grave even for a second year Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.

** I've read two. One where Fred and George shared a hive mind through what was called a Twin-Bond (It was heartbreaking) and one where the dementors all share a hive mind. I will try and find them and update this comment if I am successful.
