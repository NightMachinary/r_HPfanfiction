** I dunno, your refusal to fix the formatting/paragraphs/grammar really puts me off. It's not even difficult to do and it makes it such an easier reading experience. But the newest chapter still suffers from what your readers have pointed out to you from the very first few chapters.

Also the whole getting married at 14 thing is silly and unnecessary.

** I have gotten some really good feed back so far. I read through a boat load of fan fiction and was never entirely happy with them. So I started to write my own. It has been very rewarding.

I know the formatting is a bit hard on some people I have someone editing it for me just haven't updated it yet.

I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of it.

** The marriage seems way off. They treat it more like asking someone out to a date, not a lifelong commitment and the "Wedding night" was cringeworthy.
