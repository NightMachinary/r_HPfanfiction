I know it seems counter-intuitive to the HP universe, but I'm looking for stories where James and Lily don't die and Harry grows up with them. I read one a while back which was a long series and he grew up with them at Potter Manor (I think). Looking for more like that, if anyone can suggest some, please? ðŸ™‚


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is my favorite â€˜Harry raised by James and Lily' fic:

- The plot is epic and original. It no longer features the usual Hogwarts shenanigans. Harry has different friends, although some well known characters will join him later.
- James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. But instead of subjecting themselves to the mercy of Dumbledore, they burnt down their house, faked their deaths, fled Britain, and raised Harry elsewhere. Sirius unfortunately took the blame, and it took them 10 years to bribe him out of Azkaban.
- Most of the story takes after 2008, when every major player is already an adult.
- Being raised by loving parents, this Harry is ambitious, brilliant, and ruthless. James and Lily are no slouches either as they have built a powerful support network for their son.
- This fic is unfinished yet, but is in its final story arc. The year is 2024.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
