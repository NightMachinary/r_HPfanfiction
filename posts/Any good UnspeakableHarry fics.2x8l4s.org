** I think there was one by Perspicacity. Don't remember the title right now.

*** The original one-shot by Perspicacity is /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4289379][Detention in Defense]]/ (4k words, complete). It was expanded by someone else into /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434][Unspeakable Things]]/ (200k words, complete). In these stories, though, Harry is trained by an Unspeakable--he isn't one himself, IIRC.

**** Thanks for linking those. I just read the one shot while waiting for a software install to finish, and the expanded version looks promising.

******* I must admit, I also stayed up until 4am last night, (re-)reading most Summer of Change. Stopped with 2 chapters left due to tiredness.

** What do you mean with unspeakable? Like working at the ministry?

** Though this contains a host of other tropes, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]]

Technically has Harry working for the unspeakables for a portion of it. It is actually one of my favorite fics, and for a long while was the benchmark I used for comparing other works. Don't be put off by TMR in the characters. It has absolutely nothing to do with Slash.

Also has Harry and Ginny working as unspeakables. It is a very curious reversal of roles, though I have since stopped reading the author's work.
