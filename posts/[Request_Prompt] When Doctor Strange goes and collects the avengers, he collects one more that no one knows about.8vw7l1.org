How ever you take the idea, I'm up for It. Send me fanfics plz.


** Not the exact storyline you're looking for, but Avengers Assemble is a story where Harry becomes one of the Avengers. Its really well written, and being updated pretty regularly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781]]

*** Ey! Do you have any crossover where he doesn't join the avengers? I can't deal with Harry being a superhero it just doesn't fit his image.

**** This one is a Hawaii Five-O / Lilo and Stich/ NCIS/ Bones crossover. Its hilarious, and really well written in my opinion if you like these series. The author also has a bunch of other good crossovers imo.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12256909/1/Master-Potter-of-Kamar-Taj][Master Potter of Kamar-Taj]] by Ryuko monogatari might be something you would be interested in. However, it does match what you're looking for exactly. In this fic Doctor Strange actually took Harry under his wing. linkffn(12256909)
