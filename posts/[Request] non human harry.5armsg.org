** I was going to suggest Serpens Armarum which is a basilisk!Harry fic by Evandar, because it's my favourite creature!Harry, but I can't find the story anywhere. It looks like the author got fed up with something and took all her stories down?

Anyway, if someone has a copy of it they can send me, or knows where to find it, I'd be very grateful.

** Linkffn(Growing up kneazle). Should qualify for your criteria. Sticks to canon like glue with the occasional funnny line by Kneazle!Harry but still worth reading.

*** I'd not say that it sticks to canon like glue - not at all. In first year already, there are significant differences (there's no confrontation in front of the mirror, for example), and they only grow more pronounced as the story progresses.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
