  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Oh I know a fic that does this /beautifully/ But not until I think at least the second instalment. None the less, it's my absolute favourite fic series.

It's *The Secret Language of Plants* series and divination becomes a major plot point regarding one character in particular and it's my favourite feature of the series.

That's the first one

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

******* Mmm.. in my defense i never read a fic that has Snupin as the "main" pairing... they are usually a secondary pairing and i really like them. It started with my kost favourite fic of all time, which is "Secrets", by "Vorabiza" .. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8184311/chapters/18751001]]

I cannot recommend this fic enough.. i have read tons, of different pairings and yet this one is dear to me. I think it was the first time i read a severus/remus relationship and i liked it. But tbh it doesnt show much of their relationship, as it's mainlt drarry and focused more on the amazing plot.

I have other fics but they all would include Snupin as secondary pairing, or in one as a trio (Harry/Severus/remus) .. yay or nay ?? Lol

** Eh, I'm more inclined to the headcanon that divination is /supposed/ to be about seeing the present. Scrying and tracking and so forth, not prophecy. Seems to me that constantly divining the future would be really really hard to write well; there'd be a constant "Why didn't they predict X?" problem.
