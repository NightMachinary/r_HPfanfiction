** It'[s more Magical e-mail (m-mail) than Texting, but the messages play a large part in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]] by Jeconais (complete).

The central conceit of the story is that /The Power He Knows Not/ is actually ignorance - as long as Harry doesn't know that something is supposed to be impossible, he can generally figure out a way to do it (such as pausing in the middle of Apparition to look around or change his destination).

This ability is promptly weaponized by the Hogwarts teachers, although they do note that it leaves Harry at significant risk of magically draining himself if he isn't careful.

*** There's also the Naked Quidditch Match, where Jeaconis got the idea for M-Mail in This Means War.
