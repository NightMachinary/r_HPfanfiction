** Hey there! Been following this story of yours for a while, would absolutely love to see some new chapters. The Timefall chapter was absolutely amazing!!

There is so much I can relate to the depiction of Harry and Hermione in their old age and for that, this has become one of my favorite stories because we never really see "old" versions of these characters!

Please do update as quickly as you can, good sir!

#+begin_quote
  This tale intends to chronicle Harry and Hermione's adventures and lives well into their old age after World War 3. It starts off sweet but quickly heads into the thriller territory, and some parts of it are truly intense, going to never before seen places in Wizarding World with a Civil War brewing up, and a mysterious Auror with an agenda of his own. Romantic Thriller. Harmione.
