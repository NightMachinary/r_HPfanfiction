I've come across an author or two whose stories sound awesome but for one reason or another they have chosen to take their work off of the web. Would it be considered disrespectful or in poor taste to ask about for anyone who may have a copy or even to approach the author themselves for a copy to read privately (provided you can find a contact for them?)


** If the author pulled it they don't want it out anymore. Tracking them down to ask for a copy you will 'never share' would probably... not be welcome.

I don't see any reason not to ask if anyone still has a copy though.

** People yank their stories for a variety of different reasons. Obviously others have read it, and they may be simply removing the earlier version so that they can re-present their ideas in a better way, and/or to a different or wider audience, possibly for profit. It could be that they just don't want to hear from people criticizing their work or harassing them for more. I'd say the essential point is that the author is disassociating themselves from the work. So, anything you do to reconnect the two is working against that intent.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asking the author for a copy of something you enjoyed. The author can choose to ignore the request or say 'no', but there's no insult in asking. You're still honoring their decision and their right to control access to their property. This is the most legitimate avenue, in fact.

Asking others if they have a copy is the more rude action, in that you're attempting to circumvent the action of having it removed, but only for your enjoyment.

Maintaining an archive of other peoples' works is akin to being a dealer or fence, in that you're keeping in circulation that which was retracted. The only thing not inconsiderate about it is that the author's retroactive anonymity may be able to be maintained, so long as searchable indexes aren't publicly accessible.

I have to disagree. If I published a physical book, I couldn't later recall it from everyone who has a copy and I can't stop the lending or giving it to others. Once it's published, it's published and the only way to keep this control is to DRM it and then flip the kill switch. If an author doesn't want their works out there, forever, they have to choose not to publish.

**** Works published for profit are a different matter. They are subject to mandatory editorial oversight, and the process of handing the work over to an agency to circulate it and generate revenue is a business relationship. Fanfiction is amateur writing, and while posting to the internet may indeed mean you'll never be able to destroy the work, there is no implication that you as a writer should be held accountable for it for the rest of your life. We are assured at least the assumption of anonymity.

Besides which I said it was rude, not illegal or sinful.

Slightly off topic, but do you mean to say that publishers can do something that makes a DRM-protected ebook no longer function?

***** Yeah. [[http://boingboing.net/2016/05/07/kobo-upgrade-deprives-read.html]]

It's easy to strip the drm, or so I hear, and many legitimate sites actually recommend it. But yeah, it's possible to kill-switch a book. Same with ITunes and other services before they quit using DRM. If the DRM server was shut down then the songs wouldn't play. I done think Apple had this problem but I remember reading about it for other vendors.

** Do it /privately/.

If the author has pulled the fic from circulation, then there's most likely a /very/ good reason behind it.

** Like most have said, I think that when an author takes stories down it's because they don't want them to be read any more for whatever reason.

I must admit, when I started posting fanfiction, I didn't give a second thought to what might happen when I had had enough. Now I am edging towards taking my own stuff down, it's not such an easy decision to make. I have no reason to think anyone likes it well enough to have saved a copy, but I can't know.

When you put something out on the internet, like it or not, you can't control what happens to it.

*** If the author of the derivative work was infringing on the original work's copyright when they created it, you would also be infringing by distributing it.

Contrariwise, if they were not infringing on the original work's copyright, they would have their own copyright on the derivative work. You would be infringing on /that/ copyright by distributing it.

Either way, it's illegal for you to distribute it, and it's not in the public domain.

***** Transformative derivative works have copyright. However, the determination of whether a work is transformative, in the general case, requires a court decision. This is true in the UK and the US.

  shut up about that which you only have passing knowledge of.

I've actually researched this topic. You apparently haven't. You are merely vomiting your preconceptions multiple times, and repetition doesn't make your position stronger. Nor does increasing vitriol.

** If I take down a story, I don't want to think about it, at least not in that version. I don't want people messaging me about it. I don't want it reviewed. I don't want kudos or favorites regarding it.

I personally wouldn't mind other people offering a mirror, or sharing it among themselves, but I don't want people to talk to me about it.

Other people have different considerations. They might want the work not to exist, instead of just wanting a communications blackout.

*** I like to think that this is how most people view it. When Maya left she actually put out a PDF of all of the stories for the existing fans. Most of the time it is because they got published, so they let us share among ourselves and the publisher is happy that it isn't on the main websites out in the open.

** Sometimes the author has been advised to take stuff down when they were trying to get published or have been published. In other fandoms, such as Pride and Prejudice, stories are taken down for publication. I would say if the author has taken it down, its sad, but their wishes should be respected.

I do know a number of very successful writers who still write fanfic albeit under assumed names.
