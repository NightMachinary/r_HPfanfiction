Just a character I'd like someone to draw please get in touch if you want to.


** There is, believe it or not, a subreddit for this. Maybe even two. It's free, as well.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/characterdrawing/]]

Just in case nobody here responds, you have a second place to check. :)

** Hi. I'm willing to give it a go. Is digital art ok or do you want a more traditional piece? (Also, which character do you want)
