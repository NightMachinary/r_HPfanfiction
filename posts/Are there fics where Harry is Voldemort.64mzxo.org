...besides The 7th Horcrux? Where Harry is completely taken over by the horcrux or gets permanently possessed at any point in his life. Thanks!


** There was a 1 or 2-shot story where Harry dies and is reborn as Voldemort, in the past. He remembers Hermione's warning that bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time, and so spends his entire second life acting out Voldemort exactly as he remembered it, hating himself all the while but too terrified to stop. The end implies that there never was a Voldemort to begin with, and that Harry suffered at his own hands.

No idea what it was called, though.
