Which do you prefer? For the purposes of this discussion, let's say that oneshots are one-off, <15k word works and long fics are one-offs or series with 100k+ words.

Oneshots are bandaids for the soul to me. Oneshots are great for pre-bed reading as less time is needed and no unfulfillment is produced. Fluff is nice to read as a pick-me-up, and some of the best smut I've seen has been in the form of one-shots. Also, the shortness of oneshots usually means that the writing quality is better. However, certain oneshots just leave me hollow inside, despite being the fluffiest shit ever. The feeling of envy and jealousy really burns a hole in your soul at 2 am. Salt to the wound? I'm jealous of the lives of /made up people in a made up world/. I think it speaks volumes about my state of mind.

Long fics are more like casts, if we continue the analogy. Most of my time is spent on long fics, purely because as a chronically lazy person, I much prefer not having to switch fics all the time. My reading speed is also better with long fics as well. I burned through linkffn(Black Bond) in 6 days the first time, and 4 days the second. Long fics are also good for rereading, slightly more so than oneshots. The drawback to all this? The buildup and concept can be great, but the climax and execution can be pure shit. A certain 'Harry has a sister and elemental magic fic' caught my attention because I was interested in the concept of Harry having siblings, but I couldn't get past the first chapter since my eyes had started bleeding from the atrocious grammar and shit dialogue. Other times, the climax is disappointing and my whole experience is ruined. This often leads to my favourites list being short one fic after a reading session. I like to call these fics 'Ruined Orgasm fics' or 'League of Nations fics'.

Oh, and uh, link your favourites of each because I actually am going to have to reread Black Bond if I don't get new recs. I blew through the Ginny/Luna post in an hour and now am shaking my head in despair.


** Oneshots have the advantage of being quick to read, so I'm generally inclined to read them more often simply because they fit around my day better and I don't get the strong feeling to continue (since I'm already finished). Additionally, if I'm reading oneshots it's because I'm looking for a light bit of comedy and fluff, oneshots require less investment and feel less daunting so I can get to the parts I actually want quicker.

On the other hand oneshots don't stick with me-and bar a few I never had the urge to re-read them nor do I get the quite the same feeling of satisfaction and contentment after a particularly good long story.

I would say I prefer longer stories to oneshots in general. But if I'm looking for light funny stories I prefer oneshots.

** Uh, in-between? Short fics always leave me wanting more, but I'm wary of fics anywhere over 150K as a lot of the time the authors unfortunately include a lot of unnecessary detail and tend to fall into tedium instead of maintaining a dynamic story. 80 to 90K is usually the goldilocks zone for me, in pages its about +150+ 250, making it the average novel length, it's long enough to be satisfying, but short enough so as not to drag on.

*** I'm in the same boat. Only my cut off is somewhere in the 300k range. Unless there is some plot or character device that I'm interested in seeing completed, I fizzle out of the story.

I'm not too interested in searching for new shorter oneshots, but I do enjoy reading ones that are recommended here or on my favorite authors pages.

** Long fics, from 300k to 1,5m is fine by me. I'm not really a fan of OS, the only I've enjoyed is Ice Princess, mostly because Daphne is such a sweetie in it.

** Most stories on my favorites list are multi-chapter long fics. There's 11 one shots.(Out of 113). Some of the others are WIPs that looked somewhat interesting. In general I prefer longer stories but I appreciate a good one shot.

For good long fics Debt of Time linkffn(10772496) Divided and Entwined linkffn(11910994)

My favorite one shot is linkffn(Canis Major by amidtheflowers)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** i prefer long, sometimes novel length, fic for harry potter just because i love reading about magic. for other fandoms i have no opinion and tbh most other fandoms don't tend to write 600k fics.

however im a big fan of rare pairs and you normally only ever get random oneshots with those so i've come to appreciate them.
