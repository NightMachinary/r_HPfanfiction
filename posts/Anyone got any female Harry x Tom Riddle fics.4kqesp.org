I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium][Moratorium]] and really enjoyed it. But I haven't had much luck finding any others.


** Not to jack your post, and I dont know of any of what you requested, but I would honestly be curious if there were examples of the opposite as well. Male Harry, but a Female Voldemort or Tom Riddle.

**** Well, Wormtail botched the ritual and a beautiful woman climbed out of cauldron instead of that ugly snake face.

Or the Diary could have used Ginny's form instead of the 16 year old Tom Riddle, just to keep low profile. Merging and taking over Ginny's soul not only cured his insanity, but also had other side effects....

***** These are interesting concepts. I particularly like the idea of him using Ginny's form. It would be an interesting idea for someone to dive into. Voldemort comes back as Ginny (keeping in mind that that version of Riddle does not have full memories of later life), and under the influence of Harry (and Hermione/Luna/other friends of hers), changes viewpoints some. Perhaps she and Harry become dark lords, but maybe less evil... more focused on changing the wizarding world then worrying about muggles or pureblood philosophy. Or maybe just as evil. Or maybe not evil at all.. maybe they go light... or something inbetween.

Point is.. it could go in so many directions both due to Riddles smarts/thoughts/ideas/concepts/drive now being in a female body, and the fact that there would be no true memories of the later form of Riddle (aka Voldemort).
