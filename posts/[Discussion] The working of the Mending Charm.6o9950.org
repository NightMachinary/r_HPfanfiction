The Mending Charm, with the incantation being /Reparo/, has long been a interest of mine when looking at it's working.

The *Harry Potter Wiki* states that the Mending Charm is

#+begin_quote
  The Mending Charm will repair broken objects with a flick of the wand. Accidents do happen, so it is essential to know how to mend our errors.
#+end_quote

Is the Mending Charm classified as time magic and how does it work?

It is used in the recent movie /Fantasitic Beast And Where To Find Them/

#+begin_quote
  Newt Scamander repaired Jacob Kowalski's apartment using this charm after several fantastic beasts escaped from his magical case and broke up his belongings and blasted through a wall.
#+end_quote

That excerpt tells me you dont have to know exactly what your fixing in order for it to be repaired as he wouldn't have had the ability to completely memorize the apartment before it was destroyed.

This is also proven later in the movie when...

#+begin_quote
  After an Obscurial went on a path of destruction through New York City in the 1920s, Aurors walked the streets using this charm to restore buildings.
#+end_quote

So how does this spell actually work? Does it use time magic to restore a object to it's previous form or what else is in play?

** magic in harry potter is based on concepts rather than physical entinities. avada kedavra for example kills by making something dead rather han stopping your heart or destroying your brain. Reparo on the other hand simply makes something broken be repaired.

We also see the same spells use different means to achieve their purpose. for example the cleaning charm scourgify can produce soap, or it can vanish dirt. so it can be assumed that mending spells would depending on the skill of the caster do what ever it takes to repair an object

*** Magic requires focus, willpower, and intent. I think intent is what changes the effects of a properly cast spell, like the aforementioned /Scourgify/ charm. /Reparo/ is based on the intent of: fix whatever is broken.

** I think it can use time magic to see a blueprint of what 'fixed' should look like, but it uses only the pieces available at hand to reassemble everything and then bond it together as it had been before. I say this because Harry used a Reparo to reattach the wrong cover on his Advanced Potion Making textbook.

There's reason to think that other spells do this as well; reversing transfigurations doesn't require knowing exactly what the object used to look like. McGonagall was able to restore Draco to his fully-clothed self from being a ferret.

**** If what's missing is rare or unique [Hope diamond; first issue of Action Comics], probably not. If what's missing is magical, definitely not. Ollivander could restore Harry's broken wand to its original appearance, but it was functionally still broken- though not 'dead', as it could try to execute spells but the effect would re-break the poor thing.

By contrast, Hermione didn't need every sliver of glass and lost screw in order to fix Harry's glasses to like-new.

***** now I need to figure out what is the limit of not rare items being allowed before the item is so saturated in magic, it won't work it's original purpose
