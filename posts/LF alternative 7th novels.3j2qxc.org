I heard around here recently that there were some pre-2007 (and some post-2007) fics that were allegedly better than Deathly Hallows. Anyone know of any?


** I know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] is an alternate version of DH. It's a pretty good read, too!

** linkffn(Blessed by Erised Burning) is pretty good, if you can do with a little surrealism.

Despite how much DH sucked, I haven't seen a better 7th year fic. This goes to all the books, tbh.

** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2979751/1/Hollow][Hollow]], which is a Drarry version of post!HBP, probably written before DH existed since the Horcruxes are different.

As long as you are fine with the pairing (as there is quite some focus on it) you might like it, because although it has been a while since I last read it I remember that there were some interesting ideas, including how they dealt with the Horxcruxes.

** I don't know about better, but its entertaining. Kind of. Its slash though, with Harry/Young!Sirius and Remus/Tonks.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

**** No, it is not abandoned, I believe the author has said so before on this very forum . There are plenty of stories with regular 1+ year time periods between updates. On the Way To Greatness, for instance.

****** The update time of stories does not stay constant and the rate of chapters with time may well increase in the future. Even assuming that this does not happen, then this particular story has a projected length of 10 chapters. Therefore it would only be about 7 years.

Regardless, you did not claim that the story would take too long to complete, only that it is abandoned, which it is not.

******** That is actually not absurdly long in fanfiction time. There are plenty of fics which have taken about that long to complete. I can't think of many off the top of my head but I know that HPMOR took five years.
