Peter Pettigrew betrayed James, Sirius, Remus and Lily, despite being a Gryffindor; Regulus found out that Voldemort had a Horcrux, and tried to destroy it; despite being a Slytherin, and from a dark family.

Zacharias Smith was very jerkish; and from my memory didn't even fight in the final battle, and instead chose to run away instead of being the typical Hufflepuff loyalty you tend to see. Albus had moments where he hid things and was quite cunning, which lead him to a possibility in being Slytherin (He wasn't, but he could have been), similarly Harry could have been a Slytherin in different circumstances.

Et cetra, et cetra.

Any stories where we see characters act different or more realistic than normal? For instance not all Slytherins hating Muggleborns or following Voldemort. Not all Ravenclaw being someone who is book smart or into studying all of the time. (Think to Luna Lovegood).

Not all Gryffindors are loud/outgoing/fighters, et cetra; et cetra. (Think to Peter Pettigrew; or even Neville Longbottom; well with how he was in the beginning). Maybe even some Slytherins even helping Harry or others out for whatever x reason.

Hufflepuffs who do great at school like a Ravenclaw, Hufflepuffs who are ambitious or cunning as a Slytherin, Hufflepuffs who are bold and outgoing like a Gryffindor (Kind of think Nymphadora Tonks or something from Hufflepuff).

Because when you're eleven to when you're say seventeen years old, you tend to be two very different people by the end of it. People grow and change.

Just looking for more stories involving more different characters with personalities than you'd think.


** The Best Revenge and its sequel have a lot of well-rounded characters of all four Houses (and Harry himself is sorted into Hufflepuff here) linkffn(4912291)

The secret language of plants series linkao3(9323225) has an socialist Draco, rebel Pansy and a relatively minor Hufflepuff villain, among other elements that make it absolutely awesome

The Child of Azkaban linkao3(15068012) has a Ravenclaw Harry with friends from all 3 other houses (Theodore Nott, Neville and a Hufflepuff OC) who do not fall under usual House stereotypes, though I liked this fic mostly for its first part where Harry is rased by Sirius in Azkaban and not Hogwarts stuff.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Hufflepuffs who do great at school = Their names are Cedric Diggory and Newt Scamander.

I just linked to a fic with a goofy Slytherin Love interest for Harry. The usual trope for it is the Slytherin Ice Queen who cunningly climbs up the social ladder to help Harry.\\
Linkffn(11487772) - Please don't think I'm spamming the same fic. It was by chance suited in both threads.

  'Don't think of it as a marriage contract, I don't! It makes it easier- think of it as ... an amalgamation agreement. Makes it sound less complicated.' Harry/Daphne. EWE.
