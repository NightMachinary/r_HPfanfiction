:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been searching for this fic for months now and for the life of me can't remember the title of this fan fiction. All I remember is that the title has something like "the journal of a witch" or "accounts of a witch"

basically the premise of this is that after the end of the 2nd war with voldemort only a few days after the battle, the muggles bomb most magical places like Hogwarts, diagon alley, the ministry etc. Magical creatures became extinct many lives of wizards and witches all around the world loss in the night of the bombing.

The few magicals that did survive the bombing clustered inside the caves of Mt.Everest, after months or years on the mountain the people appointed Harry(fem harry in this fic) as the first Druid then followed by his friends (Hermione the planner , Ron the builder (the only Weasley that survived), Neville the herbologist and Luna who has an acromantula along (not sure if she's the one who brought it). To keep the peace inside the mountain they made every magicals there to swear on their magic not to harm any other magicals inside the mountain.

Then they started making the caves habitable. Finding clean water, making rooms for individuals, venturing out to gather plants & magical plants and finding muggleborns. Little by little the druids rebuild there society, they don't use wands because there's no more magical creatures which disappeared after the bombing so instead they use wandless magic. Then the babies that were born in the mountains have larger magical core (the druids theorize the cause of it and conclude that children born near the hearth of the mountain can have larger cores than the past who lives above grounds)

Something to point out in this fic is that the surviving magicals turned subterranean, digging through the mountains

Centuries pass when harry encounter a muggle father who seeks them out hoping to cure his daughter. Harry helps the man but has a dilemma later on whether or not they should interact again with muggles after what they done to the whole magical world.

Harry died before she could contact the surface world and inform them of there existence. It was Teddy her successor who initiated the first contact and letting the muggle world know that they're not the only one living on earth.

I'm not sure if the fic is still around or that the author deleted it for some reason. It's a one shot that has a word count of 12k or 15k, it those have a sequel but is on haitus or abandoned, I found it in fan fiction.net and was hoping some of you could link it here. Thanks!
