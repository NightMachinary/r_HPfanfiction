Person A puts the target in danger, person B saves the target risking their own life, creating a life debt of target to B.

They select the next target, A obliviates B of the knowledge that it's planned, rinse and repeat until they have an army of indebted targets.

Would this actually work?


** In canon Life Debts seem more like an honor thing. It didn't stop Pettigrew from helping to kidnap Harry, and it really didn't stop Snape's abuse of Harry.

** Howdy, Partner!

What I here now do is some pretty humble work. I'm out in the fields all day, rescuing people from my perimeter of hidden punji stick traps. Yep, everyone who comes to my good ol' midwestern winery gets to enjoy being skewered by those 6' spikes.

It's simple work, but gosh darn it, it makes me feel like I'm makin' a difference.
