I'm a huge fan of the Deadpool comics and a lot of the humor in them bullies the fourth wall into submission or breaks it entirely. Rewatching the movie put me in the mood for more fourth wall abuse, hopefully from the Harry Potter cast!

I've read *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, which is similar to what I'm looking for. So anything remotely close to that would also, probably, scratch my itch.

Bonus points if it's Luna casually murdering the fourth wall while everyone else is blissfully unaware and confused. Fingers crossed that this exists!

Thank you in advance!


** I can't think of any HP fics that make the cut, but there's a hilarious Avatar: The Last Airbender fic that has little semblance of a fourth wall. linkffn(Bring Me All Your Elderly!)

  After watching "The Last Airbender" movie, the appalled members of Team Avatar decide it's up to them to fix the movie by coaching their live-action counterparts on how to be more like them. Hilarity ensues. Canon pairings, but lots of weirdness later.
