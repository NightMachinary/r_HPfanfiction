For those who don't recognize the quote, it basically means this prompt would entail post-Deathly Hallows Harry creatively giving the death eaters all they want... In the most punishing, unforgiving ways possible. (Used an alternate name just cause Boy-Who-Lived takes some oomph out the Fury part.)


** I have a guilty love for Scary! Harry. I would love to see a fic from the Death Eater's perspective on how horrifying Harry seems when he was seemingly killed and yet came back to life.

** "He never once raised his voice. That was the worst thing. The Fury of the undying Saviour. He defeated Demons and Creatures and our Master we saw as a God, and even Death itself could not hold him, and yet he ran away from us. He was being kind"

"He wrapped my Father in Magical Chains, locked in a void created to trap the Dementors, and bound my Father's soul to his body. My Father was kissed by the Dementors constantly, but his soul never left, but he wished it did"

"He tricked my Mother into an Egyptian Tomb, forever cursing her with undeath, her once beautiful looks faded to that of a different kind of Mummy"

"He still visits my betrothed, Pansy, once a year. A new set of Wizarding Mirrors came out. If you hear a girl's voice answer you when you ask how you look, it's always her. She's in every Mirror, you might even see her out of the corner of your eye, thinking it's just an illusion, but it's always her"

"As for me... I was suspended in time, and made to work in what he called a Muggle Compost factory, whilst I had cuts all over my body. I couldn't leave, i couldn't take a break, and the compost would always leak into my wounds. I was eternally going to be a Mudblood"

"We wanted the Malfoy family to live forever... He made sure we did"

**** It's a quote from a Doctor Who two-parter, called “Human Nature”/“Family of Blood” IIRC. It's an alright pair of episodes IMO, I personally never quite got into it but there are loads of people who will practically swear by them. The ending though... the quote is originally from the ending (it's been modified here, obviously) and is my favourite thing about the episodes.

** linkffn(Wish Carefully)

It's not /quite/ undying eldritch terror Harry Potter, but it does have some of the flavor.

linkffn(On A Pale Horse)

Immortal "Harry is Death" fic. It is, ironically, quite dead, and long abandoned.

** ‘We followed him, hoping to find his Hallows. And he ran away from us, as he always did, hiding with muggles and their ilk. Even Obliviated himself. So we threatened his little girlfriend, hoping it would break the memory block. And it did. She screamed so loud, /begging/ him to remember. Finally he stopped playing dumb. We agreed to meet to exchange his girlfriend for his hallows.'

The pale young man opposite me stopped here, seemed unable to continue. His face was difficult to describe: his skin seemed to have great difficulty hanging onto his bones, his eyes seemed hidden in his skull, and his shoulders were hunched over so much it reminded me of the foetal position. His hair - once, he assured me, very beautiful - was gray and tangled now, and several pieces of comb stuck out here and there. He took a deep breath and continued: ‘he came to Bella first, in the night before we would meet. We- we found her later. She was -‘ He hesitated, trying - I thought - to make himself say it. ‘- tortured into insanity. By... herself, apparently.' I didn't say anything. ‘My father was next. He always wanted to be our Lord's right hand. So he is, now...forever.'

‘How come?' I asked, curious despite my mounting horror.

‘He is his House Elf,' the man opposite me explained. ‘Bound to our Lord, forever. Even with our Lord's death, he's bound to his grave, tending it as best as he can. Punishing himself when he can't, no matter the reason. ‘

There was a pause, in which he finished his drink. I gave him another.

‘He never once raised his voice,' he told me. ‘That was the worst of it. At the meeting, he was almost calm. He told us all, quietly, our fates... that's when we realized the fury of the Savior of the -‘ he stopped himself. ‘World.'

‘Peter, who avoids danger at all cost and wants to, like, never be hurt, know what I mean?'

He looked up at me, and I didn't know what to make of this look. It seemed to me he was pleading for... help? Understanding?

I nodded, although I had no idea what he meant. You'd have done the same if you were there.

‘So he got trapped. If you ever see a rat with a missing paw, it's him. Always.'

‘Surely it can't be /every/ rat?'

He looked almost offended. ‘Of course not! Just the ones missing a paw.'

I decided he was loony and ignored it.

‘He still visits him sometimes, you know,' he continued. ‘Just sits down and tells him about his friends. He can never die. His soul is split and bound to all those...' he came to a shuddering stop.

‘My mom... well, she got a long sentence in a really bad prison, in the last cell that used the most terrifying guards - they're not used anymore - because she was complicit, but he went easy on her. The others... well, Crabbe and Goyle...,' he stopped. ‘Ever read /Feeders and Eaters/?'

‘Yes, of course,' I said.

He grimaced. ‘When I found Goyle he was a lot like the cat. Y'know, alive from the upper half, all bones and sinews from the lower half. S-said Crabbe had nee-needed him. Begged me for death. I was his friend... you'd have done the same.'

I couldn't bear the look in his eyes. ‘So what happened to you?'

It was the wrong thing to say.

‘As for me...,' he said slowly. ‘I lost the things most dear to me. I got banned from the only home I had ever known, the only home I had thought /worth/ knowing.'
