I don't care how famous he got from that, the Neville Longbottom we know from canon would do anything to have his parents healthy and with him rather than the tortured and broken (or in this AU dead) people that they are in canon. He'd have Augusta to tell him all about how great his parents were and how he NEEDS to live up to their memory, especially now that he's expected to defeat Voldemort when he returns. (Augusta always believed in Dumbledore. I'll bet you anything she was just as convinced as Snape or Hagrid or anyone else in the Order that he'd return) Neville being the BWL would only put even more strain on him because he would still have the exact same confidence issues that prevented him from being a good wizard in the first 4 years of school.

To clarify, Lily dying for Harry when she was given the option to live ("step aside you stupid girl") was what placed the blood protection on Harry that let him survive the killing curse, Quirrel, possession by Voldemort and the killing curse again. If Neville was to be the actual Boy Who Lived (horcrux in his scar and all), not just a kid who somehow survived Voldemort, he would /need/ that same blood protection. Otherwise Voldemort would have killed him because canon states more than once that there is no other protection against the killing curse. So either Alice or Frank would have had to die for him to survive it and thus making him the Boy Who Lived.

Eh, isn't that just Dumbledore's overly romantic/idealistic interpretation of events? I never really bought that. Is he telling me that no witch ever sacrificed her life to protect her child? There's any number of reasons why Harry could have survived... maybe he's just born that way? Maybe Lily cast some kind of obscure curse on Voldemort or a protection spell on Harry? *shrugs*

And if you're writing an AU anyway it might be a good idea to find a better solution than a deus-ex-machina Blood protection to overcome Quirrelmort & Co.

******** So this is a thing that my view changed on over the course of my time reading fanfiction. When I first started, the idea that Lily used some special ritual or whatnot to protect Harry and allow him to live through her death was a very appealing concept to me, or the idea that the power was something other than just "love." Over time, though, I've come to really appreciate the conceptual basis for magic in the HPverse. It's kinda parallel to fighting in HP- Harry doesn't train to duel because Voldemort would wipe the floor with him, but all the important/key magic in the series is unique, specific, and almost always about emotion/feeling than dependent on power (i.e. the blood protection beating Quirrel, the Patronus, getting the Sword of Gryffindor, Priori Incantatem, Harry fighting off possession etc.) Fanfic is fun because it can take things in a different direction, but the core of magic in the actual HP canon is more about concepts.

One thing that wasn't initially clear to me was the concept of Occlumency and Legilimency and how that's influenced by emotions. In other fiction, you see stuff like mindscapes and whatnot, which really affect how people in fanon understood occlumency. In canon, it's really about the type of person you are- since Snape is naturally reticent and closed off, he's a natural occlumens. Since Voldemort is both magically powerful and naturally inquisitive/seeks knowledge, he's an effective Legilimens. One of the more fun concepts I've seen in fics takes the "fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself idea" and runs with it, so Voldemort is powerful because people believe that he is. Concepts, more than logic, dictate how magic really is.

Yea, originally I didn't like Dumbledore's power of love thing, but going back to it with the importance of concepts in mind makes it clear that yea, while the explanation may not be fully satisfactory, it's compelling from a literary perspective.

I'll probably make a separate post about this at a later date.

******** It only worked because Voldemort offered Lily the option to survive. Lily was a /willing sacrifice that Voldemort accepted/. She offered to trade her life for her son when she had been offered to be let go (something that only happened because Snape begged Voldemort to spare her and I really doubt any other mothers had had that option before). And it's more that "Dumbledore's overly romantic/idealistic interpretation of events", which we know because /Harry does the exact same thing/ and places the /exact same protection/ over everyone at Hogwarts because by the end of book 7 Voldemort still hasn't learnt to not make deals he doesn't intend to keep with sacrifice magic involved.

******** No, its not some overly romantic/idealistic interpretation of events. Wizards are beings of magic, and their actions carry greater consequence. Acts of bravery, love, sacrifice, these all have real and tangible effect. In Deathly Hallows we see Harry willingly accept his own death in order to protect others. Afterward Voldemorts spells won't hold anymore. The inverse of this is also true, acts of anger and hatred effect magic.

As for Lily using some sort of obscure magic to protect Harry. It demeans the act and the series as a whole. It makes everything less magical. The blood protection isn't deus ex machina, it was a genuine explanation set up in advance.

Voldemort only offered Lily the chance to step aside because of Snape, so it's pretty doubtful he ever did it before. I'm extrapolating a little bit here, but it seems to me that the standard operating procedure for Death Eaters and Voldemort was pretty much to just kill entire families indiscriminately.

************ True, but I think that regardless, the love sacrifice and the basically coincidental nature of how he was saved fits much better into the themes and tone of the story than Lily researching and finding some obscure ritual that somehow no one has ever found before that protects from the Killing Curse (or creating one, I guess, but although Lily certainly seems smart I think it's strange to imagine her succeeding there where every brilliant mind ever - Merlin, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, Nicolas Flamel - has failed). That's not JKR's style, which is why she's never given any reason to think that was the case and every reason to take the love explanation at face value. And frankly, this wouldn't be the most "ridiculous" coincidence in canon by far; Harry's constantly saved by luck and love.

To answer your point, I think it's still plausible considering: 1). Harry is the only known person to have survived, emphasis on known. Maybe there was another in all of human history who survived, but it wasn't recorded. (In fact, there would probably have to be if we go with the other option and assume there were some obscure ritual to protect against it. Why else would said ritual have been recorded?) and 2). The wizarding population is much smaller than the Muggle population (although there aren't really hard numbers as JKR is admittedly terrible with math). I actually don't think it's ridiculous to think that, among a small subgroup of people that view the Killing Curse as the ultimate evil, no one has decided to murder a child (or whomever, I guess it doesn't have to be a child), verbally offered the chance for someone else to walk away rather than be killed (and meant it) and the person verbally choosing to die instead. Maybe someone died sheltering a child, diving in front, etc., but I still don't think that's the same as a voluntary, verbal sacrifice where the other person actually could have walked away and not just been killed anyway. I think most people ready to use the Killing Curse, particularly during a war scenario, would be planning on killing everyone regardless and therefore the sacrifice wouldn't be a true one because the person involved in the bargain doesn't mean it. You can't sacrifice your life if it was already forfeit from the start.

(Side note: I remember being surprised as an American reading the books by how, for lack of a better word, /seriously/ they treated murder. I don't know quite how to put it, but in the media I was used to, violence and even murder were treated more, idk...casually. It was just expected that the bad guys would be murders, but in some of the scenes in the earlier books (I think Prisoner of Azkaban, when Sirius's supposed crimes and the Dementor's Kiss are discussed, although I could be wrong) there's still seemed to be this huge taboo in the wizarding world. This is despite the fact that there are probably a million ways the average person could murder someone - or maybe that's why there's that taboo, bc there has to be a larger cultural deterrent, I don't know. Regardless, I don't think it's strange for a society with those values - and the huge deterrent of a prison where you're essentially tortured into insanity with your own worst nightmares - to have known instances of the Killing Curse be rare enough that a specific set of circumstances have only happened once).

********************* If you know that Voldemort is after you, and your husband is a superb Quidditch Player, why wouldn't you have a broom ready to flee? And no, you can fly away from Voldemort - Harry did that in canon. They certainly would have had a much better chance to fly far enough to apparate especially with James holding him off for a bit. Hitting someone wildly evasive in the air is hard - and Voldemort missed Harry in the graveyard, when harry dove behind a tombstone, so it's not as if he has autoaim.

Adults are useless (just in the first book): McGonagall doesn't believe the kids, not even when they know about the stone, which they shouldn't. Dumbledore takes a broom to London, instead of the Floo, or apparition. Snape suspects Quirrell months before the finale, but nothing is done about it - despite attacks on Harry. The traps are so easy, a bunch of kids can get through them. Even if they are meant to let Voldemort through, they are so easy, he should smell a trap at the end. McGonagall sends a few kids into the forest, where a Unicorn killer is on the loose. And Hagrid splits the party.

It's all set up so the kids can save the day.

Fourth Book: Dumbledore knows someone is after Harry, but takes no precautions. Harry is thought a cheater and ostracised - nothing is done about it. Nothing is done about the attack on Hermione. Harry receives no help at all from any teacher, despite they supposedly being aware that he was forced to compete. His fellow champions receive lots of help. And yes, Dumbledore should have seen through Moody - at the very least, after Pettigrew, he should have been suspicious if he hasn't seen Moody for so long. And that doesn't even go into the whole shitty "Harry has to win the tournament so we can kidnap him" plan. That just begs for a "I can nab him during a Hogsmeade weekend, milord. He trusts me since I'm a teacher. Really, I can simply grab him and apparate..." moment.

#+end_quote

You don't need to carry a broom around - though with the shrinking Charm, you could - but are you a witch, or not? "Accio Broom!"

#+begin_quote
  Infants probably can't travel by side-along apparition. How do you tell them to hold on tight to your arm? That seems to be a pretty crucial bit. If they could, Dumbledore would have gone to get Harry and apparated him to Privet Drive, I assume.
#+end_quote

There's no indication that you can't hold on to someone and take them with you. At worst, do a Sticking Charm on their hand.

#+begin_quote
  Harry didn't fly away from Voldemort on a broom. He only survived because he passed through the protective charms of Shell Cottage (I think that was where it was). The others that Voldemort got near all died, basically.
#+end_quote

The "Flight of the Seven Potters" pretty much banked on people being able to evade pursuit.

#+begin_quote
  This is just utterly ludicrous. They aren't soldiers manning their posts. They aren't constantly standing guard 24/7. They think they're safe, protected by one of the oldest and closest friends. They would have to get onto a broom, which would be slow with the weight of multiple people, and fly at speed away from the most powerful dark wizard of all time, who would only be able to get there by breaking the Fidelius Charm.
#+end_quote

Have you read canon? "Take Harry and go" is what James says - he expects Lily to flee. And as I pointed out, having a broom ready is all too obvious with magic. Hell, Harry shows that you can summon them from far away in canon! And if your broom slows down with just you and a toddler on it, then it's a crap broom - people far heavier than Lily and Harry together use them easily.

#+begin_quote
  There's every chance that if Voldemort turned up they'd be asleep for heaven's sake. You literally don't understand how humans operate. Nobody sits around in a house they are confidence is utterly safe and secure like a robot on guard duty for months or years solidly unless their name is Alastor Moody. You're essentially 'metagaming'. Consider it from their perspective.
#+end_quote

You have no fucking idea about waiting, and being prepared, do you? Metagaming? My door has a lock, and a chain, and I use both. All I am saying is that they would have taken the most rudimentary precautions, unless they are suffering from plot-induced stupidity since they are in the middle of the worst war in Wizarding Britain's History.

#+begin_quote
  They're wrong. Snape isn't after the stone!
#+end_quote

But they know about the stone - which they were not supposed to. Anyone with half a brain would at least question them what they knew about the most important secret of the school. And, maybe, check on Quirrell, as the most suspect. Unless Snape, too suffers from terminal stupidity and never told anyone his suspicions. And yes, you don't need proof to investigate - that's how real life security works; if you have suspicions that someone is a threat or traitor, you investigate. And in this case, Quirrell would have been easy to investigate.

#+begin_quote
  Both invented while writing Chamber of Secrets. If it were George Lucas, it would be retconned no doubt, but I think it's fine as it is. Certainly not an illustration of stupidity.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore apparates at the very start of the book - "out of thin air".

#+begin_quote
  The traps are not easy. If a bunch of first years can get through, then they are easy. Especially when aimed at the most powerful and skilled dark wizard in British History. Who probably can blast his way through the obstacles anyway in a pinch - if the locked door can hold him off, why even have a key flying around? Give the key to Dumbledore! Or even, better, use the Fidelius to hide the stone!

  Nothing is 'stupid' about this at all. They're sent on a detention to the forest. A 'unicorn killer' is on the loose? Um, yeah? So are people killers. It's got dangerous animals in it. So what? They've got Hagrid. Again, Hagrid isn't very bright, we know this. Not a flaw in the writing.
#+end_quote

If you truly don't get that sending kids into a lethally dangerous forest on detention is stupid, then I hope you never, ever have anything to do with kids.

#+begin_quote
  No shit, sherlock. It's a book where the kids are the heroes. It's meant to be set up so the kids can save the day. What's important is that you understand that it's set up well.
#+end_quote

No, it's not set up well.

#+begin_quote
  There have always been people after Harry. No precautions? There are loads of precautions.
#+end_quote

So... he has an emergency portkey? He has constant guards when outside Hogwarts? His mail, and that to his friends sitting at the same table is screened for poison and other possible attacks? Hermione was sent a letter filled with buotuber puss.

#+begin_quote
  That has nothing to do with any of the staff at Hogwarts. What are they going to do about it? Stand up at the feast and say 'don't be mean to Harry Potter'? That would massively embarrass him and make things far worse.
#+end_quote

No. Everyone telling people that Harry was sent into the tournament against his will and is forced to compete wouldn't make things worse.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because helping students is cheating.
#+end_quote

Are you serious? An underage student is forced into a tournament that was cancelled because too many contestants died, and you think it's cheating to help him survive? Yeah, I hope you never, ever get put in charge of kids.

#+begin_quote
  Which is cheating.
#+end_quote

And the important difference is: Harry didn't choose to enter and was put there against his will. He needs and deserves the help.

#+begin_quote
  .. what? Pettigrew had nothing to do with this. Are you confusing this book with another one? How could Dumbledore have seen through Moody? He's less suspicious because he hasn't seen Moody in so long, for heaven's sake! He's acting very well as Moody.
#+end_quote

He should have been aware of possible traitors since Pettigrew.

#+begin_quote
  Nope. It's been said again and again why this will not work: Voldemort coming back has to be a secret.
#+end_quote

That is no argument at all. Harry disappearing from Hogsmeade? Can't take the pressure, boy ran off. Harry disappearing from the middle of a tournament with thousands of people watching? That'll get people to wonder. But either way isn't any more dangerous to the secrecy.

*********** But Lily couldn't be the /first person in the whole history of magic/ to be granted a choice to step aside. Far fetched.

I also LOATHE the idea that Lily performs the spell. How could she have done it? It actually detracts from her sacrifice in my opinion.

I personally choose to believe the theory that Voldemort unintentionally made an unbreakable vow with Snape which led to this whole Harry couldn't die because of Lily 's totally extraordinary and selfless sacrifice that Molly, Mrs Crouch or Narcissa wouldn't have made.

I'm DH, we see dear old Voldemort kill a woman who shields her children from him even though she knew that she was going to die and it was not oh-so-selfless-and-special.

Lily stepped between her son and Voldemort already knowing she was dead. If she had wanted to live in the first place she would have just left Harry there for Voldemort to kill. So she already knew that she was a goner. I also have a suspicion that she wasn't even truly listening to Voldemort because, frankly, I wouldn't have been listening then.

This is true. Voldemort mentions that he knew about such magic, but overlooked it in Harry's case. Which is not entirely surprising, because Dark Wizards would be usually focused on killing the parents without offering them any chances and killing children only as an afterthought.

But she was still just as selfless and brave. I'm also 110% sure that she wouldn't have stood aside since that was her natural instinct. Narcissa, Molly, and Mrs Crouch wouldn't step aside. Not to mention the millions of great mothers. Most, if not all, mothers wouldn't step aside.

Lily's sacrifice was nothing special because she knew that she was already dead. If she would've stood aside then she wouldn't have shielded him anyway. She'd have just run off so I don't know how that's special or how she could've changed her mind. She was sorted into Gryffindor when the hat barely touched her hair. So she's selfless in nature.

If Lily, however, was a selfish person, her sacrifice would've been truly special and much, much deeper. It would've meant something instead of Lily being selfless for every single person.

** For me it's stupid nicknames. I just find it cringey and this is coming from someone who has low fanfiction standards. Prime example: Dumbledork/dweeb. A character would have to have no respect for the D, be pretty childish (more than just immature) and have significant exposure to US culture to settle on that name - which doesn't fit any canon character at all. I laugh in the face of canon and, to a degree canon characterisation (oh Harry is half werewolf, half vampire, half merman, 110% bad at maths, in a loving relationship with 5 characters and an author-self-insert - whatever, no sweat) but apparently that epithet is a bridge TOO FAR. I just think it lets down fanfics that could otherwise be great.

The one exception to the above is My Immortal because it's inspired. Voldemint. I rest my case.

Probably the best example is Harry the Hufflepuff linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB) which is otherwise a great read (the denouement, the dress code and the quill development had me in stitches) but harry calling everyone nicknames was just really stupid e.g only referring to Hagrid as 'Tiny' and Draco as 'Slick'. I understand the author was going for: Harry is /so/ lazy that he cba to remember anybody's names. Nope. Nope. Nope. It's just cringey. I feel when I recommend it (and I do) I need to warn people about the names, that is worth reading but to just ignore that bit.

When it comes to stories that come highly recommended but I can't get past the summary section: wrong-BWL combined with Lily/James being crap/negligent parents, Harry having a different name for no reason, and girl who lived/Harriet Potter stuff when the story either doesn't need her to be a girl (totally different plot) or where the story is a literal rehash of canon with very little difference in events even though the character is a different gender. I think I'd rather read a more interesting trans!harry or alternatively, something which is genuinely lampshading how the plot may have differed if Harry were female. This is not to say these stories (that come recommended) are bad, they're almost certainly awesome and I'm missing out and I should just bite the bullet and give it a chance but that's my personal irrational summary discrimination for ya!

*** Agreed about the nicknames and canon rehashing. But I read one once that had the most brilliant nickname for Voldemort. Harry, as a real eleven year old does, mispronounces things and so calls him Volauvent. He gets confused because it sounds like something his aunt had him cook and why would Voldemort name himself after a pastry?

**** You see, that makes sense and is adorable! Using nicknames or mispronouncing names is pretty human. It can be a good way of fleshing out a characters background e.g. Harry being more familiar with pastries than dark lords due to his muggle upbringing. Having your character use low effort/ dismissive/dumb nicknames though is likely to just makes your character seem immature rather than the mature/edge-lord/heir-of-everything/grey!character that's being aimed for. In the end if your character shows so little respect for/is not intimidated by the obvious power/authority/knowledge that dumbledore clearly has (outside of AUs) I feel they should be mature/intelligent enough to come up a better insult for dumbledore lol.

He then wonders around the ministry (looking for lunch I think?) and /accidently/ happens across the Department of Mysteries. At which point he goes, "I know I already figured out that Voldemort is sending me these dreams to lure me here, but I'm just going to play along for no reason anyways." I think he even knew the prophecy before entering, but I'm not sure. That instantly killed the fic for me.

But I agree with you about Harry. He's got the dark arts thing and quidditch, I can't think of anything else he expressed too much interest in. I mean, Hermione had knitting and Ron had chess. But maybe it's hard to develop any significant interests when you're hated for the first eleven years and you have someone actively trying to kill you for next seven? I love a good fic that explores that, or that sees Harry developing an interest completely separate from dark lords or quidditch. Read a great one once about him becoming a potions master.

Yes, there are reasonable explanation just as there are reasonable questions. Anyone in that universe could have, should have, asked questions and if someone came to conclusion that Dumbledore was indeed manipulative and cunning (regardless of being evil or not) than he would be justified.

THere is nothing wrong with being manipulative. If sacrificing one lamb can protect lives of thousand of sheep than you should sacrifice that lamb. I would have done whatever Dumbledore did if I was in his position.

I read one recently that was particularly bad, so bad that a reviewer actually requested the author stop it. Seriously, it was several pages (of ebook) taken up with comments on comments I hadn't read. It's useful when authors address misconceptions or when a reviewer says something that actually is useful to other readers. But y'know, I'm here for the story not chatting about whether the reviewer also comes from your city and if they also like your favourite pancake place. There is a reply button for that.

***** Totally on board with adding context, chatting ideas and getting a feel for the authors direction for the story e.g:

A/N: this was a difficult chapter to write but you guys will be glad to know I've already finished the next chapter.

Or

A/N: sorry guys for the delay, I've been concentrating on school work

Or

A/N I've been getting lots of reviews asking about pairings- I haven't decided if this is going to be XY or XZ ship yet but I'm amendable to bribery and good reviews ;). Username1 asked about the relevance used by the catchphrase Ron used in the previous chapter - it's a line from a British sitcom that was popular in the 90s I like the idea that Arthur and Ron love this show. Astute readers have also been noticing references to Popular Album alas this isn't plot relevent I'm just really digging it right now. The spell used in this chapter is shamelessly stolen (with permission) from username2's fic: 'Harry potter and the thing that happened'. If you haven't read that fic -go read it now it's epic. Again& thanks to my beta Username3. Without her help this fic would never have been embarked on.

I don't mind thanking betas or answering reviews that ask questions that may interest 'the group' as it were. It's when the author writes loads of waffle continuing a conversation over several chapters that doesn't relate to the story.

A/N: User: yeah I've totally been to that IHOP in Major City. How do you find the raspberries User2: yeah schoolwork can be a bitch User3: I agree, I think Hagrid should be paired with the skrewt nothing else makes sense User4: I'm excited about the new spiderman movie - have you seen Dunkirk yet? User5: aww Thanks User6: thanks! I'm glad you're enjoying the story User7: yiiiiiiis User8: I agree wholeheartedly User9: I'm going to Alaska to see my family, do you have anything nice planned? ... Etc

This isn't even an exaggeration, the fic I referenced before was answering literally every review, often 20 or so with detailed responses that were often nothing to do with writing, harry potter, fandom or whatever. It was just half a conversation had with 20 people over multiple chapters. It was like hearing one side of a telephone call mixed with an Oscar acceptance speech. Many of the responses were like : 'haha!' - I mean at least share with the class what's funny ;).

** I can think of one on the top of my head, since it's still a sore spot. A story has this nice Harry/muggle OC romance going on for most of it (47/54 chapters). Then, on chapter 48, they freaking broke up so that Harry could go to Ginny, for the sole reason of "By the way you were talking about Ginny, you're still in love with her, Harry."

And "the way you were talking about her" here is consisted of two instances where Harry told her how Ginny was an obsessed fan girl but gradually grew out of it, only to reject Harry when he confessed, despite her still loving him. Basically canon with a little twist.

It was like, "BAM!", Harry gave up the girl that he got serious feeling for, whom he depended on for months to go back to an unhealthy relationship. Completely out of nowhere. I'm not against Harry/Ginny, but the way the author handled the switch was just horrible. Dropped right then and there and not bothered to check out the sequel.

Instead, from the start up until the moment they really talked about Ginny in chapter 47, it was all fluff about Harry and the OC's days together, as well as how he missed her. Ginny was almost completely out of the picture, was barely given a thought until she was needed to break the couple up.

*** I powered through the timeskip in Delenda Est and while it ends well enough, it just feels like the author was hitting bullet points rather than making a story that flows naturally. The thing that really killed it for me were the extra Potter kids. Leo Black was fine, but the Potter kids were just awful, especially Deus Ex Seer girl I can't even remember the name of even though I read the fix last month. Timeskip shouldn't have been more than five years, enough time for Voldemort to really be winning, but short enough where new kid OCs don't exist or they do but aren't relevant. Or just stay in the damn past!

**** The world after 20+ years of alive Voldemort felt too peaceful. And I agree that the Potter kids were annoying as shit, though they got a bit better near the end. I think the author did the time skip because he had Voldemort's rise to power occur so late compared to canon. He needed time for Voldemort to build up his forces.

I had a major problem with how competent Bellatrix was. She was barely of age throughout the entirety of the fic. Yet she beat James in a duel, figured out how to trace Voldemort's other horcruxes and was successfully manipulating the shit out of all of these experienced veterans and politicians.

Harry didn't feel nearly as OP even though he was a powerhouse.

However, in the end I still enjoyed the fic.

Hermione being a loner is stupid anyways. Just because she wasn't immediately accepted by everyone in Hogwarts (in a lot of cases because she's a muggleborn) fandom has drawn this elaborate picture around her having always been a loner and super shy or shit like this.

When we see her first in the train she seems to be pretty self-confident and bossy, pretty much taking it for granted that people accept her. This is not how a loner kid behaves. I always imagined her childhood as "sheltered", for lack of a better term: Very posh, upper class schooling, etc... her being in some kind of 'gifted schooling' program where she's isolated from normal bullying and stuff would actually make a lot of sense. I imagine her having interacted with a lot more adults than children of her own age, explaining her difficulty in communicating without sounding condescending.

** I think it was 'Magics of the Arcane' and i bailed when the author wrote a sequence where Fleur was raped by her betrothed, an older OC.

I despise the use of rape as a drive for narrative progression or character growth. It is inevitably mishandled and could be easily exchanged by a host of lesser or non-sexual crimes.

It's typically crass exploration and little more and I have to have a lot of trust in an author to push through and that is not something I would normally extend to Fanfiction writers or unseasoned writers in general.

** The only specific instance I can think of is this story which had a very interesting summary but after starting the first chapter I just couldn't do it. It had a muggle born family move to privet drive on like the same day that Harry is put there. Not to bad by itself but the parents somehow know that their 1 year old child is magical and also became magical themselves. I read that and just had to leave it.

In general though things that I really avoid are having Harry and Hermione be friends just because, even if it doesn't fit with the story and take on the characters. Putting Hermione into a multi pairing (not generally something I read but some are very well done and can be pretty fun reads) again just to do it. As a character Hermione just doesn't mesh well with too many other people and I've yet to find a truly well written Hermione that isn't purposely OOC.

Also using some mysterious power that Luna has to move the story along or to tell the main characters important information. It just never feels right and shows a lack of creativity.

I'm reading The Difference One Man Can Make by jeon1801, a HP X Game of thrones/Song of ice and fire crossover that has a rather interesting premise but the execution is just so heavy handed. It's the type that isn't bad per say but features a pretty obvious self insert Harry who is praised so damn often. Like I get it Harry is good at stuff, you made him really good at stuff, please stop makings every character talk about how good at stuff Harry is.

Complaints aside I'm 5 chapters in and still reading it (mostly in hope it'll get better and justify the 4k reviews it has) but if anyone here has read it and considers it worth continuing feel free to holla at me.

These days, only when I'm converting from PDF, because I have to read the whole thing to make sure the formatting is correct. Thus far, nothing's ever got better, only worse.

I used to power through fics (and books) on the hope that they would improve and the thought of "oh well, I started so I might as well finish", but there's so much fic (and so many books) out there that I just don't want to waste the time anymore.

** Whenever at some point I'm reading a Harry that is supposed to be more closed off, and doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve. Yet he doesn't actually go through the process of thinking before he speaks. It gets so annoying when he starts shouting at people for stupid reasons in the story.

** Voldemort POV. While it's usually not enough to make me nope out of it, I tend to read only the last few paragraphs, since they might be important for the plot. I just can't stand the Voldemort torturing a couple snivelling cowards and having a grand time at Malfoy Manor.

(Same with Draco's "political machinations" and Lucius' grand plans.)

** Randomly killing major characters offscreen with no justification.

Ravengrad's Harry and Hermione become The Potters has Sirius as a driving character, and then he gets killed off offscreen in a paragraph:

"As Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts came to a close he'd received word his godfather had been killed by a man who became very irate when he visited a former girlfriend and found her and Sirius asleep after an obviously amorous night."

You wrote something strongly canon divergent, and then kill off a character at the same time as they died in canon by a random character never named and never seen again. This is ever worse in my eyes than another story I dropped immediately because it had a 'smarter' Harry avoiding the trap in the DoM and Sirius being smart enough to stay inside Grimmauld Place, only for Voldemort and Bellatrix to somehow find the location and burn it down with fiendfyre with him trapped inside.

** The last one was a Snape dies and ends back in his young body and tries to do things right. It was actually pretty okay. But then it was like; 'you're good now, so you can't possibly remain in Slytherin. Resorting!' Killed the fic immediately. Didn't even read two full sentences after.

Pairings with teens (ie. Hogwarts student/recent graduate) getting in a relationship with Remus/Snape/Sirius/someone else double their age. I get that many writers are teens and write what they know, but come on... creepy and unrealistic.

In general; bashing, Mary Sues, over powered super wizard/witch personas, Voldemort is actually just mistunderstood, extreme ooc behaviour.

******* TBH there are so many characters I wish had been explored in canon more, she's one of them. I had from the very beginning been calling bs on the whole "all Slytherins are evil" thing, and I was always hoping JK would have Harry atleast become cordial to a Slytherin or 2 during his schooling, her, Tracey, and Blaise being perfect opportunities given that Harry never interacted with them in the books so clearly not that close, if close at all, to Malfoy and the others.

Other characters I wish had been explored more being; Luna, Triwizard champions, and Lily who we hear very little about prior to Snape's memories especially when compared to James.

******** Easiest way for me to describe it. My bar for quality is much lower than most of this sub. Add in that I prefer action/adventure and crossovers to mystery, character exploration, or world development, and it leads me to a weird place with this sub.

I'v looked through a good number of the subs recommended fics and I think I really enjoyed maybe 3-4. IDK, I'v got my biases but without giving a list of fics I can't really explain them accurately.
