:END:
Im looking for an old fic where harry wields a katana that was made from a broken sword of Gryffindor.

It is set in America and harry is an investigator i cant really remember much else about it sorry.


** Based on the description of Harry as an investigator in America, could it be linkffn(Investigator Harry Steel)? Apologies, if it isn't; I personally haven't read past the first few chapters.

  The war is over. the dark is defeated. but the government is still corrupt. Harry is exiled to the U.S. where he meets the family he didn't know he had, and takes up the family trade. Multi crossover after chapter 18. and Harry/Multi after chapter 38 T for Language and Violence.
