All of the massively different world stories I see recced here all the time look great, but anytime there's a pairing, it's either Harmony, which I can't stand romantically, some other girl from Hogwarts who might as well be an OC for all we know about her (Daphne Greengrass, usually), or an actual OC. I'd like to read one with Ginny or Luna, but I have yet to see any. Technically, Cho Chang would work as well, and I'm fine with her, too, but I really doubt that there's any fics like what I'm asking for with her in it.

Thanks!

Edit: I've just found out that HGatBWL does have H/G, but given that it's a Hermione centric story and H/G is just on the side, the request still stands.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

**** I wouldn't consider stories where they aren't together at the end "Harry/Ginny". That would be like calling canon "Harry/Cho" because they dated for a while. It's the final pairing that counts.

In the story - "The Dark Lord Never Died" - they are together at the start and stay together.

** Multi's tend to be pretty low quality, especially if it is a romance. It tends to degenerate into teenage male wish fulfillment.... Usually when it does work it is left ambigous or is not the focus...

Decent world-building would distract from Harry 'catching them all' :!

I know "Lunar Harmony" (H/HR/L) was big enough for a while that you can probably find a decent world rewrite in that collection. None come to mind though...

Linkffn(The Stars Alone by Darth Marrs)

Both of these are "out there" but are not wholly in the HP universe. Well written and worth a read.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
