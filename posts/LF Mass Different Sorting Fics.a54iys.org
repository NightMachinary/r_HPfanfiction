I'm looking for fics where the Sorting Hat sorts not only a single character into a different house but multiple, preferably a lot of characters. Posibly due to using different criteria to sort people, or just because nobody can really be slotted into a single house. Should be fics that explore what follows from the sortings for each character, not just shock reactions to humorous sortings.

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.

** My series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) features Harry, Ron and Hermione all in Slytherin. It's also got a healthy dose of politics and worldbuilding. I'm almost done with the third volume of the series, and the total word count is about 170k words thus far.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.
