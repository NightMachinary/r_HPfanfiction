:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty fuzzy on the specifics so I might get some details wrong. It could've been anywhere between 10k and 100k words.

Harry found out Dumbledore was giving him potions or controlling him somehow- I don't remember, I'm certain that Dumbledore was firmly on Harry's bad side at that point, though. Harry, while running from Dumbledore, went to the RoR.

In the past, Bellatrix /also/ ran from.. something? I don't recall, but she ran to the RoR. It ended up being sort of a bridge between times, so they both could meet in the RoR. They could both go to the other's time period, using the RoR as sort of a 'bridge'.

Bellatrix really hated Rudolphus, but she was in a marriage contract to him with basically no way to break it aside from losing her virginity to someone else. The problem there was that her virginity was.. bound or something by the head of her family. It was pretty heavily implied that Rudolphus raped her before they married, and the backlash made her go batshit in the original timeline.

Harry uses the loophole that in his timeline he's head of house Black to undo the fancy magic binding her, then they fuck.

I also remember Sirius' mother being there in painting-form, but somehow not insane.

I seem to remember it updating at /some/ point at least semi-recently. The last few months, perhaps.

Thanks in advance!
