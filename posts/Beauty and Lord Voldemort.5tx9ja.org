Has anyone watched it? What do people think about it?

I just watched it and it felt to me like more of a Hermione/Voldemort* parody pairing, and to be honest I'm not really too keen on Hermione/Voldemort at all (why you would even contemplate a relationship with someone who would be as old as your great grandfather I'll never know, and I've written some weird stuff but never touched that pairing or Hermione/Snape - The thought of Snape reproducing is unbelievable!)

I'll give credit that it was one of the better videos I've seen where it mashes HP with something else, but it is not my cup of tea.

(* I just can't see Emma Watson as anything else but Hermione, even in a film such as Beauty and the Beast. Guess I've watched too much HP!)

Obversa already posted a link to it 4 days ago, sorry. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5t1ujf/not_exactly_a_harry_potter_fanfiction_but_it/][Here.]]

But yeah, to me it's just a really clever parody.

...The brilliant young Tom Riddle becoming the Dark Lord Voldemort because a dark witch cast a mind-and-body altering curse on him, though? That has fanfic potential.
