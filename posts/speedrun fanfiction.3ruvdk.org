we've all seen different fanfictions about fixing the past and stopping tom riddle, but here's something i was curious about, ever seen fanfictions where someone(s) try to stop tom, the horcruxes and the death eaters as fast as they can? they don't wait or anything and they try to do it as fast as they can?

i got the idea from different video games where people try to beat the game as fast as they can

seen any fanfiction like that?

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
