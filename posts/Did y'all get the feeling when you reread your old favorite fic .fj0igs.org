Did y'all get the feeling when you reread your old favorite fic (you know the fic that made you have to bookmark, squealing, impressed over,...that kind of feeling ) and then with a more mature brain (mind you) with more taste over the years of improving, I get cringe and i mean i cringe really hard ( but i'm not delete it though) and looking back I get really proud of myself here guys for improving in my choice of reading now. Who's like me ?


** Oh yeah not so much now but when I started reading around 12 years old oh my gods so much I still read crappy fic occasionally but its usually cause I'm in that kind of mood a crappy fanfiction mood I am now 15 and my brain works far better than it used to when it comes to distinguishing good writing and bad writing

favourite fanfic to this day seriously everyone should read this it is a crime not to

**** I had this experience a few years when I rediscovered the very first Dramione/Harry Potter fanfic I ever read. I remember loving it and finding it really interesting but reading it again I got really disappointed because it was so cliche and hit almost every dramione trope I know dislike

So it kind ruined the story for me

*** My bro, same with me but I'm 16.

Though at 12 I liked all the popular power-wank fics, now I mostly focus on lesser known fics, ones that dont appeal to everyone.

At 12, no offence bit I loved all of Starfox5's stories but now I cant revisit them becuase my taste has changed.

I'm into darker stories where the characters are pushed beyond their limits, Fate by TheTrueSpartan is brilliant imo but a lot of people will skip beciase of its zany premise, Ron MC and it's dark themes.

** James Nicoll refers to this as the Suck Fairy: like the Tooth Fairy, she only visits while you aren't looking, but instead of stealing teeth, her job is to visit things you really liked but haven't read /watched in years and lace them with copious amounts of suck.

** Sometimes, but then I remember that "cringe" is a fake emotion caused by a neurotoxin produced by brain worms, and all is good again.

** Ah... Yes, I get that when I read read romance parts of fanfic and I'm like "why hadn't I realized this is kinda fucjed up" or "how did I ever think this was romantic" or my favourite "how thirsty was I when I bookmarked this, it isn't even good just lots of...."

**** Oh yes. There was never much plotting. My first attempts were like so Mary Sue/Gary sue. Hell I almost always developed a /super cool/ over powered OC with a tragic backstory whom I then included to save the day

******* You like the term "cool" when you begin with fiction but when you grow older you're not happy with just "cool" i guess, you want the character too have more brain to be precise in the matter of fact

** Well, no. I somehow managed to pick one that was just really /really/ good all those years ago. I think I've read it about eight times.

**** True, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and I have been fortunate in that the story I love has remained perfect without blemish in my eyes for all these years. It is not really perfect, but in my eyes it is good enough that I can wholeheartedly forgive it of its faults one and all.

Yes... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and this story is beautiful to Me.

** My first fan fiction live was HPMOR, so not that one so much, but another author I read who focuses on the Harmony pairing has not stood the test of time so well. (I'm definitely not posting their username here, because I would never want to badmouth anyone who gave me hours upon hours of entertainment for free. I am still extremely grateful.)

**** They're all basically fix it fics with wise, wealthy and/or powerful Harry and Hermione. Friendly goblins that turn Harry into a super warrior, etc. Those tropes have become so cliched. I just find them boring and uninteresting at this point.
