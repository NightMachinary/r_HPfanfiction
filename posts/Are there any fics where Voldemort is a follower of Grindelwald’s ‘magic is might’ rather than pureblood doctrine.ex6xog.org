I always thought that it made more sense than Voldemort's ideology, particularly as he's a half-blood. Also seems like it would in general get more followers than just a tiny group that hates everyone else.

In the Downward Spiral Saga by Bolshevikmuppet99, linkffn(13058572), Voldemort bases his doctrine on Magical Supremacy and he declares in his proclamation to the Wizarding World that "We see nothing wrong with muggle-borns or half-bloods. They are witches and wizards, same as those of the most illustrious lineages." , and Voldemort's No. 2 in this series is publicly known to be a half-blood.

  Book 6 of the Downward Spiral Saga: As the last of the Ministry's forces fall, the war is all but won. Or would be, if Grindelwald wasn't still out there, biding his time and building up a force. And who is after the Dark Lord's Horcruxes? Dark!Harry. Sequel to HP and the Dirge of Hope

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/][The Outliers]] is a single-point-of-departure story in which Dumbledore lost his fateful duel against Grindelwald. Tom Riddle, freshly graduated from Hogwarts, gives lip service to Grindelwald's ideology to attract followers to himself.

  It is 1945 and the staff and students at Hogwarts are anticipating Gellert Grindelwald's rule extending to the UK. Whether they are celebrating or panicking usually depends on their blood status. Usually - but not always.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
