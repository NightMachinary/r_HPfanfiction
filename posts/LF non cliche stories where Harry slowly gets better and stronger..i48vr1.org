There are a lot of stories out there where, after his 5th year, Harry all of sudden becomes the most powerful wizard ever or he discovers Dumbledore has been manipulating him. But i'm not looking for those kinda stories.

Stories like The Merging or The weapon revised! is basically what i'm looking for. Stories where Harry for example becomes heavily invested in studying different kinds of magic or finds out he has a sort of talent like wandless magic and he slowly becomes better at it.

Any recommendations?

  What if Usagi had finally decided enough was enough? Between the jabs and the lame excuses on problems going on involving not only Mamoru but Chibi Usa as well, Usagi has had enough and hits her breaking point. Now the girls must realize their own individual faults in the conflict and rise together to show Usagi that she is the glue that holds them together.
