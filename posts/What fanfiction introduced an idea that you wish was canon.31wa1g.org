** Can't recall what story it's from, but I really enjoyed the idea that Arthur Weasley was actually a member of the Unspeakables called the Ghost. I've always felt that he wasn't half as addled as people assumed. How much cooler would it be to find out he was powerful as a hidden player in the Ministry? That might be why no one ever tried to fire him during Voldemort's second rise!

JKR said in [[https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/oct/31/jk-rowling-ron-weasley][an interview]] with Daniel Radcliffe that at one point she was so frustrated with writing GoF and OOtP that she seriously thought about killing Ron in the final book. I think Ron's baffling behaviour in GoF is a remnant of her decision to get rid of him.

For whatever reason she got cold feet and changed her mind. A major rewrite of several key plot points would explain the very long gap between GoF and OOtP's publication dates.

The quotes in this interview (from the DH part 2 DVD) seem to support her more recent comments that, "For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."

**** She's said elsewhere that she wanted to kill Ron because if no one important died in the last book that it would be too saccharine and not real enough. When she dropped the idea for good she killed Remus in his place. She's also said, when she later recanted on Ron/Hermione, that she put them together because of the people they were sort of based on, but the characters themselves needed extensive therapy to really work together.

The rewrite of GoF happened, it's well-known. She had a character who was the daughter of the Weasley's squib accountant cousin Ron mentions in Book 1 who got sorted into Slytherin and stirred up a bunch of gossip and also was really smart and bothered Hermione; she realized halfway through that for a lot of the plot points that needed to be hit there was no way some first year, or even some student, would realistically be able to know/find out, so she chopped it all down and came up with Rita Skeeter. Not to mention the problems with having an essentially muggleborn in Slytherin, though I don't know if she's talked about that.

That could have been interesting, though. It always struck me as a bit hypocritical that they never talked about this accountant cousin of theirs, when they claim to be unprejudiced towards muggles. It's not mentioned in the book that this squib cousin is a git, in any way, so you can only assume that he wasn't mentioned, or visited, simply because he had no magic.

It would have been curious to see the Weasleys at Hogwarts deal with the fact that they had an estranged cousin who basically hated their guts because of the way in which her father had been ignored by his family, all for being a squib.

I'd also add to this Arthur's reaction to meeting the Grangers in Diagon Alley in CoS. "Oh, but you're Muggles!"

Iirc in the early draft of GoF he abandons his daughter with the main Weasleys because he doesn't like magic. So I guess JK did at least intend to address it but it seems it was his choice to bail. Tbh I can't see Arthur giving up the opportunity to hang out with him.

***** I know the story of the swotty Slytherin who became Rita from the fine folks here on this subreddit. It's entirely possible that it was rewritten for other reasons as well, but of course it's only a theory of mine.

Without Ron in the picture, though, I think H/Hr would have certainly been given greater prominence in her writing. I think the reason she ultimately changed her mind about killing Ron was that it didn't fit in with her end goal of having Ron with Hermione and Harry with Ginny. A decision that she's wavered on since the publication of DH. I wonder what the epilogue would look like if she wrote it today. The exact same maybe?

**** One of my big gripes with canon is the way attraction is handled. Harry likes Cho out of the blue. Krum asks Hermione to the Yule Ball because she's not a Quidditch groupie, but that doesn't explain his continued interest in her and his reasons are never given any exposition. So for Harry to mention Hermione as 'a very pretty girl he did not know' in GoF without any further discussion is very strange.

Many of these earlier instances are easily dismissed as 'adolescent crushes.' We /see/ Harry get over his crush on Cho and observe that Hermione doesn't have any lingering interest in Viktor. In contrast, we are simply /told/ that Ginny got over her crush on Harry. Similarly we are expected to understand that despite showing an alarming amount of antipathy, Ron and Hermione are perfect for each other.

***** On the flip side, in canon either JKR is eliding everything not relevant to the plot or Harry is incredibly unobservant about things that don't apply to him. (which I've seen several good fanfic reasons for). Hermione, one of his best friends (one of his /two/ friends) has a relationship with an older guy for most of a year, in which we know that Krum at least /really/ likes her and she stays in contact with him for a while, and Krum still has a bit of a torch for her several years later (at the wedding in book 7), and Harry /doesn't notice a thing/. Not at all. Nothing about their relationship has any impact except where Ron gets upset that it exists, and Harry never expresses any emotion or opinion about it; he's surprised it exists in the first place and is vaguely surprised they still write to each other later.

What I'm slowly getting to is that Ginny had room to have an entire emotional life, crushing on Harry and backing away and dating other guys and then liking him and Harry could easily not notice any of it. Same with Ron/Hermione- they could be flirting with each other nonstop between flights and we'd never know as readers. Harry doesn't really notice things that are based in emotions and not about him; he's oddly clueless/autistic/traumatized/self-centered in that way.

(Basically I'm saying I like fics where Harry realizes/doesn't realize as a adult that his Roald Dahl upbringing has really screwed him up emotionally, but that the people in his life do realize this and make adjustments for him.)

That's a very interesting interpretation. My own belief is that there is a third option other than JKR cut everything that didn't directly impact Harry or that he's unobservant: She just didn't plan things out enough ahead of time.

I know she's said many times how much she'd plotted and planned, but I think she just ended up winging quite a bit of it and at the end several facts didn't line up with the fans' expectations, hence the cognitive dissonance that leads to frequent disagreements.

This is actually comes from not one, but /two/ autistic stereotypes. Trauma [most likely] doesn't cause autism in any way, shape, or form. I'm saying that because I've been diagnosed with autism myself, and I've done extensive research into the causes of autism.

#+begin_quote
  *Myth: Autism comes from bad parenting.* Bruno Bettelheim popularized the theory about autism being caused by "refrigerator mothers" (which had the horrible result that, for a generation, women who had children with autism were blamed for it). About as many people believe this today as think the earth is flat, but now and then, I bump into someone who asks whether I had trouble bonding with Danny when he was a baby. Any number of new moms may have "trouble bonding," but that simply isn't what causes autism.

  *Myth: People with autism feel no empathy or affection.* People with autism sometimes have trouble expressing affection, but it doesn't mean they don't feel it. I have spent a great deal of time with people (both children and adults) on the autistic spectrum and I believe that they feel the same range of emotions we all do: fear, happiness, nerves, anger, etc. It may be difficult for them to understand that everyone doesn't know the same facts that they do, but that is very different from not feeling empathy. When I'm sad, my son will look at me warily, and then say, with hope, "You're feeling much better now?" When he was first diagnosed, a distinguished psychiatrist told me that it was "rote behavior" when my son hugged me and that didn't indicate that he felt affection for me. Later, a teacher told me that my son only hugged people "because he craved sensory input." I was very upset, but then a neighbor said, "Your son is the warmest kid I've ever seen."

Then there are a few that I know were there but... for obvious time-reasons... cannot remember exactly. Its been a while since I read the series the last time.

Finally, there was of course the way in which she remained a loyal comrade and friend in the search for the horcrux. I think this is when Rowling could've gone the H/Hr way.

But then again. I'm pretty biased. Ron always remembered me of people I loathed. His whole personality is of a person I would never, ever be friends with.

****** Unlike many other H/Hr fans I didn't see it happening in canon. My own feelings are that by the end of the series, JKR accidentally told a very wonderful story about friendship between the two of them that for /shamefully unexplored/ reasons never bent towards thoughts of romance.

I've already voiced my probably irrational opinion at just how strange it is that Harry never even gives a thought towards dating Hermione. It's a very glaring omission especially given that Harry liked Cho because she was 'pretty.' I hope most people will agree that this is a very thin pretext for fancying someone. But later in the GoF Yule Ball scene, he describes Hermione as 'very pretty.' This is one of only /two/ value judgments in the entire series as to Hermione's physical appearance. So Hermione has satisfied Harry's earlier criteria for liking someone by being 'pretty.' Why doesn't he give it a second thought? That's never even explored and it's - in strictly my own opinion - very strange.

But that's okay, that's what fluffy H/Hr fics are for.

Firstly he's 13 when he first meets Cho and he sees her as a hot girl who plays Quidditch. They never have a deep relationship and his feelings for her are noticeably more shallow than his feelings for Ginny, who he actually knows later on.

Secondly, he knows Hermione so unlike Cho he knows that she annoys him by nagging him to work all the time, he knows she hates Quidditch, basically he knows her well enough that her being attractive isn't enough because she isn't just a hot girl in the year above, he actually knows her. Just like later when he actually spends time with Cho he realises it's not a good match.

Thirdly, he doesn't fancy every girl in the series described as attractive Hermione is not alone in this.

Where does she say that? Seems to me she uses Quidditch as an excuse to help Harry in several different ways above and beyond the call of an average fan: Sets Snape on fire, charms Harry's glasses, etc. In GoF she gets the term Wronski Feint wrong but I can't see how that can be conflated with her hating the entire sport.

Respectfully, I think you're taking this to a hyperbolic extreme. I never suggested anything of the sort: that romance was a central pillar or theme of JKR's series.

If it would have ended up H/Hr, it would have only been at the end just like the R/Hr in canon, and the shippers would have raged anyway.

***** Eh, I'm not going to defend R/Hr here. I don't really care for it one way or the other. I didn't mind it happening in canon, but I didn't care for it much either.

On the other hand, Hermione's /'my way or the high way'/ attitude would probably cause friction in any relationship involving her. It comes up in all of her conflicts with Ron and Harry -- refusing to even admit the possibility that Crookshanks ate Scabbers despite all evidence, going behind Harry's back to McGonagall regarding the Firebolt, the entire thing with the HBP potions book being a thing of mass destruction, and the subsequent "I told you so" when Sectumsempra proved to be dangerous.

Not to mention the whole SPEW business : /"You are oppressed because my superior intelligence says so, dammit, and you will be free regardless of whether you like it or not."/

So, yeah, any relationship involving Hermione would involve significant hurdles in any case, and I doubt any relationship with Harry would have been much better than Ron.

A minor quibble: Hermione asked Harry to give the broom over /first/ without explaining her reasoning. IMO the only reason she didn't expand on her thinking is that the final line of that chapter, "Because Harry, Professor McGonagall agrees that the broom was almost certainly sent by Sirius Black!" [paraphrased because I'm too lazy to look up the exact verbiage] makes for a better Oh!Gasp! transition.

What motive did Ron assign to Hermione for doing it rather than her stated goal of keeping Harry safe? Jealousy over the monetary cost of the broom.

I beg to differ. I always thought that Harry is the "you talk, I'll do it anyway"-non-confrontal type. The type that smiles when Hermione has one of her fits.

In the end, I think, its all about what you see in the characters. Harry resembles a close friend of mine and Hermione's real-life counterpart is one of my best female friends, for example. Its impossible for me to imagine her being with the likes of Ron Weasley. It just doesn't add up.

The appeal of H/Hr, I think, lies within the "boring". In the end, I think most people want "boring" in a sense of "not arguing all the time". Its the couple that combines excellence in different subjects. And especially when I read the Post-Battle fics, I can see a matured Harry coming together into a harmonic relationship with a matured HErmione.

***** It depends on what you want to do with Ron. If you want to keep him, it really unbalances the trio the three have set up makes him seem useless, unnecessary. Personally, I do think this is true of the character and quite frankly, him disappearing wouldn't affect the series that much. Outside of one chess game, he doesn't provide anything that couldn't be provided by anyone who grew up in the magical world. Heck, this significant difference between him and the muggle born/raised Hermione and Harry. Heck, even as an introduction to the rest of the Weasley family, it is in fact the twins who meet him first, and that makes for a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2m3laz/who_is_the_least_essential_main_character_in/cm0zn1x?context=3][plenty fine beginning]]

I guess because Harry Potter is a magical, wizardy series, its easy for people to forget that Harry and Ron are both typical jock guys who like sports and pranks and don't care too much about their classes or their future. Fanon makes a lot of Harry and Hermione both having a Muggle background but that's kind of all they have in common.

I don't think HPMOR magic would have ruined canon magic though. HPMOR engages in both reconstruction and deconstruction of magic. The value of the deconstruction can be debated, but some of the reconstruction is nearly sock-removing because it fits canon so well. Transfiguration and Potions are great examples of this. Dementors, too, but that's been discussed already in this sub. There was clearly a lot of thought put into this.

The trouble is that critics don't always read far enough to reach these parts of the story.

On the other hand, HPMOR wouldn't have uncontrolled moving staircases (because really, why? why would you want that?). But that's not so much magic as being practical.
