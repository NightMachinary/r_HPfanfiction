How do you fanfic writers (especially longtime writers) maintain your writing habits in a happy and healthy way?

I've written a couple of fics now and am currently trying to complete more of a WIP before serially releasing it (to get better at editing). I've found, however, that it's less easy to sustain motivation compared to when I published chapters on completion because in that case there's a lot of encouragement and interaction on the way. I'd look forward to it and get words down to hit publish so people had something to read on the weekend.

I also find that my fic which got more hits and interactions made me more motivated to write - but it didn't encourage better writing. It simply motivated me to get words down each week, but the writing wasn't the standard it could have been, on reflection.

I've been doing a recent debrief with myself after completing a WIP and realised my biggest challenge right now is maintaining motivation that isn't centred around chasing stats and comments. I kind of want to get better at this as a craft and keep the joy it gives me, even when I write stuff that people don't engage with sometimes, which is bound to happen. I like the hp fandom a lot, it's maintained a healthy base for so long, so I figured people doing this for a while will have insight on what's helped sustain authors.

So I was wondering - what's been your primary motivators as a fanfic writer in the fandom? What's worked over time for you? What hasn't? Do you have any advice to impart?

Thanks in advance! ðŸ’–


** Everyone has a different way of motivating themselves to write, and I've tried quite a few of them.

I have tried writing stories in a fog of creative passion, I have tried riding the high of popularity and recognition, I have tried discipline and time management, and I'll say that each one of those achieved results. They all also have their own unique drawbacks.

The 'fog of creative passion' is lovely. It usually happens when you've just had this /amazing/ idea and you need to get it out for the world to see. Sometimes it's a single chapter, or a one-shot while other times it's a complete story. It will rarely last for the duration of a full story, though. Inevitably, there will be bits of the plot which are slower, less exciting than the ideas and plans you have for later, and that can very quickly burn that fog away.

In addition, and in keeping with the nature of fog, it tends to blind you to errors and plot holes.

That feel-good sensation of views, reviews and favourites can also be a great motivator, but it is, if anything, even more fleeting than the fog. It's also fragile. A single bad review can demotivate you, even in the face of dozens of more positive reviews. It rarely lasts a day or more, but it can still have its uses.

Discipline is the last one, and the one that many people will tell you is the only thing you need, but I disagree. Discipline is for when passion and positive feedback have waned. It is not a replacement for those things, but it can bridge the gap, so to speak, and get you across the occasional, inevitable, 'this thing is garbage' downers.

But writing on discipline alone really has no place in fanfiction, to my view. This is a hobby, and hobbies are something we do because they bring us joy. I already have a full-time job, I don't need another. If you find yourself having to rely on discipline to get through an entire story, then, well, I'd say you might need to find a new story to write. One that /does/ capture your imagination, and get you excited to start mashing those keys.

Discipline is also invaluable in tempering the other motivators. Discipline yourself to look back at your work with a critical eye. Don't just forge on ahead in the throes of creative expression. Stop every now and then, check you've not taken a wrong turn.

Writing a full story, that brought you joy to write, and makes you proud of your achievement will require all those different motivations, and more. Everyone has their own personal drivers that can be added here. Don't cast away any of them, but always temper them with that discipline.

*** I think your insight on discipline is helpful, particularly its role as something to temper other things rather than to be the primary force in fanfic. Fanfic serves a very creative purpose for me, and I sense by relying on discipline alone I would come to leave the fandom. Discipline as a bridge is a great way to look at it.

We ultimately don't earn money in this hobby. It's something I think about as I spend more time on it, because its not something we can transition into for paid work like other hobbies. Some people produce long works and report feelings of guilt for not completing it or for taking breaks, but I think a lot about how fanfic writing is essentially donated time. It has to be a good blend of things to make it feel good.

One unexpected reason for writing that has motivated me is by writing themes that have impact, where people comment that I've changed their mind or made them more mindful of something in the real world. One fic I wrote was, in part, a story about trauma recovery - something quite poorly depicted in the fandom at times. For some reason, comments where someone mentions that they understand or empathise with someone they know more - it means a lot, and make me feel like I've contributed something tangibly good to the world.

So that blend of motivators you mention is a great way to put it. Discipline needs to bridge the gaps but there's things close to our hearts that keep us here. Thanks for your insight.

** Motivation and ideas are fleeting. Having a solid outline for a fic (especially long-term ones) really helps.

** My one long-format fic I was able to maintain motivation by posting /some/ chapters before I'd finished the whole story. I kept a buffer of finished chapters in case I couldn't write as fast as I was posting or to smooth out any irregularities in writing speed - in my case, it was 26 chapters at the start, enough to cover a full year of fortnightly postings. By the time I finished writing, that buffer had shrunk a fair amount, but it was enough to let me keep a steady posting schedule all the way through. What drove me when my motivation flagged was less "gotta get something out" or "gotta keep the stats up" and more "people are reading this story, and I don't want to leave them hanging by abandoning it". If I'd waited until it was finished to start posting, it's almost guaranteed that I'd have never finished it.

** I don't write for Harry Potter, but I've been writing fic for a few years now (in the Life is Strange fandom, specifically) and this is my answer to your question.

Generally, I've always found motivation to be a fleeting thing at best. I stick to discipline. Whenever I find the time (which is rare, these days - life's a bitch), I sit down and I write some stuff. Doesn't matter if it's good, doesn't matter if it's bad, I just write it until I run out of time or I run out of words to put down. Quality comes with editing and refining (artists use construction lines, authors use drafts, musicians plan out melodies and lyrics before they put it all together, film-makers make scripts and storyboards before filming, etc). Discipline is something you have to work at, and accept that you're not always going to enjoy doing. Like exercising. The second day is always the hardest, but once you get over that hump it starts to get easier.

Also for enjoyment in sharing, get a Beta to talk to. Not necessarily an official one who'll read all your stuff and comment and correct and so on, but even just a person to bounce ideas off and chat about the thing you're writing helps a lot. Someone with which you can share the ideas, but not necessarily the manuscript, I guess?

And for the joy of progression in your craft - keep your old drafts. Keep the stuff you write that's utterly shit. Then, look back on it and think how you'd do it better. How you have done it better. Looking back at how far you've come can really solidify your progress, because we're so bad as a species at noticing our progress ourselves (part of the art of therapy is helping people realise that they have actually improved more than they think).

*** Thanks for your thoughts and advice!

For your final recommendation, I agree very much and have found that debriefing at the end of a fic has already given a sense of accomplishment that I improved in small ways. It makes me hopeful that the next work is going to be better. Betas seem to help people a lot and I see a lot of shoutouts to them on my favourite longtime writers so they seem to be a valuable part of the creative process.

Appreciate your insight!

** I think it's okay to lose interest in something. I mean fanfiction is a hobby, nobody makes you continue if you don't want to. But I do agree that it's easier to write when you have feedback after posting every chapter. Maybe that's why I usually proceed this way.

I think the clue is finding some other interest in writing than feedback. Reviews/kudos should be a bonus, not the thing that defines if you are going to continue writing.

I guess if you write to express an idea that you find important or interesting it's going to keep you motivated. Also, don't be hard on yourself. It's better to take your time and finish your fic rather than rush but lose motivation in the middle cause you're exhausted.

** I don't care so much about the views and likes for motivation, as I prefer to write the entire fic before publishing. I write because it's fun and therapeutic.

** Most of my fics tend to come from ideas in the moment.

So I write out that moment, maybe it's the final battle where Harry and Snape work together sacrificing their magic to defeat Voldemort, or Percy was murdered so Ron becomes a vigilante and eventually a hero.

Maybe a Harry gets blamed for Cedrics death and he's in the run from everybody and has to survive in his own devices.

A funny situation i made up when I was bored.

When I write them out fully I see weather I want to continue or not.

Maybe I'll mix them, maybe I won't.

Honestly my motivation is to keep on creating
