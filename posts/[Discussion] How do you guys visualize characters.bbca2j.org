Depending on the way characters are described in the fic, I imagine them in different ways.

I tend to use 'stand-ins' to imagine a character I have a hard time visualizing. They could be characters from other series, or models from a photographer's album shot. I always tend to fall back on book descriptions, and use that to visualize, but if the specific fic makes a clear distinction from the book, try to fin

Ex: Annie from AoT as Daphne, if Daphne is described as Blonde, Blue eyed and cold in personality.

Gabrielle as Christa/Historia.

These are just two characters that I 'stand-in' but I prefer models as I prefer to picture humans rather than anime characters.


** I don't, generally.

I have a very hard time picturing anything beyond the vaguest impressions visually, so I 'hear' characters by voice a lot more clearly than I 'see' them. As far as their physical characteristics, it's more a jumble of words and impressions rather than anything you could draw.

*** It depends how vivid the descriptions are for me. If it's brown hair brown eyed I would struggle. But green eyes and black hair with an untidy bit that sticks I can imagine quite easily.

** A key element is that I've never really visualized the characters in "live-action", with a few exceptions. I mostly see them in a detailed illustration style, similar to that of the original Grandpré illustrations --- which is not to say, mind you, that I see the characters with Grandpré's designs; but that's the kind of style I go with. Sometimes more realistic, sometimes more cartoony, depending on the character.

Of course, some of these designs I have in my head are influenced somewhat by the movies --- same for the voices, actually; Voldemort definitely sounds like Ian Hart's /PoS/ Voldemort in my head --- but they also draw from a variety of other sources. Sometimes it's fanart depictions I liked; [[https://www.deviantart.com/makani/art/Leaky-s-Widget-pics-46664400][a lot of this awesome artpiece]] ended up in my headcanon, and [[https://www.deviantart.com/marshmeellow/art/Hermione-Granger-574977327][this Hermione]] is just about perfect, although I imagine her hair a brighter shade of brown; ditto for [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/parsel/images/3/3c/D9507bdac328af95dcb0365bbcd81971--bad-boys-exhibitions.png/][this Ron]].

And sometimes it's just details I made up myself. Growing tired of not finding any art that /quite/ matched how I've always mentally seen Voldemort, I eventually [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/parsel/images/d/d9/LordVoldemort.png/revision/latest?cb=20171210165953][drew him myself]].

** Depending on the character, I end up doing one of the following:

- Picture the movie representation of them (The Golden Trio, Dumbledore, and various other characters with major movie representation with clear and distinct features)
- Picture a self-constructed, but consistent, image, based on descriptions across fics, for characters who has a habit of playing major roles in fics I generally read (Marauder-era Severus and Lily), or ones with a very pronounced description that movies fail to fulfill (Nymphadora)
- Visualize something on the fly based on the fic I'm reading's description of said character, if fics have a hard time agreeing on one consistent representation (Daphne), or simply not explaining it in first place (some OCs)

The same rules apply for locations -- a one-off location in some fic is not going to get a consistent visual representation over time for me, but Hogwarts look like the movies and the Cokeworth surroundings (park, the living spaces of the Snapes and to a lesser extent the Evanses) have a consistent fic-agnostic representation due to how often I read fics set in the area.

I always visualize them as looking like real people, as in, not "anime-style" or similar.

** I actually have real trouble with this.

Adult characters are easy. The main characters as twenty or thirty year olds would take me five minutes to find someone that I can go 'yeah, that's how I see Harry/Ron/Hermione'.

Kids or teenagers? Nope. No clue. What on earth does an eleven year old even look like? Child actors, especially those who've been in at least one thing a year between ten and eighteen are rare enough that it's hard to find one who can fit into the mental picture I've got to fill out the rest of it. So unless I want to go with the movie version, trying to figure out what the trio looked like on the first day of Hogwarts vs at the Yule Ball vs after the final battle is pretty hard.

Funnily enough though, a lot of the movies' secondary and supporting characters work perfectly well for me.

***** Michael Gambon is who I picture as Dumbledore.

He's still quite ancient with that long beard, but he still has that energy and presence that I imagine Dumbledore would have.

****** Ah, I see. I do like Gambon as an actor, but his face really doesn't look like the books' Dumbledore (no long broken nose, no glasses, and it doesn't look thin enough), so he's only an alternate universe for me.

** When I imagine them, I go plain after the book descriptions. Sometimes, I look up some fan art to see artists' interpretation of the characters.

Photographs don't help me a lot because while reading I hardly concentrate on how exactly they would look like in real life. Simple drawn art is enough for me.

e.g. when I imagine Harry I always see his wild black hair that stands up in every direction, green eyes, his scar and glasses. The rest is just fuzzy.
