:END:
I remember it was where Ginny gets mad in Flourish and Bott's at her parents for being poor, and the Malfoys hear her and tell her that "she has a place to stay" or something like that. She is also sorted into Slytherin and Tom ends up merging with her somehow? Also Draco has a crush on Ginny and Harry, but can only have a relationship with Ginny and that is all I know. Thank you!

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU. COMPLETE.

  Redo of my popular story. The Order of the Phoenix is sent a certain series which depict our heroes exploits. Reads like mysecretthought's 'Under a Watchful Eye' in which the characters respond to the books as they read without the actual book quotes being stated. Helps to have a copy or just be extremely familiar with the stories.
