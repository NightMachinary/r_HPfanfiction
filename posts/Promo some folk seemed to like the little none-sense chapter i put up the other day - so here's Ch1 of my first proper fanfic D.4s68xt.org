*** sorry - forgot xD\\
Chapter synopsis - Callum Darragh, the last muggle born in House Slytherin, reflects on fonder memories from his time at Hogwarts as he faces the Ministry's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to account for his actions during the war.

Novel ... gist - Callum Darrach, muggle born and Slytherin, went into hiding when the Carrows begain their reign of terror at Hogwarts, in the year 2011.

Joining Neville in the Room of Requirement, the two established the second DA - Howarts' Resistance. This time, however, they had a Slytherin's cunning, and a the history of muggle warfare, at their disposal.

***** I'm too young to really remember what the world was like in the 90s, so i can't write the perspective of an averagely intelligent, averagely well informed muggle citizen in the Wizarding world in the 90s.

I could maybe have put it forwards to the mid 2000s, but i think the change in what technology and insurgent strategy in recent years makes for a more interesting clash. Voldemort can dominate with powerful magic, and fear tactics - that's interesting, and makes a lot of sense that the Wizarding world cant resist it. But a muggle perspective probably inspires different sorts of response. I thought that would be fun to play with. :)
