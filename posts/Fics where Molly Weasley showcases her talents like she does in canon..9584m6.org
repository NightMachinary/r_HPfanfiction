She was a member of the Slug Club, had two very powerful brothers and took down Voldemort's top Lieutenant. Despite this, I've never read a fic where she even shows a sliver of her talent. I know we only ever see it at the end of DH, but she's only ever portrayed as the protective, overbearing stereotype, who is essentially the order's housekeeper. I mean, she literally blew up Lestrange when her daughter was threatened, so I'd like to see something like this. If fanfiction can give us Dark Lady Hermione fanfiction, why not give us some badass Molly Weasley too?

*** Ok Nevermind, I realise I'm wrong now. In HBP Molly mentions how Slughorn never paid much attention to Arthur, later you can see this similarity with Ron. I read it years ago and after finishing the series just assumed Molly was like Hermione, only with Arthur. I always thought it was cool that one of Slughorns 'collections' chose to raise a large family with the man she loved rather than be another of his 'success stories'. Bit traditional but whatever. Damn. I actually enjoyed thinking that was canon lol.

**** Still, there's nothing to contradict that she was, is there? Rowling described her as extremely talented and I highly doubt that she wasn't a member (unless she refused). And if she wasn't, then it shows that even Slughorn has wrong judgement when it comes to his members.

****** Yes, and if she indeed wasn't in the Slug Club, Dumbledore said that Slughorn collects charming people, too. You might be talented but not charming in the least and he might overlook you. Her brothers needed five Death Eaters to take them down and Hagrid described the Prewetts as some of the greatest witches and wizards of the age along with the Bones family. That says something about them. To be honest, I kind of understand Molly now. Her brothers died in the First War and she decided to settle down because she didn't want to endanger her family. Fear drives people to do anything. I personally headcanon Molly as the most talented witch the Order ever had after Dorcas Meadowes. I also like to think she was an Unspeakable before her brothers died.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** So far as I know, he's only posting to the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group, but Doghead Thirteen/Cal's wip story "The Scourge From the North" plays with this. If I recall correctly, Molly was an ex hit witch from the war with Grindelwald, but was rather broken after her brothers died.

Cal's juggling a ton of tropes in this one, but so far seems to be doing a bang up job of showing why those tropes were popular in the first place by writing them well.

She doesn't know that I know, but she's got an Order of Merlin First Class with oak leaves and clusters, and a ton of what I'm pretty certain are human scalps, all in a trunk in the attic along with just an absolute shitload of trophies and stuff she got given by Partisans, most of it guns -- the year she was pregnant with me, my uncles, her brothers Fabian and Gideon, got killed by You-Know-Who's lot and Dad actually had to talk Mum out of coming out of retirement complete with me-as-bun in oven and Ron still nursing.”

** Which talents?

How to be an overbearing helicopter mother who plays favourites (Ginny! While Ron is more of an afterthought than anything else! He's the least favourite son, she pines after Percy when he stood against his family but Ron? Nope, he's not special, he's got no special talents etc. and so he's seen as not important! (note: I don't even like Ron, I call him Mo-Ron, but even I can see that!))?

Seriously, what talents does Molly have? Blind, dumb luck? (Seriously, she should never have killed Bellatrix - that should have fallen to Neville IMHO!) Stupidity (having more kids than they can afford without hand downs - hell, they stump their kids magical growth with hand down wands!!!)?

Again: Show me one talent this lazy housewife (yes: Lazy! Because if normal people (muggles!) can do housework while holding down a job then a witch should be able to as well! Come on swish and flick and housework is DONE! What does she do the rest of the time?) has! (note: Stuff like cooking and cleaning doesn't count!)

Okay, so. Yeah, she's a bit of a helicopter parent. But - she lived through a war. She fought in a war. She lost her brothers, her friends, her loved ones, to said war. Then, when she was finally healing from it, she saw her kids dragged into a continuation of said war. Yes, she's pretty stubborn and overbearing at times, and it's not okay - but, it makes sense.

Killing Bellatrix - why, why on Earth, should she have NOT? Sure, you can argue that Neville had more of a reason to do so, but...if we have a crazy mass-murderer who shot and killed your entire family, and many other families, and I have a chance to kill her, I'm taking that chance. It's for the good of everyone, the crazy bitch needs to be killed. I'm sure Neville doesn't begrudge Molly in the slightest for it, and is glad Bella is dead at last, even if he couldn't do it himself.

You make some (harsh, but still) good points though about it not being the best idea to have so many children in their financial situation, and it being odd that Molly refuses to work to get them out of said situation, though. Honestly, once Ginny started Hogwarts, there was no real reason for Molly to stay home during the school year.

Overall, you have a few good points, and a few that don't pan out well. As to how Ron is treated, I can't say - I think the appeal of Molly is that she loves all her children, even ones that aren't 'special' outwardly, but I do see how Ron seems to get the crap end of it all.

*** Neville isn't special, it's important to note, in terms of Bellatrix's victims. Firstly, there were many, many victims we just don't know personally. They deserved a piece of her just as much. Secondly, why fixate on her? There were three other equally devoted attackers that night, and two of them were also at that battle. Hell, Crouch tormented Neville by casting Crucio right in front of him, then pretended to show sympathy after. Yet we never see Neville even acknowledge that one of the four who destroyed his parents died.

I don't think Neville deserves to kill Bellatrix any more than anyone else. In fact, Neville grew up ok, and had family members he loved. Harry had only Sirius, and Bella killed him. He technically had more right, if you wanna actually judge shit like that.
