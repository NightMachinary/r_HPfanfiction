** Okay, first the good. You've clearly got a plot in mind and you've taken it through ten chapters. Starting a story and keeping it going is always a challenge so well done for doing that.

But I have to ask: is English your first language? There are a *lot* of errors in spelling and grammar, to the point where some sentences didn't really make any sense. A lot of the phrasing is a bit odd too. I think what you're looking for here is less a beta reader and more a co-author. I was thinking about volunteering as a beta but there's so much that needs to be done I suspect it would end up being me rewriting your whole story. Someone who's prepared to work with you as you write would probably be a better option.

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh. The last thing I want to do is discourage you from writing. Hopefully someone will be able to help you out.

*** English speaker but I haven't written anything more than my name since highschool and I write the way I speak. Which is nonsensical

**** Do you have an editing process? A proofreading pass is a must, I would say - go over what you write in a slow manner, reading it out loud. Take your time with it - see what sounds weird when spoken, or is unclear, etc.

That'll catch a lot of 'mistakes' - eg, let's look at your very first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  All had been quiet at number 4 privet drive all summer almost, disturbingly quiet. Harry l had been reading a newspaper that was dropped off in bundles outside the nearest convenience store. Every time he opened the page, he expected to get a somber filled articles that even the cheapest of newspapers couldn't avoid but still, nothing. He flipped through it, there was an auto wreck and a small factory accident but nothing he could find that would lead to wizards.
#+end_quote

When read out loud, what do you notice? Well, the first sentence sounds... weird, right? Like "All" and "almost" get thrown in, and it's repeated. For the second one, the "I" after harry immediately stands out as a mistake, and there's a strange focus on where he got them from - but nothing about the paper (eg, is it local, country wide, muggle, wizard, etc). It also has a few little quirks - it's clearly meant to be something he does everyday, and a sign of his tension, but it's written almost like something new. Some of the grammar issues will pop up easily as well - reading "page, he expected to get a somber filled articles that even the cheapest of newspapers couldn't avoid but still, nothing" should stand out as a bit awkward.

To me, those are things that should be caught by the author in a read through. Eg, one way to rewrite it to 'sound' right to me, without actually changing it much:

#+begin_quote
  All summer long, it had been quiet at Number 4 Privet Drive. Disturbingly quiet. Every day, Harry had been trundling down to the nearest convenience store, grabbing the cheap local paper that was dropped off there, and scanning the news. Each time he did so, he expected - and /dreaded/ - confused reports of death, terrifying strange accidents, the way that a cheap Muggle newspaper would respond to the events following Voldemort's return. But as he flipped through it today, just like every other day - nothing. A car crash, a small bloodless accident in a local factory - nothing that spoke of a wizarding war.
#+end_quote

Now, that's just one way of tweaking the writing - and you'd do it in an obviously different way. But I think you write in a bit of a jumbled way that tells me that you're not stopping at the end and taking much of a time to read it as though you were someone reading it for the first time. Questions to ask yourself are - does this sound right? Is this confusing? Is there something I was thinking that wasn't included?

Here's another one from that first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  As he walked down this alley he noticed Dudley and his gang smoking and one even was scanning a girly magazine as Harry walked by. Dudley's friends eye's picked up Harry was passing. He could hear the snickering comments of Harry hunting as he walked by. Harry quickly responded. "Dudley I have my uncle, and I have my own means to deal with you from school."
#+end_quote

If you take the time to read it out loud, slowly, what do you think? Does it all sound good? Is what's happening clear to a reader who doesn't know anything about what you have planned? Does reading what Harry speaks reflect how you meant to write it? Do you have punctuation where you naturally stop while reading, or are there run-on sentences? Make sure that you're reading /exactly/ what you wrote - don't add in mental words that you think are there to smooth it over.

Now, this might seem overly negative - and I want to actually make something clear. You've *already* done the hardest part. That is, writing it out. You've had your ideas, you've written it, and you've got a big chunk of writing done. If this were a sculpture, you've done 90% of the work. Now, you just have to polish it. If you're able to write out as much as you have, you're 100% capable of making it an excellent story!

****** Do you read it out loud, without filling in words that aren't present / exactly as written?

I'm asking because rereading 5 times /ought/ to catch mistakes like:

#+begin_quote
  Harry l had been reading a newspaper that was dropped off in bundles outside the nearest convenience store.
#+end_quote

** I read your first chapter, and I can see where you might need a beta.

What are you looking for in a beta? I could help you if you want.

I have never betad, and I have never published a story myself, but I read a lot and I know when a sentence or a paragraph doesn't fit the overall flow of a story, or generally just doesn't flow well on its own. I am also quite good at catching grammar and vocabulary mistakes.

Edit: Gonna read the rest of the story now :D

** Not an experienced beta-reader, but I've enough knowledge of the English language to help you out.

I read the chapters, liked the flow of the story; where it was going. I can already see the plot lines, but understand why you would want a beta.

Up for it if you still need one!

** I've been a beta for someone at about this level before and had to give it up after three chapters because it simply took so long to go through. Even in a paragraph or single sentence there are multiple errors, so anything you can do /before/ giving it to your beta will help!

Just re-reading once and doing stuff such as making sure everything that needs to capitalized is capitalized, or taking care of things that you know are typos before sending is good.

Here is your second sentence:

#+begin_quote
  Harry l had been reading a newspaper that was dropped off in bundles outside the nearest convenience store.
#+end_quote

Even someone who doesn't know much grammar can tell that "Harry I" doesn't make any sense and if you just simply reread you can catch it and change it yourself. Most writers do a first draft and then a second draft, before showing it to anyone else.

This may sound harsh, but it will be tough to get a beta to stick with you at this level once they realize how very much work it is. It's better for everyone if you at least try a little, then a beta can help you with more important things like grammar and ideas/plot in some cases.
