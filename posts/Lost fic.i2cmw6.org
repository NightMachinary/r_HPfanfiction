:END:
Hi I'm looking for A fic that I read some time ago. This is a list of things that I remember:

Pairing was definietly Harry/ Ginny Harry was not trusted Dumbledore but he hasn't showed it Dumbledore thought that Harry will be the future leader od Light side like himself and because his relationship with Ginny couldn't to dark Hermione was dark Harry was friend with Fudge (this I'm not 100% sure) There was attack on Gringotts lead by Ginny and Harry Lily Potter was ressurected (She wasn't really dead but I'm lacking A proper word there, if I remember correctly it was something with her and Harry's soul)

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
