** Normally I'd downvote a completely off topic post, but this is a serious issue. +1 to spread awareness.

Big Cable can go fuck themselves. They are relics of a dead era, and we can't let them do this. The fact that this has been downvoted multiple times is a testament to the lack of understanding people have about how serious of an issue this is.

Which is a good thing by itself, of course, but sooner or later, the net neutrality is going down.

***** Sadly I see no alternative! And I am not only talking about the US of A alone (I am not an American myself), but all western nations - we are kind of in the same boat on this and all of us need to fight in our respective countries...I'd love to do this without violence and lynch mobs etc. but sadly the rich people and the politicians don't seem to want that, they should have learned their lesson by now (especially in Germany, I mean we had 3 major changes in government over the past century (from the Kaiser to democracy (which crashed and burned, partly because of reparations and hyperinflation etc.), to a dictatorship (which started a war we of course lost, which is a good thing - even if the Allies and the Russians turned Germany into an "all you can steal" after the war...we should fucking get royalties for everything stolen, but still I'd take being robbed over growing up under nazi-management/government!) back to democracy (ok: And another dictatorship in east Germany, the former German Democratic (what a fucking lie!) Republic)...still, the rich never learned that money doesn't give them the right to abuse the poor, to take their rights (voting doesn't do much IMHO, we just select who gets to take the corporate paycheck for the next few years!) etc....maybe a revolution now and then really is needed?)

What I like, in the case of the internet, is the idea that all data is equally accessible no matter your provider, and that there are no authorities telling you what pages you have the right to see.

As I understand it, the internet's a bit like a post office; you write a letter to someone overseas, give it to your local post office, they hire the airline to transport your letter overseas to give it to a foreign post office who go and deliver it. And then your pen-pal writes back and the whole thing happens in reverse.

With the internets, you send a website request to your ISP who forwards it to a higher-tier provider who gets it across to a different ISP who sends your packet the last leg to your target website, which sends back the details you're after.

And the thing with net neutrality is, metaphorically, the post office is supposed to treat all letters equally and see that they get delivered in a timely manner, regardless of where they come from and where they go.

But some post offices want to, instead, be able to take payments (read; bribes) to reroute their delivery truck routes to pass so-and-so company's doorstep before anyone else's, and maybe 'forget' to go down X Street of People Who Haven't Paid Bribes now and then.

***** I live in a pretty decently sized city, in the middle of an urban area. We have only one provider--the city contracted with Cox to provide all internet services in the downtown area. The only other option is satellite, which is profoundly impractical if not downright impossible for those of us in high-rise apartments.

Having ISP options in the US is a true sign you're in the wealthy suburbs.

*** I think net neutrality is better and should be required, but this specifcally is extremely unlikely to happen imo. What's likely is them prioritizing some traffic over others which would slow down services that don't pay them as much, which would disadvantage smaller and new services. Only including access to some sites would be a terrible idea, I don't see any ISP doing that. And FF uses such little bandwith that it being deprioritized wouldn't even be noticable.
