:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
That's basically all I remember. If it helps at all, Harry was in Grimmauld Place at the time. And the fic is on either AO3 or FFN. I'm pretty sure it was like hours or a day after Voldemort's defeat, though, and everyone might've died in his home universe?


** This doesn't completely match, but is it linkffn(The Mirror of possibilities by heyo)?

  Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.
