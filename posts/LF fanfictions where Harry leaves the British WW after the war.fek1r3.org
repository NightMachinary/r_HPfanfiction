** *FILFY teacher* linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DXD crossover harem with some smut. *AU.*

AU divergence in third year. Harry was bitten by Lupin. Some sort of deus ex machina occurs and Harry "accepts" his wolf, and becomes some supahdoopahwulf. Takes learning and stuff seriously after that. Beats the war, marries Ginny, has a kid. Drama happens, leaves the country (to escape politics, racism, etc), goes to college, and then gets headhunted to teach English and PE in Japan by Rias Gremory's brother.

​

Ongoing. Different people lived/died than canon.

​

OOH! The Deathly Hallows gets a backstory and pantheon in this too. Which is hella interesting.
