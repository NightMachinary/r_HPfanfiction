I am writing a Harry Potter long fic that includes witcher elements; signs, monsters, and vague references to characters. The OC under goes training to be like... a witcher... would you find it jarring if they were called Witchers...? Should I call them something else?


** I think witcher is fine, it's a fanfiction anyway that just makes your story some kind of crossover

Well more like a cameo maybe

** A witcher is just a different name for a monster-hunter, from what I understand (obviously coming with a bunch of other aspects in that universe).

Personally, I think if it's a term that comes up too much, it'd be a bit jarring because it's not the generic term for what they are, but a universe specific one. Eg, it'd be like if writing a superhero group into a story, calling them the Avengers. However, everyone has different tolerances there, and if Witchers were your concept for that fic, perhaps it can make it clearer to readers what it is/read as a homage/reference.

(There's also the question of how the term integrates into the Harry Potter series - from a quick google, the origin for 'Witcher' was to take the polish word for 'witch' (female only) and coin a new term to designate a male witch, essentially. But Harry Potter already /does/ use witch & wizard for the gendered names of magic users, and I'm not sure how well witcher fits into that).

*** It's not going to be like witcher this and witcher that... its more of a background thing, I'm turning the Bloody Baron into a witcher and the OC can't truly be a witcher anyway because the way to create one was lost, and she's just learning witchery things

I dunno I might just roll with it and see how it goes

**** In that case I probably (and to be clear - this is entirely my opinion, and I might be way off base of everyone else :P ) wouldn't find that intrusive. Just that if it's a title like auror that gets thrown around a lot, it might seem more jarring!

***** I get that...the only beings that might even use that word Witcher would be the vampires I have planned for the later books, because they were around when Witcher's were in full force, but other than that ...it won't be like every chapter someone says "Yer a witcher" (lol)
