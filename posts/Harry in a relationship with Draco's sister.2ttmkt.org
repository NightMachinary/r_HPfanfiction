As the title implies I'm looking for Harry/Draco's Sister stories such as Twins by Angles of Death ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9631399/1/Twins]]) or Harry Potter and the Arrogant Jerk by dukeofpoorplanning ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10869090/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Arrogant-Jerk]])


** Not to be rude, couldn't you just as easily look for a Harry/OC pairing and get essentially the same thing?

*** Not really. Having never read a Harry/Draco's Sister pairing, I can't really say much, but there are some inherent issues with such a relationship.

For one, how could a member of the 'Noble House of Malfoy', daughter of one of The Dark Lord's followers, easily have a romantic relationship with Harry Potter?

**** Well looking at the sheer number of Harry/Draco slash fics authors certainly seem to find a way around the whole "Noble House of Malfoy", "child of one of The Dark Lord's followers" problem. If it's a realistic approach is another matter altogether though ;)

***** But how many slash fics actually care about plot and character development, when /squeee/ theysocutetogether/squee/...

****** Realistic concerning their characterizations and circumstances. That's possible even in /fanfiction OF a fantasy series !/

****** Your standards must be incredibly low if you don't want writers to at least make their characters and situations realistic and plausible.

**** That's why I'm reading fanfics. Pretty much every relationship outside of canon is an imagination stretch but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy reading Honks or Harry/Fleur

***** You misunderstood me, I was saying that for the situation to even work would take some good writing, writing which is very different than Harry/OC pairings.

*** Theoretically yes, but I like the dynamic that the premise provides. And JKR only fleshed out four or five female characters so pretty much anything besides H/Hr or Harry/Luna is basically a H/OC

** hey there.. umm.. i actually writing a couple of stories with harry in a relationship with draco's sister premises. one set during harry's sixth year... and the other where they are all grown up.. but harry comes to know about draco's sister only later. i am halfway through finishing the first one. since i have a sketch of how i want the story to go... i hadn't uploaded it as of yet, but i am thinking of posting it soon, in a week or so, on fanfiction.net. if you are interested in reading it.. buzz me.. and i'll send you the link. i agree there aren't much stories like that... and if they do.. eventually they don't end up together and that's where the idea for the fanfic came up. my fanfic is something of a first time attempt so if you find it terrible while reading it, do give me criticism about it.

**** well... it's quite long... if you wouldn't mind... message me an email id to which i can send it to you.. and you can let me know... how my fanfic is. it might be too cliche or overly dramatic too. the oc may seem too mary sue-ish, but making her too ordinary would take away the charm of the character... and the "malfoy-ness", although i tried my level best to keep her in a grey area, where she does make mistakes, but you can only be able to see it in the later chapters. if you are okay with reading such a character then i'll mail you the story before i post it on fanfiction.net.
