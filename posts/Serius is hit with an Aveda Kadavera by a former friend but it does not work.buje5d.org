I don't remember anything except Sirius is placed in a ministry holding cell and a woman who was his lover (I think) tries to kill him because she thinks he's a traitor? But her spell does not work because she doesn't actually want him dead?

I know it's a long shot but if anyone can hit me with a link, I'd appreciate it.

Edit: if it helps I think it was either Marlene McKinnon or Emmeline Vance.

**** Yes, Marlene McKinnon thinks he's the traitor, tries to kill him and later gets serious psychological trouble when she realizes the truth about Pettigrew.

*** Wow, for some reason I thought it was a way more obscure one, but you're 100% right!
