[[/spoiler][In the end, Dumbledore AKs Harry because he thinks he's gone dark. Harry doesn't die, digs himself out of his grave, and leaves with his wand and his cloak.]] I think it was a plot twist, because I remember being really surprised. Hope this isn't too vague.

** Yes! Thank you both so much. Hit the Ground Running was the story I had in mind, but I'm really looking forward to reading Resurrexit, too.

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...
