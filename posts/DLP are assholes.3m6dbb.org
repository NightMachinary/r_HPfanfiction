** Hi, I'm staff at DLP. Recently there has been somebody plagiarizing member's stories from our "Work by Author" section where authors post rough copies of their stories in order to gain feedback. We're pretty sure someone made a bot to do it.

This is probably the same person who forced us to make new members post in a hidden forum in order to be authorized to post elsewhere on the forum by throwing thousands of bots at us who then posted thousands of threads a year or so back.

In order to protect our author's content, we've had to make it so that the only people who can view the stories in Work by Author are those who have actually posted a few times. Work by Author is not meant as a replacement for ffnet, but many people still treat it as so. It's meant as a place for authors to get feedback, which is why we only allowed registered members to view it - as only registered members can actually post constructive criticism. Now we made it so that only members with a few posts to their name can see posts in it.

We didn't do this in order to inconvenience anyone, we did this so that a plagiarist can't get to the stories. Authors are the foundation of any fandom, and we don't want their creativity to be sullied or stalled because of someone taking their work as their own. I'm sorry if you think this is an asshole thing to do, but the post limit isn't that high (less than 10) so it shouldn't be an issue to just contribute something to prove to use you aren't a bot designed to steal stories and post them to ffnet.

It really isn't that hard to find somewhere to post on DLP, we have a broad range of ongoing discussions from politics, to anime, to gaming, to other fandom's fanfiction (Naruto, Star Wars, Dresden Files, etc) that you can engage in.

Honestly, we're not as bad as people make us out to be. There's a reason we're still an active community nearly a decade after Harry Potter has been done and all the other sites have died out. Come try and post something, I can assure you that as long as you are genuine, you'll fit right in. :)

Is this anything more than a blatant desire for a more active community?

Also. If this is really about stolen content, do you not realize that limiting access is going to increase the demand, and therefore the incidence of it happening?

***** To be perfectly honest, we wouldn't want to randomly bolster our community through an effort like this. It's counter productive to the culture of DLP.

Unfortunately for the random people who have decided that WbA is for their reading pleasure, and that the fact that it's meant to provide feedback means nothing to them, we've had to implement a barrier to make it more difficult for someone to simply register an account and use an automated program to trawl the subforum.

It kinda boggles my mind that people feel that they're entitled to viewing something that requires you to be a member of the forum, without attempting to be one. If DLP is such anathema to you, why even bother to go there just wait for the authors to post on ff.net.

Except that they only need to do this once, and the obviously have already done so. Now all they have to do is also make a few posts elsewhere if they haven't already done so. I fail to see how this logically is going to have any effect except to annoy. And mostly to annoy myself and other like me, not the plagiarist.

******* You're absolutely right. The only options we have right now are to either a) do nothing, or b) close access to the forum permanently, since taking any other steps in the long run is futile.

You aren't entitled to the content on WbA since you don't consider yourself a member. If you were an actual member this wouldn't inconvenience you at all. You, and those who, like you, choose to simply use the WbA as your own personal library do not factor into the decision.

WbA exists to help authors refine their stories, not to pander to readers. That you feel that you deserve the access, when you don't provide any contribution to said authors is mind blowing.

I agree my tone is aggressive, and I suppose that's because I'm having to deal with people who feel that they're entitled to access a betaing forum with the express intention of not providing any form of feedback to the authors who post there.

If they were providing feedback, then this would be a moot point since they would have already reached the post count in question.

If someone wants to talk to me rationally about this issue without their argument boiling down to 'it makes things harder for me, so stop it' then I'll gladly talk to them without any overtones of aggression.

This is a fair point and I concede it. However its futile, as I can easily make the required posts to gain access again, in which point I will go back to my undeserving reading. The bigger point here is that someone stealing content, not just reading it, can do so just as easily. So in the end this does nothing except force more posts, which is why I alluded that this was a movement for a increase in community activity instead of an attempt to thwart plagiarism.

***** Like I said, Work by Author is not a replacement for a fanfic website like ffnet. It's a place for authors to polish their stories in order to publish it to ffnet. We don't mind people reading the stories as casual readers, but they aren't the people the authors are targeting when they post in WbA. Again, I'm sorry for this inconvenience, but it's just an inconvenience, when on the other hand, we have author's work being stolen which is much more serious.

Also, this has only been applied to members who joined on and after January 1, 2015. Members who joined before are exempt.

We don't know if it will help, but we know it won't hurt. It's one step we're taking to address the problem as it unfolds.

I can't imagine any sane person would think this.

HP fanfic is a pretty close-knit community these days. Let's say Taure put up a few more chapters of his very popular LotR/HP crossover up in WbA, and then someone ripped it off and posted it on FFN.

You /really/ think the person who ripped it off would be well regarded in the community?

Personally, I would think that person was a massive tool, a thief, and worthy of nothing but scorn.

It's a fanfiction community with some extremely talented authors and a 'we don't suffer idiots gladly' philosophy. I see no problems with that.

The issue seems to be that they've had some serious plagarism issues recently, and took steps to require people to actually participate in the community to access things the community creates.

This... seems perfectly reasonable, and the only way I can see anyone disagreeing is if they want to mooch off of the content without actually providing any feedback. As the content in question appears to be a tool for authors to get editing feedback, rather than a hosting replacement.
