Turns out merpeople are the deep ones, worshippers of Dagon from Lovecraftian myths and reproduce by kidnapping and corrupting humans. Students taken as hostages in the second task are corrupted into sleeper agents. Dumbledore allowed them because he is one of them. Their ultimate goal is elimination of humanity, sunking all of earths continents and creating an underwater utopia where all will hail and be sacrificed in the name of Dagon.


** Iä Dagon! Iä Hydra! They have prepared well for the coming of Great Cthulhu, Him that Dreams deep in R'lyeh! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl Fhtagn! Soon shall the stars align and once more Great Cthulhu will bring about the rule of the Great Old Ones!

Though He seems dead in His slumber, soon shall He rise anew and reclaim dominion over the Earth and stars! For thus was it written in the Al-Azif, "That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die."
