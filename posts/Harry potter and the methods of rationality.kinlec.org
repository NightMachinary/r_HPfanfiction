I finally got myself past the first chapter and managed to finish this amazing fanfiction, I want to know and hear what everyone thinks of this fanficiton, what you think of its universe, the characters, the magic system, everything. Whats more I want to know if any have written any sequels in the universe (due to the author stating they whole heartedly wish to see something to that effect.)


** I tried the first few chapters, but had to give up. I'd heard a lot of good things about it, but it just wasn't for me.

I thought that the "Harry" in the fic was a very blatant self-insert, and the whole thing seemed like an exercise in pointing out all of the logic fails of canon, attacking suspension of disbelief, and generally mocking people who actually enjoy the story.

I get the feeling that I was supposed to read through it and be amazed and impressed at how smart the author is, but I just...wasn't.

Harry was completely unlikeable, which makes me assume that the author is too. Acting that superior/smug/I'm-smarter-than-you-and-don't-forget-it in the real world will most likely result in people either ignoring you, or if you become too insufferable, punching you in the face.

** HPMOR was the first fanfic I ever read. I remember enjoying the first few chapters a lot, but apparently not enough to keep reading.

A few years later, I picked it back up on the recommendation of a friend. I got through another decent chunk of it, but I eventually gave up on it because it felt like the story's real purpose was for the author to smugly wank off on how smart he thought he was.

HPMOR is one of those really polarizing fics. I know a lot of people love it, and good for them. But a lot of people also find it unbearable.

*** I did find the smugness annoying. But if you can get past that is is quite a good read. Cause the author also believes anyone who reads it can guess at there points and while I wasn't trying very much I did get a gut feeling at times what would happen. So I highly recvomend finishing it, cause the ending is worth it, and I honestly believe the smugness was unintentionally done.

** a friend recommended it to me but I couldn't make it past the first few chapters bc harry's smugness just felt really off-putting to me. a lot of people seem to like it, though.

** linkffn(11174940) is the only sequel/spinoff that I liked, and it's very good, better than the original in some ways.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.
