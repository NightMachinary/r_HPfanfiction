** Not sure why anyone would want to read fanfics about a deranged Harry stalking various Hogwarts students, but thankfully author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/881050/cloneserpents][cloneserpents]] has all your Horror film needs. In particular, I point you to the six-part "Scream" series, as well as the spin-off "Waves Crashing Against the Shore".

These stories seem quite egregious, considering the author has also written "Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor", which is about as far as it is possible to get from the "Scream" series.

** Harry slicing and dicing deatheaters from the shadows? Yes please!\\
Easy to set up too.

Why should I wait for Voldemort to return to his powerbase, his devoted followers, when I can find them and take them out first? In fact, Dumbledore should have done this already, but he's so powerful he feels he can afford to be non-violent. But I don't have the decades of honing my magic into a safety net like Dumbledore has had. So, I'll do what I must, because I can.

So, something along those lines.

  When he witnessed the murder of his parents, the darkness got in him. Dumbledore took him in, taught him the best he could, and when it was clear the darkness was in too early, Albus taught Harry how to hide it, and how to get away with killing. AU based heavily on Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay.

  Tom Riddle, a young detective, focused his whole commitment toward catching a serial murderer, labelled as 'The Scalpel'. But what if the accidents happened slowly hit too close to home, and the only person Tom ever came to love? Tom/Harry. SLASH.

  Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, but the plot and the original characters are purely mine.Thank you to my lovely beta for editing this. This story is inspired by Sherlock Holmes Series, CSI Series, and Hannibal.Ladies and gentlemen, put on your seatbelt, and may you enjoy the ride. :) Psychopaths: Those who are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others, although they often have charming and disarming personalities. They are very manipulative and can easily gain people's trust. They learn to mimic emotions, despite their inability to actually feel them, and will appear normal to other unsuspecting people. Psychopaths are often well educated and hold steady jobs. Some are so good at manipulation and mimicry that they have families and other long-term relationships without those around them ever suspecting their true nature. When committing crimes, psychopaths carefully plan out every detail and often have a contingency plan in place. Unlike their sociopathic counterparts, psychopathic criminals are cool, calm and meticulous. They make few mistakes. A psychopath who becomes a serial killer would most likely conform to the FBI's organized category of killer. The charming Ted Bundy provides a classic example of the poised, articulate and highly organized serial killer.Source: Doc Bonn Blog.Clues: Harry mentioned that Harriet was a criminal lawyer, and that she's flying to San Francisco. In the night when Cedric was killed, it was raining. Later shown Harry came out of the operation room, 'sweating'.Background: The twins lived with their mother, Lily, before her death (since the father, James, was only a one-night stand) and later kidnapped and sold as slaves. The child that the lawyer was writing about could probably be Harry or Harriet, but the other twin was auctioned as well after the lawyer left. They managed to 'escape' and asked for help, in which the father came into view (after been informed about the existence of the twins) and took them in to live with him.I am sorry about the ending, but I know you know there is only one end to this dance. It's either Tom, or Harry and Harriet. I thought of writing the scene where confrontation happened between Harry and Cedric, right before his death, but we'll see. But to make things clear, Harry perhaps, did love Tom, but not as much as how he wanted to puppet him.The moral of this story is that, maybe the person you want to protect the most, is actually the reason behind your downfall. Please review. :)

  LV/HP Slash: AU: How different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? How different would he be if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he has to go through desperate means to hide it?
