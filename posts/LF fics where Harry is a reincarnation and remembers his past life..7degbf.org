Exactly what it says on the title. I'M looking for fics where Harry remembers his past life and uses his knowledge to train something of a game breaker. Personally, I prefer crossovers and it is a good way to give him different skills.


** linkffn(Again and again by Athey)

Harry/Voldemort but the slash is surprisingly tolerable, probably due to the high quality of writing.

linkffn(His Twenty-Eighth Life by Lomonaaeren)

Harry is reborn for the 28th time and a sane(ish) Voldemort senses his power and decides to kidnap him. Standard Lomonaaeren fare, (great writing, absurd dialogue and characterizations sometimes)

linkffn(All The Stars In The Sky by lemonsqueeze13)

Harry is reborn as the son of Dorea and Charlus (who are not original Harry's grandparents). Harry grows up basically the cool older brother figure to Andromeda, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Sirius and Regulus. The writing is mediocre but it gets a bit better later. I loved the premise enough that I didn't mind it. All in all an entertaining story.

linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious)

*The* HP/GoT crossover. Great plot, masterful characterization, flowing prose, compelling drama... hasn't updated in a year. Bummer.

*** Hey that's mine! Thanks for linking All The Stars In The Sky. True enough about the writing but doing my best to get better.

What did you think of the dialogue btw? Have been trying really hard for it not to come off as stilted or robotic.

**** Hey, just started reading this. One thing bugs me in the first paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  that my life as Harry wasn't as long as it was
#+end_quote

This is sort of pedantic but Harry's life was exactly as long as it was. Something can be less long than something else, but something can't be less long than itself as by definition it is the same as itself. However I do get that you meant that his first life wasn't very long.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** This fic is delightfully cracky. Premise? Harry and Voldemort are forced to endlessly reincarnate together and whenever they first meet, their memories return. Somewhere along the way they get over themselves, start to get along and also go a bit insane.

This fic follows them after they reincarnate into their original lives again and decide to just fuck with everyone. WIP, updated recently.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate') Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (crack with a hint of seriousness, my specialty)

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.
