** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12311860/1/Old-Scars-and-Future-Hearts][Old Scars and Future Hearts]] by AnotherGirlWithAStory. Technically Draco is still a Slytherin in this story, but he does begin to have Gryffindor tendencies. Draco finds Sirius' diary and became much more open minded about the world around him. He also held Sirius as more of a role model he is inspired to be. This also struck the beginning of a friendship between Draco and Harry that is platonic.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and sequels have Gryffindor Draco who hangs out with Golden Trio to the chagrin of Lucius. But its also incredibly stupid, with writer introducing plot devices then ignoring their existence when they should come in play, also forcing plot into rehashing canon even when this makes zero sense.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
