So my idea for a fanfic it's a very very minimal crossover with warhammer fantasy. Hear me out The start In third year instead of believing Sirius harry believes Pettigrew and because harry never heard the true story he trust Pettigrew and Peter becomes the father figure. Or Sirius is actually the traitor and is dark But Peter also has become tired of the headmaster I don't know what to pick. Anyway

Having spent a decent amount of time in the muggle world he learns about fiction and genetic engineering . So having an affinity for rats and wanting to be strong Pettigrew inadvertently through magical rituals using his blood creates the skaven!

The skaven will see harry as a God and Pettigrew as their leader Warpstone I'm thinking is how floo powder is made although it's very very very diluted.

Basically I want Harry controlling the entire skaven under empire and using warpstone to wage war on the wizarding world .

I love warhammer lore and my favorite race is the skaven. And I thought to myself how would the wizard world react to a race of super intelligence rat men? how would warpstone effect the hp worlds version of magic how would they deal with what warpstone could do? Warpstone is not a product of the chaos God's but of simple hp verse magic in this fic Idk just a random idea for a fic I really want to do it but would like some help refining the idea first and to see if people would even be interested in the idea I appreciate any and all help :)


** I don't think you need to involve Wormtail at all.

In fantastic beast and where to find them (the book not the movie) there's a class of magical creatures cralled Quintapeds. They are wizards who've been forcefully transfigured during a war.

I think there is plenty of precedent for Harry messing with stuff like this considering James' skill at transfiguration and Hagrid being the first magical person Harry meets.

** I think you are better off just stealing the general idea of skavens instead of making it a crossover. And im not sure if i like pettigrew as such.

Maybe just make poor little harry have a family of rats living in his cupboard under the stairs who become his only friends in life, and once he has magic he wants to enhance them somehow and accidents do happen - giving you skavens 2.0. And warpstone can be, as you said, anything.

Anyways, while i like the general idea im not sure how well this whole thing would work out after you get the skavens. Do you think you can write an interesting fic concerning skavens vs wizards?

*** It's definitely possible. I'd have have to have it so the skaven don't just swarm the surface and win instantly by numbers . I'd have to do it gradually and I kind of want to keep the whole thing of ratmen? Your insane what rat men? Thing going

*** I've thought about just stealing the idea of skaven yeah but what could I rename them as if I say that this is not a crossover? As for Pettigrew I've only seen 1 fic where he is not like in Canon I want to try a what if Pettigrew wasn't as cowardly as in Canon and instead was very cunning?

** If your intention is for Sirius to be the traitor then you just spoiled your own story. I could see it as an alright plot twist, but not something that is new or unique. Also, I would consider this: You're going to have 3rd Year Harry mutating rats, to create the Skaven. The realm of this is unlikely, because there is no background for it. Skaven is wholly Warhammer, while Animagus is wholly HP. Make Harry a follower of Tzeentch, give him more of a reason to believe Pettigrew, and not just make him a father figure, manipulating a young puppet. Warpstone is sacred to the Skaven, so why make it something as trivial as floo powder? Every Wizard uses it. I would hate to see this fic go down the route of Harry Gets a Strange Power > Than Every Other Wizard because they're too stupid and don't understand his awesome Ratness.

*** How could I introduce warpstone to the hp verse then ? The more I think about the general concept of the story the more I want to take a crack at it but I'll need help ironing out the kinks

**** Set up some kind of Warhammer lore that exists in the realm of HP. Show, don't tell. Don't info dump crap tons of Warhammer, just work it in. Maybe show some perspectives of other HP characters, so they know about the Warhammer lore, but I don't know, its shrouded in mystery, etc. Give it balance. I think for it to work effectively each character needs to have some call back to either the warp, or whatever. Maybe the Wizard earth is some far flung colony of the Imperium, thats lost its way, and devices of the warp have come to take roost. I don't think though that you can just pick and choose aspects of each and expect it to work. Make Warpstone an actual element in the story, and not some parallel to something else. That's all up to you though. I think you should have a cohesive plot though, other than Harry controls or is directly related to Skaven. Why is the Skaven attracted to him? What is his interest in the warp? How is a third year able to genetically modify a rat to make them Skaven?

***** Well I'm working out the plot already and warpstone would/will be a major element in the story . as for harry making the skaven I'd want that to be a gradual thing over the years multiple failures until he finally profects the genetic engineering processes and makes the skaven via warpstone I'm also thinking he would find out or discover warpstone early on and start using and experimenting with it thus slowly driving him mad. Obviously still working on it though.
