I read a fic and I can't remember the title. Or the author, or most of the major plot points. Here's what I remember.

1. It was a long fic.

2. There was a lot about wandless magic. More specifically Asian/Chinese wandless magic. Because in this fic's 'verse, Asian wands were made with blood and/or soul magic.

3. There was some kind of old, proper Asian guy who taught Harry stuff about wandless and soul magic, and removed the Horcrux from him.

4. Old Guy had a family that was also involved. One daughter who died/took a bus offstage after having a daughter who was about Harry's age. This daughter was for a time married to Greg Lestrade. Yes, the Sherlock Holmes one. Except it turns out he was actually related to the LeStranges, and he'd changed his name. And he was actually a wizard but he'd had his blood drained and replaced with muggle blood, and that made him not a wizard until he got a transfusion of wizard blood for reasons I can't remember. There was also another daughter, a squib, who...

5. Ended up becoming a music teacher at Hogwarts, somehow. And apparently she was also a computer programmer, or just good with Muggle tech, because somehow she and her niece and Harry and Hermione and I think maybe some other kids end up figuring out how to shield technology so it works in Hogwarts, and also making magic glass wizard cell phones using floo powder.

That's all I can remember. That, and that Old Guy also had a son or two, and that it was posted on ff.n. I know it's not very coherent.


** That would be A Study of Magic by Books of Change , or as I like to think of it, That Fic That Pretends It Isn't Manpreg.

**** Well, it tries to get around it by saying that Watson is actually a woman who dresses, behaves and responds to John for some reason I don't remember, but really. It's m-preg that doesn't have the balls to admit it.

***** I am re-reading it now, and, yep, Iiiii remember this. And apparently she-John had a still-born twin brother who the family didn't name because their mom died in childbirth and everyone was too busy grieving or upset by the stillbirth or whatever. And so child-John decides to call herself John in memory of her brother. It's grasping at some very convoluted straws.

****** Yeah. I honestly don't know why I read the whole thing. I mean, it is surprisingly good for some of the decisions it makes, but the dishonesty about the m-preg is just insulting.
