I just got an email about Yahoo groups shutting down, and that they have extended the time to request data checkouts to preserve things.

I am only a member of one group for that stuff, and it seems like all the stuff there has been crossposted to fanfiction.net

Is there anyone working on compiling a list of these groups that are getting shut down, and is there anyway I could help ensure that things don't get lost?

** The stuff from MIA authors is already gone. I went to backup the Nonjon omakes that only exist there... and I was too late by the time I remembered that it was happening.

Guys? Procrastination bad.
