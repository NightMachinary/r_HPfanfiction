  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** No one has mentioned Nightmares of Futures Past yet. Admittedly, it only updates about once every three years, but actually, I find the author's commitment to it impressive (he's kept writing it while literally relearning to walk). Even though a lot of its tropes have become a bit cliched by now (they were fresher then), it still stacks up well against other Peggy Sue fics, simply by virtue of having strong characterisations and well-thought-out Butterfly of Doom.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off.

**** Mother of Learning is fantastic. My only regret is that it's reportedly ending soon.

As for recommendations to you... 'A Long Journey Home' is really highly recommended around here, so you might want to go for that. IMO it's the best 'Peggy Sue' fic in the fandom, and I'd count things like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon) in there. (though the other kathryn518 works are also probably a good choice if you enjoyed 'I'm Still Here')

'A Magical World' is the third in a series, and that series /might/ be worth considering today if you're fine with 'Harry leaves and finds another school that teaches blood/dark/soul/etc magic' as a genre. Though IIRC it also kind of /set up/ that genre...

'Rites of Ascension' is a really long running MLP fic. If you don't like magical ponies, this is probably not the fic for you. If you are, it's a pre-s4 ascension fic, and probably the best of that bunch. Yes, it's been actively updating since 2012.

********** I'm still working through that one - you have my respect.

So, Madoka Magica - it's commonly referred to as the darkest magical girl anime, and that's not really wrong.

Magical girls make a contract with a cute fuzzy telepathic animal, and receive a wish in exchange. As you might imagine, there's a few catches. As part of this contract, their souls are ripped from their bodies and turned into gems - damage to this gem kills you. It is, after all, /literally their soul/. Magical girls are supposedly created to hunt witches, [[https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-urayzmncV_4/UFITtTV8frI/AAAAAAAAmIw/nGcNdPnd5o8/s1600/mamicharlottesmaller.png][eldritch]] [[http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36000000/IllusionDolls-image-illusiondolls-36071879-640-360.jpg][abominations]] that feed on humanity. A magical girl will have to regularly defeat these to obtain 'grief seeds' which can be used to reduce the corruption of their soul gem. Corruption which increases from negative emotions, from using magical girl abilities, and over time. All this on its own is pretty bleak, but the final kicker is that witches are, essentially, grown-up magical girls. If the corruption of a soul gem hits maximum, a magical girl becomes a witch. Incidentally, finding that out tends to lead to negative emotions, quickly turning the girl in question into a witch. As you might imagine, the life expectancy is not great. Thankfully, a nice little girl named Madoka made a wish to change that at the end of the anime.

The fanfic takes place several hundred years afterwards in the embodiment of [[https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/593/I_disagree_we_must_go_to_a_fully_automated_luxury__5e6466d8e77bc2391f2ad4829ab03c0d.jpg][fully automated luxury gay space communism]], where a war is being fought to defend the worlds of humanity from hordes of invading aliens, and it's not a war that's going too well. Thankfully, magical girls are available to throw into the meat grinder, giving humanity the ghost of a chance. Nested conspiracy theories ahoy! [[/r/ToTheStars]]

** Quite a few:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): this fic is already in its final story arc, and stopped abruptly. I'm not giving up hope yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891): Harry and Ginny in Middle Earth, one of my favorite crossovers. Now 4 years since the last update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/][Forging the Sword]], linkffn(3557725): One of the best Trio centric fics out there. Most likely abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/][Gods Among Us]]: Postwar Harry and Hermione discover an ancient spaceship and make contact Battlestar Triton. Later they find leads to the Ancients from Stargate Atlantis. I especially like that canon plots in all three universes are changed as a result of their actions. Still active updated, although very slowly.

“Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament”: The author of [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] announced this sequel 3 years ago, but she keeps getting tied up in her other projects.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Ginny and Sirius on empire building exercise in the Land of Fire and Ice. Another one of my favorite crossovers, and still being updated slowly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483): Sequel of “Delenda Est” and Dimensional travel. Unfortunately abandoned just when things got interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738): Another dimensional travel in which an almost canon Hermione is thrown into a non-magical universe, without her wand. She's being hunted by a mysterious enemy. Updated every Saturday.

How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

** Am I permitted to quote one that's not HP? Well it is one I drop everything to read.

/Flashman and the Throne of Swords/.... a Game of Thrones/Harry Flashman crossover. All the complicated, blood-drenched politics of /Game of Thrones/, with the 1860's British Empire thrown into the mix after some clever, inventor chaps devise by chance a bizarre electrical contraption that can warp ships between parallel worlds.

The British Empire at its height with its steam ironclad warships, rifled cannons and muskets finds a whole new world with untapped resources and thinks, "Awesome, we'll have some of that." (they haven't encountered the dragons yet. I guess that will make things more interesting) At the unwilling forefront of all this colonialism is scoundrel, liar, cheat, thief and coward Sir Harry Flashman VC. Who'd rather be anywhere but the benighted Seven Kingdoms.

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
