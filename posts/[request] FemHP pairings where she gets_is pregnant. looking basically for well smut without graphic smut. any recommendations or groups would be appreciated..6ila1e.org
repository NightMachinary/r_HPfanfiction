not sure what more needs to be said :-)


** Scraping the barrel a bit here, but I think there's one fic in which fem!Harry gets together with Tonks and at the "I'm a metamorph and I /could/ impregnate you" chat, Harry agrees to be the mother in this relationship.

Now someone has to remind me. Thats all I remember tbh.

**** Thats the one, yes!

Can't remember if Jamie ever actually got pregnant in this, though.

***** She didn't. iirc, she did say something along the lines of, "I guess I'm going to be the one to have the kids, then" when she found out about metamorphmagi having fully functional equipment of both genders.

****** She did get pregnant in the last chapter, but it was in the afterword-ish part of it which takes part almost two years after the happenings and is not guaranteed to be canon as far as the story's universe is concerned (assuming that the sequel, and the sequel's sequel, ever get finished).

** Fairly sure half of the fem!Harry/Draco fics include this, for example linkffn(The Perfect Wife by slytherin-nette).

** Holly has a baby towards the end of linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path). It was a background thing that was mostly skipped over as she hid in a cellar during most of the pregnancy. She was also impregnated in the graveyard, but she purposely ditched that one by changing into Harry. After leaving school, she impregnated Tonks using Harry-form.

... and then there's the eggs.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.
