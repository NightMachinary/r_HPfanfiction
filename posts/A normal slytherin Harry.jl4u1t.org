Where Harry is not overly dark or against all dark. He is just any other slytherin affected by his surroundings and has friends in his house.

Any parings is fine, just not harlems or multi.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

** Quiet Like a Fight by MzMinola, linkao3(4913998)

Harry doesn't have a lot of friends in this series, but it is one of the most realistic and normal depictions of children at a boarding school.

*** The series appears to just end after third year. Is the conclusion satisfying or does it just end abruptly?

**** From what I remember, it's rather satisfying and it ends about as abruptly as the early HP books do: the plot arc is concluded and Harry is finished with another year at school. It is satisfying and complete enough, but I wanted more after being so invested in the character development. Definitely worth a read for a story without child politicians, even though some of the children are distinctly aware of how complicated the world is and must face things like having Death Eater relatives. Much more realistic and well done than so many Slytherin fics.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) does a really realistic Slytherin Harry. It's quite similar to canon for the first couple of chapters but really takes off on its own. linkffn(When in Doubt Obliviate) is much more light-hearted and humorous but is surprisingly well-done and believable given its cracky premise.
