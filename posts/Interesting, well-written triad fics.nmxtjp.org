I recently read linkffn(Litanie contre la Peur by SeverelyBurntToast) on FF.net, having come across it by accident. I like Haphne as much as anyone else, and Harry/Tracey is also a nice pair. Usually I stay away from polyamorous plots because they tend to be off-putting to me in some way or another. This one is great. Unfortunately, though, as the author mentions in the most recent chapter, it's going to be a good while before the story is updated, and it's already been a long time.

So give me your best believable triad stories. Please leave out anything involving Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, or any of the other pairs that tend to be cited as particularly unbelievable.

  After Ron and Hermione cast him aside, Harry finds solace in two snakes. Offering their assistance, Harry quickly learns that appearances can be deceiving and that being cold-blooded can have its advantages. Can Harry live his life after everything he knows and loves is destroyed? Or will he succumb to insanity, and die before he can fulfill his life's purpose?

  This AU takes place in a world like Mary Potter, but where Eileen Prince left Tobias Snape and threw herself on the mercy of her family before moving to the continent and taking young Severus with her. Lily, James, and Sirius had a triad relationship for a while, and due to an unfortunate lapse of control on Beltane 1979, Lily ended up pregnant by both of them. Fraternal twins Victoria Anne (Potter-Black) Evans and James Henry (Black-Potter) Evans were born in early February of 1980. The prophecy Dumbledore received from Trelawney was not, in fact, anything to do with a boy born in July, but instead spoke of a 'great hero of wizards' who would be 'forced to yield in order to triumph.' It was not overheard by anyone. Dumbledore fulfilled it himself by appealing to the ICW to resolve the problems in Magical Britain when the Order finally sustained too many losses to keep going in the spring of 1982.

  Padma Patil never meant to fall in love with a dragon. When she joined the Romanian Dragon Reserve after Hogwarts to train as a dragon Healer, she finds herself slowly enthralled by the handsome, kind dragonologist Charlie Weasley.But when Draco Malfoy, still broken and in pain following the war, also joins the reserve as a trainee dragon handler, things between Charlie and Padma start to change.Padma Patil certainly never meant to fall in love with two dragons...

** I humbly offer my new snoppymione fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31573067/][Drowning in Secrets and Lies]], complete in 6 chapters. It's a little bit /different/ than anything I've read from others, not least because Poppy is almost always a one-dimensional afterthought in fanfic, and I've put her center stage for 2 of the 6 chapters. When you say "believable" that's something other readers have said repeatedly about Chapter 1, and then after that it's going to be a matter of whether you like Hermione as someone ruthless enough to learn all of Snape's tricks for her own purposes, and also how you feel about a little "magic made me do it" trope. There's stuff /about/ sex but no explicit smut. The triad is developed slowly with an implied HEA. One of my beta readers said this fic is "set to be a really powerful story about triads and a really cool take on snape" so there's that :)

** There's the Triplicity series on AO3 by idleside - they're an amazing author. It's Harry/Daphne/Pansy, and is so good. It has the Lord Potter-Black Wizengamot trope, but Harry genuinely faces problems rather than breezing through life. Each character is well-developed, and it is pretty clear that the three all complement each other, and are in a good relationship as well.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.
