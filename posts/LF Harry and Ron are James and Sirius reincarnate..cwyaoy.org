Looking for fics where both Harry and Ron are effortlessly talented at Magic and they know it, leading to lots of hijinks and mischief.\\
Bonus: No Hermione\\
Absolutely no slash


** What, Hermione can't be Remus? Make her a werecat and you hit all the boxes!

Uhh, I can't think of any who have both. I can think of a couple with pranking Harry, but he is either solo (waging prank war against the twins) or is leading the twins...

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.
