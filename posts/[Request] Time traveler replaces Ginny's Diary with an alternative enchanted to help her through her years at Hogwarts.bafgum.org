This replacement would be everything Tom pretended to be.


** There is a 1 shot by Dunuelos where this happens. It was in one of their LoneTraveller collections. Not sure which one.

** This veers dangerously close to child grooming, even if the other person doesn't have deliberately malicious intentions.

Ginny told Tom /everything/. Keeping such a diary across years introduces the danger of obsession.

*** That's presumptive. Tom had a vested interest in acquiring Ginny's secrets as it made him stronger.

That hardly means that something designed to be the opposite of the diary would do the same thing.

I didn't ask for Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches...

** That's one of the lone traveler fragments. But there are hundreds of them so you're on your own finding it.
