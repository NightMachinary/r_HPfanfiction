:END:
The only thing I remember of this fic is that Theodore Nott was appointed 'Slytherin Representative' (or some phrase to that effect - he actually calls himself that in conversation with Harry one time) to basically bitch Harry into sharing his plans for the tournament. Amiably bitch, oddly, but yeah, they were on the same side. Harry proceeded to be shit-eatingly evasive about his plans to be annoying. Even after the first task went well, the conversations were still "Don't get complacent. What are you going to do now?" and Harry basically refusing to answer directly.

I think the three tasks were the same, but I don't remember specifically one way or another. There was definitely more friendliness between the two and I think Harry might've been more academic and popular than usual, but I couldn't tell you how or why.

It was on either AO3 or FFNet, and I have no idea what the pairings or tags were.
