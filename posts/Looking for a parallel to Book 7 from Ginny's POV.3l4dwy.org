Anyone have a novel length, written in the style of JKR, fic about the time period of the 7th book from Ginny's POV?

For style/quality, I'm looking at the James Potter series, though something else would probably satiate that part of my curiosity for head cannon


** I have read several. But I never liked how Snape was portrayed in them. Either he was excessively cruel that Ginny would never ever agree to the name Albus Severus Potter, or he was treating Ginny as Lily Evans 2.0. Both extremes are implausible in my opinion.

Ginny's situation after the fall of the ministry was especially precarious. Voldemort and death eaters knew that she was very important to Harry regardless whether he broke up with her not. Unless someone convinced Voldemort otherwise, she would certainly be dragged off in front of him, and it wouldn't take long for Harry to capitulate.

Snape was a master legilimens and most likely Voldemort's chief interrogator in the raid on the Weasley wedding. He should have no problem breaking into Ginny's mind to realize what was really going on. Snape should realize that if Ginny was lost to Voldemort, it would be game over. Ginny had to play her being-dumped-furious girl part, while Snape reported back to Voldemort that Harry had run off with Hermione. Voldemort saw these two escaping right under his nose about 3 months after school started.

Furthermore, I'd like to see writers consider the fact that Voldemort was pursuing the Elderwand quest until the Eastern holiday. He spent most of the time out of country, and he would cruciate anyone who summoned him without Harry Potter wrapped up. Thus, his minions were terrified of him and were more than happy to cover things up, and he was pretty much oblivious to what was going at Hogwarts. From the book, it was obvious after Voldemort's return, that crackdowns, torture, and violence increased dramatically. But by that time, all Weasleys had already gone into hiding.

*** /A Call to Arms/ did a pretty decent job IIRC. DATYD took it too far in the negative direction: Snape was both ultra-evil and incompetent in that.

/The Changeling/ is going to do this next chapter. That is almost guaranteed to be awesome.

**** I don't like Call to Arms.

If chapter8-10 really happened, the name Albus Severus Potter would have never existed.

DATYD introduced too many unnecessary plot devices. Neville saved by Krum from the execution chamber, WTF?

***** Eh. That Snape allowed students to be tortured by the cruciatus for long hours is canon.

****** To Michael Corner, yes, and that happened after Voldermort got the Elderwand. DA basically stopped operations after that episode.

If Ginny had suffered similar things, there would be no way they named their son 'Severus'.

In the canon, there was no mentioning Ginny being tortured by the Carrows. Maybe that was the other major reason Ginny felt grateful toward Snape.

*** i agree with your ideas on the matter. Snape would have been protecting her, even if only in a capacity such as he did Harry, one who he loathed, but for the sake of his own aims couldn't afford to lose.

i'm intrigued by the idea of the time frame, and (wishfully) wish that JK would have written that POV for what was going on.

** There was a really good one on SIYE. Lemme see if I can find it real quick.

Edit: this is the one I remembered. It's not quite what I thought, unfortunately - it's mostly focused on Book Six, although it also covers Book Seven. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128362]]

*** Looks good regardless!

She is a character so important to the character development in the series, but had a potential for a cool story of her own. I was only looking at book 7 as its a completely parallel set of events

Only 6 chapter so far, but I've written quite far ahead. It will be novel length.
