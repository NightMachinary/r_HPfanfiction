Hey I'm new here, and I'm looking for a Dramione fic where they hate eachother... It can be post Hogwarts or in Hogwarts, I don't really mind, and rated M. Thanks in advance :))


** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/][Isolation by Bex-chan]] if you haven't already read it. Best Dramione fic by a long shot.

Another really angsty fic is [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544208199][Water]] by kissherdraco

** linkao3(The Politician's Wife)

There is not a lot of action, but I really enjoyed it. It's like watching Mad Men.

  This story is set twenty-three years after the fall of Voldemort. Our main characters are Ministry employees, middle-aged, and the majority of them not very happy.

** Mine by HufflepuffMommy is really good. Definitely more romance & hurt/comfort than angst & it all devolves into a really sweet love story although they hate each other in the beginning.

  Hermione Granger is a single mother. The last thing she needed was to get involved with anyone, especially Draco Malfoy. Love however, has other plans. Rated M for mature themes later on. (Hermione/Draco) (Harry/Ginny)

  Draco Malfoy is visited by Hermione Granger in the middle of the night. But how is this possible? She's been dead for two months now... NOT a ghost story. DHr.
