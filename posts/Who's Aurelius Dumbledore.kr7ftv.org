So, what's the most accepted theory right now?

Is he Albus' lost and most-secret-yet sibling?

Is he the love child of a secret affair between Percival Dumbledore and Bathilda Bagshot?

Is he actually a cousin of Albus?

Is he fake?

Is he the product of a mpreg story between Albus and Gellert?


** He's Corvus Lestrange. Grindelwald lied, and there is a very brief scene in the movie showing his men doing something to the Lestrange family tree in that mausoleum

*** I so want this to be true. My biggest fear for the next movie(s) is that they're going to claim "Bellatrix Lestrange" was just an unnamed flower on the family tree and completely ignore the fact that she married into the family. I don't love but can accept some canon divergence (like having McGonagall around while Dumbledore is a teacher) but that would just ruin it for me. I love the Black Sister dynamic.

*** This is a theory I can get behind as well. Always found it kind of weird that the Unbreakable Vow is still bothering Kama if Corvus died all those years ago. Plus, Leta's memories could have been tampered with, although I'd feel horrible for her if that was the case.

*** I want this to be true solely because I thought Corvus suits him much better than Aurelius, even though Aurelius is one of my favorite ancient Roman names (yes, I have favorites, 5 years of Latin results in that lol)

** Currently my money is on Grindelwald lying but if he actually is telling the truth then I'm putting my money on a cousin of some kind. I mean, we know knothing about Percivals family.

** I wish Grindelwald was lying. But now it's going to be some complicated thing with Ariana's obscurus finding a new home in Credence. And maybe he's also Corvys? Who knows, this shit is weird AF.

** I think he's the cover-up for Dumbledore /actually/ having a squib kid. There's not a lot of book-or-movie canon for how LGBTQ+ people are treated in the wizarding world, so I wouldn't be surprised if c. 1901 Dumbledore had a kid, realized the kid was a squib, and covered it up. I don't believe that kid is Credence though, as Dumbledore did not act like how I expected he would for that scenario. Grindelwald just believes he is, for whatever reason.

...Also, yes, I realize how crack-y this sounds, but this is my leading theory since all of the other ideas I've entertained seem lame or don't make much sense. So there.

**** Aurelius Dumbledore is the (alleged) true name of Credence Barebone from Fantastic Beasts. That was what Grindelwald claimed his name was in one of FB movies.

** You know, i hate harems. I actually despise harem fanfics.

But qhen I see slash or mpreg, i give it a pass (but i dont read it) because magic can peobebly do that.
