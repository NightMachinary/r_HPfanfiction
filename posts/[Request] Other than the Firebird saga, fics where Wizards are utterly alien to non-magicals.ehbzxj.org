Not alien as in "oh, you are so different and cool!" but as in "OH GOD WHAT ARE YOU STAY AWAY FROM MEEEEEEE!!!!!"

** Could you link the series you mentioned? This idea sounds very interesting to read!

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
