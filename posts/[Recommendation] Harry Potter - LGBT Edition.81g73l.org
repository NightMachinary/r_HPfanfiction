If anyone is feeling down, reading the reviews for Harry Potter - LGBT Edition linkffn(12817894) might make you feel a bit better. Yes, some of the reviews are quite vile but the story is far, far worse. And the various Author's Note...I have no comment on the matter. I stumbled upon this while looking for new stories to read. Enjoy!

**** No need to apologize; it wasn't a criticism by any means. Although what we /could/ start doing around here is custom-flairing certain "Recommendation" posts as "Condemnation" when we want to share particularly bad stuff we've seen. We could even make a weekly tradition out of it: "Worst-Fanfic-I've-Seen-Wednesday" or "Foul Fanfic Friday" or something like that. (Although, as fun as that sounds, it also seems like openly mocking people's fics might run afoul of Rule 3 in the sidebar over there.)

** I'm getting cancer from this bullshit. I'd rather read a fanfic where Dumbledore and Dobby copulate than read another sentence of this trash. Apart from all the rubbish in the story, the author has absolutely no grasp on canon (satire or not). Harry's wearing a V-cut cropped top and stockings while at the Dursleys'??!!?! HE ONLY WORE HAND-ME-DOWNS FFS.

“I respect J.K. Rowling a lot. Her books were pretty good for their time but unfortunately the books aren't progressive and don't live up to the modern standards that we live up to today. This is 2018 and we have all kinds of people: Gay, Trans, Lesbian, Gender Binary, Asexual, Gender Fluid etc. Unfortunately, members of the LGBT and the fellow generation will disregard the HP books, considering them offensive and sexist and transphobic. This is because the Harry Potter series alienates them, forgetting to include the LGBT altogether and only focusing on gender norms and traditional sexual preferences. Harry, despite his close friendship with Ron, falls in love with only girls throughout the book, again an example of pushing straightness on us. It's always been the biggest mystery on why she never included any character that wasn't straight and anyone that didn't identify as the gender they were born with in her stories.” This is the most arrogant shit I've heard anyone on FFN ever say. Honestly, this LGBTQGirl is just too stupid to realise that Rowling was targeting kids with the first few books. And it is parents who buy books for their kids. Like hell parents are gonna buy a book that straight-up encourages homosexuality. I pray that not all LGBTQ people are like that.

****** You've been warned:

Chapter 1: "Unfortunately, members of the LGBT and the fellow generation will disregard the HP books, considering them offensive and sexist and transphobic."

Chapter 2: "If you get offended by my writing, you are most likely a straight white male or even female that is homophobic, transphobic, racephobic, etc."

Chapter 3: Nothing to quote here as the author accuses a Tesco cashier of being rude, told the author she's an ugly waste of space woman, a sexist, thought that the cashier would rape her. Oh, did I mention that author said the cashier was a "white male"?

Chapter 4: Again, nothing to quote here as the author goes on a rant about how Fantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindelwald will not directly explore Dumbledore's sexuality. Also, this chapter doesn't include any story content whatsoever. She also said JK Rowling "muted her" when she [the author] asked her about it.

Chapter 5: "I didn't make McGonagall a villain because that would be racist and stereotypical." - Like what in the actual fuck?

Chapter 17: Again, not an actual chapter. In fact, it's so short I can quote the whole thing: "STOP HATING YOU CYBER TERRORISTS! NO CHAPTERS UNTIL I GET POSITIVE REVIEWS! THX FOR MAKING ME CRY."

I won't go through the rest of the chapters but I think you get the general idea. The whole thing's a bunch of nonsense really.

****** OP has already given some examples of the Author's Notes. Instead, here are some examples of the story itself.

Unlike any normal child, Harry lived under the cupboard under the stairs just like how the LGBT live under the crushing expectations of society's view on gender and sexuality. Harry knew all about this. In fact, he was homosexual as well. Proud and righteous, he never tried to hide the real him and instead made his inner feelings known to everyone.

As any straight white male would know, you should never act in any way that would single you out, make you special or let you express yourself. That's why they all hated Harry. He was real with them. Girls understood him a bit more because they were also oppressed, due to the wage gap and the countless sexual harassment they have received due to their gender such as mansplaining and the patriarchy itself.

If the story merely wanted to draw attention to LGBTQ issues, it may actually possess value. However, the snobbish discriminatory messages the writer tries to shove down readers' throats are just horrible.

BTW I have a question. Why do the LGBT/feminists try to act as if the wage gap was not only an American issue? Because it is an only American issue.

******** I'm afraid I am unable to answer your question and I am not an American. However, I believe that an issue such as a gender wage gap is extremely difficult to prove, given that the gender ratios across different industries are different. More men work on oil rigs, more women work in the childhood education industry. Unless a study covering all industries is conducted, the gender wage gap remains unproven.

********* That is true. However according to Wikipedia(not the most reputable of sources, along with their shitty sources) I quote

#+begin_quote
  There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: unadjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience. For example, someone who takes time off (e.g. maternity leave) will likely not earn as much as someone who does not take time off from work. Factors like this contribute to lower yearly earnings for women. With all external factors adjusted for, the gender pay gap no longer exists. Unadjusted pay gaps are much higher. In the United States, for example the unadjusted average female's annual salary has commonly been cited as being 78% of the average male salary, compared to 93% for the adjusted average salary for graduates.

  The World Economic Forum provides recent data from 2015 that evaluates the gender pay gap in 145 countries. Their evaluations take into account economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment scores
#+end_quote

The data mentioned in the quote is nowhere to be found, sadly.

****** Did you get the chance to read Tommy's (the author's so-called boyfriend) chapter? It got deleted but the gist of it was: LGBT is stupid. This is stupid. And that's pretty much it. So in the AN of the current chapter, the author criticizes his post but thanks him for being such an awesome writer. I mean, people have accused Stephen King of using "ghost writers" but this author takes that to a whole new level.
