I remember reading this fic some time back where Tom Riddle was immortal but not due to Horcruxes, he had changed his body into a combination of different creatures or something? I think halfway through the fic he also changed Harry. I just can't remember the name of it or what it was.


** There was a story like this by Epic Solemnity, I think it's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]]
