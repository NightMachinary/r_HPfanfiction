** James because all he has to do is disarm Lily. Then he can turn into a Stag. Pretty sure if he tried hard enough he'd end it pretty quickly.

** I'll vote for James.

James is described as a brilliant student by McGonagall, Lupin and pretty much everyone else. He, along with Sirius, were said to be very talented.

Lily on the other hand is also described as talented by Slughorn and others. Considering that she was the Head Girl, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that she was also a straight O student (like other Head Girls in the story eg McGongall). Note that she possessed a degree of control over her magic before attending Hogwarts.

The only question is whether her academic performance stemmed from studiousness like Hermione's or brilliance like James'/Sirius'.

** James because he smacked around Severus who was creating curses like Sectumsempra. He must be pretty good at fights.

** Lily in a white room scenario, purely because Charms are generally better for combat compared to transfiguration, and from we know from Olivander that Lily's wand was more suitable for charms compared to James.

Of course, this analysis is useless because it discounts everything actually important in a fight, so it is ultimately up to how you want or need the story to go at any given point.

my exact reasoning for James is hte opposite of yours, James because that is how the masters like Voldemort and Dumbledore duelled

** James without a doubt, due to his away from school studies, he appears to be far more capable with a wand and a brilliant student of both Transfiguration and charms.

He and Sirius were pretty equal and one of them was rumoured as a freakin 21 year old to be capable of being the right hand of Voldemort.

nothing in the series suggest tthat Lily compares to James with a wand, unless we go into fanon territory where she is a charms prodigy that was being mentored by Fitwick

***** I mean Harry had a phoenix feather wand and he was basically only good at DADA and proficient in Charms and transfiguration.

** We know James was good at transfiguration and beating people up, Lily was good at Charms and Potions. I think James would win because he just has more applicable knowledge. Lily wasn't really a fighter.
