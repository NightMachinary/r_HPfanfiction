** Moved two decades ahead, Harry Born in year 2000 instead of 1980. Home life better simply because their is no way to hide anything like canon abuse in that time.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

After going getting back from Diagon Alley Harry had started wondering if their was any information on Hogwarts on the internet.

A search had lead him to Wikileaks which had a blurb about finding more information on an Onion site with instructions on how to access Tor.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Bloody hell!" The warnings for Hogwarts Muggleborn and muggle-raised were fecking scary.

The whole British wizarding world was an absolute shit show of corruption, racism, classism and isolationism to an extreme.

There were tons of contact information links on getting asylum out of wizarding Britian. How much education they would have to retake. It was a nightmare compared to the Americas. Wizarding Europe was not ahead of mundanes at all. They were centuries behind.

Wizarding America, MACUSA was several decades in advance of the Mundane America. Holy hell!

Harry filled out an asylum form quickly with MACUSA and prayed for the best.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Boss we got a mundane-raised from Britian who just got his Hogwarts first year letter requesting asylum."

Brian's boss waved his hand for Brian to continue on. It wouldn't have been brought to his attention unless it was important in some way.

"Well the name is Harry Potter sir. Pretty sure it's legitimate, he's also asking for rescue from an abusive home."

Nick stared for a minute into the air thinking.

"Contact the Thunderbirds, if this is valid have them extract him immediately. I'll get in touch with the president about getting him full asylum. The Potters were a wealthy family. Have someone contacts the Goblins. This is going to be a mess."

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry at the park where the email had said to be with only Hedwig. He had been told most importantly to leave his wand behind due to Bristish Ministry tracking charms on it.

He felt a calmness wash over him as a calming charm hit him. Someone appeared before him casting spells over him.

"Holy hell! Operational Silence, Fallback To Waterfall Cave."

Harry had no idea what was happening but he suddenly felt tired and fell asleep.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"The kid came up positive for magical blocks, mental blocks, blood charms, tracking charms, memory blocks, hell there were metamorph blocks on the kid. That's discounting the dark soul magic we found."

Nick looked over the entire list of what the Thunderbirds had found. They had kept the kid under stasis for almost three months getting him back up to par.

Albus may be leader of the ICW but his magical signature all over the illegal and horrible spells on the kid would see him serving multiple life sentences.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry bounced across the room snatching the ball as he threw for a score.

Victory was close and he could taste it. Life was great in MACUSA to say the least. It helped Harry was the star player for Gravity Ball, scouts for pro teams were already checking him out at only 15.

The attention from the girls helped out as well. Life was good!

**** Thanks, I will add it to my queue for sure. Have two stories ahead right now. First is from a prompt about using cursive for runes and the next is a space adventure. I've posted the short of the space on already on FF. This story will require some serious planning for it.

Have to create new school, people, and make it into a believable world. Going to take a fair bit of pre-writing to map out.

Like Waterfall Cave is a head nod to hidden caves behind waterfalls. So a foreign magical agency operating in another country would likely have safe houses under fidelius charms or similar. Having a place to stash a HVT that blocks tracking is a must have.

Tons of little things like that to flesh out and then throw into the background. Sure most won't notice, but I will, and that's something I cannot tolerate letting slide in my work.

This story would be huge and extremely detailed. So even when I get to it in queue it will take some time before it is released.

****** Would still have to fill in the details. Teacher names, school layout etc...

Also unless Illvermorny is a city state school it cannot be the only school in America.

Ignoring Rowling's 10% number and using .1% (1/1,000th) we still have 250,000 witches and wizards in America in 1990. If we are super conservative and only have 2.5% age 11-17 that is 6,250 school age kids.

6,250 students at Illvermorny at any given time. These are the conservative numbers. Well below what statistics tells us those numbers should be and below what Rowling said the population was.

With Rowling's 10% that would mean 25 MILLION witch and wizards in America. Real statistics puts about 15% of the population in that age bracket. So 15% of 25 million would mean Illvermorny has a larger population of students at 3,750,000 than Los Angles or Chicago had people.

That's not including the populations of Canada and Mexico as well. Adding I those populations brings in an additional 1,695,000 students. That's almost a school student population of FIVE AND A HALF MILLION STUDENTS.

Pretty sure that puts it just under New York City as the second most populous city in the Americas in 1990.

She created an interesting world for sure she was just horrible at actual world building. Good framework but just that, a good frame, the rest needs work.

**** Not what I was going for, just an english speaking country honestly. Rowling's Canon has people shitting on the floor in the halls for most of a thousand years.

It takes little to be more advanced than her Bristish Wizarding World is. Seeing as how both Durmstrang and (The Frenchie School I cannot spell) didn't seem off put by Hogwarts you can guess they are at the same level.

So centuries behind the modern world, just past shitting on themselves, and overall really fecking stupid, yeah, that's not a high bar to surpass.

Swear to god I do, Rowling's WW in Europe are just about equal to a really healthy third world country. Seriously the health benefits are about the only positive these idiots have.

A fecking ghost teacher, a class EVERYONE FUCKING KNOWS IS CURSED AND NO ONE HAS FIXED FOR DECADES, a teacher who actively hates kids, and a magic school that for some reason has Astronomy at night. Not like they could spell up some night sky illusion or some shit.

Oh yeah let's not forget the fecking squib janitor who has an entirely redundant job as elves do his actual work. Best part, he also hates kids!

I wonder do Snape and Filch hang out on the weekends drinking homemade potioned gin, swapping hair gel recipes and sneering at how much they have made kids suffer that week?

Seriously the bar could hardly be lower for how shit she made the education in hogwarts. So yeah, America has a better system. Feck I could start one in Mogadishu during the 90s and it would have been better. Bonus for all the practical exercises for the Defense course.

Could have been Ausieland, they speak English, went with Murica though cause why not.

***** Fleur was telling everyone how much better Beauxbatons was actually. Including criticising the teachers. She might have been right.

Hogwarts has a selection of parody teachers: the teacher that hates kids, the useless one, the incredibly boring one, the competent one but strict, the fun one. I have had all of them in my life. Hogwarts is somewhat limited in that these teachers are the only teachers, most schools will have a McGonagall for every Trelawney but it's not as unreal as you'd think really.

And seeing as they can vanish it instantly, they are less being backwards but too up in their own power. It's like how versions of the future will include things where we can go to the toilet but keep functioning. It's more practical but also, kind of sad?

And Astronomy of course it's at night. It's more fun that way...In school part of my Physics course was Astronomy, and sure we could look at artificial versions of the night sky but why the hell would you when you can look at the /real/ night sky? So that's what we did.

***** Unfortunately, in England that is school age.

As for the Pelka case - his mum told the school that he had an eating disorder that made him scavenge. So the school ignored the fact that he stole food from bins. When he got home from school, his parents fed him salt to make him vomit up the little he was given for lunch, made him do unhealthy amounts of exercise around the house and kept him in a room with a mattress on the floor and no handle on the inside so he couldn't get out. He'd even been taken to hospital for injuries and no action taken.

Nothing wrong with a good evil Dumbles fic! I honestly wouldn't have been shocked if Dumbledore had done blocks in canon - he was focused on the greater good, after all.

****** Actually when I get the spare time throughout the day I add notes to a file I am making. So far have a word doc that is five pages on world building and back story for the story based on this prompt. Totally making this my first full length fanfiction.

So far have fine tuned the magic system and overhauled parts of it.

Using the medium length, about 40k words, as a means to test out some ideas for it. Changed world history here and there slightly to match a world of magic.

My only big nod to canon is, and will likely always be, Ancient Runes. It's just a language class for ancient languages in canon. Which makes sense to me, I have wizard generations at just over double ours are at 50 years a generation.

So in 1,000 years mundanes have about 50 generations and wizards only have 20. They would have far more texts we would consider ancient and to them are just a bit old.

Actually going with wizards and witches don't have a maximum length of lifespan. Magic keeps them going in decent shape.

The Flamels are famous as the Stone keeps them young as they age. So they look and feel as if they are in their 20's while other wizards look old as balls.

Those things are just minor background details I have pages of to fill out my world.

** Harry is born later, so from 2000 to 2010

Edit: I should clarify, the books events are all moved forwards to 2000-2010. This is done for Harry to discover WikiLeaks.

-

Harry had always been interested in technology. It just was so amazing! You could do anything, like enter a virtual world of fire and dragons, fly to space, travel the world in just hours, and and access tons of information so easily, it might as well be magic! Essentially, Harry was a giant fan of technology, if you haven't noticed that yet. The reasons why though, are a bit darker.

One day, while Harry was browsing the internet while his cousin wasn't looking, he stumbled upon a website called WikiLeaks. He had actually wanted to search for Wikipedia, but Dudley, his cousin, had somehow managed to completely and utterly destroy his keyboard.

He clicked on the link anyways, maybe something interesting was there, he had learned some obscure knowledge this way before..

--

By now, you can call Harry Potter, the magical boy-who-lived, a tech nerd, and a giant privacy activist. Have we forgotten something? Oh, yes, he's trying to escape Britain once and forever.

Why a privacy activist though? Story for another time. But escape Britain? That i can answer.

Apparently, when Harry installed Tor for privacy reasons, of course, he opened WikiLeaks, and found a pretty mythical leak about 'Magical Britain' being in cultural and economical chaos. So that rabbit-hole lead him to discovering magic before the age eleven.

--

'For Fuck's sake!' Harry calmly said, while falling out of his chair and unto the floor. Then laying there for some time, as if waiting for something to happen. Then he remembered that he needed to research it quickly before Dudley came home.

So, the magical Britain is like the muggle Somalia country. Isolated, corrupt, and in the figurative stone age. The rest of the world, both muggle and wizard, cooperated, and as a result of that, they prospered. The muggles knew that magic existed, but they didn't burn the wizards. And neither did the wizards harm the muggles.

They were actually working together to make genetic engineering advanced enough for it to be possible to implant magic genes. They also had a couple of colonies in space, as apparating and muggle space agencies resulted in trans-galactic teleportation.
