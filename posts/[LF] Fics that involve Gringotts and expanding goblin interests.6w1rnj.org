I've recently finished as much of Sympathetic Properties as is currently completed and I'm looking for more goblin centric fics. Harry Crow I've read but haven't liked well. I'm looking for some shady dealings, political maneouvres and underground (literally) plot lines.

Romance is acceptable provided it isn't the sole purpose of the fic. Hopefully not solely "Lord Harold Potter inherits the entire world and then gains fifty different aspects of various magical creatures" kind of fics.


** You should take a look at this month's Book Club selection, Hogwarts Houses Divided. The last third involves some intrigue with the goblins.

** linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) is short but it's generally described as "the same premise as /Harry Crow/ but done a bajillion times better". It's /extremely/ good, highly recommended.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?
