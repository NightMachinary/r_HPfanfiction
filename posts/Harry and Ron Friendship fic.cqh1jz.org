So after reading the comments on this post

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ckvjn0/ron_and_hermione/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

I realized even though Hermione's friendship with Harrry is more based on circumstance than the friendship Harry has with Ron( cuz Harry and Ron have more common interest and get along better as a duo than Harry and Hermione) in a AU where Harry is only friends with one of them its Hermione not Ron. At least in my experience.

So because I'm curious AU where Harry is still the MC/protagonist and friends Ron but not Hermione. I prefer more plot and friendship based fics to romance but any ship with Harry m/m or m/f is fine no ships are fine too. But Rons friendship with Harry has to be a major focus.

No fem! Harry or genderbending. Any sort of AU is fine but preferably more canon divergence than a completely different world. It doesnt have to be complete but I prefer long fic.

Edit: it applies if the friendship is broken off or erodes with Hermione and not Ron. Since ive also seen that alot the other way around but not where he keeps the friendship with Ron and not Hermione.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

There's another one, but it's hard to find. It's Harry/Luna and she's reporting to Dumbledore.

  Have you ever realized that all you know about Hermione is what she said about herself and what she did in front of others? And that the trio is much too lucky for it to be natural?
