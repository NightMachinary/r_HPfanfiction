So many fics have the Americans using magic-resistant or magical variations if cellphones and computers and the French don't give two craps about blood purity and use "mundane" instead of muggle, and the Japanese drive magic cars instead of those stupid inferior brooms and so on. I want fics where Britain isn't some embarrassment on the world, where Hogwarts education isn't useless because the poor, stupid Brits dumb down the education for pureblood sakes and don't even teach muggle subjects! Differences are fine, and some places can be better, but not by so much that Magical Britain is a laughing stock.

Bashing, slash and crossovers are fine. No genderbending, mpreg, pottercest or romance-driven plot. Thank you!


** It's kinda hilarious that people think Magical Britain completely lacks enchanted muggle vehicles. Knight Bus, Hogwarts Express and Ministry cars are mentioned.

Anyways! linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) comes to mind.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

*** They either tried and got caught leaving or were basically raided before they even knew what was going on?

There's plenty of explanations you can use for that one-including the idea that those that were caught were the die-hard remnants that refused to leave or those that were simply too bloody poor to make it out on time.

The 'I like it here so much I am going to stick right here and wait for the murderous lunatics to knock on my door and drag me into the night!' explanation is not exactly one that I would go with, what with requiring the one thinking it to be suicidally retarded-or just plain suicidal-for the idea to work.

**** My impression was that Muggleborns were not Voldemort's main target in the first war, and that magical Britain was the most progressive country when it came to equal rights for Muggleborns.

So it had to be a shock for them when they found out the truth about the Muggleborn Registration Commission. Those Muggleborns were basically lured into the Ministry and their freedoms taken away on the spot. By then, it was too late to escape. Not all Muggleborns were locked in Azkaban though, many had just their wands taken and their assets seized. We saw some of these people begging in Diagon Alley when the Trio tried to rob Gringotts, one of them even had the courage to charge Bellatrix (Hermione).

Some might have seen the sign and run, but since the Books were narrated from Harry's very limited POV, we don't know about them.

** My head cannon has always been that GB is the most "modern" magical country (a muggleborn was elected minister in the 70s). With North America as a totalitarian republic, the Latin countries dominated by oligarchies, no muggle-raised in Durmstrang because muggleborn are stolen by magical families in the slavic countries, Germany as a patchwork of hereditary principalities where muggleborn pay their education through (inheritable) indentured servitude,the non-human and muggleborns of the Balkans and Middle East under a dhimmi status, a rigid caste system in India, East Asia dominated by magical warlords who give no respect to their figureheads, religious gerontocracies in South America,...

Of all the cultures and countries of the late 17th century (instauration of the Status of Secrecy), GB is probably the one that was most similar to a modern western country (see Bill of Right of 1689). Some countries would have changed quicker than GB since, but going from the most "liberal" country to the most oppressive in 3 centuries, without a serie of civil wars? Doubtfull.

*** Thing is, there was a civil war. Quite a bad one too. Personally, I think that pre-Voldemort Britain was actually the social and economic powerhouse you would expect it to be largely because it was nowhere near as badly affected by World Wars 1 and 2 as the rest of the world.

However, the Dark Lord probably leveled that particular playing field in his own unique little ways. The Magical Britain we see is in the process of rebuilding before 1995 comes around. The scars are tidied up but the damage has been done. And it was most likely extensive.

As for the rest of the world, again, the situation you describe was probably how things were done... prior to World Wars 1 and 2. But between the absolute devastation these conflicts would have wrought and the power games that followed in their immediate aftermaths (alongside, well, Marxism and Anarchism actually being feasible ideologies through the liberal application of magic rather than the prelude to things getting way worse), the likelihood of such a state of affairs persisting are actually quite small.

What is more likely is that Magical Britain is in the unique position of having a single unified magical system with a recorded spellbase stretching back millenia. Everywhere else would see clashes and conflicts between different kinds of magical systems becoming evident-not to mention exacerbated by the injection of new magical systems originating from overseas thanks to migrations and colonisation efforts.

This... would have a negative effect on the local populace. Accounting for often wildly disparate magical systems and how they would interact with each other would be worsened by the fact that those self-same systems would come with strings attached to them. Strings of the 'learn more by supporting X' variety or 'get a new wand if you do y' variety.

That would have a knock-on effect on magical industry too should the maker's potential customers accidentally manage to modify the product when said product comes into contact with a magical system that happens to be totally at odds to the maker's own. I would hate to have to handle a broomstick, for example, if the 'up' command happens to kickstart a spell of its own under my wandless system of choice. Anything from the broom not working to the broom undergoing explosive detonation may ensue.

As you may expect, that would have severe effects on social development. Given that you have several magical systems that often contradict or even conflict with each other, managing to come up with a homogeneous solution would be /hard/. Standardised education would be a toughie too since you have to account for all the various systems students need to learn in order to simply get by in their societies. And infrastructure? Pfeh.

This would stifle independent research and development efforts in countries that experience such problems. Moving forwards in one area might require research in a half-dozen other, seemingly unrelated at first glance areas first if you want to avoid any strange and fiddly accidents. Developing commercially viable products and services from such research would be, again, a hazardous endeavour indeed when considering how your potential customers may approach magic.

And that's before you get into the ideological and cultural differences each set would produce.

Needless to say, it is likely a mess outside of the Isles. Not in the 'hurr durr everywhere's a shithole that enslaves people' sense but in the sense that everything is harder to do with magic if you actually care about things such as people, buildings, cities-you know, fragile things. Toying around with the rules governing reality gets a lot harder if you don't have a wand to do the heavy lifting for you, after all, and there are a lot of systems that don't use wands at all.

So that's the advantage Britain has-a single over-arching magical system that is stable enough to use as is, has a ton of spells and research sitting behind it and a government with the right infrastructure to take advantage of it. It also features a good education system, an okay relationship with the muggle government (in that the government in question is not actively seeking to murder them for being an affront to their god/ideology/industrialisation efforts) and a steady supply of people that are willing to stick around long enough to actually have kids within their magical enclave-in sufficient numbers to allow the population to grow beyond a small cabal of hardcore purebloods, no less!

And that's the point where I could see magical Britain actually being a fairly okay place to live. It's not perfect, what with random assholes popping up to go on murder rampages every decade or so, but it is stable enough and prominent enough to allow for the exploration and development of magic as a whole without having to deal with the whole 'risk opening a Black Hole on Earth by sneezing during a ritualised spellcasting' thing the rest of the world has to deal with to a greater and lesser extent.

So there you have it-how to make magical Britain awesome without having to make anywhere else suck harder than canon MB! It's simply a matter of simplicity-because Britain has kept its magical system simple and never threw away random research doodles ever, it now has a magical system that combines quick, easy, stable and powerful spellcasting in one easy-to-learn package that doesn't blow up in your face should you attempt to cast those spells without a wand.

This has, in the past, given them the edge when it came to spellcasting, research, infrastructure, commercial development, combat and many, many other areas. And while wand use is probably gaining traction overseas thanks to the British Empire exporting the idea, MB still has all the delicious delicious wand-related spell libraries others just don't, which gives them an almost unbeatable edge in wand-measuring contests.

Okay, so socially it's a bit... poorer than it used to be, but it's still a great place to live if you happen to like performing research without committing suicide by foreign magical system!

Or that's how I see it anyhow.
