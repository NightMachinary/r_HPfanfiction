Can be either tonks or Teddy


** I now imagine an adorable four year old Teddy, sitting on the sofa, and changing appearance every other moment while sneezing and Harry in the background being a bit overwhelmed because he never had Teddy while sick before and honestly, he isn't sure if those quick changes are okay or somehow bad for Teddy. And Ginny just being very calm about it, like: ‚ÄúThis is just the flu and he doesn't have it bad. Can we now refocus on the wireless? The Chudley Canons are loosing and I want to gloat about it to Ron.‚Äù

Obviously the affected character would be a child, I think it would be a bit ridiculous for adults to have such struggles. But a child not yet able to control it at all times fits very well in my opinion.

**** Why would he go to muggle school though? If he goes he is a huge risk to the statue unless they have a way to freeze his apperance. Most magical children are home schooled til 11

***** I mean his grandad was muggleborn and his mum grew up in a muggle area, his godfather was muggle raised, I don't remember what remus' blood status was but I would assume as a known son of a werewolf (see that rita skeeter article jk wrote once I think it was on pottermor) so I assume all the adults who are raising him would want him to experience the heritage his parents had. also his only living bio family is a grandmother who from what we know lived a comfortable middle class life and now without half the family income would be required to work so can't take time to homeschool.

*** I mean tonks canr walk through a door without tripping over an umbrella stand my mind went more to a kind of spasm so even adults would suffer it but yea it would make more sense for children to suffer through random changes and adults maybe just struggle to change at will. like when you have a bad flu its a struggle to do anything at all really

*** That's what I was imagining OP wanted to say. Teddy's face gets stuck in the silliest form during the sneeze.

** I'd find it comedic if most magicals possessed the talent in some way or other, the bloodlines are all interconnected after all, but unknowingly suppresses it because it was a 'rare talent'. Add in near immunity to muggle disease and rarity of the given symptoms in magical illnesses, most do not know about it.

Cue a big outbreak, and Diagonal Alley turning all colors of the rainbow. Knockturn too.
