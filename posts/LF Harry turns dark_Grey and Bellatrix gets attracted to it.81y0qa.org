Whether it plays in the Magical world or in a Modern Setting without Magic. Whether Voldemort recruit Harry to keep him "safe" (he is Weapon, that defeats him after all) or Tom Riddle as the Leader of a Gang find and take him with him... The setting doesnt matter, as long as Harry might has a change in his Behaviour, but without getting evil, and Bellatrix gets attracted to him. It should result in a more or less Harry/Bella Fic. Even one-sided attraction is fine. A Smut fic would be the perfect result, but erotica would also be good. Atleast she should try to seduce Harry.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]] is the only thing I've read that fits what you're looking for. tl;dr Heavily AU, war goes on shit happens, Voldemort eventually gets offed in a massive battle, a dying Dumbledore sends Harry to another world because everything's gone to shit but Bellatrix gets caught in the vortex so they're both stuck in the new dimension. You don't get to see much of the change in Harry's behavior since most of it happened before the story starts.
