I just finished reading linkffn(A Slytherin Through Time) and was wondering if there were any other good stories like it.

Complete stories would be great and I don't like much focus on romance.


** linkao3(Why you shouldn't mess with time turners) --> not complete

linkffn(5114608) --> not complete

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7811107]]) --> one-shot complete

  Set after the events of the cursed child. Draco gives Hermione the time turner and, in an attempt to destroy it, their minds get sent back to their eleven year old selves. Can they do it all again? Without changing the future? No, probably not...Currently being translated into Chinese!http://helusen.lofter.com/post/1fe4e4e4_12be113fe

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  With a sly smile he eyed the time turner. It gleamed like gold, just the way the Malfoys liked it. With this, he could save his son. He went for the door but came to a sudden halt when realization hit him: With the time turner, he could save more than one person. (Draco-centric time travel fanfiction, 3rd year)

  AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]
