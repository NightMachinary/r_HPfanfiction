Looking for HP as the main character but will also gladly take any character(s) POV. The police state would ideally come from loosing so many in the war. No preference if people are trying to destroy, uphold, or just live through it.

​

Thanks!

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3782908][Case File Seventeen]], sorta - it's not specifically a police state, but it is dystopic. OC's POV, oneshot. (No ffnbot b/c the fic is locked to AO3 members; PM me if you need an invite.)

*** Wait, what? Do you need an invite to create an account on AO3?

​

Nevermind, went to their page and saw the invitation prompt. Apparently there are about 10k people requesting invites and they sent around 1k invites each day. That translates to a waiting period of around 10 days after you provide your email?

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) fits a bit, the Ministry is on Voldemort's side at first but then switches against him, after he's defeated minister Bones tries to discredit the resistance that won and arrest them but fails.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
