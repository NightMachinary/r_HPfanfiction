:END:
I wish I could remember where I read this, it may have been a Yahoo Group. People/pairings that I remember being in it were Hermione/Lavender and Harry/Amelia, the twins following Harry around for after-action issues, Harry tearing through a castle and rescuing Amelia (and I think Susan). The general gist of it was that Amelia vs. Voldemort resulted in Amelia having to pledge herself to the winner, then Harry scared off Voldemort. Amelia is dying due to not fulfilling her vow until she tells Harry about the pledge she had to make and he tells her he's the winner, so looks like that's the way they have to go.

Anyway, I know there's a few Amelia-centric fic's out there, but I haven't found this one again so I don't think it made the "normal" sites. I also think it was pretty short (someone wrote a very excellent start in my opinion). But if it rings a bell for someone, please share!
