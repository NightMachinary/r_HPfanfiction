Actually I've been noting recently how many indie Harry's manage to so perfectly embody exactly Snapes canonical view of Harry. Except I've never seen it done unironically. I don't get how they can lack such self awareness that they go from Mr humble hero harry pleading with the irrational Mr bad death eater Snape to please give him a chance and view him as a seperate person, then immediately transition to a bold public display filled with "confidence" (the definition of arrogance) that usually involves several insults against whichever caricatures of the authors disliked characters are there.

The title was inspired by this, taken direct from a fic

#+begin_quote
  Harry sniggered. "Of course it isn't. After all, how could the son of James Potter know anything?" He snorted. "And that's the problem with Professor Snape. He has not once yet looked at me and seen Harry. He only sees James." His tone hardened. "A man who has been dead for over ten years."

  Snape drew his wand. "Your arrogance-"

  "Severus." Dumbledore's smooth voice cut through Snape's. "Is this true?"

  "Of course not!" Snape snarled. "He's lying! He's just doing it for the attention-"

  "Put a sock in it, Snivellus!" Harry snapped.

** I think it's the drawback by trying to make him more independent,bold and assertive you make him into a loud and grandiose ego maniac who,S arrogance is off the charts.

*** I feel some writers seem to think that the fact there's always a positive outcome (often just an extremely OOC amazed audience) makes it entirely acceptable and not arrogance or egotistical to grandstand and belittle (if the victim apparently deserves it). But you can be arrogant and successful - arrogance is just aggressive confidence

** And then you get fics like Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage, with one of the worst written scenes in Fanfiction, where Harry apologises to Snape after Snape smashes his several million-dollar Gadget intentionally. Harry raised by Tony Stark, apologising to a Bully. Swings and roundabouts.

** Finding a well written Indie! Harry is a massive pain in the ass because of stuff like this. Reading about a bolder and more assertive Harry in theory should have a lot of potential given how passive he could be in canon, but authors seem to almost always fuck it up. For once I'd like to see a Harry who grows into someone who is more ssertive and confident, but still manages to be respectful and keep canon Harry's humility and kindness. I also get sick that every Indie Harry fic has to have him browbeating and humilating Dumbledore, and the author bashing him.

*** I'd say a huge problem is that writers always want things to be 'perfect' thus requiring immediate change and desperately OOC events and actions in order to get their desired results on schedule. This excludes character development both due to the necessary immediacy and the lack of setbacks or mistakes

The biggest example is Sirius. There's always a scramble to have Harry stumble on his innocence through some coincidence and leap of logic halfway through first or second year because they can't stand to leave him in Azkaban and let the plot develop around him. I get that it's a bad place, and it's more understandable in time travel fics, but it happens even in non time travel a lot.\\
It's not even about him getting a guardian to take care of him - by this point he's got a past-time of shaming dumbledore personally and has likely enacted several plots to cow and punish the dursleys

**** I think it's hard because when it comes to Dumbledore the story gets caught in a paradox. They portray Albus as a powerful manipulator that's been pulling the strings for years but because Harry has to be powerful. Dumbledore's schemes decades in the making are utterly derailed by some 15 year old saying no to him

** Oooh that's an interesting point (Also is that the Quantum Leap story? No lie, it's a guilty pleasure).

When I read those, it does depend on the context. If I'm thinking of the right one, this is a time travel? So maybe Harry's given up? That and the only other exception I make is when a story does say they're going to make Snape be the bad guy. Not the greatest out but enough to make the story plausible to keep me reading.

You do have a good point though. I've never really realized that Harry becomes more of a bully like his father as Snape says in these situations.

*** Yeah, it was quantum leap - time travel. Maybe sometimes he's given up, I wouldn't say it was the case for this one though. He went back purposefully after what seemed an acceptable ending because he wanted Hermione back. It's just bad writing. Authors want Harry to embody perfection which comes with arrogance, something that can't coexist with denying the negative view Snape portrays. End result is a shocking lack of self awareness
