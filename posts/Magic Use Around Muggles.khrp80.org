Forgive me if this question has been asked before. I'm working on some ideas for a story, and am hoping someone can clarify a point for me, as I don't remember what canon may or may not have had about this. The curse of reading so much fanfiction - I don't always remember canon!

If Harry, as an adult, uses magic on a muggle, or in sight of a muggle, would the Minestry be notified? The answer for underage magical folk is yes, because of the Trace. But what about a fully adult magical person? Would the Minestry be notified because of the statue of secrecy perhaps?


** No, they have no way to know what magic adults are doing unless someone reports it to the Ministry. Clearly they have some advanced reporting in place (because Arthur knows when to go help with muggle things that have been messed with, and they knew when Morfin was causing trouble), but they aren't tracking what spells everyone is doing.

*** This lines up with my train of thought...based on the varied answers I've gotten so far, I'm thinking I'll have to figure out my own interpretation of things. I'd agree they have some sort of advanced reporting as you say, but I don't know if they're tracking all spells around muggles. Say Harry is under the Invisiblity cloak and stuns a muggle. The muggle might simply assume they'd been hit from behind when they woke up, so they don't suspect anything strange. I can't imagine this would alert the Ministry.

**** I agree, I don't think there's a practical way to track spells around muggles. Maybe they have some sort of alert system that goes off when it notices key phrases being repeated somewhere, the sort of things someone might say if they'd just experienced magic and can't explain it.

** As usual, if they don't catch you it's not a crime.

** In one of my stories, the Obliviators were working on the orders of Seers so they would be able to reach situations endangering the SoS.

** Yeah they would as it breaks the Statue of Secrecy. I think that's what Obliviators were for. To wipe the memory of Muggles that had seen magic

*** True. What if a muggle was stunned from behind? No one else sees what happens, and when they wake up they assume someone hit them and don't think anything strange happened. Is the act alone enough to alert the Ministry, do you think?

** Yes, if it was intentional (or voluntary) than it is a felony (or its magical equivalent), a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy, and Aurors will get involved.
