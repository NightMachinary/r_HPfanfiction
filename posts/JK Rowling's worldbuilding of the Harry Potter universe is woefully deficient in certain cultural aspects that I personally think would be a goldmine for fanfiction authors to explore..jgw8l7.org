From my personal experiences with the HP fandom, a large portion of magic mentioned is derived usually from the European, African or Middle Eastern cultures. Futhark, wand usage, fanon runes, etc. Certainly, Hogwarts is set in Britain, and the narrative voice is from a British perspective, although I am surprised to not have found stories which attempt to incorporate or world-build elements from East Asian 'magics' into stories.

It could of course be the consequence of the fanfiction sites I frequent being of English origin, but I personally consider it an interesting direction in which an author could explore and move in.

Especially given how in classical Chinese literature, for example, there is always mention of ritualistic magic and alchemical pills derived from Taoism and the like; Chinese bone oracle script was used as a means of divination known as pyromancy, etc.

What else do you think could be incorporated into such a topic?


** I have a headcanon that Chinese wizards are a bit more hand-in-hand with the Chinese muggle government than most. I figure somewhere in Beijing is the "People's Committee for Something That Sounds Boring" which is the public office of their ministry of magic, and Party officials will from time to time pop in just to keep tabs on things.

I've based this on the Celestial Bureaucracy, or at least on my vague notion of it.

*** My headcanon is wizarding Japan is ruled by a wizard emperor

during the time of the statue, the emperor of Japan at the time had a wizard kid.

so the empire split between the two halfs the normal son taking the muggle half and the wizarding son the magical half

**** Or just the regular emperor, in a constitutional capacity similar to with the muggle government, but a little bit more involved.

** Native American - animist, animal-part fetishes, etc. So much here to explore.

India/Buddhist - mantra. Basically using words and sounds as the primary magic-shaping tool.

I am sure there is are a lot more traditions and folklore that can be mined for more variety in magic.

There might also be interest in animal-centered societies? Such as people who focus on horses, or dragons, or whatever. Their magics might be focused on the animal in general or one particular animal they have as a familiar, or some combination. I don't know if this counts as some different style of magic as it would be very tightly focused and remove much of the widely functional expectations of 'magic'.

** If JK actually cared about her world she would stop doing Twitter retcons and start building her world beyond Britain. What happened to native American magic when a bunch of European (Th wHiTe MAn) came with a small part of the wizard population.
