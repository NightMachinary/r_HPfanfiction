This is driving me absolutely bonkers. I read a fic years ago and can't find it now. Here's what I remember: Early on starts with Draco and Lucius going somewhere desert-like and ending up buying a slave to protect Draco. Turns out its grey!Harry and he's totally able to leave if he wants, he went to another school and is very powerful. Tidbits I remember include Harry pretending not to speak english and then later surprising Draco, some sort of slave manacle that Harry secretly removes and Narcissa notices, and Harry (maybe) breaking someones neck. They eventually head to Hogwarts. I thought the author might be Araceil on ff.net but it isn't there. I don't think it was finished, it wasn't the absolute best writing ever, but I want to find it before I lose my mind. Any ideas?
