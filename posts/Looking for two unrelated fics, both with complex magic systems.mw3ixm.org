The first one was in the "Dumbledore decides to quit screwing around and finally gives Harry some decent training" vein. He pulls out the secret good books he keeps in the back of his office and Harry goes looking for some heavy artillery magic that will give him the upper hand over Voldemort. One spell that he finds (and later attempts to vaporize Voldemort with) is some heavy duty industrial mining spell that is slow to cast but basically burns through a hundred meters or so of stone with an eight foot radius, something like that. A last resort spell for combat because it would completely drain the caster.

The second fic I believe was a female Harry story, and she was doing some expert level dueling training against Tonks in the Room of Requirement. Harry (I forget the fem Harry name) throws around some elemental stuff (like ice walls) and she casts a wide area lightning storm spell that has a long Greek incantation. Tonks shields from it with a conjured metal cage.


** The second one could be To Reach Without, maybe: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8495269/chapters/19468255]]. I'm pretty sure Tonks teaching her dueling is a thing in it though I don't recall specifically what spells they were throwing around.
