I would love recommendations on some decent stories that does not feature a Big Bad in it, eg. Voldemort/Evil Dumbledore either not present in the first place, or already defeated.

Either Hetero pairings or FemSlash prefered..

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** linkffn(The Malfoy case) Draco/Astoria, a realistic post war fic describing the trial and Draco's life after the battle. Has quite a lot of realistic, but interesting law and court scenes.

linkffn(Grow young with me) Harry/OC who is a muggle. Well written and kind of sweet. Post war, describes Harry's life as a single parent (Ginny died due to an accident or something like that).

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) Post war Harry/Ginny from the perspective of their muggle neighbors.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
