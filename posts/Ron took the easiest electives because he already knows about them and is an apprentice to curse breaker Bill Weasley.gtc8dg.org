His dad is the head of misuse of muggle artifacts office, and tutored him in muggle studies from a young age.

His eldest brother is a curse breaker and teached him all he knows of. He doesnt need OWLs or NEWTs since he has reference from his brother.

He did poorly in school not because of laziness, but because of boredom since he alredy knew most things.


** I love this prompt, but I feel obligated to say this:

- Ron did not do "poorly" in school. In HBP, Harry notice that he and Ron pretty much got the same grades in OWL with the exception of DADA where Ron did not get an "O".\\
  Also, most teacher seem to ask at least an "E" to their OWL before acception students to their NEWT level class (McGonnagall say that Neville can't take Transfiguration since he only got an A, but he could go to Charm since he got an E there).\\
  So with these informations, and the fact that Ron was accepted in the same NEWT level class than Harry, means that with his 7 OWL, he got at least 5 "E" in DADA, Transfiguration, Charm, Botanic and Potion.\\
  These are not the results of a "poor" student, and probably put him in the top quarter of his year (I want to say top Decile, but since Harry's year seem to have only 40 students, it's pretty unlikely he is in there).
- Ron was not "lazy", or at least not more than the average teenager. The only character who only considered Ron lazy was Hermione, and if we follow her standards, everybody at Hogwarts is lazy except some stressed Ravenclaw (who else would spend all his free time in the library and start to stress about their exames 2 monthes early. I'm pretty sure at least 90% of the reader would also be considered lazy with these standards, me included.

*** I feel like the whole 'Ron bashing' comes from people who either;

A. Only watched the movies - they were only ever exposed to the comedic relief movie version of Ron, they don't get to read about him struggling to live up to his family expectations, how studious he was and how truly loyal he was to Harry. The /worst/ example I can think of is in PoA movie where Hermione is given Ron's lines in the Sirius showdown instead.

B. Watched the movies first before reading the series - the film version is their first exposure to Ron so their perception of Ron is already tainted when they're reading it.

Harry had flaws, Ron had flaws, Dumbledore had flaws, /Hermione/ had flaws - every character had them, yet Ron gets villainised. He doesn't deserve it, and that's coming from a person who's favorite character is Hermione.

Harry's year has about 120 students(Gryffindor alone has 31 students in Harry's year) Rowling herself mentioned that its significantly more than 40, those are just the ones she created names for.

And since both Harry and Ron were the top choice for Prefect it can easily be assumed that they are in the top ten percent.

Otherwise I agree fully.

I'm curious about the source of this number.\\
I thought they were 40 because that's about the number of students "named" in Harry year (or even less since names like Fay Dumbar or Tracey Davies are never mentioned in canon).\\
It is pretty unlikely that Ron is in the top decile if the year has 40 students, or less, especially since Harry and Hermione would be both above him in grade (and it would mean that the House supposed to be the least academy oriented dominate the ranking), but if a year has around 120 students, then yes Ron is probably with the bests.

In Order of the Phoenix Harry describes there to be 30 other students in DADA, we know that this is a class the Gryffindors take alone, so thats the number of Gryffindors in his year. So 120-130 for the entire year sounds about right.

  ʹCedric Diggoryʹs death was a tragic accident,ʹ she said coldly.ʹIt was murder,ʹ said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, *least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates*. ʹVoldemort killed him and you know it.ʹ
#+end_quote

Other things that hint at such a number are the number of students throughout the entire school which is implied to be at about 850-900.

As to how I get the number of 850-900 sudents.

In Prisoner of Azkaban we see during a Quidditch match that Slytherin alone has over 200 people in it and even specifies that they make up a quarter of the spectators. Meaning at the very least there have to be 814 students, though that isn't accounting for students not in attendance.

#+begin_quote
  They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. *Three quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes*, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP.” Behind the Slytherin goal posts, *however, two hundred people were wearing green;* the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
#+end_quote

Also in the same book we see that there are over hundred carriages transporting the Students to Hogsmeade

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, *where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse*, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
#+end_quote

In Goblet of Fire during the Yule Ball there were also about hundred tables with a dozen seats each.

#+begin_quote
  The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling.T*he House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people*
#+end_quote

None of those things would make sense if there were just 40 students per year.

Also here is Rowling saying its more than 40.

#+begin_quote
  While I imagined that there would be *considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts*, I thought that it would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, and to have names at my fingertips when action was taking place around the school.

***** maybe kingsley but not snape, hermione or even harry.

By sixth year snape was making his own spells(sectumsempra) and his own variations on potions, by fithy year hermione mastered proetan charm(wich was described to be NEWT level) and aced almost all subjects with outstandings, and harry mastered patronus charm during third year (also NEWT level) and had enough field experience to teach DADA by fifth year.

Ron is average. Main reason why most people in ministry cant even cast a shield charm is i think because of Voldemorts curse at DADA position. Just because they cant cast a shield charm doesnt mean they cant do other advanced charm work. In deathly hallows, Ron was polyjuiced as a maintenance staff( i might be completley wrong about this so dont take this part withouth a pince of salt) and couldnt do the spell required to fix the enchanted window.

****** I said that Ron is not on the level of Snape or Kingsley. Ron is still above average. DADA instruction is spotty, yes, and yet students still manage to pull good DADA OWLs and NEWTs, including pre-DA students. Note that the ministry issue isn't because Ron can't cast the spells, it's because they don't work for the problem. When Hermione starts suggesting solutions, Ron fumbles for a quill to write them down. Note that he doesn't express concern over casting the spells. When we see Ron and Arthur later, Ron says he didn't try a spell Arthur suggests, not that he tried and failed to cast it.

There's also the matter of OWL scores. Exceeding expectations, by its very nature, means above average, unless the definitions of standard expectations of the ministry and Hogwarts revolves around below-average wizards, something I find unlikely. He manages to keep up in classes with a broken wand, one that wasn't an ideal fit for him even when it wasn't broken. He becomes an auror for a while, which he says "You've got to be really good" (to be one). It's also interesting that the aurors seek grades of exceeding expectations and above, as if exceeding expectations place you above-average and thus good auror material. All while being lazy.

During Harry's escape, Ron lands a hit on the Death Eaters (maybe the only one to?) and is called by Tonks "brilliant". His combat performance is impressive throughout the rest of the books as well.

Like it or not, Ron Weasley is an above average wizard. Your mistake is considering exceptional average. It's not. He might not be on the level of Snape or Dumbledore but then again, neither is Harry or Hermione. He, however, is firmly above average.

While I agree that Ron is not at the level of Kingsley, Snape or Harry (though 2 have 15 to 20 years of experience over him, and the last is said to incredibly talented in defense), I do think Ron is a better fighter than Hermione.

While Hermione is a very talented witch, which mastered a lot of spell, somes above her year level, there are a lot of evidences in canon that she is more theory oriented and could crumble during the practical aspects of magic :

- In PS, while Harry and Ron where caught in the Devil Snare, while knowing the weakness of the plant (light), she first tried to look for wood to make a fire, before Ron reminded her she was a witch (who knew several spells to make light).
- In PoA, while acing the writen part of the test, she failed the practical part, being unable to beat her boggart
- In OotP, during the Battle in the DoM, she taken out after the spell of a Death Eater broke her shield (though it can be argued that her fault was to not dodge the spell, make a too weak shield or that she was just unlucky and any of the others would have lost in the same situation
- In DH, after the little skirmish with 2 Death Eaters in Muggle London, her hand is trembling so much she cut Ron rather than the rop he was tied in.
- In the same book, after the raid on the Ministry, she is the one responsible for Ron injury (since she was the one to apparate with him and Harry)
- Still in the same book, while trying to protect Harry from Nagini, she is panic firing and one of her spell reach Harry's wand (breaking it in the process).

So while Hermione is a very talented witch (and able to create some very effective plans when she has time to plot), she is not the kind of witch you would want to put on the field. And despite what is shown in the movies, I am pretty sure Ron would beat her if they were to duel.
