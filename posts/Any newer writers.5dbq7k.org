I am in the process of writing my first fic. It is a little intimidating to say the least! Any other newer writers out there who would like to beta swap or any experienced writers with general advice?

I am basically writing an evolution of Ginny. How does she go from the girl who is afraid to speak into a leader of Dumbledores army 2.0.

Thanks :)


** General advice:

Adverbs are the enemy.

Adverbs telling readers how something was said are punishable by death. True story.

*** Haha! That was something I heard from a friend and am trying to incorporate. But my friend is a real writer and I am a little too embarrassed that my first foray into the writing world is through fan fiction to ask him for advice.

what about having a descriptive sentence after the conversation?

For example, instead of saying: "Yes." She quietly said

Saying: "Yes." She said. Quietly she sat down and put her cards back on the table.

I am generally trying to take the approach of "show don't tell". I have about a 3 page outline on how I want my chapters to flow broken out into four overarching themes. I am currently writing what feels naturally as it comes when I feel inspired by a specific part of the story.

Thanks for the advice though :)

** If you are writing canon compliant fics, research your source materials well. Readers are very strict when it comes to canon compliance.

Some authors tend to disregard canon elements that could interfere with their plots or make things too easy for their protagonists. Don't, or readers are going to say very nasty things. If simple solution exists to a problem, use it. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and Luna were all highly intelligent people and they deserve to be treated as such.

Since you are working on a canon compliant Ginny story, I highly recommend rereading DH a few times, because JKR only left a few clues in her Book that could be easily overlooked. And don't make Snape too evil or else Harry and Ginny would NEVER name their child 'Severus'. In fact, my head canon says that Snape only deserved that honor because he bailed out Ginny from multiple tight spots at his own risk, in hindsight of course.

** Your readers have imagination. Use that to your advantage. Outline your scene clearly, but don't over describe it. Let the reader's imagination do that work for you.

** Don't worry about the details. I spent my first few fics detailing every little crevice. People will honestly fucking lynch you. Write the surroundings vaguely, and only describe the things that are important with details.
