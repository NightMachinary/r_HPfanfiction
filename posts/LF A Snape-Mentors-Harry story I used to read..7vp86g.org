It was only a few chapters, at most, maybe only one. It was set in year 5 or 6. Snape sees Sirius, who is deranged from his stay in Azkaban and being trapped in his childhood home, rape harry thinking he was James. So he assigns Harry an essay as "Detention" or homework. And it's all about the effects of Azkaban, imprisonment and Dementors on people's minds.
