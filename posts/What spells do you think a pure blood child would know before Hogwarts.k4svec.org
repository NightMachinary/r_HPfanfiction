Pureblood children definitely get an advantage when it comes to the trace. I'm just wondering what spells would a pureblood child know before age 11.


** Perhaps surprisingly, I believe they are a lot of everyday spells.

Cleaning dishes. Drying your hair. A warming charm. Folding clothes. Basically, things you "pick up" by the way, just by watching adult wizards, not things that are formally taught. Formal lessons would be much rarer.

Especially if we're talking Canon. Strictly going by that, what Hagrid (or Ron?) says appears to be true; all children enter Hogwarts knowing much the same (little) amount of magic.

*** They would probably /know/ all of those sorts of spells, but they might not be able to actually cast them until they get some practice in.

Of course, Rowling gave us very little to work with in the way of magical theory, so it's hard to say for sure how easy it is to pick up spells just from seeing them used.

**** Perfectly valid point, and thanks for pointing it out. It makes for an interesting distinction and also a way to reconcile Canon and (intuitive?) assumptions about purebloods (or, more generally, magic households).

Of course, going by the letter, OP also /did/ ask about "knowing" spells :P

*** I'm not sure why formal lessons should be rarer, at least among Hogwarts students. Quite a lot of them are from the sort of families that would absolutely have tutors for their children in the muggle world. I just can't imagine the children of 'nobility' (using this term in quotes because they're not exactly nobility in canon, but close enough for this) not being taught at least theoretical knowledge about magic - be it because of a paranoid parent or due to the kid asking for lessons. Hell, it doesn't even have to be a tutor - I'd imagine that in the wizarding world, parents would be teaching their children about magic alongside teaching them more casual stuff such as reading.

Sure, they may be unable to actually /use/ magic, but I can't see someone like Lucius refusing his son a tutor, or a young Sirius, or other members of the Black family, really, not being taught some stuff about magic before they turned eleven. And wasn't the quote about Snape coming to Hogwarts knowing more curses then most seventh years canon? Granted, in his case I'd imagine he learned them from books rather then being taught by his mother, but it's still a thing.

For two reasons. One, OP asked about purebloods, not Malfoy-equivalents. In Canon (as opposed to FF), there does not seem to be that much of a correlation between blood and status. Or at least, while people of status may often be purebloods, being a pureblood doesn't a priori imply status. You have Malfoy on one hand, and the Gaunts and Weasleys on the other. In-between presumably are a lot of perfectly average, in no way exceptional purebloods. Yet as you note, in the Muggle world such tutoring is limited to the exceptional.

And two, you're somewhat answering your own question ;) -- with "formal lessons" I meant that, and not wizarding dad trying to convey his half-knowledge on a subject he last heard about 20 years ago. I don't think every adult wizard is a scholar. That is, after all, the reason to have tutors in the first place, if you can afford it.

.

So, with the caveat that you have to reconcile everything with the apparent lack of purebloods visibly being ahead in PS, I'm not opposed to Lucius ordering a tutor for Draco (it seems like something he would do), and other purebloods trying their best to teach the children themselves -- it /is/ (interview-)Canon that this is how wizarding children learn reading or counting, after all. Just not "on account of being a pureblood, you have etiquette lessons every Friday, Duelling instruction Wednesday, Arithmancy comes in Tuesday, ..."

** Probably not many, because most wizards (and most people) are lazy, teaching a typical child of average talent and motivation is tedious at best, and at best they'll be a few months ahead of their peers, who will catch up quickly because everyone is learning the same spells at the same time. (Don't let a the "Slytherin" label fool you: inheriting your parents' wealth and connections or marrying well are just as "Slytherin" in principle as seeking greatness on your own merits through talent and hard work, and even more so in practice.)

** Depends. They're not supposed to practice magic outside of Hogwarts. They'd have to be influential enough to get away with letting their child learn.

****** Wow, JK really didn't think that one through, did she? I mean, the only reason I can think of for her doing it that way is for (Harry's summer) plot, because it's easier for the government just to put a trace on the wand (or the child him-/herself, before school age). The Weasley twins come to mind. They'd be terrors at home.

******* Except the Trace /cannot/ be put on wands or individual people. How would you detect accidental magic, particularly the one made by Muggle-borns? We know the Ministry does not have complete access to the Book of Admittance. By all measures, the Trace was an unsuccessful attempt by the Ministry to copy the Founders' enchantments on the Quill of Acceptance for every time magic is being performed by minors. The Trace being put on wands or people is just not logical and leaves too many holes that could risk the Statute of Secrecy.
