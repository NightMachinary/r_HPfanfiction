I've read a couple of fics where Harry and McGonagall ended up as friends despite their student-teacher relationship. Not HarryÃ—Minerva, but Harry+Minerva. The closest fic I can recall is the rapport they gained in Methods of Rationality, but that's not quite it. Nor is "Harry time-travels to Minerva's school days" (though one of the stories I recall but can't identify was a "post-war Harry pulls a Peggy Sue Got Married back to his own youth", which is just as good a reason as Rational!Harry).

I won't particularly care about who gets paired up in these fics. Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Draco rescuefic, doesn't matter. I just like the "Potter and McGonagall are friends" dynamic.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** Closest I can think of is "Harry McGonagall", but that's not exactly friendship but a parent/child relationship.

  Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr

*** Read it, liked it, but it's not what I'm looking for. ...it might be one of the ones I thought I remembered, though.

Thanks!

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

** Why is "being friends with McGonagall" your metric for cleverness? Throughout the books she was a pretty unhelpful character.

*** It's not my metric for cleverness. Cleverness is the standard reason for becoming friends with McGonagall, and the only reason in which I'm currently interested. I like "clever!Harry catches McGonagall's attention in a way that causes her to treat him as a friend despite the authority/seniority dynamic".
