we have metamorphmagi. right. those are a thing. right. ok, so we have a fic made to exploit the lumos charm. right. "that's pretty cool i mean we have a fic that exploits everything so what are you talking about" I hear you say. metamorphmagus. that's it. literally the most badass exploit ever. my writing is shit and I am considering breaking out the keyboard writing this and calling it "my immortal 2: the cheekqual". hell, where are the shapeshifting exploits in any fiction? I mean we have "perfect shapeshifters" like the pink dildo monster from dragon ball z right? where is the shapeshifter!harry that turns into an eldritch monstrosity or shoots bones out of his hands like a gun or turns into various animals? I mean really you could even do it up to Deadpool level "won't die unless you transmute the moon into a nuke and ram it up his ass and even then still lives because one cell managed to survive". my point is why don't people exploit metamorphmagi like they do every single fucking thing else!!!

WHAT THE FUCK!!!

It goes against the laws of physics and badassery that nobody else has written this.

And I searched I fucking searched!!!

I will fucking write this!!!

*** Because Tonks herself doesn't know what he looks like, she only has legends to go off of as at the time of the war she wasn't even losing her baby-teeth, let alone seeing the Dark Lord with her own eyes. There's also the fact that Voldemort shows up to battle hooded a lot of the time, so even if someone crossed wands with him, they're unlikely to get a good picture. There's also the fact that we've never seen tonks change skin-colour, bone-structure, height, and gender.

***** Also, movies and pottermore don't count and the books only gave a vague explanation

So you can basically interpret metamorphmagi as balls of biological material that choose to take human form all the way to just naturally make illusions surrounding the body.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

**** Just did a search for it, can't find it. IIRC the story premise was that all wizards had died after Harry defeated Voldemort, with only Harry left. His magic was gone but it was replaced with a uber shapeshifting ability. I can't recall how he ended up in the SG universe. The story was probably from around 2007-2009, so I think predates the existence of a crossover feature on FF.Net, which is why I can't find it. It will probably be listed as an HP story only.
