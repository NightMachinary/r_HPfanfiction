I just love reading rarepairs. My favorite one is definitely Blaise/Hermione, but honestly, I love any fanfic that focuses on minor characters. It doesn't even have to have a romantic pairing, although that's always a plus. Why read/write Dramione or Drarry when Blaimione (??) is right there? Give me Hermione/Lavender! Dean/Ron! Harry/Padma! Luna/Blaise! Am I just listing random characters with each other now? Maybe!

On a real note though, I think characters like Lavender Brown and Angelina Johnson and Dean Thomas are so underrated. I love to read about Hemione being friends with Lavender and Parvati, because I seriously doubt that they were roommates for six years without forming some sort of bond. I love reading about Angelina Johnson & her relationships with her Quidditch teammates. Obviously I enjoy reading/writing fanfics with popular pairings too, but there's something about fanfics centering minor characters that I just can't get enough of.


** Harry/padma is a fav of mine and its so hard to find fics with them thats not a harem with her just tacked on with parvati because of course harry gets every gorl in his year

** Ron/Harry is a stupidly rare pair for how obvious it is.

Ron/Draco is weirdly rare given how common Drarry and Dramione are. I don't get the appeal of overwriting Draco thoroughly enough for any of the three to become plausible but given Faco is the single most popular character in HPFF you'd think he could get a few goes at Ron, too.

** For decades I was an SSHG exclusive, one of the most popular pairings by far, but the rarepairs are growing on me. I'll now ship Snape with /anyone/.

As part of a festival that requires a background/past rarepair, I'm currently writing a 3-chappy where the fist chapter builds up Snoppy, the second is the breakup and building of SSHG, and the third is the tragic canon-compliant ending.

But I may have to write a fluffy Snoppy to clear out all the angst. Something slice-of-life during the 10 years before HP came to Hogwarts. The Potions Master and the Healer, taking names and kicking ass, breaking curses and relieving suffering, maybe with a little gfd/mommy kink underpinning it all.

Honestly I was a little surprised that Sev/Poppy was so rare! Most fics that feature both of them are platonic, and even those are pretty rare.
