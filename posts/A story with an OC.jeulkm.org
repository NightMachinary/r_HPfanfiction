:END:
Is there a fanfiction in which there is an OC who knows the proceedings of the battle and everything but has to keep it a secret and her main job is to save those who died. She's also friends with the trio.


** U could check webnovel.com under the fanfic section. There is alot of oc insert there, but must of them are work in progres.

Webnovel is more of a original story platform
