No idea if something like this exists but every time I watch gof I can't help but wonder what would happen if Moody sneezed mid spell since he performs the killing curse on her desk.

** You have to mean the killing curse for it to work. Intention is key. If it isn't his intention to kill Hermione I don't think it would work.

*** But what is the specific intention for the curse? If it didn't work on people who weren't specifically targeted then everyone would jump in front of it to save their friends, so it wouldn't be very effective. (And Hedwig wouldn't have had to die ðŸ˜¢)

*** We're forgetting that he was a death eater in disguise and she's muggleborn. By that very nature, he intends for her to die. It's just a matter of when.

*** Don't need to intend anyone in particular, just to kill.\\
There's bouncing killing curses in the end of HBP cast by some death eater and they manage to kill another death eater IIRC

*** Ur wrong,it can work.Imagine a scenario in which a death eater is battling Sirius and Remus.He launches a killing curse intending to kill Remus but it hits Sirius instead (the death eater's aim was shitty.)
