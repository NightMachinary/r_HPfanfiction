Using JKR's rectified canon (James was originally a year older than Albus):

â€‹

- Sometime between April 18 and April 30: Edward "Teddy" Remus Lupin is born, the first of we-can't-come-up-with-original-names children.
- May 2, 1998: Battle of Hogwarts
- Summer 1999: Ginny (and Hermione) graduate Hogwarts. Ginny is a reserve for the Holyhead Harpies (1999-2000).\\
  2000-2003: Ginny plays Quidditch professionally.
- July 31, 2003: Clone Number One is conceived. Ginny is a month pregnant when she finishes the Quidditch season.
- April 8, 2004: Clone Number One is born.

[Sometime ~2004: Ron and Hermione feel pressured to get married now that Harry and Ginny have a child.]

- April 2005: Clone Number Two is conceived.
- September 19, 2005: Individual Number One (but still kind of a clone) is conceived.
- January 15, 2006: Clone Number Two is born.
- June 12, 2006: Individual Number One is born.

[Sometime ~2006: Malfoy's clone is born. Clearly the system is still corrupt, as Malfoy somehow had children when he should have been in prison. This proves that the wizarding world hasn't changed.]

- May 2, 2007: Clone Number Three is conceived.
- Fall 2007: When Individual Number One is ~18 months old, Individual Number Two is conceived.
- January 23, 2008: Clone Number Three is born.
- Summer 2008: Individual Number Two is born.


** Just to be sure, Clones 1/2/3 are James/Albus/Lily, Malfoy Clone is Scorpius and Individuals 1/2 are Rose/Hugo (not sure about the name Rose...) ?

**** Don't worry, it's all good (and far better than the terms I've been using in my own mind).

***** My autocorrect once tried to change Albus Severus to Anus Several, so that's always an alternative.

****** Nice one! Personally I tend to use the more graphic terms that [[/r/childfree][r/childfree]] use like "crotchdrop" (but it is a tad brutal).

** If you feel that Draco should be in Azkaban personally I don't think you understand his character enough.

Reread the books with an open mind and your view on Draco will change by the end of book 7 if not the end of book 6.
