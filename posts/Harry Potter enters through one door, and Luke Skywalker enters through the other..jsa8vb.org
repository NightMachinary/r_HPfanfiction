Luke Skywalker enters through the door on one side of the room. He holds out his lightsaber in front of him, ready to activate it if needed. Harry Potter enters through the door on the other side of the room. For what seems like a very long time, they stand there, just looking at each other. Luke keeps his lightsaber ready, and Harry puts his hand in his pocket. He knows he's got this. After all, all he has to do is say “Avada Kedavra” and Luke would be dead. He pulls out his wand and points it at Luke, surprised to see that Luke still hasn't activated his lightsaber.

“Avada Kedavra!” shouts Harry. But at that moment, he realized he should've thought a little more before he acted. Because right then, the green flash of light that came from Harry's wand traveled across the room to Luke, who activated his lightsaber just as the light hit it. The green light from Harry's wand hit the green blade of Luke's lightsaber, deflecting back across the room and hitting Harry in the chest.

“I knew I should've taken that class on Jedi life,” said Harry as he crumpled to the floor.


** Bold of you to assume he wouldn't use Expelliarmus first

** Plot twist: Harry is a sith lord and he killed himself on puropse so he can transfer his essence to Luke much like how Voldemort possesed Quirrel. Now Luke is Harrys pawn and carries him to the rebel base behind his head. he wears a medical hat to hide harrys presence, claiming the potter had almost beheaded him in their epic battle and stuters to seem less threatening, claiming the sith lightning damaged his speech faculties.
