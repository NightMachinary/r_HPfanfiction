Super specific, I know. Seriously, I've looked everywhere and not many really write Snape as the snarky person he is. I want to read something where he isn't out of character and doesn't speak like a teen! Perferably not AU, but if it's really, really good I'm up for it.


** There's linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) and linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) where he's paired with Aurora Sinistra and Charity Burbage respectively, who could be considered OCs since they're barely present in canon.

I too would like to see more of these. It would be a nice change of pace from the usual Snape/Hermione and Snape/Lily pairings. Whatever Snape/OC I've read has been wildly OOC and shitty though.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

and

linkffn(Diaries of a Dungeon Dwelling Moron by Gedia Kacela)

So these are Snape/Sinistra (kinda obvious). I don't honestly remember much, except they were light hearted and pretty funny.

  The true-life occurances of one Severus S. Snape, sure to bewitch your mind and ensnare your senses.... er, perhaps not. Filled with bitterness, discoveries, and plenty of spite towards the starry-eyed Astrology professor.

** It's a bit of stretch on the adult part of your request since the OC is still a student at the beginning, but she is of age, so I'll link it anyway. Linkffn(Merciless affection by verity brown)

I haven't seen it recommended much, maybe people are leery of the "student" part. But it is a very well written fic, the gradual romance is very interesting. And we see DH from a different side, so there's plus.

Also, you said nothing against slash so... linkao3(11284494)

  Canonshafted by HBP & DH, but still very IC. When a N.E.W.T. Potions field trip goes badly wrong, a chain of events is set in motion that may cost Snape more than his life, and a student more than her heart. Angst/dark romance. SS/OC of-age student.
