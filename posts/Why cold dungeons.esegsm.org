I have read now in many, many fanfictions the dungeons and the Slytherin common room described as a freezing place in winter and I'm wondering why? From my understanding basements are the warmest place in a house during winter and the coldest during summer because of the surrounding earth acting as insulation. I'm not sure if that's the same in castles though.

I'd really expect more fics with students complaining about having to go to classes up in the drafty towers and Slytherins and Hufflepuffs boasting about their (better) climate-controlled common rooms.


** Dungeons tend to be associated with prisons and poor conditions - and in the case of a castle in winter, the idea is that outside of places that are specifically heated it'd be cold. So the Slytherin dungeons, being generally removed, would not be heated this way.

This is also how it is in canon - Snape's classroom, at least in the first book, is described like this in December:

#+begin_quote
  While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.
#+end_quote

Combine the imagery of dungeons as cold and damp with remembering situations like that, and it's fairly easy to think of the dungeons as always freezing in the winter. I think it'd be strange to expect the Slytherin common room to be as such, though. I guess it comes from the Gryffindor one being described as cozy and warm in the books, whereas the Slytherin one feels more austere in its description despite the large fireplace?

*** That's the likeliest explanation I could come up with, too, that the word "dungeon" is simply connotated with "cold, damp, dark" and you get that image of a bare prison cell with a simple hole (no window glass!) for ventilation. But Hogwarts is described very differently from that and the Slytherin common rooms, even if further removed from the center of the castle, are still living quarters so they should be adequatly heated.

Oh, I didn't remember that quote from the books. It's been a while since I've reread canon. In the books, didn't Krum also say something like Hogwarts is much warmer than Durmstrang and has a lot more active fireplaces? Or am I mistaking that?

**** In Krum's case, he seems to more be used to the cold - so even outdoors with no heating might be warm for him (eg, he goes swimming in the lake during the winter, seemingly for fun, in just his swimming trunks). It's kind of like how the ones from Beauxbatons are described as being cold in Autumn, a way to show the difference between the schools.

Not sure about Krum talking about the fireplaces or Durmstrang - a quick search didn't pop it up, but I very easily could have missed it.

  "Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking," he was telling Hermione. "Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these - though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains -"
#+end_quote

So no fires allowed for heating (I wonder how they cook) and it's a long way north if they get little daylight in winter. Hogwarts probably feels like a Caribbean resort the Durmstrangers.

***** Thank you for finding that quote!

I'd imagine students aren't allowed into the kitchens in Durmstrang like it's in Hogwarts. Krum just isn't a rule breaker like Harry and co. So he never saw the fires used for cooking.

**** Remember also that this dungeon is near a Loch, a massive lake. That sort of moisture loves to seep into the surrounding landscape.

** I would assume you're not British because every cellar I've been in in England has been bloody cold if it isn't heated. We don't really have temperature-ranges here, it's generally very similar temperature so insulation and air circulation isn't as much of a concern here. So, since cold sinks and heat rises, upstairs tends to be warm and downstairs tends to be cold. Not absolute, obviously, especially in England where our houses can be anywhere from one year to fourteen-hundred years old and upgrading is varied as heck. But it's generally true. We also have a problem with really wet, marshy ground that leads a lot of underground structure to have issues with damp. Damp makes things cold.

It's also not the same in Castles, I don't think. The bottom floor of my house is made of big stone blocks and the bottom floor has a bizarre temperature differential. Sometimes it can be colder inside than outside. I remember a big kerfuffle a few years back about how some nobility had found their drafty old castles made them suffer from rheumatoid arthritis due to the cold and moist air. But this is Harry Potter, so the whole business could be solved quite easily with a warming charm, meaning it's probably an active choice on Snape's part for it to be cold like his soul.

*** That's great information, thank you! I always like to hear about the differences in houses in different countries.

I can totally believe that about the castles. They're just too big and old to keep properly warm without spending a fortune on heating. It's probably not even possible to renovate them to today's standards in insulation without destroying their character. Nice to look at, certainly, but not live in.

** It's my understanding that the Slytherin common room backs up against the lake, so I think people assume that is the source for the cold, but I would expect those walls to be magically fortified?

*** Yes, many authors imagine the Slytherin common rooms and dorms to have big windows into the lake. However, if the Slytherin common room is located deeper down in the lake the water temperature should be around 4 degrees Celsius, if the common room is closer to the surface of the lake the water temperature would be closer to zero. To me that still seems warmer than a tower exposed to cold wind from all sides.

And yes, why wouldn't the walls/windows etc be fortified with magic not to let the cold through?

*** While the Hogwarts dungeons may be called so, I don't think they've functioned as a real dungeon for a long time (or ever). Certainly not the part we get to know in the books. These are corridors, the Potions classroom and the Slytherin common room, none of which would deliberately be kept uncomfortable and cold.

Except apparently the Potions classroom, as another commentor here proved. But I think that's more due to Snape's preferred style of teaching than the architecture of the dungeons.

** Well, if I recall correctly, there's a computer game that references ice caverns in Hogwarts, so perhaps the dungeons are close to those?

*** That's certainly a possible explanation, but I think it only works if that ice cavern is explored during the story and the readers and the characters have that moment of understanding, where they think: "That's the reason it's always cold in Slytherin!"

In none of the fics I read was this the case.

** Their surroundings may be warm, but their ophidian hearts are ever cold.

Also, after Salazar Slytherin left, Helga Hufflepuff secretly installed a magical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump][heat pump]] to warm up the Hufflepuff dungeons at the expense of the Slytherin dungeons. However, the number of people who've been to both can be counted on one hand---as can the number of popular fics that feature a character who's been to both---so nobody's noticed.
