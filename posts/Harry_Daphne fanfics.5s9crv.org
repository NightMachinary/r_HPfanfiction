does anyone know any good harry/Daphne oneshots and stories?


** I don't know about you but I hate the whole betrayed!Harry that has a mentor show him the true ever lemon drop offering evil!Dumbledore and how the Weasleys have used alove potions on Harry to make him fall in love with Ginny. Harry then stops by Gringotts, learns he has another vault, the goblins remove a magical block on him and and make him a new basilisk wand. Finally he stops by Hogwarts and declares Daphne Greengrass, the schools ice princess (whatever that means) and declares her as his wife, then disapparates out of Hogwarts shocking everyone that he can break the anti-apparation wards.

Anyways sorry for the rant. But if you want a realistic story, with realistic characters, emotions and romance, not to mention the absolute best Harry personality and mannerism wise I've ever read, definitely read:

*** Out of general curiosity, if it's not too much to ask, what about Harry lead to the 'absolute best Harry personality and mannerism wise'. The general commentary I get most often on the story isn't typically favorable of Harry.

My goal with it was to make them both act their age, and make them both make mistakes, and more often than not I was just told how stupid it was that they instantly in love, how Harry was weak and stupid and not focused nearly enough on the war, and how Daphne was a slut that didn't deserve Harry.

**** Wow, nice to meet you. Vitam Paramus and The Pureblood princess are two of my favourite fics!

I read a lot of fanfiction, and my biggest gripe is that authors are so focused on making their characters idealistic, that they completely throw out any possibility of them being realistic. And that's just what Harry's and Daphne's relationship is, realistic.

Harry is a lot of the time written as some sexy charmer that knows the ins and outs of romance, but on the contrary he's actually totally clueless about romance. See his fumblings eith Cho, and how long it took him to get together with Ginny.

How Harry interacts with Daphne is something I could totally see him doing in the actual novels. You managed to reach the perfect balance between realism and idealism thst allows the reader to relate to Harry or Daphne but at the same time really like Harry.

Looking back at my answer I feel really dissatisfied with it; I feel like I gave you a really general answer. If you agree just let me know, I don't mind discussing this at all.

Now here's the part where I beg for a sequel based on the last chapter in Harry's pov.

***** Well, I mean, I never say no to talking about my stuff. I just received what I felt were an alarming amount of comments along the lines of how the leads were horrible, how they were unlikable, how they were shallow. And I wondered if i failed at portraying the dynamic of two young teens that both didn't really understand how a relationship evolves, and both don't really know what to do.

There won't ever be a sequel. There are only epilogues because I lost bets. And have since learned to stop wagering fanfiction on sports games.

****** Wow it's almost like you wrote them as real people with real flaws.

Look man, there's a reason why authors like robst and stories like HPMOR have tons of fans. The characters (specifically Harry) are not all realistic. Yeah maybe those people want a Harry that isn't superficial, doesn't to have sex with Daphne because it's not honourable, never makes any mistakes, and is able to make the correct choices in every situtation, but the fact is that kind of Harry is fake and just insulting to thr Harry Rowling wrote.

You can't ever please everyone and unfortunately the people you don't please will be so much more vocal than those you please. Take me, I absolutely loved your stories, but I never left any reviews because it's just not something I do. I guess I should change that habit and show more greatfulness for authors. Now, say I absolutely hated a fic. I'd be pretty likely to pm the author with a scathing review.

******* I never got the part with honour and sex. Not sleeping with someone because they are drunk is honourable. Several hundred teenagers locked in a castle without any real supervision and not having sex is bullshit.

Even worse are those time travel fics where both travel back in time and still want to have sex but decide to wait until they are adults. I get it that shagging your wife in her eleven year old body might be an issue for some but when they are fourteen, which is the age of consent in half of Europe, it becomes ridiculous.

Books about teenagers and their dumbass problems is AFAIK a whole other literary genre (and the only time I will ever have read it is for school). It's no surprise to me that the parts of HBP that people complain most about are those that went in that direction too much...

***** People just love to hate on Ron don't they?

Ron was FOURTEEN when he became envious of Harry's fame and fortune. Try to empathize with the guy. His family's poor, he has six succesful and more popular brothers, and his best friend is the most famous wizard in Britain. Those are some pretty easy ways to develop deep insecurities.

About abandoning Harry during the horcrux hunt: Ron had been wearing the locket for a long time. I don't need to remind you the insidious and destructive power of the horcruxes as you need only to look at the effects of the diary. Blaming Ron for leaving is like blaming Ginny for being possessed.

****** Look, my life sucked compared to the one of my best friend. Now I know that his isn't perfect either but he get's the money and the girls. But am I jealous? No, and honestly I cannot recall anytime I was.

When I was fourteen I certainly wished to have his luck with the ladies but I never did resent his success. And I still don't. Much like Ron, I could be in a better situation if I would apply myself but I have no one to blame besides me. I don't nag my friends to do my work or stop them from getting better at something because I would much rather play a game or talk about sports.

Ron was a deserter and I remember one paragraph from a fic I have recently read. Paraphrased it says something along the lines

"Desertion from the military carries the highest penalty. Desertion of a sprouse leads to a loss of trust. It is not simply forgiven. Under no circumstances Harry and Hermione would welcome Ron back after what he did. And he deserted them more than once."

****** Poor excuses, Yes maybe all you mention can justify being jealous but the fact that he didn't ask for forgiveness afterwards and waited until after the first task is unjustifiable.

And as for the horcrux hunt, bear in mind that Harry and Hermione was equal in wearing the locket with Ron and yet they didn't leave or complain about their seemingly impossible quest. Also remember that Ron has been complaining throughout the journey about the situation. How they don't have a specific goal or how abysmal their food situation was. Ron also kept expecting Hermione to always cook the food and doesn't offer to do it himself. Overall he was spoiled by his mum and that trait made the journey even more worse.

And they don't go around hurting the other as well like Ron was doing. Ron's always been a hothead and his mouth say hurtful things before he could think properly. We know he probably don't mean it but the fact that he does those things are undeniable. What ticks me more is that Harry forgives him easily so Ron never really learns to apologize properly for his mistakes. Harry refuse to let him apologize after his abandonment in 4th year. And again during the hocrux hunt when he just shove the issue of Ron leaving them as if it's not a big deal when it really is. They should had to talk about it to properly clear things out. All three of them should have.

Ice Princess is one of my favorite HP/Daphne pairings. It's short at 15k words, and well worth a read. Not a typical Daphne Greengrass.

The Amalgamation Agreement is also a good one. Post Hogwarts, and also not a typical DG.

For a more typical "Ice Queen" DG, I like Contractual Invalidation a lot, also a post-Hogwarts story.

** I appreciate and respect the people doing the recommending, it's just that everything has been recommended countless times now. There's nothing wrong with that though. Before starting a new post wouldn't it be better if you used the search function and found similar posts, and skimmed through those. Because if someone makes a repeat post, I honestly assume that he has already been through other posts on the subreddit and if he has then he probably isn't looking for what has already been recommended countless times. Of course, I could be wrong but just my two cents.

*** Yeah it just seems like there are hardly any worthwhile Harry/Daphne fics to read. So much of the pairng has just dissolved into the same stupid tropes over and over. I'll definitely check out the one you recommended though.

*** The problem is that sometimes people want some oddly specific stuff while at other times the only parameters are the pairing. And simply searching ffn is not always an option because of poor tag use. I have seen a lot of stories which are tagged with two characters and turn out to be multi/harem. Or don't have any important characters besides the pairing tagged.

And of course there are new fics written all the time so two year old threads are not that great. Maybe we should have a monthly updated sticked post with a best of and another one with suggestions for stories to be added. I know there's the wiki but it is not up to date.

**** No, it's not trust me I had the exact same reaction looking at the summary but after the first chapter it really starts getting great. I dearly wish it wasn't abandoned because the way they characterize his anger is spot on and Dumbledore seems well characterised even if a bit different from canon. Also actually goblins are kind of normal in this fic. The author seemed to subvert tropes a bit, but it was published in 2010 so to be fair the cliche tropes aren't too bad you should give it a try.

** Most of my favorite of H/D already recommended here. Here's some other:

Linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) - adult Harry & Daphne. Recently completed. Probably one of the finer story of this pair.

Linkffn(White Nights by PotterforPresident1997) - canon-ish, short story. For me, it's one of top 5 of this pair. I adore this one & The Trail by reviewgirl911.

Linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-dude) - one shot. Married Harry & Daphne visiting Dudley's.

Linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII) - it's summery sums it up.

Linkffn(Ruthless Revenge by Yunaine) - oneshot, crack fic.

Linkffn(Far from Perfect by fantasyra) - interesting premises. Even if Harry defeated Voldemort, he's exiled from wizarding world. He's actually suicidal.

  The most disturbing thing was the pool of blood. The coffee table itself was literately dripping blood onto Daphne's tan carpeting. Judging by the amount on and around the table, the smell in the air, and her friends clothes, the first conclusion someone would have had would have been she murdered someone in her sitting room. This was not an unfamiliar situation.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
