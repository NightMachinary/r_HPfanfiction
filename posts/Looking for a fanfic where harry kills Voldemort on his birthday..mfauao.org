Hi I'm looking for a fanfic I read years ago all I remember is that the opening has harry jogging on what I believe is his 16th birthday when voldemort and his death eaters attack and harry ends up killing Voldemort using some kind of portal spell that redirects Voldemort spell back to him.

I remember it also has harry stabbing bellatrix in her throat with his wand.

Really hoping it rings a bell for anyone.


** Amazing... I just read this today. (I'd read it before but wouldn't have remembered which fic it was from if not for that.)

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.
