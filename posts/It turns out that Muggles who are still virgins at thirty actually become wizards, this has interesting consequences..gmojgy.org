This Prompt is based on the meme of the [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-virgin-wizard][30-Year-Old Virgin Wizard]], and the hilarious consequences it could have if it happened in the world of Harry Potter.

Like for example Hogwarts regularly having to deal with a few noteworthy first years students or the ministry going to great lengths to tracking down 29 year old virgins and helping them get laid.


** Would make a great crack fic with Squib!Harry and Manipulative!Dumbledore doing everything he can to make sure Harry doesn't get laid until he's 30 so that he can be a wizard and fulfill the prophecy

Taking that into account, you also have to figure that with the other problems in there background like the stupid amount of social politics for a society that small and well Im not suprised that many of them were willing to take the socialy aceptable short cut to sucsess.

And while the Founders (or anyone after them) /could/ have dissolved Slytherin, they demonstrated not having any common sense by dividing children into groups based on these traits and having them compete against each other in the first place. They didn't realize what a horrible idea that is, so it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't realize that having a breeding ground for dark wizards and witches is not that great either.
