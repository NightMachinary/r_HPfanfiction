** There are a couple nice ones in The One He Feared

#+begin_quote
  The room beyond was much larger, dominated by a huge stone stab in the shape of Britain, mountains and rivers and cities carved into the surface. Tiny dots of light were flickering on and off all over the map. Hanging on the wall next to it was a blackboard, upon which were the smudged remains of a mass of words recently rubbed off. A single word had been written in their place:

  /VOLDEMORT/

  Hermione was looking at the map in fascination. "Is that the Trace?"

  "Among other things," Harry replied. He jerked his head at the blackboard. "It's tied to the Taboo too. Looks like Voldemort's planning to Taboo his own name."

  Even as Harry said the name, a dot of red light flickered in central London.

  "Let's not loiter," Remus said, nodding to the next door.

  The next room was equally large but full of plinths, an artefact sitting on each one. It was almost like an art gallery. The largest plinth, in the centre of the room, held a sturdy oak wand upon a purple cushion. Another body lay beneath it.

  "Killing Curse," said Remus, bending over the body to investigate.

  Hermione had moved over to one of the plinths. It held a clay pot, within which a green fire burned. "Is this...?"

  "The Floo source?" said Harry, "yes."

  "My god," said Remus, catching sight of a copper sculpture of two clasped hands. "I thought it was a myth."

  Despite himself, Harry had to smile.

  "What is it?" asked Hermione, but Remus just looked dazed.

  "An ancient artifact which anchors the power to make and break magical contracts," Harry replied, enjoying Hermione's look of surprise. "But come on, we need to move."

  They approached the next door carefully, aware that a Death Eater could very well wait beyond. But when they flung the door open, an empty room met them once more. It was considerably smaller than the artefact room, and only contained three ornate sarcophagi.

  ....

  Harry nodded distractedly and picked up a splinter, examining it closely. Relief flooded through him. "We're in luck," he said, feeling the pulse of magic within, "it's not beyond repair."

  "But what is it?" asked Hermione, casting a few spells herself, analysing the wood. Her eyebrows rose at the results.

  "Arthur's throne," said Harry, joining two splinters together with a spell, "it's the symbol of authority which forms the basis for many centuries of Ministry enchantments."

  "And we can't defend the Ministry without it," concluded Remus, joining Harry in the repair. His splinters stuck together, wiggled, then fell apart again. He frowned. "This might take a while."

*** It's a fucking /crime/ that Taure abandoned this story. Like so many other stories of theirs it has exquisite, unique worldbuilding, but they don't seem to realize this and just leave it by the wayside.

Very sad about that. Wish more people would do stuff like this instead of rehashing the same tired tropes or known spells or identical plotlines over and over and over again.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

***** Oh, that makes more sense. I would send something from my own story, but there aren't many 'unique' magic items. That's why I'm hoping to get something that sparks an idea, which sparks an idea, which ... so on. That's how I get a lot of my ideas.

****** I've found that if you take a Muggle item and then take its name literally you can come up with some amusing things. The icebox is now a block of unmelting ice where they store their food like a fridge. Or take some normal Muggle thing and then add something unneeded/ridiculous to it or make it TOO good. Like baby carriages now have feet and can run away from you at high speeds if you're not careful or washing machines stalk around the house like a predator sniffing for lost socks.

******* That's a really nice little formula to come up with ideas, I think I'll try my hand at it. Another thing you can do is think of Muggle items, then make their original purpose not possible with the magical version, but this change allows them to be useful in a different way, or otherwise hyperbolizing the effects of Muggle items (i.e. sweets can make you ill, thus WWW). * Glasses that make your vision worse but make the vision of those you look at worse, too * Watches that always read the wrong time so if you go off of that you'll never be late * Quills that don't want to be written with, so they launch ink at you instead of writing * Backpacks with a pouch that swallows items (i.e. if you were at school with something you weren't supposed to have) * Mirrors that show character, not looks * Makeup that makes you look not as nice so you can see how people would treat you if you weren't attractive * Notebooks that doodle for you

** Laventadorn's The Never Ending Road is a Snape fiction. It has in Hogwarts a room that has (if memory serves correctly) the Bridge to Nowhere - an unspyable room that absorbs sound and there's just a bridge hanging over an abyss and stretches infinitely forward. It was really evocative.
