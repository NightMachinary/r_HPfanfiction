*Tyrant*, linkffn(5324704): this one is especially interesting as the author was trying to write a imitation of Caesar/Octavian's rise to power with HP characters. So far I've been able to map following characters to their historical counterparts:

Sirius - Caesar

Frank Longbottom - Pompey

Remus - Mark Anthony

Dumbledore - Cicero

Harry - Octavian

Ginny - Livia Drusilla

Nymphodora Tonks - Octavia

Draco - Brutus

Alastor Moody - Crassus

Bill Weasley - Lepidus

Victor Krum - Marcus Agrippa

Cedric - Tiberius Claudius Nero

Neville - Sextus Pompey

Narcissa - Sevilia

Marcus Flint - Maecenas

Crouch Sr, Amelia Bones, Scrimgeour, Umbridge, Ron Weasley - Republican conspirators

I suspect Fleur will take over the role of Cleopatra.

** Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo

A fic that goes in a direction I've seen so few go in, and done so well. It sucks that she gave up on writing fanfiction. She had a real talent, and Aorist Subjunctive was a great story.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1358209][Master of Death]] by esama, an AU with great foreshadowing/development. I wanted a continuation badly enough to try finishing it myself but ran into what were probably the same problems the original writer faced.

** There are others whose individual chapters excite me more, but none that I invested quite as much into as Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574)

It's the only 7-year fic I've read that far into, and it was worth the million words it took. It is no small thing to see such an ambitious task be so well-written and engaging, and then to simply stop so close to the end.

I'd also give a shout out to Forging the Sword - linkffn(3557725) - if only because it is simply criminal that no one else has mentioned it. Whilst far earlier on, that fic is perhaps my favorite, and it says a lot that I'd rather see an update to it than OTWTG or The Changeling, despite their being in far more exciting periods.
