I'm looking for fics with HP/fem!Vampire pairing (smut or not). I already read Valeriana Natassa linkffn(11552218) and I'm looking for more.

Preferably completed or not abandoned fics please and over 70k words

#+begin_quote
  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

Hope 500k words isn't overkill. One of my favorite fics in general, though.

*** This one's a tough read. Not because it's bad, just because the pacing jumps around a bit. It's absolutely worth it though.

*** Thanks I'll look into it. And no the word count isn't a problem. I usually prefer long fics.

*** Aw, its H/Hr, even if its vamp!Hr. That was like an ice bucket to the face.

** I'm with you! You'd think there'd be more fics that have a fem!vampire paired with harry. Hp is popular, vampires are popular... but I haven't seen many (or any) that weren't abandoned...
