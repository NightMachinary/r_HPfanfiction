I got [[https://imgur.com/a/IvNS52O][this gross comment]] on my POC Hermione in one of my fics today. It was actually the first time someone had commented on it, even though in my three ongoing stories it is mentioned that she is mixed-race.

*Do you have any head-canons that you subscribe to religiously in all your fics? Is it something you get negative reviews/attention for or are people accepting?*

Edit to add: apparently Portuguese aren't even considered POC in Europe anyway so,, many shrugs. Dunno why I'd need to tag it.

Second edit to add: never mind, I'd also included a Nigerian relative so POC was the right term. Mixed-race encompasses it all anyway.

** I'm not sure if it counts as a deviation from canon, as most people ignore or pick and choose information from Pottermore, but I use Charlus Fleamont Potter and Dorea Euphemia Black for James' parents. Combining the two just makes for a much more interesting background story.

As for Hermione, she's very proud of her father for overcoming racism to become a successful dentist (and her mother for overcoming sexism). She's either half or a quarter black, I haven't decided, but she has more of a medium skin tone as a result.

** I like to imagine that Hagrid plays a bigger role in Harry's life, and is the most influential of Harry's father figures. More so than Remus, Sirius, Mr. Weaselly, or Dumbledore. I think Harry was in his own way very sheltered as a child (to keep him from getting ideas) and Hagrid frequently introduces him to a variety of notable weirdos. Hagrid's influence also means that Harry will usually hooks up with a non-human in the end.

On another note, I also have an extensive collection of headcanons regarding magical theory that underpins the setting.

**** I don't write much, but I do occasionally contribute to things. Anyways here are a few:

- There are a number of different styles of magic, the two most common in Europe being Wizardry and Witchcraft.

1. Wizardry is magic born of will and whimsy. Casting a spell is like calligraphy with each being akin to a simple piece of art handcrafted and unique. Most of what are considered charms, hexes, and transfiguration are acts of wizardry.

2. Witchcraft is the art of utilising the the magic inherent in nature/objects/the stars. This is most commonly seen in potions, but includes some forms of divination. Witchcraft is considered outdated in the modern era.

- Nature spirits are poorly understood, but are at the core of the animagus transformation and the patronis spell. Werewolves are the result of a curse drives the wolf totem to madness. Lockhearts werewolf book is based on an encounter with a wolf animagus driven mad by its corrupted spirit.

- The Master of Death is a myth. The Deathy Hollows are not a set, but simply three related and powerful magical artifacts.

1. The Wand is cursed. Those who wield is are destined to die of violent conflict.

2. The Stone is cursed. Those who use it are driven to take their own lives to be with their loved ones.

3. The Cloak is blessed. Its owner cannot die until it is given to another that is almost if not always a decedent.

Harry chose to die (2), by being murdered by Voldemort (1), yet fate conspired to give him the means to return to life. (3)

** I always use WhiteSquirrel's concept of Arithmancy rather than canon. I just find canon arithmancy boring, not to mention that it doesn't make sense for Hermione to like it much if we use the canon definition.

I tend to use/prefer a lot of meta-writing explanations for some of the stupider things in the series, like some of Dumbledore's actions early on. In all likelihood, JKR just made mistakes and didn't think some things out. But I find it a bit boring to use that as an explanation, so it can be fun to find in-universe explanations even if they seemingly contradict canon.

I don't think we really have a canon explanation of how spells work in regards to hitting a target or affecting an object/person. Is it a projectile, or just a flash of light that has instantaneous effects? I head-canon that it depends on the spell. For instance, Avada Kedavra and Stupefy and more projectile-based, while most transfigurations and charms are not projectile-based.

**** IIRC, Arithmancy in canon is using numbers and mathematics to predict the future. This isn't awful or anything, it just feels a little dull compared to some fanon interpretations, like spell-crafting. It's also a little odd that Hermione would hate Divination so much (a class about predicting the future) and then like Arithmancy (a class about predicting the future via a different method). And now that I think about it, Hogwarts having 2 full classes about telling the future seems odd. It would make more sense if Arithmancy was something else, IMO.

******* Interestingly enough, trelawney actually has a couple real prophecies and while she normally sucks at interpreting things, her predictions and feelings arent usually entirely wrong.

She predicts that someone will be lost to the class before the end of the year, and Hermione fulfills that by dropping the class.

She asks harry if his birthday is in late December and while he was born in July, Voldemort, who has a soul fragment stuck to Harry's face, was born in December.

She interprets the "Grimm" in Harry's tea as an omen of his impending death. While this isnt correct, harry does meet his godfather that year, who has an animagus form of a big, black dog.

While Trelawney kind of sucks at some parts of divination, the subject itself isnt inaccurate. Trelawney is just bad at doing it. Dumbledore really only keeps her around because hes afraid that Voldemort will try to use trelawney to get the prophecy.

******** That's, I think, intentionally ambiguous. /Real-life/ charlatans get by on these vague predictions which always come true "from a certain point of view" if you wait long enough, so this could just be that (certainly, that's what the "it will happen on Friday" bit with Lavender suggests this interpretation). But at the same time, Prophecies /are/ real. So I think readers are meant to draw their own conclusions; it could really go either way based on the evidence in canon, either Divination itself is largely bogus, or Trelawney is just bad at it.

***** Canonically, the idea for why she likes Arithmancy and not Divination is, I think, that Arithmancy does its predictions in a controlled, mathematically-predictable manner, as opposed to Trelawney's haphazard intuition-based techniques. Hence Hermione doesn't object to predicting the future but to how shoddily Trelawney does it.

I have an alternate theory of what Arithmancy is, however, if you're not convinced by the above (I wasn't either). My theory is that /on paper/, Arithmancy is about predicting the future with numerology, but a Headmaster long ago decided that it was superfluous as a second Divination class, but ideal to sneak some non-magical education under the Ministry's nose. Hence they're nominally learning calculus so that they can predict the future, but mostly it's just an excuse to get some math into the Wizarding kids' heads.

** I generally use a very different political situation in my stores: In 1692, the magical world split from the muggle world, and didn't give a damn about political changes to muggle countries afterwards. Prussia still exists. Poland is a big country. France is ruled by a Duc. There is no Magical USA - Magical North America is split up in many, many enclaves and tribal nations, often warring with each other. Magical Russia is ruled by a Tsar. Grindelwald didn't give a damn about Nazis and tried (and almost succeeded) to conquer Magical Europe with an "all wizards are equal and superior to muggles" ideology. That resulted in many muggleborns flocking to his banner, and a backlash against them in Magical Europe after his defeat, which means that Britain is the best place for muggleborns under Dumbledore - they are facing heavy discrimination in the rest of Europe.

I like to use Arithmancy as the way to analyse spells including wards (which is shorthand for "permanent protections").

*** I like most of this, except that I think the French situation would be one of those cases where the "let's have a Revolution" craze would likely have spread to the Wizarding population. Hence I'm perfectly willing to have Magical France's borders not match the real ones, but I do think they had their own Revolution in the 18th or 19th century and abolished aristocracy like their Muggle counterparts. They may not have ever had a Napoleon, though --- it could be that the Magical Republic of France is still the same entity as the one founded in the 18th century, with no interruption.

I also tend to see Magical France as /more/ progressive than Wizarding Britain, on the basis of Beauxbâtons' Headmistress being half-Giant and their champion part-Veela. Which would fit the fact that what racism or class-warfare in Muggle France, ever since the Revolution, are greatly reduced compared to what existed (indeed, still has remnants) in the Anglosphere --- again, whether the Wizarding /government/ cares about the Muggle /government/, the cultures aren't impermeable to one another, and a racist/specist monarchic France seems to have little to do with Muggle France IRL.

Concerning Grindelwald and Nazis, my theory is somewhat different, in that I believe he /did/ prop up the Nazis, as part of a masterful tactical scheme --- simultaneously weaken the Muggle armies all over Europe, making it easier for him to swoop in and conquer them afterwards; /and/ collect /plenty/ of evidence to prove that Muggles left to their own device are horrifying barbarians.

One thing I do have along those lines, that you may not have considered, is that Magical India absolutely did not get conquered by Wizarding Britain, and they are still wholly independent and in much better economic shape than Muggle India.

I think giant-human offspring are incredibly rare because of how improbable a union is - fully grown giants average about 20 feet in height, after all. And the reason behind Olympe Maxime's post as Headmistress of Beauxbatons could also be due to the fact that people just believed that she had big bones, or had a mishap with Swelling Solutions or what not, not with France being any more tolerant.

Until Rita writes the article about Hagrid, people don't suspect him of being a half-giant, even though he's about ten feet tall. And he's been at Hogwarts for the better part of fifty years. It's very clear in hindsight to all characters after the article comes out, but before that, nobody suspects a thing.

**** The huge problem with making France more tolerant of muggleborns - as opposed to being more tolerant of Veela (giants do not seem to be tolerated much, seeing as the Headmistress denied her ancestry) - is that it makes every British muggleborn who didn't move to France as soon as things got difficult instead of moving around through the country and dodging Snatchers an idiot. And, of course, it makes the French idiots or evil for not doing something about Voldemort starting his genocide.

I also don't see the Frech as having a revolution, since the conditions that caused it didn't happen to Wizarding France. And in my stories, the wizards really don't give a damn about the muggle culture, lacking three hundred years of common history now.

With regards to Magical India, it wasn't conquered in my stories. It's also not united either, though. And its economy is likely dominated by the Princes and has a rigid caste society - far worse than muggle India. Untouchables who show magic? If you're lucky, the evil people who obviously stole you as a baby from a real wizard family are punished for their crimes and you're getting raised in a proper magical family after you have recovered from that trauma. If you're unlucky, you get killed as the abomination you are.

Hence they would refuse entry to Britons without the proper paperwork. And the Umbridge-Thickness, Voldemort-controlled Ministry would hardly give them that paperwork, even while taking care to remain on perfectly cordial terms with their French colleagues, so that when the British officials say this person isn't allowed to travel, the French believe them and kindly extradite any unlawful fugitives back to Britain, dismissing their talks of Imperiused Voldemort-agents as the mad ravings they clearly are.

Er, points for creepiness, but the Untouchables thing doesn't entirely compute. If the wizards are going to enslave other wizards only to not allow them to show magic, ever (and seriously, do you have any idea how many Obscurials that would create?!), why not simply enslave Muggles? Besides which, one would expect the slave-caste of the Wizarding version to not be humans at all, but House-Elves or some other species of similar status.

****** The French Ministry cannot refuse British muggleborns entry - they are British citizens and can legally travel to muggle France. Also, if they work with the British regime, they are evil or dumb - or both. Doubly so since the Delacours know better.

Also, I said, that's my personal take on it. The purebloods don't give a damn about what muggles think in my stories. And if the muggleborns want to make changes, they get stomped flat. That only started to change with the muggle population explosions, when muggleborn numbers started to reach levels where they started to matter.

You misunderstood my take on India. For the caste society there, things are clear: Since untouchables are just that, they most certainly cannot be wizards. So, any muggleborn untouchable must have been kidnapped as a baby, and therefore will be "rescued", or they get killed as some evil abomination. It's not about slavery, it's about the caste system.

In my stories, the wizards hid from muggles because if they hadn't, some catastrophe would have wiped them (and the world) out according to every seer in every country or tribe, presumably because magical WMDs would have been wielded in wars caused by medieval princes - or the belief in magic would grow so strong as muggle numbers exploded, the Old Ones would wake up and destroy the world. Whatever works. (The rest of the world certainly wouldn't have agreed to go into hiding and lose their place at the top of their society just because of some silly witch hunts in Europe which mostly killed muggles anyway. So it had to be a reason every wizard, world-wide, would agree was worth going into hiding.)

Oi, make up your mind. Either the Wizarding government of the relevant countries gives a damn about the Muggle one, or they don't. But if Magical France is a completely different regime that doesn't keep up with the Muggle side or give a frick about its laws, why on Earth would they care if the British wizards would be allowed by Muggle law, so long as they're not by Magical French law?

Interesting theory. My take on this is that an overwhelming majority of wizards were /already/ in hiding, more or less --- not hiding magic's existence as such, but trying not to mingle among Muggles too much and hiding their homes behind Muggle-repelling charms and illusions. So with a few exceptions the hassle of implementing the Statute of Secrecy wasn't in convincing the wizards (as a majority had always leaned in that direction), but in Obliviating the Muggles and corrupting records.

As for the rest of the world not having a reason to care about the European Witch Hunts, that would mostly be that the European wizards were the strongest and threatened war if the other nations in the I.C.W. didn't comply. Remember that the Europeans are the ones who invented wands, an extremely decisive advantage in battle magic. And besides, witch hunts [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_accusations_against_children_in_Africa][aren't just a European thing]].

I do think the Wizards in India have a caste society. Just one without untouchables/casteless. Still nothing about slaves.

I don't think that wizards were hiding. Certainly not in tribal societies where they would be the medicine men and shamans. Certainly not in societies where they would be the priests. Certainly not in socieites where, like in canon, a wizard could court Queen Elizabeth I. By the time the separation happened, the other countries had wands - they were invited 1500 years or more ago.

Why not? I'm not saying that wizards were trying to hide the existence of magic, but I think a majority of wizards already lived in places like Godric's Hollow or Diagon Alley and tried not to have too much contact with Muggles, for their own peace and quiet and/or because they despised Muggles.

And even in societies without such obvious positions of power for wizards, I don't think many wizards would be hiding. Wizards, no matter what pureblood fanboys like to claim, are human. And humans like to enjoy their higher status, power or wealth. Would they mingle with the peasants? Probably not. But with nobility? Of course they would. "Peace and quiet" is not as desirable for most people as power, influence and status. And until they have a country of their own, that means mingling with and being part of the ruling class.

So 14th-century Malfoys mingled with 14th-century Blacks in Diagon Alley and got their social-interaction fix that way. Having power and status over Muggles would not, I think, have been worth much to them, since it's so /easy/ for a wizard of debatable morals to rule over thousands of Muggles if they so wish --- just use enough memory charms, Imperius Curses, whatever, and any wizard could become a king. Wizards do want power and status, but even before the Statute they would most likely have wanted it over their fellow wizards.

No doubt some wizards also enjoyed Muggles' companies, but I imagine that for a majority of even /those/ wizards, they were glad to pay house-visits to Muggles but nonetheless preferred to live in comfortably-warded, location-unknown-to-the-authorities-so-I-don't-have-to-pay-taxes houses off in the middle of nowhere, and to do their day-to-day shopping in Diagon Alley.

Also you keep talking about wizard shamans and high-priests, but... do we have canonical confirmation that this used to be a thing? I mean, it's a fine enough theory as part of your own AU worldbuilding. But I don't think it's a canon fact that you can rely on.

We probably do. In general, I like your stories (dare I hope that you like mines?) but we have very different headcanons about a lot of thing.

In this particular case, wizards' equivalent of servants are House-Elves, and I don't think Elves are commonly trusted with gold to run errands with in the 20th century; I don't really see why things would have been different in the Middle-Ages. Besides, the sort of shopping a wizard does is mostly for magical items, and the wizard would want to pick those for themselves.

#+begin_quote
  Also, before the SoS, there was one society. I see no reason why wizards would segregate.
#+end_quote

In my view they never really /were/ one society.

In my headcanon, in prehistoric times, there were tribes of magicals and tribes of Muggles, and they didn't really mingle. I'll accept that if a Muggle-born came to one of the Muggle tribes they became the shaman, but that wasn't at all the main place to find wizards in those days. Of those tribes, some trained their magic, perfecting first wandless spells, and, eventually, wandlore; they are the ancestors of the modern wizards; others focused their gifts in one area, and hence rock-carving cave-dwellers became Goblins over generations, and quiet, fleet-footed hunter-gatherers became Elves, and natural legilimenses became Dementors, and so on.

Furthermore I'm firmly convinced by the Ancient Times, wizards were their own bubbles --- not /priests/ to the Muggles as you seem to suggest, but /gods/. For example, there was a thriving wizard citadel on Mount Olympus, the ruling dynasty of which had access to Elixir of Life (Ambrosia & Nectar, don't you know). "Demigods" were usually Half-Bloods whom the around-sleeping pureblood wizards wouldn't dream of training in proper magic, but who would use their magic wandlessly to boost their own abilities.

By the Dark Ages, the wizards were no longer seen as gods, but as the Fair Folk with their immense riches and powers, and strange, amoral ways. As Muggles became numerous enough that Muggle-borns were a noticeable phenomenon for the wizards, so did the tales of "changelings" and babies stolen from cribs come to exist.

Only when Muggle population exploded did the magical communities find themselves with more or less no other choice than to mingle with them regularly, rather than live on their own in their towers with and occasionally swoop in to exact tribute from the nearest village of ignorant peasants. They could no longer truly hide that they were humans of flesh and blood like the Muggles themselves, rather than strange immortal spirits. Still most wizards thought of Muggles as little more than beasts, and lived secluded in their perfect worlds of advanced healing and hygiene and literacy --- though /some/ were happy enough to mingle with the Muggles, the Dumbledores and Harrys of the world, such, one presumes, as the Malfoy who courted the Queen.

But these people, while a /sizable/ minority, were still just a minority. The witch-hunts were only one more thing to convince the already-biased purebloods that Muggles were loathsome creatures who could never live in peace with wizards, and it would be better for anyone if they remained apart. After democratic Wizarding governments and the I.C.W. were instated, replacing the amorphous councils of before, it only took someone /suggesting/ the idea of making the Muggles forget wizards' existed altogether, to realize that a majority of the population was in favor. And so despite outcry by the "blood-traitors", the Statute was implemented.

But they hadn't accounted for the fact that the Muggle population would keep growing and growing to the point that by the end of the 20th century, half-bloods and Muggle-borns far outnumber purebloods and more Muggle culture has seeped in through the cracks of the Statute than was ever known to wizards /before/ the Statute.

Well, I agree with the end of that paragraph, but not the beginning. I'm one of the people constantly chiming others on the sub when they forget that canonically, magic is more advancing than it is receding --- but while a lot of everyday-commodity-spells that everyone can learn with enough elbow grease are recent (or recent-ish) creations, since I think of magic as having always been abstractly the same, any Dumbledore-level genius in Ancient Times could do a billion things that would make Muggles see them as gods.

There perhaps it's a difference in our conceptions of wandless magic --- but a true magical savant would, in my opinion, be capable of bringing down lightning and so on. Remember for example that Tom Riddle could apparently do a wandless Cruciatus as a child (or something close enough; probably not as strong as the wanded version; but if he can get that far without any training, as a child, and without a wand, then give him an adult's magic and a wand, and all bets are off).

My point is, Zeus could probably levitate things around, even if it took hundreds of years yet before /Wingardium Leviosa/ was refined into something you could more or less get into 11-year-old Neville Longbottom's head. And they may not have had cutting-edge Nimbus 2000s or Time-Turners, but the Peverell Brothers still managed to find ways to open a doorway to the freaking Afterlife.

So in short, my answer is twofold:

- The status of academic magic, and the might attainable by a few magical geniuses, are in my opinion almost entirely unrelated to one another.

- An ancient wandless wizard could still be trained to use his magic in ways that curbstomp a Muggle with a pointy stick any day, even if they wouldn't stand up to a modern duelist.

With regards to the ancient wizards, Zeus might have been able to call down lightning - but he wouldn't have had all the utility spells we take for granted. And he would have been the Dumbledore of his time, not the average wizard. The average wizard would have been doing rituals just to get clean water, for example. So, no, Zeus couldn't do a billion things - he could do a few impressive things, tops. Because he was seen as a god, not an ordinary wizard, so he was exceptional. And ordinary wizards had a much harder time curbstomping anyone wince, without wands, they simply weren't that good fighting others - too slow, too vulnerable, apart from a few exceptional exceptions who had the knack for fighting.

But the average wizard? Was a priest or healer, who lived in muggle communities, and picked a talented successor, usually their kid.

I don't like the idea of wizards being apart from muggles before the SoS, and I don't like the idea of magic being a gift from gods, fully formed. I like progression - magic being advanced little by little, with wands and later schools being huge steps.

Another point where our headcanons differ; I don't think "rituals" were ever much of a thing. The average wizard before wands and schools would have, in my opinion, more likely been trying to use his wandless magic Force-style than carrying out any "rituals".

Really, this is the shortest way to explain it --- I think wandless prehistoric/ancient wizards had loosely the same type of abilities as Force-users. Taking lightsabers out of the picture, a modern wizard (even a mediocre one) would make mince pie of a Jedi; but that doesn't change the fact that pitting them against the /SW/ version of /Muggles/, even one barely-trained Force-user is an extremely important factor to keep track of on a Galactic scale. /In a sci-fi universe./

By 1692, /my/ wizards don't really have much of a ruling authority; most wizards, or wizarding families, live in their own domain and by their own rules, and even the friendlier ones would laugh at the idea that they're under the /authority/ of the Muggle kings. But as they enter an age where /some/ kind of wizarding coordination better than an inefficient Council is necessary to prevent catastrophes has become absolutely necessary, they grudgingly agree they need /some/ kind of government.

Wands are so important, for all their weaknesses, for good reason, in my opinion. Wandless magic is, in comparison, on the level of someone using martial arts in a fight where everyone else has guns and some have tanks. Sure, you might be able to take care of unarmed peasants (aka muggles in this comparison) easily - but the weight of numbers will tell anyway, so wandless wizards can't dominate multiple muggles easily.

Well, since wizards differ greatly in talent and ability, I see them looking for exceptional, powerful wizards to lead them - or, rather, I see such wizards taking the lead, and the rest following. I really, really don't see them, as a group, decide that they need a government and that they want to hide. That sounds too much like "those super-humans not only can work magic but are culturally so advanced, they know and want the best form of government, and are mature enough to install it.

That the original 17th-century governments were a golden age is the furthest thing from my mind.

No regression to get to the 1990 Ministry, just moral stagnation and the bureaucracy progressively getting more bloated thanks to the generous amounts of bribes that wizards started paying literally from day one so X law or Y regulation wouldn't apply to them.

Even if 90% of the wizards thought like that, that wouldn't prevent the rest of taking over positions of power in muggle countries.

Your headcanon still relies on the faulty assumption that wizards would rather be the lowest of the pecking order in the wizard village than ruling the muggle town next over. And that assumption doesn't work, as our history shows. Certainly not for everyone.

You're thinking by real-world rules. But in the pre-Statute history I posit, wizards had for a long time been seen as, well, think Tolkien Elves. I think in terms of status, just being a wizard (especially a wealthy one of refined manners) would have been equal to being a nobleman, as far as most Muggles were concerned.

There probably were a few, of course. But that doesn't mean that wizards as a whole were integrated with Muggle, just because a few villainous ones occasionally decided to live in the Muggle world for personal profit.

But more importantly, most of the power-hungry wizards who ruled over Muggles, in my view, did so as God-Emperors or literal Gods. Again, if you want a dynasty of wizards who used their powers to rule the Muggles, see Zeus and the Olympians.

They are humans who can work magic but are still stuck with the exact same human foibles, not some super species of noble people. The more you separate them, the more you make them less human, less integrated with human history, the more you violate what I consider HP's core message: Wizard or muggle, we're all humans.

Also, we have lots of legends and histories of super-powered heroes on mythology. We have lots of tales of priests able to heal people, or witches cursing others. I really don't see any reason why you'd have to make wizards into elves just to justify the SoS.

I don't have a particular written source. It's just that as a Frenchman myself, growing up, the term "/personne de couleur/" was only ever mentioned to us in school as the euphemism used during the Apartheid to just barely cover up how racist they were.

As for "mixed-race", the fact is that France rejects the notion/term of "race" altogether. If you start talking about someone's "race" in France, /at best/ everyone is going to look at you funny, at worst they'll call the police. There was recently a big symbolic movement where the one time the word occurred in the French Constitution was struck from it.

***** That's super interesting. I don't think POC is used that way in Australia at all, people who want to be respectful either say POC or, if they know it, their ethnicity specifically. Racists use slurs mostly.

I think that's a positive - for many people, the removal of race does signify the death of culture also though. How does France deal with that aspect of divorcing race from a persons identity? Is it something that is addressed?

Interesting note: my partner lived in France for a year and speaks French so I just had a discussion about it with them. They said the term ‘personne de couleur' in French and ‘person of colour' in English aren't equivalent terms (in terms of the implication? I don't exactly know how to describe it). Same with talking about race - /Noirs en France/, which is totally acceptable in French, is literally ‘blacks in France' in English, which is blunt at best and rude and reductive at worst (in English).

Language differences are so interesting!!

Also re Hermione's background: no, I don't think it's a deviation of canon at all, but some people seem to think it is. I haven't really /changed/ her background at all, I've just elaborated on it in a way that wasn't touched on in canon.

It's a bit of a political issue there, as of late. Historically, France has been spectacularly non-racist, but not much for diversity; the common wisdom is that you shouldn't care who someone's parents were and what color their skin is, but if you want to live in France, you must adopt French culture and customs. Melting-pot, not salad-bowl.

This may sound odd to you, but remember that France didn't start out as a mishmash of various peoples like the U.S.A. did, or even England to a lesser extent. The French are one people with one history, and while we do have minorities they are really --- well --- /minor/.

A distant great cousin of mine was the consort of Napoleon. We are distantly related to Joan of Arc, not that you'd understand the significance because she was a /mere Muggle/. There was a branch of the family tree, mostly forgotten until I started looking into it in my sixth year, a reclusive son of a reclusive father, going back to the 1600s. He married a woman and to the horror of everyone, also took her name. His name was Hector Dagworth-Granger.”

  Regulus's eyes widened in recognition and he opened his mouth to speak. She sealed it with a searing stare and continued to talk.

As far as what education they received or the type of school Uagadou was, that's not elaborated on.

That's why the European community sees race changes as unnecessary bullshit. You are adding American politics to a YA novel universe. If you really want to include some social issues, make Hermione half Polish or something like that (even though the Polish only really came to the UK in 2004).

********* I mean, I'm not. The fact she has different race background is really not relevant to the story apart from the topic of heritage which comes up as a part of the Muggleborn/Halfblood/Pureblood argument that is already present in canon.

It's not a political or social issue at all in the story. No one is trying to discriminate against her because of her race or make an issue out of it. It's not a significant part of the story, it's just something /I/ like to play around with in /my/ fics.

The comment that I posted was, a) racist and unnecessary and b) asking me to tag a POC Hermione which I don't think is necessary and is such a nit picky thing to take issue with that I thought I could use it to start a discussion on headcanons that writers like to use in their fics.

It's deviated into mostly people nitpicking my language (which I've clarified in the OP anyway, I've included several backgrounds of ethnicity that qualify my HG as a POC and also learned that some European communities don't use the same language as the communities in Australia, which was interesting to learn) and telling me why Hermione isn't POC in canon which I never tried to claim anyway.

Saying Europeans don't care about race is ridiculous. That's a reductive view of a huge variety of people and ethnicities. Regardless it's not actually relevant to my post at all.

This isn't a question of age or circles or whatever - people in Europe don't consider southern Europeans as "non-whites". Anyone who tells you differently is either a hardcore racist, a liar, or an idiot.

(People in Western/Northern Europe have a lot of racists views about Southern or Eastern Europeans - but "they're not white" isn't among them. The worst you get are the Nazis talking about "non-aryan races", which covers a lot of white people.)

Now that I know it's not widely used /I will refrain/. It doesn't need further discussion. I already understood and have let go of my stance on the matter. I'm not trying to pigeonhole them into a ‘non-white' box, I was trying to respect their identification as PoC. I will refer only to the people I know who use the term with that identification from now on.

Regarding self identification, i /just/ said *no one* gets to decide who's the right shade/culture/ancestry. Aboriginality in Australia, for example, is almost entirely based on self identification and participation in the aboriginal communities, because the minute we start talking about ‘how Aboriginal' someone is, we get into [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations][Stolen Generation half-caste bullshit]]. I don't think there's a definitive answer on how to regulate it and I never said it was actually easy or fair; just /the easiest and fairest/

FYI the word Aborigine is older language no longer used in Australia due to the negative connotations of the word. Aboriginal Aboriginal is the preferred term.

From this the obvious conclusion to me is that wizards all over the world have had a pretty good idea about world geography for much longer than Muggles.

** Hermione's race is never specified. She has canonically curly-as-fuck brown hair - more than reasonable for her to be mixed race. The disgusting slur used for POC Hermione in fanfic is revolting. It's absolutely ridiculous that white people must defend the white-unless-specified-otherwise defence (as a white person), because writing a non-white character is just way too PC and not at all representative of real life!!!

** I write a mixed Harry or Latina Hermione. tbh it's your fic, your way if interpreting JK's characters. Don't do it like her, do it like you!

I would like to write a HP fix where Harry becomes Spider-Man and is not a crossover, just the idea of him becoming one and it would kinda be like Spider-man PS4.

*** Oh I'm definitely not changing it! I've given my Hermione Portuguese background, she's actually still described within the parameters of JK's character description so I can only conclude someone has taken offence to the idea that the background of her character can be taken at liberty.

That sounds like an amazing idea, I would absolutely read it.

** I imagine Harry as bisexual. However, in the HP fandom, I've only posted short stories that were either gen or established Harry/Ginny. It's only in my current long fics - not yet posted - that that this is clear. So, I don't know what response that's going to get. Considering fic readers are used to filtering out m/m if they have a problem, it should be accepted.

I also write Hermione with Jessica Sula in mind.

** The Black sisters get along splendidly, no matter the public appearances. Andromeda is not the good sister, she merely fell in love with a Muggleborn.

Rastaban killed Nymphadora, Bellatrix avenged her niece before going on a murder rampage, slaughtering Defenders and Death Eaters alike.

**** Linkffn(12745758)

Especially chapters 7 (Andromeda PoV) to 9. Fairly family centric, with Nymphadora being somewhere between adoptive sister and mother and Andromeda somewhere between adoptive mother and cool aunt.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

****** Thanks. I just find the common narrative utterly boring and quite frankly dumb. Unlike Sirius, Andromeda did not have issues with her family while growing up, so at the very least she was better at hiding her true self. And even then her sisters would have noticed. And Bellatrix joining the Death Eaters to protect her sisters is a better story than evil child becoming evil because she is evil.
