Pétunia et Vernon accablés doivent affronter la maladie de Dudley sous le regard du petit Harry qui va obtenir leur respect par un geste totalement inattendu de sa part en raison des mauvais traitements infligés par son cousin mais aussi les parents de ce dernier.

A 94 chapters completed story.

I enjoyed it quite a lot and it is pretty rare for me to enjoy a french fanfic. French fics tend to be even more badly written than "bad" english ones.

​

So tell me what you think of it ?


** Thanks, I'll have a read through! I've been meaning to get back into French and have been trying ti avoid fanfiction since the writing is not as useful to me as other french works.
