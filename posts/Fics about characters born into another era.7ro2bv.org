I'm looking for fics where characters like Harry/Hermione/Tom were born in an era different from their original. For example, Hermione was born into the Marauder or Tom Riddle era, Harry born into Riddle's era, Tom Riddle born into Harry's era, etc. Fem!Harry is great too. I would prefer AU fics where the characters are just born into those eras as if thats just the way it is, not "redo" or "reborn" fics (like The Debt of Time), but if there is a fic that's really good that is like that then feel free to link it.


** Well it is a redo but I really like linkffn(10610076)

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Because every relationship is essentially just a stage, whether it's a friendship, a familial, or a romantic relationship. Theirs encompasses all three.

*** This a good rec! I've actually already read it...the writing is great, even though Remus/Hermione isn't my cup of tea.
