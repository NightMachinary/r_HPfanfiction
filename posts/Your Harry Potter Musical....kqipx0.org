There are a number of songs, that every time I hear them I picture characters or vignettes of the Harry Potter story. Be Prepared, by Jeremy Irons from the Lion King soundtrack, makes me think of Tom Riddle convincing his first Death Eaters to join him. Heroes, by David Bowie, makes me think of James and Lily, knowing that the only thing between Riddle and their child is their own lives. Finally, Counting on Me, by Smashing Into Pieces, makes me think of Harry at his lowest points, knowing that he's the only thing in between Riddle and the rest of the world. What songs bring to mind certain characters or scenes to you?


** The song "Memories" by Maroon 5 makes me think of Snape.

I don't even like Snape that much!

** [[https://youtu.be/ORUZ4YB9yxs][Liar by The Arcadian Wild]] reminds me so much of Severus Snape in his youth

  I sense there's trouble ahead

  It's clear by the signs and warnings

  That should tell where all blame is due

  So why are they pointing at my head?

  All have been led astray

  We've all fallen short in some way

  Please understand I'm ashamed

  And I beg of you, please find your grace

  'Cause I'm not in a right state of mind

  I just wish I had strength to admit it

  My stubbornness will put up a fight

  But I don't deserve to win it

  I'm left in the dark pondering my mistakes

  In the light I swear I will

  Deny it all
