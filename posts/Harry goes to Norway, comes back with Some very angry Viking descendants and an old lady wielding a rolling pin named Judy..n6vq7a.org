** To be fair, I love the idea of a viking/norse inspired magical Scandinavia. Having a viking chief-like headmaster, runic magic as a key part of the curriculum and creatures from Norse mythology and Nordic folklore makes far more sense to me than Karkaroff and Durmstrang and the love of the Dark Arts. Besides, no offense to JKR, but if she thought that the Nordics would be happy to share a school with Russians, she's a bit off the mark. Especially Finland, with their history with Russia, has good reason not to want to share school with Russian students.

*** Share with russians? Shit, they have to make a damn good argument to make Scandinavians share a school with each other, especially Denmark (my country) and Sweden. There would be constant fights in the halls.

**** Yeah, I'm Norwegian, and I doubt any Norwegians would be happy to collaborate with Russians either.

** By viking descendants do you mean people descended from vikings or people who descended from Harry who also happen to be Vikings? Because a fic where Harry goes back to viking times and becomes a badass viking chief and just has a shit ton of kids and either finds a way back in the present and brings his fam with him or is immortal(at least immune to aging) and shows up a few minutes after he disappeared originally along with all his Viking family sounds cooler to me than Harry leaving to Sweden and bringing back magical pewdiepie and his swede homies.

** While my idea is probably not what you were imagining, it's definitely something.

Alright, so --- I'm from Iceland, so I'd know the language and the culture. Plus, if we're talking folklore or whatever, there's this one story about a giant worm that I'd love to pair up with the giant squid.

Oh well, on to my idea --- despite stereotypes, we don't act like vikings, but still, I'd write about an OC that'd go to Hogwarts from Iceland, and the OC would be incredibly alike to, uh, some stereotypes; as in wearing only wool jumpers and the weird hat that's called ‘buff' in Icelandic --- only eating fish, lamb and licorice --- living in a grass house (I have no idea what it's called in English but if you google ‘torfbær' you should find some images on what I'm talking about.)

The OC would be rather blunt, lazy, extreme (challenging someone to a fight to the death over something small (edit: tehe, a holmgang!) and unable to pick up on social cue's --- and honestly just life in general.

By the way, if you didn't pick up on it while reading my not-so-quick description, this fic would definitely be a crack.

*** Your idea made me smile. Dude it's a prompt it's supposed to give you an idea to start writing anything that comes from it is awesome it doesn't have to be exactly what I have in mind that's why the prompt is it's open to interpretation by whatever writer comes across it. And your idea sounds Hilarious I'm primarily a crack writer myself. And if you choose to continue with that idea I would definitely read that story.

​

Thanks for taking the time to read my prompt and I love the incorporation of the OC the blunt lazy character sounds like it would fit in interestingly with the story premise this sounds like a fun read if you want writeto it I would definitely read it

*** Apparently a ‘torfbær' is called a sod house in English --- and I'm not completely sure, but I think that the buff thing is also called a buff in English (I'm too lazy to do the research rn).
