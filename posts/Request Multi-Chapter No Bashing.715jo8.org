Looking for Multi-Chapter stories where there's no or very little bashing. I tend to hate it when characters are bashed by the authors.

Can be set in any Era but I tend to get rather bored with the Marauder Era pretty quickly since they tend to rehash stuff a lot, maybe if there's a interesting multi-chapter out there set in Marauder's Era that you can think of it's fine.

Can be close to Canon or completely AU. Can be set in any Era as I said, but if the story is set in Marauder's Era please don't let it be the typical Marauder's Era story.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

I don't want Harry to be Hermione levels of smart because it's not believable, now a little more smarter then he was in canon is fine, just not Hermione levels smart.

And I'd rather him not be Dumbledore levels of powerful either, a little more powerful then he was in canon is okay, just nothing crazy please.

Can be focused on any character major or minor as long as they have believable characterizations/personalities.

Would rather the story be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine I suppose.


** Linkffn(Strange Visitors From Another Century by Izzyaro) has the trio going back to the Founders era.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5)

If I had to choose one Marauders era story it would be Linkffn(Sands of Destiny by amidtheflowers)

A Long Journey Home Linkffn(9860311) is one of the best stories in the fandom. It's a time travel fem Harry story where Harry or Jasmine is smart and powerful, but not because reasons.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
