:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I haven't been able to find this fic in a while. It involved Harry being sent back in time via the McKinnon family time turner, and is somehow made into a female. He takes the name Ariana, and uses the last lame Peverell I think. She eventually gets adopted by the Potters. She is within the Order in disguise as a male version of Harry. He also identifies when Rookwood becomes a source for the Order. Last I remember, it was at least 40 chapters I think, and Voldemort conquered Britain in a year when Ariana was in a magic coma. Then Rookwood was the only Order member left, and they left using the last functional time turner, the McKinnon family time turner.

Does anybody remember what this story was? It was on ff.net, and was updated within the last year, probably the last half year I think.

  Harry Potter gets captured in his 6th year, only to die and get sent back in time.. with a twist. He is reborn a girl with wild and uncontrollable magic as he tries to stop Voldemort's first rise to power with the help of Dumbledore. Can he change the future? Or is it set in stone?

*** That's it! Thanks, honestly wish I could find more Rookwood characterization, which is why being unable to find this nagged at me.

**** Besides here, one of the best Rookwood is from HP PoS. I always liked him as the best DE there is, simply because in fanon they always characterize him as a DOM special agent and whatnot (he did work for DOM on canon, but we have no idea what he did) and it adds interesting depth to it.

***** Do you have a link to that story? I don't know what the acronym stands for. Unless it's Prince of Slytherin, but we haven't seen him outside of a coma yet.

****** Oh, yes, its Prince of Slytherin. He isn't out of coma, but everything that was attributed to him, and the fear/respect that Snape has of his mind is enough to illustrate the character to such a level that is enough for me, for now, at least.
