I got the sense that Fleur wasn't necessarily being told rude things to her face ( could be remembering wrong)

But I feel that Ginny and Molly would have shown there disapproval and that Bill probably defended her considering they got married .

But ya scene where that happens in any fic. Doesn't have to be Bill or Fleur centric just that moment happening. Could be one shot or long fic.

No ship preferences beyond Bill x Fleur
