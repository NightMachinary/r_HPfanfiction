If you suggested something last month and think it's a really good choice, feel free to suggest it again. I'll give extra consideration to fics that get suggested multiple times. The theme for May is going to be *AU*.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]] 260K long novel, and I believe its the #1 HP fanfic the internet has to offer! A warning though, the fanfic features a dark HP universe were many characters have been killed and the author's portrayal of Voldemort is the most evilest one you'll ever find.

With that said the portrayal of the rest of the characters (H and Hr in particular) are so spot on it will make you shed a tear, the story is also VERY real and details very real emotions, anguish and angst. you'll be on the edge of your seat the entire way I'd think, at least thats the case for me and I'm halfway through the story.

Another thing, this is an H/Hr pairing, even if you aren't a fan, you just have to read it for the writing in of it self, its a real masterpiece.

** I'd like to put my story out there since the theme is AU.

Hogwarts Battle School. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

And so I'm not being too selfish, another AU. It might fall more into the crossover realm, but I think it deserves to be submitted for discussion.

The Prince Who Was Promised. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/]]

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

*** After reading both of these fan fictions yesterday (great job by the way, Kwan), I can also vouch for these. Especially The Prince Who Was Promised. It's a crossover with a Game of Thrones however it's still a great read even without actually knowing anything about GoT.

They are a tonne of AU stories however I'll recommend this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] and it's sequels.

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

*** Both are great, original stories. I have to admit that I favored The Prince Who Was Promised, if only because I've always wanted to see more of the ASOIAF world before book 1 in cannon.

Also helps that both fics are being actively updated, with the author of TPWWP recently putting out new material on the DLP WbA section.

*** I have yet to read HBS so I can't really comment on that one, but The Prince Who Was Promised simply blew me away. It is one of those few fanfics that people can point to as a reason to read fanfic in general when other people diss on the writing capabilities of fanfic authors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]

#+begin_quote
  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
#+end_quote

Complete

This story almost ignores the books, as to instead follow Harry on an adventure in Southern America together with Bill Weasley. Great fic - I can't stress this enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759007/1/Turn-Me-Loose-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]

#+begin_quote
  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?
#+end_quote

Complete

Bungle in the Jungle sequal. Not as good as the previous one unfortunately.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries]]

#+begin_quote
  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
#+end_quote

WIP

A lot darker than many fics out there, and not something you wish to read if you want to feel happy. It is however very AU and well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black]]

#+begin_quote
  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.
#+end_quote

WIP

A big focus on the Blacks (duh) and some Harry-Draco friendship. No slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]]

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
#+end_quote

WIP

The newest one on the list. Fairly regularly updated. If you like fast moving stories this isn't one for you. It's about Harry following the Voldemort of his dimension to pu a stop to him. He suddenly finds himself in a new dimension where he never existed, and his now battle-hardened self must go through Hogwarts again with quite a few changes. Not very AU, but subtly and ever increasing.

To anyone who wants to write and AU HP story you might want to take a look at Taure's Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic. It has a lot of good ideas, but the author abandoned the story when he found he didn't have enough of a plot to keep it going. A real shame.

One of my favorite fics. The writer captivates the reader with an entertaining concept, and the humor fits in perfectly. It manages to be a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and romance. It is INSANELY AU.
