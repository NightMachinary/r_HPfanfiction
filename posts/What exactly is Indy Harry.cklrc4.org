** It's Harry driving fast cars around Indianapolis. /s

Actually, it stands for independent Harry. In theory that means a Harry who is more aware of and takes a more active role in the wizarding society around him, instead of relying on advisors like Dumbledore.

In practice, it often contains plenty of dumb tropes like a manipulative Dumbledore whose life goal it is to exploit Harry for personal gain; Harry finding out he's the heir to every single famous witch and wizard from 1000 years ago and having a quadrillion galleons; stupid "pureblood politics" where noble houses actually exist instead of being a figment of the Blacks' hubris...

*** You forgot that Ron was a greedy idiot who is only friend with Harry because he is paid, and that Ginny planned to dose him with love potions to become the Lady Potter (and take control of his vault) with the help of Molly.

On another note, Indi Harry fic also often portray Sirius as a big manchild, whose 2 only goals in life seem to be to pranks everyone, and to sleep with as much girl as humanly possible (so a perfect representation of canon Sirius I would say).

  relying on advisors like Dumbledore.

Great points. It's a bit different from Canon (where his dependence on people was one of the main strengths of his character) I like them because Harry doesn't take help from order (after a point I got bored of Harry needs golden trio . - it works great in canon, but I read fanon for my guilty pleasure, so I like fics going the other way from canon)

** There are oodles of Indy Harry types but I think all of them involve living in a box at some point.

** Basically it boils down to

"Harry decides to be proactive, learning and developing his skills and power-base etc, rather than being a passive part of the plot, doing as he is told by Dumbledore"

Often this includes Manipulative!Dumbledore, both to create conflict and the initial justification for Harry to strike out alone. It also often includes an attempt to make Harry more 'grey' - more killing, dark magic, less selflessness in his goals - and to emphasise that he's a 3rd side in the war, no longer part of Dumbledore's Army nor a supporter of Voldemort. Also common is Harry's friendships changing - often losing Ron and/or Hermione in favour of Slytherins or characters like the Twins, and replacing Dumbledore as a mentor with someone like Moody or Salazar Slytherin's portrait. This is cause it emphasises Harry's independence and deals with the fact that Ron and Hermione are less likely to react as he does and be okay with opposing or ignoring Dumbledore's orders.

Then you have the tropes that result from laziness and poor writing, the convenience tropes - Harry inherits a dozen titles, Death Eaters are good guys, Dumbledore is evil and stealing from Harry, the Weasleys are paid to be Harry's friends, everyone is ignorant and blind and accuse Harry of darkness and uncritically follow Dumbledore, 'magic blocks', helpful goblins etc. These are basically all ways of hitting the important points without needing to do too much hard work as a writer - Harry's growing power fits with him gaining political influence or removing a magic block, Evil!Dumbles is a step further than Manipulative!Dumbles and creates harsher conflict, having Ron and/or Hermione become idiotic or paid pawns of Dumbledore helps justify replacing them with Harry's new friends etc etc.

Personally, I'm a sucker for Indy Harry, along with Powerful or Genius Harry, WBWL, AU, Peggy Sue etc. I like a powerful, proactive protagonist rather than the passive puppet Harry resembles at times in canon.

** Welp, until now i was half convinced indy!Harry was like "Indiana Harry" like a Harry that exhibits Indiana Jones traits like going into ruins and jungles and knowing ancient runes and stuff ðŸ˜‚ (not that I've seen that many fics or discussions with those tags, hence the misunderstanding, i think)
