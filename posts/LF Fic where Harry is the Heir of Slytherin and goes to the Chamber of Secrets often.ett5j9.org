Thanks!


** I know of linkffn(A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned). Many think it's cliched and cringy, but I've only read it once over a year ago so I can't judge.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** It's interesting to me in that it plays with a lot of cliches and subverts a lot of them, but since it's been around so long a good amount of the subversions are becoming cliche

*** If I'm thinking about the right one I just feel like it had so much more potential as a harry x katie pairing

**** I think so too. Katie is a much better match for Harry's short-tempered self than Fleur was.

Also, I might have gone overboard on the spoiler tag right now (Hey! It's two in the morning, my blood pressure's been up and down all day and both my sisters just left for uni abroad. I think I have the right to be irrational right now.) but, maybe you should spoiler tag the pairing part.

*** That's one of my favorite fics, but unfortunately it doesn't fit OP's request because the series isn't finished.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
