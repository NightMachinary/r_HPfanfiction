Are there any fanfictions where harry either invents or uses a kind of magic that only he can use or really hard to learn? Don't care if it makes him op at some point

​

Please no stories where he teaches his magic to everyone and their mothers, it's super annoying to see fanfictions where he trains really hard to be able to use some kind of magic, and then just teaches it to everybody he meets.

​

Prefer it to be AU and not just a canon rehash

​

No slash/femslash or Harry/ginny


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Harry invents tons of runic devices. Some for fun, some useful, some really dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) Hermione invents tons of new spells. Some are taught to Harry and the others, some are published in academic journals and earn awards, but some, like the Curse of Von Neumann, are so terrible that she decides to never let anyone know about them.

** In the Last Mage of Krypton series on FFN, Harry learns Kryptonian Battlemagic in Book 2 in order to defeat Lockhart in a duel. Said battlemagic consists of manifested sigils that act as shields and when arranged correctly and empowered, produce effects based on the meanings of the sigils. An example would be the sigils Ur Kann Tor. The first meaning of Ur is /Attack/, the second meaning of Kann is /Thoughts/ while the third meaning of Tor is /Ambiguity/ -- the whole meaning that the target's decision making is severely impaired for a while. It is noteworthy that any attempt to use four or more sigils will simply cause the attempted spell to backlash.

In story, Harry is the only one to use said magic, but since he was born as Kal-El, that isn't very surprising.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
