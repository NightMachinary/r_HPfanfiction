I hate myself for never pushing myself to finish it before now. It is one of the most compelling pieces of fanfiction I've read, and one that I literally could not put down. I read over 3 million words in four days, staying up until the wee hours to squeeze in just one more chapter. I've never felt so attached to characters before, and I'm almost heartbroken to have reached the conclusion. I highly recommend the series to anyone who is looking for a long fic with a strong Harry with a lot of flaws and insecurities to overcome. There is slash, but you can easily skim over it without missing anything plot relevant. Starts with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Saving Connor/]]


** Its one of those series that I've always wanted to finish, but I give up part way through. I remember trying a bunch of times over the years, but never managing to get there.

*** I so recommend just forcing yourself to finish. I almost put it down a few times, but when I finished it I was so... satisfied, I guess.

**** Yeah, I'm not going to force myself through several million words of writing just to feel a bit of satisfaction. As I recall I've always given up part way through because the whole thing slows right down.

As with all big fanfic series, its in great want of some hefty editing. The author could accomplish the same plot more effectively, in 2/3 the number of words if it was well edited.

As it is, I think a lot of authors try to get the highest word count they can rather than trying to write effectively.

***** Ahh, I personally prefer the long fics that include some good slow parts. I find it more realistic when it isn't all action and shows some scenes that aren't completely relevant to the plot, but flesh out the characters.

** The world building in this is just phenomenal. Side characters who never get a real backstory in canon are completely fleshed out. Brilliant.

** I remember starting this and liking the writing a lot, but I couldn't get over how much I hated Draco Malfoy. It really felt to me like he was the villain, and seeing that the pairing would eventually be HP/DM depressed me.

*** He's not, but he is a whiny bitch most of the time. He's actually pretty heroic at some moments, but mostly a whiny bitch.

**** Hmm, you liked it despite that? Does he get less annoying/what he deserves, or is the rest of it good enough to make up for him?

***** He gradually grows up after making a series of realizations. By the end of the story he still an asshole, but he knows he's an asshole and realizes it's just the person he is. He's not AS whiny and actually helps Harry get through a lot of struggles with being a normal, well-adjusted human. Harry's development is way more frustrating because he was raised to believe he was a guardian and sacrifice for his brother (the boy who lived). Lily and Dumbledore molded him into this weaponized child because of an irrational fear that he'd become a dark lord and the whole story is focused around his coming to grips with what it means to live for yourself and your own choices.
