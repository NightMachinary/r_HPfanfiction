I know that Rowling considered killing off Arthur i'm not sure if she would have killed of Sirius even if Arthur had died as well. But i realized I never have read a fic where that happens and im curious if one exists. Any fic where Arthur dies and Sirius lives at the end of book 5 will work as long as the fic continues beyond the events of book 5. I don't have any ship preferences but i'd prefer it focus more on plot less on shipping.

**** Yeah, but he didn't really have any right to tell him what to do outside of his own home. Dumbledore was Harry's headmaster and a grandfather figure, Sirius was his godfather. I dunno, Arthur and Remus just never felt the same as Dumbledore and Sirius. Maybe it's just me.

** I'm glad she didn't kill off Arthur. Not only do I really like him, moreso than the other father figures of the series, but I think his death would have completely changed the entire Weasley family in a depressing way. I think a lot of the joking around from the twins, or the romance plotlines involving Ron and Ginny would feel out of place, if not removed entirely.

One of the things that made Harry Potter so great was how they made the characters seem normal and real by having them experience things we all go through. It's why I loved Half Blood Prince so much; while the stakes had been raised to new heights, it was also the book that made these magical characters seem most normal and allowed the reader to connect with them on a different level.

The other possible issue with Rowling killing off Arthur would be that she might not actually change much of anything. I think Rowling was not great at accurately showing the impact traumatic events had on the characters. I was surprised how quickly and easily Harry seemed to bounce back from Sirius' death, for example. As such, one would not be surprised to find the Weasleys also not really feeling the impact.

**** I'm with you that it is very interesting to explore what could happen. Fanfic is great in part because it allows the author to take the story in different directions, including darker themes. As a thought exercise, it is interesting to see what effect Arthur's death would have on canon. Would Harry and Ginny get together or would both be so depressed that neither would notice the things about each other that drew them together? Would Ron become so surly and depressed that Hermione simply couldn't help him, thus breaking up the Trio? Or perhaps would he become incredibly determined to avenge his father's death, which at first makes Hermione happy that he is becoming more serious about his studies but then she realizes she is losing the fun Ron she loves?

It's a plot change that could be fantastic for fanfic but I think could've ruined the actual series.

****** There are a surprising number of juicy plots that for whatever reason just rarely get written.

Not so much a plot, but I've requested a few times for a Dean-focused fic that revolves around the awkwardness that is Harry dating Ginny while he still clearly likes her and shares a dorm with Harry. I never get any responses, nor have I found much of that story in my searches.

****** Because I think its only good as a really character driven thing. Writing character driven stories is hard. You have to have a great understanding of plotting and dialogue to make something worthwhile. I think most fanfiction authors shy away from it simply because of this.

  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash. She knew all about it because she asked a lot of questions and her aunt and uncle believed in answering them.Why is the sky blue, auntie? Why are b's and d's like in the mirror? Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.
