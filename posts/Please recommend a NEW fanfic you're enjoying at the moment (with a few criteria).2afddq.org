**** Yeah, the authentic needs to move it a bit along. I like how the story focuses out of the classroom and it puts it as an 11 year old with super powers and doesn't make him an sound and act like an adukt

** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]. First published a year ago, half million words, and then "finished" so that the sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]], could commence. Basically, Sirius breaks out of Azkaban when Harry's 8 and the Dursleys let him take Harry. Slightly AU (Draco has a fraternal twin, Marlene McKinnon is alive, etc.). Lots of legal and political machinations involving the Ministry and Auror department; only romance is between some of the adults right now. I believe Initiate currently has Harry in his first year at Hogwarts, and it's being updated roughly every week or two (last one five days ago). Very high quality of writing in general.

** Some of these might not completely meet your criteria, but here are some new fics that are being updated regularly. The actual new ones are not super-high quality, but they are very enjoyable imo.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305847/1/In-Love-of-Quidditch][In Love of Quidditch]], fem!Harry lives in a world where it's not socially acceptable for women to play Quidditch, she switches places with her twin brother to play anyway.\\
  *Published: Apr 28 - Words: 69,424*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10385204/1/Where-Eagles-Dare][Where Eagles Dare]], Ravenclaw!Harry with a Gryffindor twin and Neville being the BWL. Harry is quite OP and the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but I really enjoy the flow of the narrative. Currently on hiatus as the author is on holiday until halfway through July.\\
  *Published: May 28 - Words: 35,641*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10130558/1/Attack-of-the-Deranged-Mutant-Killer-Monster-Dark-Lord][Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Dark Lord]], a crossover with Calvin & Hobbes. It follows Calvin who gets placed into Hogwarts and his wacky adventures in Hogwarts with Harry & co. Now on hiatus for an unknown amount of time as the author is currently focusing on another work, still worth the read though imo.\\
  *Published: Feb 21 - Words: 124,085*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]], not new, but it is updated regularly and has been regularly updated for a very long time now.\\

  Firebird Trilogy, not new, but it is updated regularly and has been doing that for quite a while now. Published: Oct 21, 2012 - Words: 357,792
#+end_quote

The author, Darth Marrs, has been updating weekly (with very few misses) for years now. Though his is not top-shelf storytelling and though he sometimes reuses tired ideas (an over-reliance on Luna flakes, e.g.), DM is a remarkably dependable writer who puts out serviceable stories--good enough to follow, even if they may go to odd places.

***** A tendency to take an established hetero pairing and add 'sexual free-spirit and roving super seeress soothsayer' Luna in generous sprinkles.

/Luna Flakes (tm)! They're 'sweet and commitment-free'! Add them to your next harem story when the protag is too busy boinking babes to actually use all his new powers to defeat the enemy of the hour./

Wait, just for the clash of personalities there that adds a whole new level of awesome.

Wow. Luna does make everything better :)

** This is a story that I rarely see recommended but is one of my favourites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young To Die]]

The first chapter is not the best but it improves from there and became (at least for me) very emotional towards the end.
