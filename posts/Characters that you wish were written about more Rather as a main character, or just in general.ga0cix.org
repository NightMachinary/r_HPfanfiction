We all have certain characters that we really enjoy, or wish we got more insight into, who are yours?

Some characters I really love, or maybe not love but want more insight into:

Bill Weasley

Arabella Figg

Argus Filch

Amelia Bones

Kingsley Shacklebolt

Alastor Moody

Nymphadora Tonks

Andromeda Tonks

Fenrir Greyback

Regulus Black

Terry Boot

Justin Finch-Fletchley

Alicia Spinnet

Edit: Any recommendations for these characters as main characters or a secondary character would be great.


** Honestly the Flamels were the ones I wanted to know more about the most. I mean they're over 600 years old and you'd think would be insanely talented or knowledgeable about magic and the magical world. I want to hear their opinion on everything the ministry was doing and wished they had a few interactions with them, Harry and Dumbledore. I mean Dumbledore was an apprentice to Nicholas Flamel so I want to read about him talking to and treating Albus like a student. Maybe call him "my boy" a few times or do some eye twinkle, or just witness the master/apprentice relationship between them.

** Percy Weasley and Parvati Patil. Also, Fleur as something other than a love interest/harem girl for Harry and Dean Thomas as something other than a temporary H/G obstacle.

ETA: Rookwood as a Post-War villain. He was an Unspeakable, there's potential there. But it's always the Lestranges, Greyback, Rowle, or the Malfoys that people use.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Nymphadora Tonks

Here you have a witch who has a very unique magical ability, equalling an unending supply of Polyjuice Potion, and she just ends up being an uterus for Remus Lupin in canon. What a waste of an interesting character. Especially the trainwreck that is HBP.

I'm not just talking of the Harry/Tonks pairing; a mentor Tonks, or big sister Tonks can also make really good stories.

Honestly, how is it that Newt isn't involved in fighting Voldemort? He's old, sure. But he is far younger than Dumbledore, and magical people age slower or something. He lives in England, is a close associate of Dumbledore and a brilliant wizard.

And Moody. His death was dissatisfying as fuck. The guy was badass extraordinaire, yet he was killed because we can't have many possible helpful adults alive to steal the limelight from the Golden Trio, can we?

** For me, two characters that had a lot of potential in canon and that got reduced down to their relationship with whoever they ended up with are Fleur and Tonks - and fanfiction generally doesn't do them justice.

For instance, Fleur is a triwizard champion, one of the most accomplished French witches (or, if we use the bad canon approach, Western Continental European - since Beauxbatons also includes Spain, Portugal, Italy, etc) , a part-Veela, /and/ not from Britain - all of which could make her a fascinating character. Instead, canon barely uses her (and badly), and fanfiction often reduces her down to a walking pair of sneering boobs that are misunderstood until super special Harry can pierce through that allure. It's just having her as a prize, when there's a lot more potential to it all.

For Tonks, canon first presents her as obviously competent (being an auror that young is no small feet), funny, lively, and with a metamorphagus ability - which is a pretty unique combination. However, canon then proceeds to define her almost entirely (in my view, at least) with her pining for Lupin (which is hurt for me because I'm not very convinced/don't particularly like that relationship) and subsequent death. She's not that big a fanfiction character - though again, like Fleur, she's often defined just by being a designated partner for Harry that has a special ability that he's the only one that's able to look past and make her instantly melt - which is not a satisfying way to do a relationship ><

After Ginny is possessed by the Dark Lord during her first year at Hogwarts, Luna founds a magical school for girls to explore the ancient art of women's blood magic, defensive magic, and rhetorical diplomacy. She fights the rising tide of darkness with this new brand of old magic, putting her at odds with the Ministry, Hogwarts, and Harry Potter. Luna must choose between traditions when a darker power rises to threaten her brave new world.

Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.
