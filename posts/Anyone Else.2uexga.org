I can almost always download ff.net stories from FicSave, but every time I try to download

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium]]

It never downloads. Could someone here try to download this with FicSave to see if it's just me?


** I just downloaded it fine

** Alternatively, you can use [[http://fanfictiondownloader.appspot.com/][FanFiction DownLoader]]. It seems to work better for me than FicSave.
