For me, the order is only formed during times of need. When Albus needed wands with him to reach Grindelwald. When he realized the disappearances in the seventies were the work of a dark wizard, it was again reformed and then he learned riddle had fallen further than he originally believed. Then again reformed during fourth year when riddle is resurgent.


** That people gathered around the strongest wizard they knew in times of trouble, assuming their assumption of his omnicompetence extended to counter-insurgency.

Dumbledore, not apparently realising there's a sensible course of action here, shaped the group that had gathered around him how he felt they ought to be organised, which was drawn mostly from stuff he'd read in adventure stories for boys he'd read in the 19th Century, bought for him by his mother, who'd made sure he didn't get anything too gory. Or depicting actual military action.

*** I /love/ the second part. Consider that headcanon accepted.

** I suppose we'll see for sure in /Fantastic Beasts/ (if not /CoG/, then in the third or fourth film), but I don't think the Order already existed during Grindelwald's War. I think it was very directly an attempt to create an opposite secret society to fight back the Death Eaters.

*** There may have been some overlap between Grindelwald's war and the first Voldemort war, even so - some of the earliest recruits to the Order in the 1960s-70s were likely people Dumbledore had been aware of as reliable opposition against dark fuckery in the 1940s. The grown up core, as it were, a generation removed from James and Lily and Sirius and such, who would have been barely out of school in the late 1970s.

On the whole I think you're right, the Order doesn't exist (or at least, not as we would recognise it) until Voldemort makes it necessary. But I do think that lessons learned from Grindelwald were important in the earliest stages of the Order's existence.

**** Grindelwald's second-in-command is a Rosier, and we know that Evan Rosier was a Death Eater, and Bellatrix's mother was Druella Rosier.
