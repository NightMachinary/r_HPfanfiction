** I personally like it when the wizarding world is portrayed as vastly different to the muggle world in its traditions. When your world is as good as isolated from the other, the chances of them celebrating the same fests is close to zero.

So Yule instead of Christmas, Samhain instead of Halloween,...

Starting with the Winter Soltice, Yule, the year looks as follows: Imbolc abd Feb.2, Ostara from March 20 to 23, Beltane and Walpurgis ant April the 30, The Summer Soltice, Litha at June 20 to 23. Then Luchnassad on the first of August, Mabon at Sept. 20-23 and in the end Samhain at October the 31st.

In general, the rituals and traditions surrounding these fests go from raucous and celebration of life, beginning from Yule, to more and more silent affairs ending with the honoring of the dead at Samhain.

**** Which makes little sense, the Wizarding World has been isolated from the Muggle word for far to long to celebrate Christmas and Halloween in the fashion its currently done today or the late 90's.

I personally would've liked if J.K Rowling actually went a little broader and deeper with the Magical world, ancient/unique holidays and celebrations have serious potential for worldbuilding.

**** Which made no sense at all. Christmas was a very controversial holiday in (practiced) Christianity for the longest time, and it definitely was during the time the Statute came into play. Halloween is in a very similar situation. And then, why would a society celebrate holidays of a faith that explicitly states that the very existence of witches and wizards is a heretic act against god and they should all burn or hang?

Muggleborns would be a explanation towards why christian holidays are a thing, but we know they aren't exactly the ones calling the shots in wizard society. If I had to explain it, then I'd say that Dumbledore and the Weasleys celebrate christian holidays in order to separate themselves from a culture they associate with Death Eaters and a Grindelwald-like ideology.

I think Rowling wanted to have recognizable holidays in her books. But christian holidays make very little sense in a wizarding community once you look at it with a critical eye and free of the wish to have children recognize it.

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) covers my headcanon true wizarding holidays (I don't see a reason why they would celebrate christmas over the older pagan-y stuff)

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
