Doesn't have to be Harry. I just want some wizards living on the streets.


** Linkffn(Realizations by wishweaver) The Dursleys move to Australia without telling Harry. He copes with finding a new home on his own.

Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them) Harry is abandoned at a park at the age of 4; he survives on the streets until he learns how to live in the woods.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
