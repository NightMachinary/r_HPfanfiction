Something that focuses on how magic works or how the wizarding society works (or both)

Not Harry Potter and the methods of rationality Already read that

I prefer not to read Hermione centric stuff mainly for a change of pace.

I like Ron/Hermione Harmione and Drarry but I really dont care what the ship is as long as the story is more plot based than ship based.


** I'm going to recommend all AU's, as those feature extensive world building by their very nature.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi

Black Luminary by YakAge

Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone

Prince by SallyJAvery

Out of the Night by rainingink

The Mind Arts by Wu Gang isn't really an AU but builds it's own unique interpretation of magic.

**** Yes it is.

However I still believe it is worth the read as it is the only well done Voldemort won AU. The characterization of Voldemort is also incredible. It may not be completed, but the million words that are there are excellent.

** A decade and change old, it remains one of the more original fics, and has aged rather well.

** The Sacrifices arc by lightning on the wave. It starts with Saving Connor and ends with I am also thy brother. Please note that it is about 3 million words long and is HPDM slash. But the worldbuilding is excellent.

edit: the second link is the philosopher king by Red Horse

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.
