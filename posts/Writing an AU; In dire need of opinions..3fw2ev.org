So, this is something that I thought about for quite a while. I really wanted to write a sci-fi Harry Potter thing. Problem: Not even Next Gen is advanced enough for that and I didn't want to do timey-wimey stuff.

So, my story starts with Adolf Hitler in his bunker in 1945, facing his final defeat, cursing everything and everyone, but especially the abomination that he thought was his allie, Grindelwald. Before he offs himself, he arranges for the leaders of the world to get copies of all files the SS and Gestapo collected about the magic world. Its a "lesser evil" thing for him to warn the humans of the magicals.

It starts an avalanche effect. As soon as people (and especially secret service) knew what they were looking for, the picture formed.

The "Humans" (Muggles call themselves humans), form treaties with the other wizard hating species (Goblins and Centaurs) and establish their power over the world by nuclear blasting Grindelwald and Dumbledore to shreds during their duel, invading the magical enclaves and enslaving or killing the halfbreed species that didn't form alliances with the humans beforehand.

The following decades are known as the Age of Magic. Magic becomes a powersource and science, at first equal and with time more important than oil or uranium. In the decades after, with the assistance of the Goblins, the humans establish a tight grip on the magicals. Wands get limiter on them, magical education is strictly regulated and magical children get drilled into their role as providers of power. From an early stage on, magical children get educated in their role of "Cores". Basically, they work as batteries in powerplants.

A selected elite of magicals get trained to work in construction or agriculture, producing more food from single fields than entire countries were able to produce before the use of magic. Or constructing buildings and machines beyond the imagination of most engineers.

The sheer endless powersource and the scientific research of charms, hexes, jinxes and curses, but especially Apparition, Portkeys and the Floo, enable humanity to fly into space much - much sooner. Spaceships use bastardized forms of Cores to function.

There is, of course, resistance in the magical population. James and Lily Potter die while fighting in a rebellion on the side of Tom Riddle. The rebellion never really dies after the point of defeat, but many members of it resign to their lot in life and stay within "Muggle Law". Many because they saw their heros and leaders die, others because those heros and leaders left them responsibilities. In this AU, Harry gets raised by the Black Sisters, together with many others who have lost their parents in the rebellion. Under the cover of being law-abiding, the Blacks de-program the muggle propaganda from the children and teach them offensive and defensive magic, away from the eyes of the muggles.

The true story begins with Harry being invited to an interview. His scores are off the charts in terms of magical power and the NASA and ESA are interested in him to power "Project Exodus". A Colonial ship to another solar system (or galaxy). (At this point I'm thinking about making this a Star Wars crossover, but I'm not sure.) Harry accepts the offer. The plan that forms, however, is to establish a wizarding culture on the planet they're about to colonize. Together with magi-tech prodigy and on-board engineer Hermione Granger, Pilot Ron Weasley and many others his plans do at least have a chance.

So, yea. I find the idea to be fun to write, but I'm always looking for input, suggestions, criticism. Its obviously really AU, and I'm not even sure its HP fanfiction anymore. But then again, its fanfiction, so who cares?

- should I make this a Star Wars crossover?

- do you like the general premise? Why yes? why no?

- would you even read it when this come up at the first chapter?

*** I think the idea with the Star Wars crossover is because I read so much of them lately. But yea, its probably a bit out of place. A bit of worldbuilding of my own would go a long way I guess.

And yes, its definitely dystopian, from the perspective of the wizards. And Harry isn't left alone, not at all. The plans show merely 30 wizards on a ship for thousands. One of those wizards being Harry who is, for the duration of the flight strapped in the reactor of the ship. Command is in the hand of muggles and merely two positions (those which require magicals) on the bridge are filled with magicals. However, the Resistance smuggles in more wizards and witches to usurp the muggles once they arrived at the destination.

** Just because it doesn't follow the books' script doesn't mean it's not fanfiction.

The general premise is quite interesting, though it has the potential to be a very dark fic.

Are the magicals forced to work for the muggles? Or are they brainwashed? It would also be interesting to see the muggles' reaction to magicals being used the way they are; obviously there would be muggles fighting alongside the magical insurgents.

Tom Riddle would be an interesting personality in this case. He was abused by muggles, finds out he is not one of them only to realize that his new position as a wizard would only lead to more abuse - unless he fights them. Perhaps he actually unites the magicals to put aside their differences regarding blood purity and becomes a great leader of the magical resistance and perhaps the magical world in general.

I think it would be easier to make this a firefly-prequel/crossover, though I personally would prefer no crossovers at all. Would definitely give it a shot.

*** I hope its becoming a dark fic.

Yes, the magical√∂s are forced to do it, combined with a propaganda machinery that makes them feel good about it (so to say).

And the muggles know about it. Many of them also demand more rights for magicals (thats all stuff happening on the sidelines). But in the end, the majority loves to pay nothing for energy and food. Something that would be impossible if magicals could actually choose.

Tom Riddle is going to be a legendary, but dead figure of the Resistance. The first Core to actually rebell against his fate. In this AU, he strives on the fact that he is a halfblood. His charme and charisma make him the ultimate leader of the rebells. He got killed in a massive battle that left parts of the american East Coast unihabitable from radiation and lingering curses. You'll often hear Harry say in private conversations that he wants to be like Riddle and his auntie Bella has trained him from early ages to become exactly that.

This part seems ridiculous. Nuking individuals? Talk about overkill, why would the muggle authorities be okay with nuking their own territory? Even as a demonstration of power, nukes are a terrible weapon in a muggle vs. magical conflict because the magical population is interspersed with the muggle population. There's no enemy target to nuke that wouldn't kill more of your own people than theirs. Maybe Hogwarts if you could find it, but you'd still be causing nuclear fallout in your own country and nuking a school isn't really a deterrent so much as a way to make sure the enemy */really/* wants to kill you.

I think it would make the point clear. "Even your most powerful are nothing compared to us. Behold our most dreadful weapon and despair!"

Also, Germany in 1946 was at the mercy of the Allied Forces. If they really wanted to nuke a place, they could. But anyway, its the only nuke that gets dropped in the human vs. magical war. Its a symbol and there'll be mentions of "the cloud" throughout the story. Its synonymous for the callous way in which muggles rule over magicals.

** Damn, son.

I like it a lot, but there are two things that are bugging me.

1) Denarii is right. You might want to look for a better way to off Dumbledore and Grindelwald.

2) I realise that the whole point is having wizards fight for their self-determination etc., but you're treading a very fine line along the plausability index. You need to show exactly why the goblins and centaurs are so dangerous when teamed up with Muggles, because for all intents and purposes, canon suggests a wizarding supremacy. (It might be argued that Muggles aren't exempt from this, depending on how far you want to take the first chapter of HBP.)

It doesn't need to be a Star Wars crossover... unless that's what you want. The way you've described it, I'm sort of expecting a bloody skirmish between the crew after landing, followed by a Colonisation!Fic akin to linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig), just with more dogfights.

Other than that, you had better write this. It sounds sexy as hell and I'd never forgive you for teasing me.

Instead of having them duel, maybe you could have Dumbledore in Germany preparing to duel Grindelwald, but when it becomes apparent that the muggles know about them and are hostile, they take over Berlin together. After a few days of attempting to take back Berlin, the Allied forces fall back. The wizards celebrate their apparent victory. The next day, a single plane flies overhead. The standard anti-bomb wards go up, but are completely unprepared for an atomic weapon.

A nuke is overkill for 2 wizards. It's definitely not overkill for a city full of them.

** I'm not sure how you think the energy would be ... /extracted/, but transfigured nuclear fuel is probably the way to go. The behavior of the waste material when the transfiguration ends might be interesting, so throw more transfiguration at it until it's harmless. Or just throw it into space.

Purely technically, I have to wonder if using magicals as a power source is really the most effective use case.

See also: [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/3/][1]] [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2305#comic][2]], /The Matrix/

Magic can do a lot more than just move things, which is good for your story because there's more to long-term space travel than just getting off Earth (food, water, air, loss of bone density, and so on). Other industrial applications should be numerous. Transfiguration should revolutionize the disposal of all waste, not just nuclear waste. Prototyping new products with transfiguration sounds promising.

The propagation of magical power between generations would be a big question. How can as many people as possible be given magical power? After a while there wouldn't be any muggles to be afraid of wizards, they'd just all have magic. Oppositely, how can the number of people with magical power be carefully controlled?

The upshot of all this is a comprehensive education in science and technology to complement a magical education. They wouldn't just be sealed in the energy pods to harvest their magic in a sort of super-underclass (especially not in the wake of WWII). The magical education wouldn't be the same as Rowling's, but it would exist.

This can probably still be reconciled with your other ideas above, as long as I haven't completely undermined the central conflict. Do make sure there's one of those. I'm a bit biased against a crossover without a really good justification, but if you need Star Wars to provide that conflict, then go for it.

*** I'm going all out Matrix on the wizards. The produced energy is going to be rather abstract I'm afraid. Obviously the idea kind of breaks apart the moment you try to be actually scientific about it. I also don't really have the scientific knowledge to disect this properly.

I'm going to have a magical "elite" that is used for higher demands than just energy production. But only the most promising muggleborns from loyal and upstanding families are cleared for actual scientific education (Mistress of Magical Engineering, Dr.Hermione Granger would be such an example). The rest of the magical population is kept on a low-education basis in order to prevent well organized rebellions.

The rest of your suggestions are pretty good. I pretty sure I won't make it possible for muggles to become magical. But using magic itself through Runes and pre-made Charms is going to be a thing. Also magical education is going to be 50% indoctrination and 50% "Charms and Jinxes to help humanity".

A magical elite is one approach to some things I said. Keep in mind that the "World Government" won't form overnight and you'll have a bunch of independent countries.

To be clear, I didn't literally mean that muggles would become magical, but just that the next generation could be mostly or entirely magical. Maybe the leaked research included gene therapy or similar so that normal births could produce magical children. But again, that verges on being a completely different story where magically-capable humanity goes to space. Still needs a conflict, but it could be interesting.

I see this universe being very Warhammer 40k. If you don't know much about it, basically Psykers in that universe navigate ships through the warp (horrible place that they use for FTL travel), as well as perform other tasks. If they are not employed by the government they are hunted and killed. This AU gives me very similar vibes.

I stumbled into an overpowered stasis charm in 1781 and didn't get out until 2010, none the worse for wear. There's a lot more that you can do aside from popping people out of the stream of time to move them into the future.

Alternatively, you've got some level of magic/muggle integration starting around the space race. A Featherweight Charm on a rocket (and especially rocket fuel) means it's tons cheaper to get to space. Even if that's your only advancement, with a more concerted effort after the 60's, you could get a colony ship built in time. Of course, that only gives you cheaper rockets carrying more cargo, so you'd end up with a generation ship, crawling slowly between stars, reaching Proxima Centauri in twenty thousand years.

So you need to invoke magitech for faster space travel if you want the colony ship to reach anywhere interesting within a reasonable time frame, keeping the same characters.

As an aside, if you want Harry to be the /captain/ of this voyage, and if the selection criteria are what I'd expect, he probably needs 20+ years experience in the air force, which means you'd be setting this in 2020 to 2040. However, you're implying that Harry's selected based on his grades, which means he's fresh out of the academy and it's probably around 2000, so Harry would likely be a very low ranked crew member. You could stage a mutiny to put him in charge, if you want.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No. Star Wars has a universe that's been relatively static for 10,000 years or more. No vast uncharted territories aside from the Uncharted Territories, and those, I feel, have been fixed for ages. No colonization projects. And given the speed of space travel and interstellar communication, you wouldn't send a giant ship and establish a vastly independent colony; you'd send a series of small ships and maintain close ties to your point of origin. But even that is kind of outrageous when you have tens of thousands of planets in the same overarching nation and can emigrate with little trouble, while the local planetary governments and social mores diverge wildly, so if you're unhappy with your current planet you can find a more suitable one that's already developed.

No, Harry gets selected as a powercell, not a Captain. The Captain and much of the crew is muggle. There really is just Hermione Granger as the engineer in charge of controlling the magical part of the Core-Reactor and Ron Weasley who pilots a scouting ship. He, quite literally, is asked if he'd like to power the ship. Well, he's not asked, more ordered to do it, but ESA prefers willing Cores over unwilling so they're polite about it. He's selected because his magic is strong enough to power a colossus of a spaceship such as the Exodus.

And... as others have already said, I think "nuking" Grindelwald and Dumbledore isn't a good idea. Not only because it's unrealistically overkill, they hadn't even tested it yet. That duel is said to have happened in May, before Hiroshima (Aug 6), before the first nuclear test, Trinity (Jul 16). Using an untested weapon is a terrible decision.

** You're going to have to do a lot more to convince me that Muggles have any chance of gaining dominance over wizards, and in particular that magic is something that can be understood by reference to Muggle science.

Your best bet would to be to put some powerful wizards on both sides, and instead of technological counters to magic, have magical counters.

*** The counters are basically magical. The dirty little secret of humanity is that without the help of the Goblins and Centaurs they would have been pretty helpless against the magicals. But global politics make sure to keep both of them happy to keep up the status quo. The Goblins like it the way it is because they can cash in like never before and the Centaurs love it because they can call entire Rainforests their territory.

**** Centaurs taking over is very out of character to me. They are the observers of history and the future, rarely taking an active role. Maybe get a different set of half-breeds, such as the Veela, werewolves, etc that forms a coalition to ally with the muggle governments to help take down the wizards, as well as the goblins. That would give you access to wizard magic on both sides, as well as removing the financial power of the wizarding world.

There would be a desire on the side of muggles afterwards to turn on the coalition, but the power of the goblins that live underneath them would delay any betrayal until they have a solution to the goblins.

Wizards would see view the coalition similarly to the French sympathizers.

** I'll assume you enjoy sci-fi, so have you ever read Alastair Reynolds? He's an amazing sci-fi author, and he does quite a few stories that focus on long distance/duration space flights.

I say this because it might be interesting for the story to take place entirely during the spaceship journey, with the Rebels slowly making a move. Maybe an overt hostile takeover at some point? Help from some of the 'humans' (parents of muggleborn maybe)?

Maybe, Harry is the only wizard on the ship just as the power source. I don't know why they would let other wizards be in positions of power(pilot, engineer, etc). A rebel ship could board them (Look at me, I'm the astronaut now!).

I guess this might make it a bit darker/more disrepair than you're original plan. But it could be interesting.

And no, don't make it a Star Wars crossover.

** Sounds great. Don't make it a crossover though. There's so much going on that making it into a crossover will ruin the very interesting and unique plot you've come up with. Looking forward to reading this once you're done. You should definitely put a link here!

*** Yes, I began writing a similar one, but its taking a backseat to my main story and my HP x Fallout crossover.

Here it is.
