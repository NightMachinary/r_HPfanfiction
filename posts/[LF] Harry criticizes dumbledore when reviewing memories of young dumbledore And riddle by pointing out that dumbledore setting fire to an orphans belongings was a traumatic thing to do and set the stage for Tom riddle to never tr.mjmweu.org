*** /To Reach Without/ was the one. If I remember correctly Melantha (who was Harry up until the summer after fourth year, but after the graveyard wished he wasn't Harry Potter anymore, which accidental magic makes true by turning him into a girl) argued that to little Tom, who bullied the other kids to make them stop bullying him, Dumbledore, someone much more powerful than him, setting his possessions on fire, sent him the message that bullying definitely worked, regardless of Dumbledore's intentions.

I think there was another fic I saw with a similar part, though I can't recall the details, sorry. I think it was a 5th or 6th year fic, with a normal Harry, but after the events of the books had less trust/respect for Dumbledore.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.
