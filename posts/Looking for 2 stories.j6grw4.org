:END:
Hi, I'm looking for two different stories. The first one is a Harry/Hermione story. Hermione is an inventor and Harry is undercover at some sort of couples resort. Harry asks Hermione to go with him and pretend to be together so he can spy on who he is watching. One night they have to play cards with him and they must kiss for good luck before each play. When they get together for real, Ron says its about time. The second fic I am looking for is a Ron/Hermione story. Hermione works at St Mungos as a researcher along with someone named Gus who she eventually dates and goes to dancing lessons with. Ron works with magical creatures. He is also dating someone else who he ends up breaking up with. He gets called to deal with creatures who can only be resisted by being truly in love with someone. Hermione thinks that he is in love with his ex but he comes to tell her that he loves her at Harry and Ginnys wedding.
