preface:so this is my first time on reddit, so I don't know if this is the right place to post this or anything

I'm looking for a tom riddle/hermione fanfic that I read some time ago and can't remember the title of details I recall: there's a scene where hermione sends Riddle an anonymous valentines day card that when he opens it releases singing cupids that sing an embarrassing song about Riddle's looks -I think the words "tight buttocks" are sang- and Riddle gets angry and blows them up when people start laughing. he then does some kind of tracing spell to find out that hermione gave him the card.

I would have read it on fanfiction.net

any assistance appreciated as this is driving me nuts, thanks!


** I'm a pretty avid Tomione fic reader, but I haven't read anything like that. Let me know if you find out the title!
