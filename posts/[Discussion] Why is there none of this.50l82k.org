*** My request for HP giant squid smut is the most upvoted request thread on this subreddit and I got no good recommendations. So I got nothing.

Except for one where Harry turns evil, shags Hermione and Ginny then tentacle rapes Luna, but I can't remember the title of that. Think it was on ao3 though.

BRB gotta go explain recent browsing habits.

** I have a story where there could be an eldritch sexual being in my anthologies(the terminator/HP one). I've yet to see it either. thankfully. There is one in one story, though, Tim, In Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood. Oh, also in Nonjon's A Black Comedy, Harry could likely use his 'arms' for such shenanigans.

** I think something like that did happen... What was it? I think, a fic about Harry being a metamorph and being kind of ashamed of his desire to use those powers in his sex life with Hermione... And then I think she scolds him or something, and he uses vines...? Something like that.
