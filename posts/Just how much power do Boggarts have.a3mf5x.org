If a Boggart Dementor can make someone sad and relive their worst memories, could a Boggart Basilisk kill someone with their eyes?


** No, but I bet it could petrify them.

... that would be a fun elseworld to explore. Harry doesn't meet a dementor on the train, so his worst fear is actually the basilisk. All students in the room along with Remus are petrified for the rest of the year.

** That depends on how hard the Basilisk's magic is to replicate. Boggarts basically have no limit but size on their physical forms, but they'll still keep their own magic; so they can /imitate/ other beings' magic, but it'll just be approximation.

Hence the second /PoA/ Boggart could give off cold and an unpleasant aura as a Dementor, but Dementors' aura of /crushing despair/ is unique to them and the Boggart couldn't really do it. Similarly, a single Boggart sure as heck can't replicate the magic of the freaking Moon, so the first /PoA/ Boggart's Moon form didn't cause Professor Lupin to transform.

But in much the same way that an Elf pretending to be a wizard could "Pop" to imitate a wizard Apparating, Boggarts /can/ probably replicate a lot of other magical effects.

(Also, I have the headcanon that the reason only /Riddikulus/ works on them is that they absorb all other spells you cast at them and can rerelease them to improve their wizard disguises; so a Boggart whom someone had tried to /Avada Kedavra/ for some reason could, if it ever had to turn into Voldemort, land a Killing Curse. But this is just my theory.)

** Is it cannon that the boggart as a dementor has dementor-like patterns, or is it just Harry's reactions?

** Was the dementor boggart really emitting an aura, or was it just Harry's natural panic at seeing one? I always thought it was the latter.

** I don't think a boggart's magic is enough to make the gaze kill or petrify, but it might be able to cause some "minor" distress (dizziness/pain in the eyes/whatever). I think even petrification magic is far too powerful for a Boggart to be able to replicate.

** Boggarts imitate. So it can imitate things but they are not permanent. So while it can imitate the dementors aura, and make someone relive their worst memories, when it came to sucking out their soul it wouldn't be able to "literally" suck out their soul, but simply imitate the process. So the person would not actually lose their soul but it would be damn terrifying that's for sure.

So, logically it would be able to imitate a basilisks stare, but not actually cause death. So if anything it could only petrify. However, I would argue it couldn't even do that, and instead what would occur is you would collapse and blackout (as if you suddenly died) but would be able to be easily revived by an innervate or whatever.

** My theory is that boggarts form a connection with a wizard, and on top of taking on the form of what you fear, they induce non-visual flashbacks of sort. Harry vividly remembers the chill of a dementor, so he "feels" it with the boggart. Lupin might feel the full moon without transforming and Hermione, if her fear had been the Basilisk, might have frozen in place as if she were petrified, without the actual petrification. It's nothing but the placebo effect turned up to the max.
