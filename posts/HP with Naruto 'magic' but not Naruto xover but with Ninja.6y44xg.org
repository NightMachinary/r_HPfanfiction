So I've been trying to find this story for a while but can't seem to find it.

- Harry grows up with Dursleys, and he 'invents' Naruto ninja magic. He is curious if there are any ninja in RL or it's just him.
- There are Ninja in this world but not Naruto ninja. One Ninja clan has just begun a deal with Lucius Malfoy which includes having the ninja-apprentice nephew of a Japanese Quidditch player attend Hogwarts (arranged by Malfoy with Dumbledore's approval, though he doesn't know about the ninja).
- On the first trip to Diagon Alley Harry detects or is detected by a Ninja who invites him (henged as an old man?) to his shop. On the way Harry Kawarimi's with his clone so the real Harry goes. He detects the Ninja stationed on the rooftops. The Ninja threatens Harry, but he ignores it and leaves without any of the Ninja knowing how.
- On Platform 9/3, Harry (hended as old man) speaks to the aforementioned Ninja and the nephew in Japanese. They are scared of his skill.
- In the forbidden forest, Harry (henged) spars with the ninja-kid while using an animated-metal-spider-thing, but treats it as fun, the kid needs time in a healing bath to heal up for school.

Can't think of any other scenes, but even knowing those it was hard to search for. Thanks for the help!


** Pretty sure it's linkffn(of Wands and Kunai) or something similar.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.

** The only story I can think of off the top of my head which has Naruto-inspired elements without any actual crossover is linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope by OnTheImportanceOfLungs).

There's also linkffn(Kaleidoscope of Magic by karldin) but I only found that while searching for the first one and have no idea if it's any good.

*** It seems I was mistaken. The story I was looking for was labelled as a crossover even though it's only with him finding a Naruto manga without any actual characters / world history. Both your recommendations are a bit darker than I usually read, though the first seems quite interesting. Thanks!

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.
