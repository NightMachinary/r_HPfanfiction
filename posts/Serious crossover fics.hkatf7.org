No hurt/comfort fics or badly written romance fics or anything like that Fics where Harry is thrown into a new dimension are preferable but anything works so long as it has proper world building and good writing No slash or fem Harry No bashing


** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), both worlds exist in the same world, just don't interact. Pretty dark and gritty. Has some spelling mistakes, but they're pretty rare.

linkffn(To Train A Dragon Rider), MoD Harry travels to AlagaÃ«sia and takes up Brom's quest when Brom dies.

** Child of the storm is a good one, Harry is the son of Thor in the MCU. The author has the best world building I've seen in fanfiction, and it is a really long story. There's also a sequel.
