I can't remember anything about the title but I do remember a few scenes. It's a DH fic where the gang is living and horcrux hunting of Grimauld Place.

Draco gets sent there for his own protection and after a while starts helping them with the hunt, and on one mission where he and Harry sneak out together he uses a steel pipe as his only defence.
