** I recommend Recnac Transfaerso. Harry isn't in Slytherin and there isn't Severitus strictly speaking, but Snape does act as a mentor for him later on and really grows to care about him. It also explores the psychological consequences of abuse really well. My heart aches horribly for Harry throughout.

The writer also has a shorter story in Dudley's POV where he finally realizes his parents are abusing Harry and wants to help him.
