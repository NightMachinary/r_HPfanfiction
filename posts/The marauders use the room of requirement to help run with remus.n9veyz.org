One day, ine ofnthe marauders. And mentions it (possibly todsing a banned item into hmthe lost things room) this reminds james of a time iin first year where he encountered the room. So they start a search, and one night, before the full moon james or sirius happens to be pacing thinking about remus. And forms the perfect place.to bring remus on full moon. Nights.

This could range from simple 0 danger to anyone as the room locks the werewolf in the room to morning. Or the room blocking the curse inside, or even getting remus cures, or even have his werewolf be beneficial, if he learns to control it.


** In debt of time Hermione takes Remus to the room and has it put them in an illusion of a forest on a full moon night so he can enjoy the moonlight. It's certainly an under-utilised option for safe transformations certainly.

With a room like that the shrieking shack and whomping willow seem quite silly.

**** yeah, it's a lovely concept. I think she just drags him in there in the story who's isn't really how I'd do it, but it is certainly a way to use the room which I really like
