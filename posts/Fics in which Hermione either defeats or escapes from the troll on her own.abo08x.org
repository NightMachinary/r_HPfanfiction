*The Background:* You know the drill: Harry, Ron, and/or Hermione might be sorted into different Houses from canon, or not attend Hogwarts in the first place, or have completely different backgrounds. It might be a heavy AU, and the very nature of magic might be different. None of it matters. Hermione /must/ be in those toilets at the appointed hour, and she /must/ face the troll, and then she /must/ either be rescued or be killed or severely injured.

In a sizeable minority of fics that still have a troll, Hermione avoids it by being elsewhere at the time (which is probably the most sensible consequence of most pre-Hogwarts or early-Hogwarts divergences). In some time-travel fics, it's an older and more skilled Hermione, in a younger body, facing the troll.

*The Request:* I am looking for fics in which a troll is let into Hogwarts in 1991 and the 12-year-old Hermione does encounter it, but in which she then proceeds to either defeat it or escape from it, either on her own or with only minimal help from others. She may or may not do it while rescuing someone else from the troll. Whether it's because of some explicit divergence, alternative universe, or even by complete accident, anything goes, short of a time-travel-style personality rewrite.

*My Search So Far:* I can't think of a single fic in which that happens, except for some vague memories of crack one-shots. I can understand why it's so rare: it requires both visiting a Station of Canon and diverging from it severely at the same time. The closest examples both involve time travel of some form, but not by Hermione herself:

- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa), in which Hermione sends her past self a care package.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), in which it is Harry who goes back in time, and Hermione is forewarned about the troll.

  All the snips for a, after plenty of votes and likes, new fic that is coming out. A spin-off of Tantric is Magic. A SFW fic where Hermione Hebert goes to Hogwarts and learns the magic of the natives. A good deal of the context can be found here...http://archiveofourown.org/works/11508537/chapters/25824003None of these will be in any particular order, but I hope you enjoy it anyway!

  Taylor and Lisa, after shenanigans that led to them being planted in another dimension almost forty years in the past...have settled down. Had their fun. Done their time...and had a daughter of their very own.Now, its Hermione Hebert's turn to shine in the spotlight...hopefully, not quite as brightly as her mother and father did. She isn't that type of girl! For the full context required, read this.http://archiveofourown.org/works/11508537/chapters/25824003

**** Had that been the problem, it could have still been a good fic. A Hermione who is a high-functioning psychopath is an intriguing reenvisioning of the character and one that isn't actually that big a divergence from her early-to-mid-canon personality.

This fic has, shall we say, /other elements/, including, but not limited to, Dumbledore-bashing, Hermione irrationally attaching herself to Harry, and, from what I heard, some later weirdness with Diary!Riddle.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
