This is probably a long shot! I don't really have enough time in my day to read fanfic, but I love listening to podcasts, audio books, etc while I do other things. Are there any good recorded fanfics? I have listened to a bit of that James Potter one but didn't really care for it much


** There are two (long) fics I know of with good audiobook reads. Unfortunately I can't wholeheartedly recommend either.

There's the HPMOR podcast for Methods of Rationality. The guy who reads it is a good narrator and is an interesting person, but this is his first audiobook so it takes a while to hit his stride. The actual fic is....."eh." at best. If the story grabs you you'll like it but it meanders quite a bit from it's original premise.

There's also Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, which has a number of problems. First of all it's not complete yet, second of all the narrator for the first 10 chapters is not as good as the author who takes over for the rest of the fic. The fic itself is..well also "eh" at best. Cool ideas and world building, but very very slow pacing, weird "politics" that has no resemblance to politics in any place or time in human history, and some really, truly uncomfortable overtones about grooming.

Like you, I wish there were more podfics, but this is the best I've found so far.

**** Well if you like Eneaz reading rationalist fiction, he does a Superman fic called "The Metropolitan Man" that's A+ in both writing and voice work.

** I almost exclusively listen to audio recordings of fanfics. In order to do so I convert fics through text-to-speech with [[http://www.fromtexttospeech.com/][fromtexttospeech]] or Ivona reader (when available).

I remember it was pretty jarring at first, but now that I'm used to it, I actually prefer some TTS voices over certain voice actors.

I've got about 100 GB of Harry Potter fics and another 150 GB of Worm fics. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to upload them though. Would the authors take offence? And I think there might be some restrictions on what the TTS services allow you to do with the files.

*** Is this method better than the built in TTS on the FFN.net app? I've tried using that and I just tune out after a while. The consistent errors also get to me after a while. Only so many time I can hear "Mr. Weasley" pronounced as "Mister. (Long pause) Weasley." as the app can't deal with periods when they aren't full stops.

**** I've never tried the FFN.net app, but it sounds like they are far better. There are only a few consistent mistakes with Ivona (I use the "Amy" voice) and FTTS ("Alice" as selected voice). I rarely bother correcting them (it's a short list of words, like Beauxbatons, portkey etc.), with one exception; if the author write three dots and no space between the words "like...this", it comes out as "like DOT DOT DOT this" in the audio file, so that has to be edited before I convert.

I also speed up the audio file to 1.25-1.45, but that's probably up to personal preference.

***** I use the Amy voice too! It's the best one I could find. If you are on iOS there's a great app called Voice Dream Reader which lets him pick dozens of voices (via in app purchases) and import ePub from ffnet or ao3 really easily. Do this while driving sometimes.

** I'm working on audiobooks of Inverarity's Alexandra Quick series and post them via [[http://samgabrielvo.com/alexandraquick][this podcast.]] [[http://www.samgabrielvo.com/alexandraquick/feed/podcast/][(RSS link here)]] I upload three chapters a week, and the entire first book (of four) is recorded and edited, but not completely posted yet. It will finish in late November, followed by book two!

** I havent't listened to them myself, but I know Mugglenet Audiofictions are still archived and available on their site. I also found an audio version of Turn [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1162544/chapters/2362570][here]], recording is not as good as a 'normal' audiobook but I found the fic great (haven't gotten around to listening more than a few minutes, but I've read the fic multiple times. Is Drarry though, in case you don't like that).
