I mean, aside from the fairy tale wish fulfillment angle there's absolutely no logical reason why anyone aside from Dumbledore and his closest confidants would possibly believe that a TODDLER could vanquish the Dark Lord. A more believable narrative would be the feat being attributed to Lily on the grounds that she was the only other person in the room who had a wand, thus she probably managed to pull a mutual kill with Voldemort and the collateral damage was due to the power she had to put behind whatever she cast to take him down with her.

And if Dumbledore knew the truth but intentionally covered it up, it'd fit nicely with the idea of him having wanted Harry to grow up humble, rather than entitled with delusions of grandeur.


** I've always thought it was obvious why they attributed it to Harry.

At least Harry's a half-blood.

I don't see, with how prejudiced Wizarding society is (even Molly seems a bit prejudiced in a condescending way towards non-magicals at times) that they'd /accept/ the idea that Lily did it. Dumbledore does, but he's Dumbledore.

Even in the 90s, telephone technology was far better than floo and owl communication. Wizarding medical tech is better in many ways if you listen to Rowling, but we don't outside fanfic see things like LASIK. Muggles win hands down on pure destruction, while wizards win handily on guerilla warfare.

It's why the 'Muggle vs Wizards' argument amuses me. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and so many people ignore or deprecate one for the other.

Magic, at least in canon, clearly works on a full immunity basis (IE a flameproof charm will either not work at all or completely ignore any fire no matter how hot). Even if we ignore things from fanfic's/ logical next steps from Rowlings words, wizards still have zero threat from Muggles. Are they completely advanced in every way? No just almost every way. There's places where Muggles have caught up or are going to catch up and outdo magic. But Muggles vs Wizards debate, if going from Canon is a firm and no diff win by Wizards.

But literally how could Muggles win? They can't know who they're fighting because of Obviation. Even if the statue of secrecy broke and no one bothered to recreate it, how could Muggles organize? There's no way that a single imperius wouldn't subvert the entire system against Muggles. No security system that can stop teleporting wizards that can just make walls disappear with a flick of their wand. Thats why as a collective wizards would beat muggles.

In canon, magic doesn't have an x number before it stops working. Either it works or it doesn't work. There are spells that stop projectiles. A singular muggle would need to either ambush an unaware witch/wizard with a gun or attack them in melee while dodging spells. It is heavily stacked against the muggle. Not as heavily as a group of Muggles vs a group of wizards but still vastly in the wizards favor.

********** Obliviation doesn't work on cameras. Even in the 1990s, London had one of the /densest/ CCTV coverages in the world. It's also said in the Fantastic Beasts books that you cannot normally Obliviate more than one person at a time. (The NYC thing was a very special situation). No 'I obliviate everyone in the room!' fanfic stuff. There was Internet in the 90s, I had a dialup Internet line in '92. And universities and governments were connected even back then. Data travels.

Teleportation needs you to know the target location. You can't 'teleport to the other side of the wall' or other stuff.

Imperius only 'subverts the entire system' if you assume muggles are idiots. Yes, they can cause havoc, but they aren't going to tear down the system. All the big things have failsafes and checks and balances. It's unclear how many people one person can Imperius, but the 'Imperius Chain' the books hint at won't work with muggles, anyway.

Protego can certainly block at least small bullets, as it can block the force of things like Bombarda, which likely has a lot more force than a bullet (though we do get into whether a bullet's piercing changes things). However, shields can be broken, and once you start pulling in burst fire weapons (I'm not going to into fully automatic fire as you do NOT use that outside certain situations or in Hollywood. You're throwing bullets away.)

Yes, wizards can 'blast through' walls. This is also very much obvious. And again, no AoE Obliviates, those are actually anti-canon (Again, see Newt).

In a war, it would likely end with one side winning for a while then the other side recovering, and you'd end up with a terribly bloody guerilla war where the wizards can strike easily but can't win and the muggles can strike back when they discover where a wizard is.

Think a magical Vietnam war. No one would win.

If you're taking Fantastic Beasts into account that oblivation is just straight up near omni-potent; it doesn't just erase memories but also physical evidence that would contradict those memories.

Even not taking it into account it's shown in canon that oblivatiors aren't idiots and thoroughly cleanse evidence.

The big failsafes and checks wouldn't work against wizards. The imperius is literally perfect; a deep-cover mole essentially thats keyed in all the security systems, knows all the passwords and checks, ect.

If you mean multiple parties would be on the lookout; how would anyone not a wizard know someone is imperiused? There is no sign if the orders include to give no sign.

Thats not even mentioning that in canon wizards /already have/ infiltrated the top levels of every government and change things at their pleasure and whim without anyone stopping them; the /British/ MoM managed to get the president of the USA to "forget" a telephone call to the PM.

Why do you assume Bombarda is just a regular explosion? It's magic. So is the protego. They don't work on anything resembling our understanding of science. There has never been any indication whatsoever that non-magical things would strain a protego. You made that up. There /IS/ however indication that magic works on an immunity basis; either a spell works and protects against everything it can handle or it doesn't. I can buy magic breaking magic. I cannot buy that same magic that ignores our understanding of reality suddenly being as obedient to the limits of physics as our muggle equivalents of shields are and breaking under repeat strain of bullets.

In a war it ends when the wizards get their hands on the chain of command and nuke all of the muggle world into hell. Which they already would have before any theoretical fight even started.

This only really starts happening over halfway through the story, so be warned about that (though it is all pre-hogwarts).

Mr Cunning McControlsTheGovernment Malfoy casts the most illegal spell in the country on a child in a school outside the office of a member of government. Moody agrees to the Seven Potters plan. Dumbledore doesn't think to interrogate the supposed double agent in his secret vigilante group to find out exactly what he told the still-free-and-plausibly-active Death Eaters about them. For some reason, the Goblins control the economy. The Parselmouth with a Muggleborn mother and a Muggleborn best buddy who's shown no prior interest in anything but said people and Quidditch is suddenly believed to be a bigoted petrify-er. Their jailors are Dark Creatures who (IIRC) joined Voldemort in the last war and they're still gainfully employed.

To check vis a vis your request, are you specifically wanting fics where it's always believed James/Lily were the ones to defeat Voldemort, or where it's revealed or otherwise advocated for later on? (eg. Postwar Harry tells everyone to stop making a fuss, it was all his mother's doing).

** There's a fic where Hermione time travels and ends up there that night, Lily dies and James survives, and she tells them to say it's Lily that should be celebrated. It's eventually a Hermione/James story, I can't remember the title but it was quite good :)

** If someone can remind me of the name of a fic about Lily taking care of Harry and Hermione in what is essentially a ghetto a la WWII run by Death Eaters as Voldemort rules the country. I believe Sirius was a spy (his pureblood background and family help with this) and Sirius, James, and Snape work to rescue Lily. The fic begins with a journalist going to interview Lily about how she defeated Voldemort and being surprised at how broken down such a young woman is, from the starvation and depravations of war.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** I prefer leaving Voldemorts death a mystery, and Harry's fame stems from him surviving. Most people believe that either James, Lily, or both did something to ensure Harry's survival, and a few attribute it to God.

Later, when the whole Chosen One(tm) starts picking up speed, Voldemort's defeat its retroactively, and mistakenly, attributed to Harry.

Essentially, it comes down to what prejudices they carry.
