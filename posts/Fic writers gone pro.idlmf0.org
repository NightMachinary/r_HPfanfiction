Out of interest, do you know of any HP writers gone pro?

I remember when I first got into fanfic reading about a Drarry (I think) writer who had gotten a book deal and (I think) had taken her works down, but it's hazy. Just wondered if there were any others.


** You might be thinking of Cassandra Clare, who wrote the quintessential Draco in Black Leather Pants, and went on to write The Mortal Instruments series, none of which I have ever read

** Cassandra Clare and her “[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Draco_Trilogy][Draco Trilogy]]” are certainly the big one. Eliezer Yudkowsky of /HPMoR/ fame has also published some original fiction, I believe, but he had already published /non/fiction before he started /HPMoR/, and all in all /HPMoR/ is more one aspect of his overall idiosyncratic career than what launched it.

[[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][G. Norman Lippert]]'s fame was certainly bolstered by the well-regarded oddities that are his /James Potter/ books, also.

Also... /tips hat shyly/ I have a story in [[https://www.arcbeatlepress.com/probe.html][this book]]. What feels like a lifetime ago, I was writing the moderately-well-regarded /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/. Which I still plan on picking up again at some point, but if any reader of mine was wondering where I'd been, that is more or less where. (That, and more stuff that hasn't been announced yet.)

*** Any idea where we can find the Draco trilogy and the James Potter stories?

***** Oops yes the Draco ones are PDFs at the bottom

The links on the James Potter ones went to an unpurchased domain though :(

**** Hey, just saw this.

You can find a link to download the James Potter ebooks at their Goodreads pages (first one [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2548866.James_Potter_and_the_Hall_of_Elders_Crossing][here]].)

** Apparently, *The Sinister Man* (author of "/Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/") recently published his first original novel. But the most famous example is probably *E. L. James* who wrote Twilight fanfics before publishing "/50 Shades of Grey/" and its sequels.

** Sarah Rees Brennan and Naomi Novik both wrote Harry/Draco fic. Of course, Novik has written for a ton of fandoms and is one of the founders of Archive of Our Own, so she's a bit of a powerhouse. Her novel /Spinning Silver/ was nominated for several fantasy genre awards, and at one point Peter Jackson optioned /Temeraire/, her "dragons during the Napoleonic Wars" series for a possible movie.

** Gone pro with fanfic? Isn't that considered plagiarism?

*** Copyright/trademark infringement, anyway --- I'm not sure if the exact charge would be "plagiarism". But OP isn't asking about fanfic writers who tried to publish /their fanfic/ for money; rather, they're asking about fanfic writers who later wrote original fiction commercially, drawing to one extent or another on the /experience/ they racked up in the fanfic world.

(Although there's always the trusty option of keeping a lot of the structure and characterization of your AU fic while changing the names and designs; depending on how far your original fic was from canon, the result can be pretty hard to recognize as fanfic-based, and it's certainly not illegal. Would you guess [[https://www.deviantart.com/twisted-wind/art/Oz-Abraham-Van-Helsing-838756151][this]] is a rebrand of a character from a /Mickey Mouse/ fancomic?)

** Jbern wrote some very good HP fics like 'the lie I've lived' and 'a bungle in the jungle'. He published several books under his name: Jim Bernheimer. The most memorable for me was the D-list supervillain series.
