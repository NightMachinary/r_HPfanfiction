*I always ramble. Tl;dr at the end*

So I've got a fic sort of simmering on the backburner of my brain, and it looks like patronuses are going to feature pretty heavily. Not like as a central plot point, but they'll show up on the regular. It takes place around Harry's infancy to start off, and Marauders and co. will all be around.

It's been a while since I read the books and I never got involved in Pottermore, so I'm doing some research to refresh my memory. I know it's hardly a surprise when it comes to Potterverse-lore, but I feel like the rules behind patronuses dont make a huge deal of sense? Like, if a patronus can alter based on the happy thoughts behind them (like when Tonk's turned into a werewolf) - then wtf does Remus have a wolf patronus? You'd think his feelings towards wolves would be the opposite of happy. And I know you can mess with animal symbology to suit just about any need, but name and affliction aside Lupin doesn't seem very 'wolfy'. I always felt that contrast was part of his characterization.

Also, if Lily's patronus became something representative of James out of love, then why did Snape's also become... something representative of James (out of love for Lily - wat?).

Do you think people's patronuses should always align with their anamagi-form up until they change out of love for someone? What about afterwards? Like I doubt if Snape became an anamagi when he was 30 he'd have turned into a doe, you know? If a patronus can change based on things like the thoughts used to fuel the spell, then would it make sense for people to have multiple patronus forms throughout their lives?

So basically what I'm wondering is how do you guys, as the general fic-reading public, feel about authors playing around with HP lore? Nothing huge - I was thinking of suggesting that Lily's patronus matched James's anamagi form due to their natural compatability rather than the Power of Love, for example. Hell, maybe James became a stag because he was so into Lily in the first place. I was also thinking of making (some of) the Marauder's patronuses not just match their anamagi form by default - or at least changing Remus's to be something other than a wolf. What sort of alternative forms do you guys think might make sense?

Anyway I'm probably overthinking this a bit and in the grand scheme of things these would be very small changes in a big AU. Just wondering what your guy's thoughts are on the matter :)

*tl;dr Patronus rules dont make sense to me. If an author fucks around with HP lore a bit does it drag you out of the story? How much fucking around is acceptable to you? Any ideas for alternative patronuses for MWPP?*

((Also I know that Lily's patronus was 'always a doe', but I'm curious about the canoninity of James's. Was it confirmed in PoA that it was a stag? I really need to reread the series but I suck lol.))


** Dunno if this is helpful, but before we got obviously contradictory information, I had this headcanon that a person's patronus form took on the shape that represented a person they saw as a protector--James' personality was a stag, Harry saw his dad as a protector, ergo his patronus was a stag (but James' wouldn't be!) (Having Harry's patronus as a doe would, I think, be even better seeing as Lily was the one who stood between him and Voldemort.)

As such, a patronus could change if a person's ideal protector changed; a teenager's is likely to represent their parent, but an adult's is more likely to represent their partner, closest friend, or a mentor. Also in this case, a patronus does not match a person's animagus form, except in a few cases. Voldemort, trusting no one but himself, would be the sort to have his animagus and patronus forms be the same.

Feel free to use this theory if you want something to base your patronus ideas on.

*** That's my take on it as well. Albus Dumbledore's patronus was a phoenix, probably reflecting his trust in Fawkes. His brother Aberforth's was a goat or ram, which given his odd proclivities hinted at elsewhere might represent his primary symbol of love and affection - or it might mean that Aberforth considers Albus the goat.

In Remus Lupin's case, his father was the strongest influence in his life, and the Lupin name comes from Latin for wolf - oh, such irony.

If you are talking about canon, that is definitely not how it works in canon. It is shaped by a person's character. There are three known way for a Patronus to change, "bereavement, falling in love or profound shifts in a person's character." Those three can honestly probably be condensed to just changing because of a shift in a person's character. Bereavement and falling in love can both shift a persons persoanlity.

It's gonna be different for everyone. Do what you like. If you're writing for the masses, I don't really have any advice because people have different preferences.

I highly recommend changing how an animagi's animal is chosen or how a patronus is formed if this is what you decide to do. It's a fairly safe bet to say that a person's animagus form will match their patronus because it appears that the animal chosen for an animagus is also based on personality.

*** Thanks for your input :) To respond to the first bit there, that was what I always thought too! But while I was looking around I found this quote from a LiveChat JKR did like 10 years ago:

#+begin_quote
  *Chely:* James patronus is a stag and lilys a doe is that a coincidence? *J.K. Rowling:* No, the Patronus often mutates to take the image of the love of one's life (because they so often become the 'happy thought' that generates a Patronus). /(src: [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][J.K. Rowling and the Live Chat, Bloomsbury.com, July 30, 2007 (2.00-3.00pm BST)]])./
#+end_quote

Honestly it seems like JKR has so many ideas and bits of lore that didn't make it directly into the books that it's not unusual to see alternative canon pop up here and there. I cant think of any specifics but I feel like there have been instances of this happening before.

****** I read it as you implying the personality shift isn't involved and it is just happy thought, if that isn't what you meant, apologies. But that quote does not mean the happy thought is what directly affects what the corporal patronus is, is what I am getting at, which is how it appears you are reading it. What it means is that it is the happy thought that allows you to produce a corporal patronus is what I am getting it and is what canon states.

I wouldn't be surprised if the happy thought can fundamentally alter your personality at the time of casting to produce a different patronus, but happy thought isn't the main focus of what shape the patronus takes.

** In regards to Lupin's patronus being a wolf: I've read several fics which follow the idea that the werewolf curse fundamentally alters a wizard's magic. From the time that they contract the curse, any animal form that their magic could take will always be their wolf form. So a werewolf would have a wolf animagus form and a wolf patronus.

*** My battery is about gone, so I'll have to look it up and confirm later on, but I'm a good 85% sure JKR said it was a mundane wolf and would always have been one, because both he and they are so family-oriented.

Interesting theory, though. I like it.

** I think it's very likely that Lily was able to cast a Patronus much earlier than James or Severus, and likely before James got his Animagus form, since canon suggests that she was gifted in Charms. Both men's Patronuses suggest love for her, and it's possible her feelings toward them influenced the form each Patronus took: James as a potential mate and Severus as her best friend (someone she equated with herself, not as a love interest).

Unrequited or otherwise life-altering love affects Patronuses in canon. Tonks' jack rabbit changes to a wolf for Lupin, while Hermione's Patronus is an otter (Ron Weasley lives in St. Ottery, otters and weasels are both mustelids). Ron's Patronus is also shaped for Hermione - terriers chase otters across water, which is pretty funny when you think about their first kiss in the movie version of Deathly Hallows (the terrier connection was online awhile ago, not an original realization). Ginny's horse is beautiful and represents freedom, but it's strange that it's not really a match for Harry's stag. If one of the Marauders experienced a life-altering event, their Patronus would change. I'd guess Peter wouldn't be able to cast one after taking the Dark Mark.

I think if there's a reason for bending HP lore within a fic that is consistent with the fic's theme/AU, then I'm not bothered by it at all. The key for me is consistency and purpose. If you have a good reason for switching Patronus forms that works within the story, then go for it.

**** Possibly! But I think Lily must have been able to as she's stated to have always had a doe patronus in the books. It probably would have made sense for Sirius and James to as well, since The Order seems to have used them for carrying messages and they're known to have been talented wizards. Maybe it's more complicated than prohibitively difficult, seeing as DA all picked it up (from what I remember) with proper instruction?

** My biggest gripe with the whole patronus stuff is that dementors feast on happiness and yet are driven away by a Patronus. Fixing this isn't really difficult, just assume that Dementors feast on misery and have an aura which suppresses happiness. They can't stand happiness and positive emotions in general, therefore a Patronus drives them off.

This is said in canon, more or less. The purpose of draining happiness is to create a general despair (which also allows them to breed). According to Lupin in PoA, the reason the Patronus works is because it has no negative memories as part of itself so the Dementor cannot feed on it.

**** ([[/u/Hellstrike]], this is of interest to you too)

The solution I've found to this conundrum is that Dementors' feeding works opposite to Legilimency: they can only take your happiness and happy memories if you're /not/ thinking about them. So they make you the opposite of happy (e.g. miserable) so that your consciousness leaves your happiness "unguarded", and then feed on it. Patronuses are concentrated happiness with nothing else to be distracted towards; they're the embodiment of the happiness /fightning back/, in fact.

*** I tend to think of “happiness” like warmth to a dementor. Dementors are incredibly cold, they make everything around them cold, and they constantly seek out any warmth they can find. A Patronus, however, is so concentrated and intense that it burns them.

** In Remus's case, JK seems to have focused on animal symbolism. Wolves are family oriented and non-agressive, so that's why Remus's Patronus is a wolf, and of course he doesn't like it. If you really want to change it, I personally think you should do it in a way that makes sense. Then you might have to think of an animal that somehow represents his personality or something. It's very risky to change something that has already been established as canon and something as significant as Patronuses would require some research. Because in Sirius's case, his Patronus form seems very fitting, at least to me, so you would have to think about why a different animal would be better. I see nothing wrong with the fact that their animagi forms are the same as their Patronuses, to me it somehow adds consistancy.

** To add to my previous point, in au in my head, Remus learns not to be ashamed of his Patronus, he learns that he shouldn't be ashamed of his condition. He might not be accepted by every individual he meets, but he learns it's not his fault, that he has family who accepts him. So the whole irony disappears and the Patronus becomes a symbol of a lesson he has learned.
