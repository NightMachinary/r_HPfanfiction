I have just completed my longest fanfiction to date! If you are interested, please R&R. Details below:

Narcissa: A Death Eater's wife, Draco's mother, Bellatrix's sister - but who was she really? This question sparked me to write this story. It is canon-compatible, (books 1-7) following Narcissa from her seventh year at Hogwarts in 1972 through to the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. All chapter titles are named for constellations and their myths. Complete.
