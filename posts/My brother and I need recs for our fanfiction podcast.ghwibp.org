** J. K. Rowling has revealed that Lily Potter was pregnant with their second child when Voldemort killed her. So am AU where that second child was born before Voldemort killed them.

** Well, there's the classic of the loops collection. There"s not a ton of Harry Potter stuff but it's fascinating. Harry is one of the original loopers, and is mentioned or talked about by lots of characters at random different times.

It's scattered everywhere on fanfics and a forum. The fanfic hasn't been updated since 2012, but there are plenty of little short things buried in forums.

This is maybe where you should start [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/infinite-loops-project-the-yggdrasil-olympics.553656/]] Just read the summary at the start, the Olympics thing can be left alone.

Here's the fanfic, rather short, but like I said, there's more scattered on the spacebattles forum. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3761766/7/The-Harry-Potter-Omake-Files-Innortal-Style]]
