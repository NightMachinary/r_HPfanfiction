I'm looking for some good HP LGBT fics. I made one myself and it has 200 reviews but unfortunatley everyone's hating on me and criticising me in the reviews so I want to read some good ones so I can improve my writing and not embarsss myself in front of writers :( Any Gay/Lesbian/Trans fics would be ok. :)

Also looking for a beta-reader cause I want to see what's wrong with what I'm writing :(


** Please tell me you made a joke account just to do this. If so, congrats, you made someone snicker. If not, everyone hates your story because the writing is horrible and nothing makes sense. You may want to look at well known fic My Immortal for some inspiration.

**** Whether you mean to or not, your fic comes across as mocking the LGBT community.

** Your biggest problem isn't because of your plot. It's because you have fundamentally failed to understand the concept of fanfiction. Your story is essentially a political commentary (and one that lacks any nuance necessary at that) that happens to have characters named after those in the HP series. Please don't use fanfiction for the sole and express purpose of championing a sociopolitical agenda and then expect positive reception.

*** I mean, it is funny when someone does that with LGBT issues, but if you'd make that kind of story about fascism, it gets questionable really fast. Just imagine a fanfic where Voldemort and his Death Eaters are the good guys...

** Lads. Its her. The writer of Harry Potter LGBT edition. I must say, your story was the best thing I ever read on ffn. Even better than My Immortal. The prose was wonderful, the messages very subtle and the allegory completely, utterly exquisite. So beautiful a story that I had nightmares reading it. It was almost like reading about a troll shagging Umbridge. How can you improve on your writing? Stop stuffing your story with unfounded and baseless claims. Get off your high horse and actually process the reviews left instead of being an asshole to everyone when quite evidently, the problem is the writer.

*** Ok first of all I'm not the one who started the hate, it was the reviewers. My reaction is totally justified. But at least you liked it. Thank you.

** I honestly think someone should criticise your fic via YouTube or something just to show you how terrible of a writer you really are. I mean the adverbs are just horrific. Cryingly? Infradely? Those aren't words

** Blatant self-promotion here, but I'm writing a fic with pretty heavy LGBT themes, though it's also very blatant AU. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492]["Holly Potter and the Witching World"]] includes multiple references to homosexuality, several gay, lesbian or bisexuals, and at least one transgender character. linkao3(12861492)

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

** I still don't know how I ended up in here, but I started reading the comments, and I thought to myself : "that fanfiction can't be that bad". So, I looked it up and it's so bad that it's hilarious. I really like the part where future generations will feel that Harry Potter is outdated because it's against lgbt because everyone is straight

** Well, I'm a lesbian, and in my story Fight For Rights, my adult female Harry is bisexual. There are also a good number of other LGBT main and secondary characters across the story too, and in ALL my other stories I write - I have a transgender vampire, an agender orc, a gay human man, lesbian witches and married, gay mermen - because I want and NEED people like me and people I know in life to be visible for once. But I don't write it like that's all they are, because it's not all I am either. They're characters first, people first, and LGBT second. It's a part of them, but not all of them. They can be heroes, or villains, criminals or civilians, soldiers or pacifists, and they're all unique and all flawed in their ways.
