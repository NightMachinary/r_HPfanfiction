I've always wondered how Daphne, a character who was only mentioned twice in canon, became such a fundamental character in HP fanfiction culture. She's often referred to as the ‘ice queen' of Slytherin, regraded as a member of the ‘grey' political faction, and is often used as an alternative pairing for Harry.

Would really appreciate it if anyone could point me towards the fic/author that first used Daphne and made her fanon.


** Dunno whether technically the 1st, but definitely this is the fic that jumpstarted the Daphne Greengrass movement in the fandom:

** The oldest Fanfic that labels Daphne as a character on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] is A Line In The Sand - linkffn(2700237).

Funny enough I was wondering about this earlier today. I wonder she popped up randomly in a bigger fic and someone was like "You know what I like that character, time to write fanfiction." Too much to filter through to try to figure out where she came from sadly. Just that she's here to stay, maybe.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=2&r=10&c1=5549&s=2&p=62][Here]] is a sorted list of complete fics on ff dot net with Daphne in them according time. Just work up from the bottom of the list. There are a few small fics, but there are a couple of fics a little up that are actually successful. One is a Dramione fic in Spanish, the second, Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts is one of the most successful DG fics ever, so I suspect that fic is the one that really popularised Daphne.

I was not reading fic from the beginning so have no idea if there are fics on other sites from earlier that are comparatively successful

*** Oh, good lord no. Marriage Contracts, along with Acts of Betrayal was just me jumping on the Daphne bandwagon. I have no idea who was the first to use her in a Fic, but Jenconais' Perfect Situations was my introduction to the character.

  La vida de Hermione Granger a sus 27 años era casi perfecta, casi, si no fuera por su deplorable vida sentimental, la cual ascendía a la generosa cantidad de cero... ¿o no? (Dramione en re-edición. Catorce primeros capítulos remasterizados. Favor NO LEER EL RESTO hasta que esté revisado).
