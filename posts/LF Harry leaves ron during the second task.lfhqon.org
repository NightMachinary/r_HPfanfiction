:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
it was either Ron and harry never made up, or a harry was dragged to Hogwarts for the tournament, having not attended previously, and harry is displeased with Dumbledore's attempts to push him towards his supporters.

i may be mixing things up here but im not entirely sure it was the lake, it might have been a maze with a compass to lead to the hostage, or that may be a different fic i am mixing into it. if so, could you point to this one too?


** There is couple of Harmony stories, where he pulls out Hermione, not understanding why somebody who “betrayed” him (whatever is understood to be betrayal is different matter) and not his true best friend (if not more than that). I don't recall any story where he would just intentionally left Ron to drown.

** Hmm, I was just recently reading a fic where Harry was dragged to the tournament. They couldn't find him or something and they wanted him to come in and they thought making him compete would force him to show up. He was not happy, and only came for the tournament.

Was it a crossover per chance? I have most of my old reads open in old tabs, but I'm trying to narrow it down a bit

Oh! Maybe: blindness by angelastarcat? But that just talks about Harry being forced into the tournament, and not him refusing to rescue Ron.

*** it think it may have been a crossover, as i'm sure it used the 'goblet summoning' trope.

not blindness tho, sorry.

** Well I remember one short where Harry leaves Ron in the Lake and brings Gabrielle back instead. It's called Not a Poof by Broomstick Flyer

Linkffn(12141993)

Then there is a longer Fic where Harry leaves Ron in the lake but helps Krum rescue Millicent (they had previously ensured that anyone they cared about was protected and couldn't be "volunteered" as a Hostage. They were unable to protect Millicent). The story was called Can't Have it Both Ways by RobSt

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr
