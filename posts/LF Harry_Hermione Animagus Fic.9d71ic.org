If I'm not remembering wrong it was after fourth year, Because Sirius was alive and Harry was spending the summer at Grimmauld Place. Harry and Hermione became a couple in the first few chapters, Hermione was frequently visiting Grimmauld Place. Sirius and Remus taught Harry how to become an Animagus and his form was coyote. Later when Hermione comes to Grimmauld Place to stay for the rest of the summer Harry taught her too and I guess because of Harry's animagus form her form was coyote too although there seems to be few differences. When the two of them successfully turned they added their Marauder Name to the Marauder's Map and remove Peter's name from the map. There was Ron and Ginny bashing a little I guess, I'm not sure about Molly. When Weasleys came to Grimmauld Place to stay Ron and Ginny tried to sneak in to the basement where Harry trains although Harry specifically told them not to cross their boundaries. Again I'm not too sure but Harry and Hermione became prefects and Ron got jealous maybe or I'm just remembering another fic.

That's all I remember really, I really want to read it but I lost it and I can't seem to find it.


** Was it Vox Corporis? I think it was taken down but someone put it up on a google doc. [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZ74bV_yYE2kWMa4s-gMYt8n92v0WsFq/view]]
