Looking for fics where characters /other/ than Harry or Hermione are involved with another world/planet, timeline, alternate history, dimension, or what have you. Ron /by himself/ or with people other than the usual suspects would be acceptable. (I've yet to come across one with just him adventuring.)

Crossovers are fine.

One caveat: No romance fics please. Fics with romance in them are okay, but I don't want something that's /purely/ of that genre.

*Edited to add:* /Any/ characters are welcome, but I've read a lot of the Harry- or Hermione-focused ones, so that's why I excluded them specifically.

+Harry+ Violet and Hermione are major characters in it, but a Slytherin Ron is the story's protagonist, with a potentially time-travelling Hermione actually being something of an antagonist.

*** I'm pretty sure both Violet and Hermione are time travelers, too.

** /sigh/

Mirror, Mirror kind of sounds like what you want. Probably too much romance and Hermione in it for you. Alas, it's abandoned.

Still, I'll leave it here just in case. linkffn(Mirror, Mirror By BlackHawk13)

*** The likelihood that most fics of this type contain either Harry or Hermione is pretty high, so I know that my request is a fairly narrow one. Excluding stuff with "romance" in the genre section narrows it down even further, so I've got no room to be picky.

The fic you've recommend has Ron, which seems to be incredibly rare. Thanks!
