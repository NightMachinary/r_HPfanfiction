:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a Harry/Harem fic, from what I remember it involves most of the Hogwarts girls, and some heavy aspects of Norse mythology. I think the original authors name might have been Varian or something. Please help


** Can you provide anything else concerning things that happened in the story as searching for Harem and Norse returned some 528 files out of over 9000. And "Varian" had no hits.

*** Yeah, one of the key components was a Neville and Susan bones, and Harry had 2 Huldr partners

** Ok the only fic that I have read that contains Huldr is called Making a Merlin by SnitchesGetWitches. It is a harry/multi story. But I don't think it's what you are looking for.

**** I had gotten it from hpfanficarchive. But it looks like it's no longer on that site.

The author might still be able to be contacted through the site.
