Harry is young in this fic, gay. Bunch of people are gay around him. Goes to a school when there is a moody dark kid as his room mate. Meets famous people who are also gay because he is gay and scared he can't do anything because of it. Everything is fabulous. Mentions fashions magazines.

Thanks for any help redditors


** You'll probably have better luck finding it if you ask around [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. peeps here on the main sub aren't super keen on slash a lot of the time so your results probably wont be the best.
