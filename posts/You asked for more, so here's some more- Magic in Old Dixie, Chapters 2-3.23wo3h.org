** So, I had the day off today and cranked out two more chapters for my fan fiction. It's a bit different than most fan fics, as it doesn't heavily include the characters from the original books, though I certainly plan on having a few cameos. It does, however, take place in the same universe.

I definitely welcome feedback- it's something I'm mostly doing as an enjoyable mental exercise, but I definitely think others can enjoy it too, especially if like me you're curious about what was going on across the pond during the Harry Potter series. In my universe, they didn't have much time to help with Voldemort as they were a bit, erm, busy with their own war.

So, anyways, I really hope you take the time out of your day to read it and give me feedback! I just spent about four hours writing the damn thing so it would be a shame if it just sat in a dark deserted corner of the internet where no one ever saw it :(

I most certainly do, thanks for writing. The plot is riveting so far because of a lot of unknowns. I feel sad for Arthur's mom though, I hope her perception of the magical world changes to a more positive one as the story moves along.

** I really like this and hope you keep writing it! I like how you can tell roughly when we are in the HP universe, but it's side knowledge and not the main point. Your OCs seem well written. I'm waiting eagerly for the next chapter!

My only questions so far are why is the man in charge of the DWA a "Headmaster" as opposed to a more American term? Why does he need a spiral staircase like Dumbledore? The letter from Mr. Adinson seems a little off. I think it was meant to be mysterious/eccentric? But it doesn't seem right to me.

Looking forward to more!
