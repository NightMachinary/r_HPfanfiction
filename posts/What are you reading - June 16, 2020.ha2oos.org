** I've read most of the way through linkffn(Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly). It started off really interesting, with Harry going back in time, merging with Lockhart's soul, and then the combined personality intervening in young Harry's life - still obsessed with fame, fashion, and appearances, but actually leveraging that to solve young-Harry's problems.

He still unleashes pixies on the class, and is as foppish about it as ever - but he actually made everyone briefly practise shielding and freezing charms first, and uses their poor showing as an object lesson - "/Nearly everyone forgot their spells!/" He still makes Harry spend hours in detention answering his fan mail, but then spends a while legitimately discussing Harry's notoriety and how he needs to put out his own narrative lest he give tacit permission to others to write their own (literally, in this case; it's a story where people have been publishing "Adventures of Harry Potter" books and promoting them as fact). He even persuades Harry to embrace Colin's love of photography and make a deal for authorised photo shoots and a percentage of sales, so that people can get photos (even signed ones, if they want!) and will have less motivation to take them on the sly ("Otherwise you might find someone selling pictures of you taking a shower in the bathroom."), plus Colin will stop bothering him at other times. Lockhart's personality is still present and he's just as much of a braggart as ever; it's simply that with Harry's foreknowledge and moral fibre, he actually demonstrates skills to back up his boasting.

The reason I'm not sure about finishing it is that as the story progresses, it leans harder into several cliches I'm not keen on, including Dumbledore-bashing, Lord Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Black-etc, and Harry being able to serially assassinate the Death Eaters who avoided Azkaban, burn down their mansions and steal all their belongings. (Note that there is a degree of Ron-bashing as well, but I'm not sure it properly counts, since Harry/Gilderoy spent a great deal of time /deliberately/ sowing the seeds of contention there; considering how much the deck was stacked against him, Ron doesn't come off all that badly.)

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

** Just finished reading The Hidden Hero linkffn(3995826). Note that it's from 2008 so it's pretty old by current standards, but at least it's finished.

First, I like the idea. Harry is kicked out of the Dursley at 10 and survives on his own. Accidental magic makes his true identity hidden, and he attends Hogwarts as a muggleborn.

However there were so many things that I didn't like about it:

- Despite having a new identity he still sticks to the stations of canon for the first 3 year. He follows Quirrel, finds the diary, slay the basilisk, discovers Black and Pettigrew, etc.
- Dumbledore automatically suspects an 11 year old muggleborn of being an up and coming Dark Lord because he has the twin to Voldemort's wand.
- Weird things like a bunch of people respecting Harry for looking regal while he was waiting to get sorted (like oh my god that 11 year old kid looks calm and collected, wow so regal, I definitely respect him)
- During third year a kid pretended to be the missing Harry Potter and managed to fool Dumbledore. Like canon Dumbledore isn't an idiot, he just accepts some random kid saying that he's the missing Harry Potter?
- Harry monologues A LOT when he was fighting Voldemort at the end like even more than Voldemort. And people were gasping and everybody was shocked at the things he said and his "reveal" as the Harry Potter. It was kind of cringey
- Post defeat of Voldemort got weird. Harry got indentured to Snape for his own good to help his mental health. Ron and Hermione called him selfish for wanting to get away from the magical world, etc. It was almost like bashing except the story kinda framed them as being in the right and Harry definitely needed his rights violated to help him because he was definitely going to die without them doing so. I mean yeah the plot made it right but it was this weird "this feels like bashing" except "oh it's not bashing since the story is justifying them"
- Voldemort said "um" once
- Some plot and logical issues, certain things happen too easily, certain characterization was weird

​

What I like about the story:

- Things changed post third year. There was a major divergent near the end of year 4 and year 5-6 was different
- I like the idea of Harry diving into Voldemort's mind and trying to get his secret
- Dumbledore despite his weird "that muggleborn might be a Dark Lord" isn't exactly the GreaterGoodManipulator. He acknowledges that he was wrong about Harry multiple times during first year, second year, etc. Only his actions near the end did I not like.

** This week I've gone back to an old favorite of mine linkao3(Rise of the Drakens by Starlight Massacre) this story is a huge 129 chapter (and still going) with 5 additional stories in the same universe that started in 2012. The biggest thing that always sticks with me is that you see these characters and their relationships ebb and flow before your eyes. She constantly keeps you on your toes and delivers some true heart wrenching moments. This is a creature fic that has a lot of OCs and a polyamorous relationship which not everyone is okay with, but I'm always stoked when I see a new chapter alert in my email.

** Slytherin's Potter by Animeaddict56 (It's a next generation story, they're my favorite) Rating M, but not until quite aways into the story, and even then it's quite tame, could pass as a rated T story. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6551834/1/Slytherin-s-Potter]]

It's my all time favorite story, I've read it a good 3-4 times. Basically, Lily Potter II gets Sorted into Slytherin and her family (cousins/brothers) aren't accepting of it and she ends up falling out with them all and is basically the black sheep of the family. She ends up loving Slytherin though and befriends her brothers biggest enemy (Scorpius Malfoy). It's quite long and takes you through all 7 years of school and beyond. It's a Lily/Scorpius pairing, which is my favorite so I won't say no to any recommendations! (Also I'm terrible at summarizing things)

A downside is the author makes Lily into a huge Mary Sue. Personally it doesn't bother me much but I know some people hate it. Some of the writing is a bit off sometimes and certain words are used too often but overall it's great.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]) Also a good crack fic, I'm very partial to a nice OP Harry crack fic. I just love the trope of Harry as a DADA professor and turning all his students into avatars of death that scare the daylights out of aurors.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651/chapters/54512623]]) This fic isn't complete, still updating, and is very sweet. Quite nice as a break from grimderp edgy Harry fics (which I also like)\\
linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) I'm reading this as it updates, set to go on hiatus... :(

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

** Sekrit projekt

Not sure of the rating, since it's not on [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] or ao3.

Harry and Ron have a fall-out with Hermione after third year, and they turn to pranking as a means to find studying magic interesting. It has quite a few hilarious moments and include Harry and Ron being smart without Hermione's help. I don't find that often, so it was refreshing, even though I find that the development of cleverness and knowledge happens a bit too quickly.

It is a Harry/Hermione story, time travel, powerful Harry, Rich Harry and includes technomancy. It includes some level of Bashing of Dumbledore and the Weasley potion trope (Molly, Ron, and Ginny) (whether the bashing is excessive or not is for the reader to determine). It also includes a minor DC crossover.

** Currently rereading Linkffn(11933512).

Not everyone likes this author's style, but I like this fic a lot.

There's an interresting dystopian vibe, the ministry is somehow even worst than canon and a lot more insidious, there are a bunch of very good OCs. Harry is a lot more active than his canon self, yet he's still a wizard in training, not an instant god of magic, the stations of canon are suitablly avoided (the basilisk, for instance, is dealt with completely off-screen).

Completed fic with long installments (8 chapters, 140 000+ words).

** Title: Departure from the Diary

Author: TendraelUmbra

linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/Departure-from-the-Diary]])

It is not often I'll read a story of this nature. A Fem!Tom/Harry pairing, no thanks. Departure from the Diary tricked me though. It's actually good.

So, AU from the end of PoS. To but minds at rest. No paedophilia. As of this comment. There are no romantic undertones. Simply a developing friendship.

The relationship between Harry and Tamlyn, is the backbone of this particular fic. I won't go into specifics, but, there are good plot points that allow for a friendshipship to grow. It is not fast moving, by any metric. Yet, developing all the same.

The magic in this AU is interesting. I appreciate when an author takes a stance in magic. Then takes that stance, to it's logical conclusion. Harry learing the Patronus Charm is a personal favourite, and new headconon.

As a personal note. Not everyone will enjoy the portrayals of Dumbledore and Remus. Me? I could read though without much effort. All the same, warning delivered. In saying that. It is a rare day in Harry Potter fanfiction. That we see an Indy!Harry remain friends with Hermione and Ron. Take the bad with the good, I guess.

Still, after everything, I was entertained. In the end, that's all that matters. So for an interesting read. Check out, Departure from the Diary.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos, by ACI100.

You can read it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Ashes-of-Chaos][here]] on FFN, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1664050][here]] on AO3.

~~~~~~~~~~

Its the first WBWL (maybe) fanfiction I've read, so I can't really tell you if its unique or not compared to others, but there certainly seems to be some pretty unique ideas in this story in general.

Due to the author planning ahead, they have so far released one chapter every week, and it seems like this will carry on for a while, so you don't need to worry about waiting forever for a new chapter release.

I don't really want to spoil too much for anyone interested in reading, but I will give you a few bullet points so you can get a general idea:

- Slytherin Harry Potter
- Female Voldemort
- Alive James Potter
- Wizarding politics
- Morally grey characters
- No character bashing

Now I do want to point out that when I say "no character bashing" I mean that from my own personal opinion. I get that everyone has different definitions of character bashing, but to me it just seems like humans being humans, e.g. not being perfect and making mistakes.

This is a good time to start reading this fanfic as the author has just finished Book 1: The Forsaken's Ascension, and just this week posted the first chapter for Book 2: The Sacrificial Slytherin.

I really hope some of you give this one a shot, because I really do think its underrated.

So most WBWL stories have character bashing then? I guess I got extremely lucky finding one of the few that doesn't have any. If there is one thing I can't stand its character bashing.

I hope you enjoy the story. =)

** The Serpent and Her Lion by The Real Jon Snow\\
linkffn(13332212)\\
Rating: M

It's a pretty solid GOF Haphne fic. Pretty heavy Ron bashing so far and I think Dumbledore is heading that way (I'm currently in Chapter 17/27). What stands out to me is that they made an OC Daphne's male cousin, as Hermione's love interest. Very compelling OC IMO, but the fic overall is definitely a bit on the cliche side. It's a good easy read though, and it looks like the sequel is still updating pretty regularly, which is a plus

** Just finished up the most recent chapter of Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Causality linkffn(13140418) <Rated M>

It has been a very interesting fic to read where Harry retreats to the Chamber of Secrets after being ostracized by the school for being the fourth champion. He makes some rash decisions that I think he is starting to regret but he has also taken control of his life. He has dabbled into rituals and found himself torn between three women for three very different reasons. There is good drama in this and some complicated situations which Harry has found himself in. This was one of this fics I couldn't put down once I discovered it.

​

Second fic I just made to the most recent chapter is linkffn(13182638) Who Dares Wins...

<Rated M>

ever since I read Excited-Insomniac's Three black birds linkffn(13247979) <Rated T> I have been trying to lowkey find some well written stories where Lily and James are still alive but through a strange set of circumstances find themselves remarkably biased towards their other son. Who Dares wins brings out a more militaristic Harry and it was done in a very convincing way. Harry is definitely grey here, and is also the Lord of the Potter House which presents a lot of good drama as James Potter feels it was unfairly taken from him.

​

Third fic is grow young with me. I have been keeping up with this one from day 1 and the most recent chapter was just posted...definitely more of a fluff romance where Harry is dealing with a past trauma. Extremely well written and I especially love how well written Hermione and Ron are...There are a lot of fics that find them easy to bash but if we get past the fact that JK Rowling maybe made a mistake with this pairing, Taliesin-19 has written them exceptionally well. linkffn(11111990) <Rated T>

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived.

** I have finished these, but I am doing some rereads of them, and I will explain why after each link:

linkffn(The Chamber Strike) My personal humor has always been nonsensical and crazy, so this struck right in the heart for me. It highlights the silliest theory I have ever read, and the read was hysterical. There is plenty a reason why this fanfic is marked "the best fanfic" in my bookmarks bar; however, please take these quotes and decide for yourself. Altogether, a 9.5/10.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Delores "Toadie" Umbridge was furious.

  Fred and George in particular refused to be unchained from the showerheads in the girls' Quiddich locker rooms.

  Draco continued to be extremely furious with Harry over his blankie and hat.
#+end_quote

NEXT UP! My personal favorite: linkffn(Dear Order) It is a complete, 22-chapter-story, and it is, to say the least, one of the funniest things I've ever read. Small warning, it IS SnapexRemus. With compelling mysteries such as Snape's intense dislike of Elmer and why Luna is mumbling at the wall, you'll buckle up with a platter of cheese sandwiches (Kingley's favorite food!) and laugh yourself senseless. Here's my favorite quotes.

#+begin_quote
  I'd like you to do me a favor, Professor Snape, if that's at all possible. I need you to convey a message to the Headmaster for me. Tell him he sucks. Love Harry.

  "Harry is as perfectly sane as I am," Luna said dreamily, adjusting the hood of the glittery blue Death Eater cloak she was wearing.

On my third re-read of “From the Cupboard“ by huntersg1rl on AO3.

​

It is a Dumbledore Bashing, Good Slytherin book. And currently has a complete sequel and in-progress third. The author has many more planned to follow.

James Potter's family does hail from India, so there might be a couple of things to google for reference of what they are, but I really like all of the effort the author put into it in order to make it unique.

** This is fabulous. I've read several post DH tales and this is now my favourite. It's quite old so I was expecting tropes but so far I haven't encountered any. For its age it seems to have received surprisngly few likes. Harry and Hermione negotiate the wizarding world and the vacuum of power now both Voldemort and Dumbledore are gone. It's well written and all the characters seem mostly true to canon - at least my interpretation of it anyway. There are some startling but also logical plot developments.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** "A Squib at Hogwarts" , T, linkffn(13314330). As the name implies, it's a story about a squib who goes to Hogwarts. She finds a way to pretty much tricks everyone into believing she's a witch instead of a squib and gets an education. The story is in 1st person and is told kind of like she's telling it to a group of people. It's pretty interesting, I like the voice of the squib character, Cassidy.

I also recently re-read this one-shot "The Line", T, linkffn(13581002). It's a one-shot about Blaise Zabini during seventh year under the reign of the Carrows and he sort of becomes Slytherin and beyond's unofficial healer for injuries gotten from the Carrows. I like the way it fleshes him out and shows what it could have been like for Slytherins during that year.

*** You might find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12747766/1/Ottery-St-Catchpole][Ottery St Catchpole]] interesting :). A muggle moves into the home of a late wizarding relative, and the local witches and wizards just assume that she's a witch herself. She actually isn't even in the know.

  Squibs are viewed with disdain by most witches and wizards. They're born without magic, and they're taught that this makes them lesser. They're exiled from their community based on something that they did not choose and that they cannot control. But one girl is going to turn that all around because there is no shame in being different.

  It begins as an effort to heal Goyle's injuries after a class with the Carrows. And then others start coming. Blaise does not know quite how to stop this reputation he has built for himself as a pseudo-Healer for the Slytherin House. And suddenly, it is even bigger than that. Alternatively, in which Blaise's philosophy to coast by seventh year does not quite go to plan.
