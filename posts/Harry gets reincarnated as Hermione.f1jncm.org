One of those do-over fics, except Harry's in Hermione's body, and other Harry is still Harry


** Would make a good crack fic. Every time Harry dies, he reincarnates as another member of the cast. Problem is, he's died so many times that every single kid in Hogwarts is now Harry, and they are all secretly trying to combat Voldemort without tipping off the others.

Except Voldemort is /also/ Harry.

It's Potters all the way down.

** But what happens with original Hermione? Is she, in essence, non-existent? Was she 'moved' into another body, perhaps a sibling? Or was Hermione as we've known her never really Hermione but instead the nonlinear reincarnation of Harry?

**** And how many lives are we talking about here? How long did Harry live and much did he learn during? Is he just dying only to be reborn throughout history?
