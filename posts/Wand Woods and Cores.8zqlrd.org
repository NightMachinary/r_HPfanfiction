Hey y'all!

So I'm trying to choose a wand for my MC (not going into a lot of detail in the story, but it's a fun easter egg for people inclined to look up the meaning of the wood and core) so I was reading what JKR has on Pottermore about the subject. It mentions that dragon heartstrings are "the most prone of the three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental." What do you think that would mean? Do wands with dragon heartstrings cores make feathers explode when you try to cast Wingardium Leviosa? Do they make the spider you want to engorge into the size of an elephant instead of a small cat?

Sorry if this has been posted before, but I couldn't find anything like it.


** You also need to consider the type of wood it's paired with, as it's the combination which influences the 'character' of the wand, not just it's components individually.

For example, [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hazel][Hazel]] wands, being influenced strongly by emotions and will absorb anger from the user if they lose their temper, discharging it unpredictably. This would presumably be reinforced by having a temperamental core. That example with the spider to the size of an elephant is way too extreme (an unreasonable size difference), but something like trying to double it's size while the user is angry results in tripling its size before it bursts.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Elm][Elm]] on the other hand, prefers owners with dignity and elegance. Instead of violent manifestations of that temperamentality, it might become mopey if the user's wandwork is sloppy or they spell in an undignified manner, and simply not perform at all.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Poplar][Poplar]] wands are known for consistency, and would likely not suffer from the issue at all.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pine][Pine]] wands like to be used creatively, and so might act up if used for a repetitive purpose, creating variations of the intended effect.

Okay, moving on because I'm starting to have a bit too much fun thinking about wand combinations, the elephant example seems far too extreme but I've gone over that. Regarding exploding feathers, I vaguely remember Seamus setting his feather on fire, due to him getting impatient and poking it, as well as various other mishaps such as blowing up his tea trying to turn it into rum, and accidentally shooting off a water jet when he got too excited after apparating.

How much was his wand and how much was due to him is unknown, but there is likely a correlation.

Of course, to a more skilled witch or wizard, these quirks matter less. Then again, a more skilled with or wizards probably wouldn't be paired up with a wand that caused problems for them.

*** Fun fact: my wand is hazel and dragon heartstring, haha. In this case, Pottermore states that it works best for someone that can understand and manage their feelings.

** Dragon Heartstring: arguably the most 'powerful' core of the three, these wands can cast new spells more 'easily' (according to description), leans slightly toward transfiguration. Most dark wands have dragon heartstring. Are the least loyal on average.

Unicorn Hair: more finesse, slowest to learn new magic, but are also better control with spells (perhaps more variability?), very few dark wizards have unicorn hair wands, better with charms.

Phoenix Feather: the rarest core (not surprising), often found among people who stand out from the crowd or are somehow separate, seemingly better in direct defensive or offensive magics (ex. DADA, the Dark Arts). Sort of the middle ground between the other two.
