This is the only scene I remember. Harry and his father James where fighting in an honour duel against one another with Sirius as James second on the grounds at Hogwarts, I think after an incident where Harry's brother was injured and Harry was blamed, but I'm not sure, and Harry won.


** By your description I think it's Unsung Hero, he duels James in Chapter 34 [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/34]]

â€‹

Here's the first Chapter: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/1]]

** That sounds kinda familiar... the duel take place (maybe) on the Astronomy tower? Did James end up sorta-petrified?

**** Unless there is more than one story by that same name, it is FFN story ID: 13334697

Though, I don't think OP's answer is *Unsung Hero*... I just quickly searched through it and did not find any reference to Harry and James dueling.

***** It is a different Unsung Hero, one that is no longer on FFN: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/34]]

Edit: I want to stress that I do not recommend this story. There are stupid levels of neglect and favoritism depicted.

*** linkffn(13334697)

Thanks for the reminder guys! I had been looking for this story for a while and couldn't remember the title. It's supposed to be a duel between Harry and his brother but James finds out and insists on dueling.

  There are two things to know about Harry Potter. One: He kicks ass. Two: No one cares. Why? Because Daniel Potter is the Boy Who Lived. Wrong!BoyWhoLived fic. Powerful Harry. Harry/Hermione.
