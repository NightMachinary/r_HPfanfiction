It might be during his final stand with voldemort or in the Third Task, but Harry is transported to a different universe where for example, Nevilles the BWL or his parents are alive, or Riddle won the first time. Nice if it includes Harry doing things in secret and fumbling up, also Overpowerful!Harry is fine, if not preferred.
