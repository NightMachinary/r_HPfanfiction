** The only effects we ever see Dung have are helpful to Voldemort: He abandons his guard duty to buy some dodgy cauldrons, robs Grimmauld (including stealing the locket Horcrux, which he later uses to bribe Umbitch), and bails out during the Battle of the Seven Potters and gets Moody (one of the Order's best) killed.

***** Not really? In HBP Dumbledore implies (when they are recruiting Slughorn) that since he was with Harry the trace wouldn't pick up spells casted by either of them, and in the end of the book Harry casts all those spells in the cave and (not sure if I remember correctly) I think he was also the one to apparate Dumbledore and himself back to Hogsmead, which the ministry had no idea about. Beyond that there were all those spells casted around him during the World Cup at GoF, whatever magic happens at Hogsmead... my HC is that the actual reason the order didn't tell Harry that they were around at Privet Dive was to prevent him from figuring out that the Trace wouldn't pick up any magic he did and using the opportunity to curse the Dursley's into a grey blob on the wall.

** I doubt it would change much from the Canon plot.

Even if someone else used the spell, Harry would be accused of Underage Magic since it was used in his "zone", he would still be brought to Grimmault Place for his own protection, he would still have to go to a trial where Fudge would try everything in his power to condemn/ silence him.

If anything, the defense of Harry would change from "He had to protect himself from Dementors" to "Someone had to protect him from Dementors". But Fudge would still refuse to admit that Dementors ever went there, and the wizard who protected him would have to justify his presence, and explain his connection to Harry (which is not a very good idea in the political climate of that time, especially if it was a Ministry Employe like Arthur).

*** Not really?

I mean, Statute of Secrecy forbids revealing magic to uninitiated. If they already know, or are a close relative of a magical citizen, it's fine. Offensive spells cast on Muggles have their own set of laws, but Patronus doesn't count as one. Since the wizard/witch would have been of age and fully qualified, underage sorcery would not apply either.

​

As everyone present was aware of magic and no one was harmed, nor any lasting magical effects remained (like Biting Doorknobs), the adult could cast any spells they wished.

*"Mr. Anon, why did you cast a Patronus Charm?"*

*"Dunno, I felt like it. But since no unaware muggles saw it, I was well within my rights to do so."*

In Fudge can try to blame Harry for using Magic in front of Dudley, he definitively can do the same for a random adult wizard who doesn't have any connection to Dudley. And even if you remove Dudley, it doesn't change the fact that he cast the spell in a "Muggle-inhabited area".

It is only an assumption on my part, but I think that only the "parents" and "siblings" of a wizard can know about Magic, and that Dudley only get some kind of exemption because Harry is living with him. Exemption that is completely ignored by Fudge.

But that's not really the point there. Because, as seen in the chapter, Fudge was not there to determine if Harry was "in his right" to use magic, but to put him in troubles. If it could be used against Harry, Fudge was totally ready to ignore his own law, or be completely dishonest. I mean, when he saw that the Patronus charge wouldn't stick, he tried to attack Harry about his accidental magic, back in 3rd year, even though he had forgiven him himself at that time.

If he sees that he can't attack Harry on the Patronus, because an adult wizard claim to have used the spell, he would probably go all out on this wizard, if only by pettiness. And according to the charges, using magic "in a Muggle-inhabited area" is a true offense against the Statute of Secrecy. Which means that to be cleared of all charge, said adult wizard would have to prove that he used the spell because of Dementors, which put him exactly in the same situation that Canon Harry.

He may try, but the only reason it somewhat worked with Harry is the months long smear campaign. Trying that shit on someone who isn't a teen (Harry) or willing to play the game (Dumbledore) would not be good for Minister.

Additionally, we'd need to look up exactly where is that law? Because there are 2 given as basis, without distinction as to which law demands what.

I am leaning towards "underage sorcery", because there is ample precedent of adult wizards casting spells in that neighborhood without reprisal. (It might be just Rowling screwing with consistency of detection, but it happens).

The low hanging fruit would be Arthur Weasley, 4th year. Blasting hex, reparo, and undisclosed number of spells to reverse the Ton Tongue Toffee. No reaction.

** Let‘s assume Umbridge‘s attemt at making Harry use magic would have failed, since...let‘s say Tonks conjured up a patronus. In this case there would have been no immediate need to take Harry to Grimmould place and most likely there would have been a rather heated debate between Sirius, Molly and Dumbledore, all of them wanting to protect harry in their own way: Molly: Dementors? Dementors! You can‘t possibly plan to let him stay there?! Albus: As you are well aware there are certain protections- Sirius: Yes, sure. And they clearly work, don't they? Ah wait...there was this incident with the house elf... Albus: Who meant no harm- Sirius: And the mass murderer who got close to him without being noticed Albus: That was you- Sirius: And now those soul sucking bastards- Molly: Language! Sirius: -which means we might have the whole fucking- Molly: Sirius! Sirius: -ministry against us. /whispering among the order members/ Molly: He does have a point. What excactly is that „protection“ Albus: Um Sirius: Yeah, tell us. Albus: Nope can‘t. Sirius: Why? Albus: /throws firecrackers/

Meanwhile in little winging Tonks decided that after having dropped off a little less traumatised dudley at the dursleys it wouldn‘t do any bad to invite Harry over for tea. So she takes him to her parents place, where he gets to meet her parents for the first time. Tonks also invited Hermione and Ginny ( since they seemed to have already built an even sister-like bond), whom Harry is quite pissed at for around five minutes, before they fall into easy conversation. Also at some point the family pictures are discovered: Harry: Waaaait is that a picture of you and Narcissa Malfoy over there? Andromeda: Yup. Harry: Cool, why though? Andromeda: She‘s my sister. Harry: Wow, having a sister, who's a pureblood supremacist and a death eater‘s wife...must be pretty much the worst thing to happen to you... /the Tonks family exchanging looks/ Tonks: Hm yeah, the only thing worse than that must be having a second sister, who is a mass murderer and you know who's first lieutenant. Harry: .... Andromeda: I have that too. That's her over there. Harry: Oh Hermione: Well, she‘s kinda hot though. Ginny: What about your parents? Andromeda: Banned me from the family. Hermione: Aunts/Uncles? Andromeda: Burnt me from the family tree. Harry: House elves? Andromeda: He hates everyone. Harry: A goldfish? Andromeda: Someone ate him. Harry: Oh Andromeda: Nah only kidding-never had one. /silence/ Hermione: Well...let‘s change topic...maybe some fun stories? Tonks: Lucius Malfoys hair? Hermione: Huh? Tonks: I bet he uses bleach. Harry: But Draco‘s a natural blonde, right? Andromeda: I think so...he‘s got his mothers hair. Why are you interested anyway? Harry: I, well, that, I have to go to the bathroom. Ginny & Hermione /exchanging looks/ Ginny: /giggling/ that's why his scarf was green.

Very much later this year: The department of mysterys: Lucius: The prophecy, Potter. Neville: Or what? Lucius: Or we will torture and kill every single one of you. Harry: Bet those threats are fake. As some other things here. /giggling/ Lucius: Excuse me? Hermione: Are we getting in your hair? Lucius: I don't- Ron: Makes your hair stand on end, that we discovered your secret. Lucius: What nonsense are you children- Luna: You know...blonde people are way less affected by Nargles, but with all those swarming around your head... Bellatrix: /emerging from the shadows/ Itty bitty potty knows how to play! Now- /gets interrupted by muffled discussion/ What?! Ginny: No, no. It's nothing, go on. Bellatrix: Tell me this instant! Ginny: Well Herione and I were just discussing- Bellatrix: What?! Hermione: We saw that old picture of you.. Ginny: And oh boy do you look less hot in real life.

A quite long discussion about Lucius's natural hair color and Bellatrix probably catfishing the order managed to stun the distracted death eaters from behind.

And that‘s how it would have happened. CHANGE. MY. MIND.

I'm mean I get the fudge kept interrupting him but still.

And I know the government relies on the parents to discipline their kids but really? Did Dumbledore remove all knowledge of where Harry Lives? Because a few witches and wizards have met him growing up. Bowing to him in shops. And we all know Petunia's not taking him to London for that. So they all kinda know he lives in Surrey.

Then does this mean that they put up a anti magic detector around Harry's house. Because they all just apparate in and all that.

We know some of the strong ones could but if Mundungus was a guard then anyone could be. Could Doge do one? Could Molly? Harry ends up having to do it anyway and events proceed as normal.

Or, depending one how you interpret the trace, Harry is in the clear because there was an adult nearby. We know Arthur's fireplace fixing and Tonks's pack spell go unremarked so there's every chance Harry would have gotten away with it.

** If the different Order member is unable to cast a Patronus then it'll go as it went in canon.

But even if the Order member manages to drive the Dementor away, then it'll not change much. Firstly, Harry wouldn't attract Dumbledore's attention, and probably wouldn't get moved to Grimmauld Place for the entire holiday, or at best towards the very end of it, like the last one or two weeks to shop for school equipment (he got moved on 6th of August, so he only had 25 days to go, or three weeks and four days).

Dumbledore made no effort to bring Harry into the fold, until his hands were tied by the Dementor attack and court hearing, so he could very easily think that he's keeping him safe by leaving him at Privet Drive. He believes that with Voldemort on the rise, the safest place for Harry is the place where Voldemort can't even touch him.

Harry spent the entire July by himself, so half of his holidays were already spent in isolation. He would give his friends and adults even harder time for leaving him out of loop, but beyond that, I can't see anything else changing; Harry is not a spiteful kid and he treasures his friends so he would forgive Ron and Hermione eventually. Umbridge would've probably become the DADA instructor regardless, to spy for Fudge, and things would've gone normally.

Nonetheless, I would love to read an angsty Harry who's moved to Grimmauld Place only one week before the term starts, and simply loses it at everyone, his anger would be justified.

If, say, Tonks had been on guard instead, she'd have cast the Patronus and then Umbridge would still have accused Harry, only for Tonks to provide his alibi instead of Figg. Same outcome.
