2 things:

1. Has this been done before?\\
2. Would you write this if you had the inclination?

Premise: A Lord Potter AU in which Harry is gay, but due to laws must marry and have a legitimate heir (son) before he can take his seat on the Wizengamot. If he does not have a legitimate heir to succeed him by his death, the next Lord Potter would come by way of agnatic primogeniture. (This means that Daphne's father isn't on the body because he doesn't have a son, but an author could change that.) In the case of a Lord's son being someone below 16 years old at the time of the Lord's death, a Regent is appointed on that same basis of agnatic primogeniture. That Regent is supposed to house the young Lord and act as his guardian and takes the young Lord's Wizengamot seat until that day. If a Regent is unwilling or unable to care for the young Lord, then he goes to closest relative unless the wills say otherwise (with some exceptions) and the Regent may remain in the seat. Families are supposed to keep their own records, and the family must notify Gringotts and the Ministry of any happenings inside of it.

I know this seems like a wall of text, but I think if someone would take this on (you don't have to follow all of the traditional monarchical succession rules if you don't want to; it's merely a suggestion to spice things up), you'd have my gratitude if this hasn't been done before (or something similar)

Ninja edit: I did not know whether to flair this as Discussion or Prompt, so I went with Discussion.


** Eh. If I want medieval politics, I'll go play Crusader Kings II.

It's not so precise that it hasn't been done before in a general sense, but I don't know how many people get into the nit and grit of feudal succession laws. You might be better off going to a historical fiction subreddit and asking for an adaptation, or something.

*** Thanks for the swift response. I figured it'd be very niche, but there may be some interest because of all the Netflix shows about it.

**** That's fair, but I don't know how much the audiences cross. Fics with inheritance drama in them usually focus on the magic bloodline part instead of the legalese.

** I think you would need to give a reason why sons are favored over daughters in a society where witches are as powerful as wizards. Are wizards so traditional that even 300 years after splitting off from muggles, they still follow the patriarchy, the muggle patriarchy even?

There are other questions as well:

What happens if your heir dies? Do you lose your seat?

Can you adopt an heir?

If having an heir is so important, wouldn't that mean that all families have an heir, and a few spares, instead of single children like Draco?

*** Q1: If a line dies with no eligible heirs, the line dies out officially and any real property (incl. house elves) is given in trust to one of the 5 holders of Honor Seats, given to people who are an Order of Merlin, First Class who are currently alive, to find someone to take the seat and join the ranks of the Lords, then all that property is transferred It is literally a bloody mess when this occurs. If there are less than 5, the seats are filled with people with Orders of Merlin, Second Class who fulfilled the requirements for a First Class voting but were not nominated for one. If there are more than 5, than the 5 whose nominations were accepted with the highest percentage of votes get in, while the remainder may sit in on Observer status and may take a seat as soon as one of the 5 dies. An Observer may speak in debates but cannot vote. As to the part about why they have such a system... it's the only way they knew and decided to copy what the Muggle government was doing at the time, with the exception of having a "House of Commons" because the rich families didn't want to cede that power. Due to the lack of a magical member of the Royal Family, they installed the Minister of Magic position as a Cromwell-esque Lord Protector role. Since there was opposition to a lifetime term, they ended up imposing the term limit we know to be canon.

Q2 and Q3 are related. If you lose your heir due to death (or lose the possibility of having one due to infertility, etc.), you may adopt an heir, but that heir cannot already be a Lord, and he must be a Muggleborn. Blood adoption is not a thing, and people know that you are adopted.

Q4: Some families are cocky and only have one child, or some simply Some choose to only have one out of convenience. Others don't really care because of they have a daughter and they marry a Lord, the 2 houses consolidate and a seat opens up.

**** You need to decide why all the witches tolerate this system. Are they all raised to unquestioningly accept losing everything just because their brother died? Or why do they accept this?

Also, why can you only adopt a mugleborn? That does not seem to make sense in a system that stuck on blood. What if it is revealed after the adoption that the muggleborn was actually a half-blood?

Also, what happens if you are the heir, but too young to have children when your father dies? Do you get a grace period? Can you adopt instead of waiting?

I think the whole "you need an heir to have a position on the Wizengamot" makes not much sense - especially since the muggles never had that requirement. What exactly is the point of this, any way? What kind of plot does it make possible that wouldn't be possible without it? Telling Harry he has to continue his family line is pretty much a standard trope in Lord Potter fics.

** What you described is a mechanic, but not a story. I usually don't care much which mechanics are underlying in your world, as long as they are pulled off decently.

So without knowing some actual story I can't really tell you if I'd be that interested - sure, the mechanics sound decent, but it /really/ depends on the actual plot.

** What I wanted to say about your specific post has already been said, so here's some general advice:

If you're having fun writing it, it doesn't matter how many people like it.

If you write it, someone somewhere will enjoy it. The audience might be very narrow or very wide, but worrying about it only causes unneeded anxiety.

If you have an interesting story and believable characters, most readers aren't going to care what they're about as long as you can hook them in the first chapter.

tl;dr - Go write, have fun. Let readers worry about themselves.

** I am pretty sure I've seen this before in one of the thousands of Lord Potter fics. Its just a slight variation to what has been done a bazillion times over and over and over again.

If I'd ever write a Lord Potter fic on a prompt it would have to be something amazingly new and unique.
