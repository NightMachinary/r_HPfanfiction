Or other fics where they're really close friends while Harry's in school. I just read linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1130031]]) and I need more like it!

** Ingenio ab Artifex by JamieJabs on FFnet has a relationship like that (I posted a link before, but apparently it counts as underage and I'm not sure if lines like 'boy did we have a great half an hour' violate rule 8 in the sidebar.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1471928/1/Daddy-s-Favorite][Daddy's Favorite]] linkffn(1471928) fits the bill, though it's from other characters' POVs.

(I'm assuming you've already checked out Darkfromday's other fics, but if you haven't then definitely also read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19179952][birds of a feather]] linkao3(19179952) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22190359][worth a thousand words]] linkao3(22190359).)
