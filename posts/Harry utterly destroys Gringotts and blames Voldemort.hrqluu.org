:END:
The only thing I remember about this fic is that an OP Harry annihilates the British branch of Gringotts on his hunt for the horcrux stored there, blames the attack on Voldemort, which ends up starting a Goblin Rebellion where goblins the world over come through the British branch to wage war.


** I don't recall the name for sure, but there is a sequel where they get kicked to a different universe that is HP/Stargate crossover, if that helps. If I recall the first one was HP/Star Wars, and was Harry/Hermione/Luna relationship.

*** That multi pairing was in Broken Chains, though I have no idea if that's the one you're thinking of - it's the only SW crossover I've read so far (and I'm currently reading it). The sequel is called The Stars Alone. linkffn(7718942; 12040341)

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** That's one of my favorites, a little dark, but the story is great, and it's one of the few I've seen that use goblins in this way, the chapter you refer to is between chapter 35-36, I hope it's the fanfic you are looking for:
