** It's not the one where he's trained by the founders, right? There's that fic where Albus, Harry, and Tom were all heirs or something and at some point go back in time to train w/ their respective founders or something like that?

** Could it be linkffn(basilisk-born by ebenbild)?

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
