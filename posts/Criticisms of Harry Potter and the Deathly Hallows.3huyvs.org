I often see on here ([[/r/hpfanfiction]]) many criticisms levelled at HP & Deathly Hallows. I decided to ask this question here because many people in this sub describe the book as "poorly written fanfiction", and there are a myriad of Fanfictions out there that serve as a replacement of book 7.

So I was wondering, why does Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows get so much hate in this sub?

I read a one-shot that started immediately after the epilogue, where Harry arrested Ron (or at least demanded his badge) for using the Confundus Charm on an unwilling person and violating the Statute of Secrecy.

**** If you look at it like that, then I'd say it shows that pureblood bigotry runs deep, even in the supposedly fanon dubbed 'Light' families. Not to mention that the corruption in the Ministry was never dealt with, it just underwent a changing of hands. One could also say that, as an extension to both of those: the oppressed have become the oppressors (or there's scope for that still to happen).

**** I find that very interesting because i little while ago I was reading the pensieve Tom Riddle bits in HBP. Paying attention to Ogdens words shows the reason Morfin was in trouble/summoned was because he did magic in front of a muggle and not for the boils(?) he hexed. It appears though that Ron altering someones mind, Hermione altering someones mind, Dumbledore altering someones mind and liquoring them up aren't ever an issue from anyones point of view. For further DH goodness- McGonagall and Harry both use Unforgiveables, the Aurors have been (are?VWII?) authorized to use the other Unforgivables, but I guess those are... noble causes. Hell back to the mind alteration I guess repeatedly wiping the GoF camp officials minds is completely A-okay, funny even, but levitating them up in the air is sick and twisted torture.

And furthermore good people should not like evil people, so it was right and good for Dumbledore to view Tom with suspicion rather than trying to make him a better person.

Or perhaps it's not immutable, but only a select few are eligible for redemption -- Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy, for example.

But I also find it stupid that anyone, especially Harry, would care about using confundus charms on Muggles, and more generally that wizards would be using Muggle ideas about mental inviolability. This is a society where it's considered okay to use love potions and cheering charms. Manipulation of mental states is routine and accepted. And you can see why: wizards know that they have immortal souls which define their essence and nature. The mind would carry much less importance when you have a soul, because it's no longer the basis of who you are.

Ron Weasley in that fic did not follow the correct procedures. Muggles noticed irregularities. Then the Obliviators came in and cleaned up after him, which took multiple people and required altering paper records, because that level of thoroughness was mandated by their procedures and they were trained how to be thorough.

In general, members of a government agency who have training in a specialized field are allowed to do things that private citizens and members of other government agencies are not. Applying certain pesticides, storing toxic waste, imprisoning people, performing surgery -- those all require government certifications, and in some cases it's illegal for private organizations and individuals to do it at all. It would be stupid if there were no regulations on these behaviors and any citizen were allowed to do something if they could find at least one government employee authorized to do it.

Nope, all wizards are authorised to manipulate Muggles' minds to maintain the statute of secrecy, or generally make navigation of the Muggle world more convenient.

Canon example: the almost constant obliviation of the Muggle camp manager at the Quidditch world cup by basically every single arrival.

Another example (from Fantastic Beasts): the obliviation of an entire beach of Muggles in Wales by two wizards who were on holiday.

Canonical Muggles do not notice irregularities, even without active concealment magic in play. This is a theme brought up multiple times: that Muggles have a natural response to magic that, even when they witness, they explain it away. Example: the Knight Bus doesn't have concealment charms on it but rather it's so beyond Muggles' accepted reality that they refuse to see it.

I've read (part of) the fic in question. The muggles who noticed the irregularity was nowhere near the magic. IIRC it was the Confunded guy's supervisor, who noticed he gave an all-clear to a guy who, by the paper records, failed the test miserably. The guy loses his job and the Obliviators have to intervene.

The important thing here is that Obliviators are authorized by the Ministry. They follow the /rule of law/. Just as I can't go around giving people tickets, /even when they commit crimes/, Ron can't go around Confuding Muggles.

Your position is that Ron is perfectly willing to alter people's memories and brainwash them whenever it maintains his ego. Mine is that he'd never do that to anyone he could empathize with -- the one counterexample we had was not for his ego but to kill a Dark Lord -- but, due to the Statute of Secrecy and anti-Muggle prejudice, he never learned to empathize with Muggles.

I'm really not sure where you're pulling this from. He confunded a guy to pass a test for what was for him a pointless test, as I can't see Ron driving a car regularly, and when he does, as he said, he could just use magic to ensure he drives safely.

******* It /is/ a bit much, but any action that they took in support of the Voldemort regime makes them a collaborator.

Their guilt can be mitigated if they were coerced (like Reg Cattermole) but that doesn't remove the fact that they worked to keep that Ministry operational. They're still guilty. They just maybe shouldn't be punished severely--or at all.

I am in the minority in this opinion re: the Harry Potter fandom. A lot of people seem to believe that one positive action wipes out completely the negative actions a person has undertaken, e.g., Narcissa suddenly isn't so bad because she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead--despite the fact that she did it for a selfish reason AND had previously supported Voldemort, even if in a limited capacity. Narcissa's one act of defiance doesn't make her not guilty of everything else (like conspiracy to commit murder, harboring fugitives, conspiring to smuggle murderers into a school, etc.). It just mitigates the negatives and makes her punishment less than it would have been.

No matter what JKR did, she simply was not going to satisfy everybody.

Which is okay. It's her world, and that was her ending. And that's what fanfiction is for, right?

** I am not going to refer to things like the disappointing final battle and epilogue, disliked plot devices, or the pairings that enraged fans around the world; instead, I will refer to a basic element of the book that made it worse than its predecessors.

Books 1-6 had a certain structure: events occur almost singularly within the story's 'base', which is Hogwarts. It gives people a sense of familiarity and they look forward to finding out what new plot will happen to their favorite place of the series.

On book 7, we depart from Hogwarts and we have them 'on the run'. The transition was not so... good, in my opinion. I was personally looking forward to this whole thing ending as soon as possible, rather than savor what was happening during this journey.

That said, I wouldn't claim that the seventh book /had/ to happen at Hogwarts. It would simply be a safe bet, i think. Focus on alternative places could work, but it with the author's choice that was not the case in my humble opinion.

Finally, I'd like to say that before discovering fanfiction (which was about two years after DH came out) I 'liked' the seventh book, kinda. It was still a bit 'meh' due to the above reasons, but thought it was okay. Upon reading fanfics that handled that scenario better though ( especially those that abolished horcrux hunts and focused on other facades of the war) I was forced to re-evaluate.

** Three teens camping in the forest for most of the book was very boring. For me, the book didn't get remotely interesting until the trio made it back to Hogwarts near the end.

JKR has done an amazing job with her characters. What makes the world so rich is the entire ensemble of characters interacting together - and not just three characters off on their own doing stuff. The characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione, in the capacity that they were written, were not able to carry the DH story.

That's just goddamn bullshit!! You do not introduce a Deus ex Machina 7 books in! That's just lazy writing and makes no sense. And you definitely do not introduce three of them in one book. The deathly hallows should have never been created and wand ownership isn't a thing, it directly contradicts every duel in the previous books were people disarmed each other all the time!

I can overlook Harry being a horcrux since

- Horcruxes have been established before.

** I dislike it because Voldemort is 100% correct in this sequence:

#+begin_quote
  "I don't want anyone else to help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this. It's got to be me."

  Voldemort hissed. "Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "This isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?"

  "Nobody," said Harry simply. "There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . ."

  "One of us?" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. "You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?"

  "Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?" asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. "Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?"

  "Accidents!" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. "Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!"
#+end_quote

Harry didn't deserve to win, and without plot armour he wouldn't have. Even worse, Harry /directly references/ his plot armour in this sequence by saying that being morally righteous means he has a power Voldemort lacks which means he will win.

Plus, the whole "winning on an obscure rule of wand ownership rights which had never been mentioned before" isn't a great conclusion.

Not to mention the fact that Voldemort should have just pulled out his yew wand and killed Harry with that, after Harry directly tells him that he's the master of the Elder Wand.

*** Egads, I don't know if I want to get into a whole plot discussion or not, (but apparently I do......) but in my understanding of the series, this conversation makes perfect sense. I don't mean to say you're wrong or I'm right, but if I'm able to share a few words that help you enjoy the final book, then awesome! The following is all my interpretation.

It's also not about Harry needing to win because he has the advantage of being the good guy main character. Harry kind of blunders his way through the whole series, where Dumbledore is the clear-cut mastermind. Harry is the main character, but the conflict is really between Voldemort and Dumbledore with Harry as a useful puppet.

Also, the way I understand magic, there's canon evidence that magic is tied to emotions ("did you ever make anything happen when you were angry or scared?", and how you need to "mean it" to do the Cruciatus Curse). It is not that people who have love are just somehow stronger magicians, it's more that love is one of many powerful emotions. So is anger, and so is fear, etc. So the most powerful wizard in the world would be doing himself a huge disservice by not valuing the power of each of those. But Voldemort can't help it - he does not understand love, and so he fails to predict the actions of those motivated by it: Snape deserting him, Lily choosing to die (the greatest weakness of all).

Lily's sacrifice started a snowball effect that eventually led to Voldemort dying. It was not just that he did not have love, but that he continually failed to realize it's importance within magic. At each encounter with Harry, Voldemort thought he overcame the previous mishap. He used Harry's blood, but Harry still got away because of their wand cores. Well, why was Harry's wand core the same? Because he had a piece of Voldemort's soul in his head. Why did he have a piece of Voldemort's soul in his head? Because Voldemort's soul was unstable and broke apart. Why was his soul unstable? Because he made several Horcruxes? Why? Because he was terrified of Death. Why did Lily's sacrifice work (as opposed to James's)? Because Voldemort had given her an option to live. Why did he give her an option to live? Because Snape had asked him to.

So it's not that some divine essence of love within Harry is magically stronger than the essence of evil inside Voldemort. It is more logical (if it was more divine, then Dumbledore would probably have more respect for Divination, but he doesn't think it's important. He only values the prophecy about Harry because he knows that /Voldemort/ values it. The prophecy, in and of itself, is not important) - there is a very direct line of how Voldemort's mistakes lead to his death, and those mistakes stem from his inability to love and his fear of death.

Dumbledore studies the magic between Harry and Voldemort and attempts to understand why something so outwardly straightforward as killing a child should have ended so disastrously. He discovers what I laid out above, that Voldemort failed because he did not understand Snape and Lily, or the magic that might evolve if he did not take the needed precautions to avoid it. So Dumbledore discovers the only way to get rid of Voldemort is to somehow manipulates the situation to use the magic that Voldemort does not understand - so these aspects of Voldemort's character will be his downfall.

Voldemort tries to do something similar to Dumbledore and Harry - using their ability to love against them. The same way people kidnap rich kids so their families will pay tons of money to get them back - exploiting their love. But Voldemort fails because he ultimately does not understand the extent people will go to fight for their loved ones. He does not understand that dying (his greatest fear) is /nothing/ to these people who are fighting to protect their families. He thought Harry's death would mean he would win, but he had not anticipated the likes of Neville, who was willing to keep fighting, because he cannot fathom their motivations.

Dumbledore /can/ fathom Voldemort's motivations - hadn't he dabbled in the dark arts in his youth? Hadn't he considered controlling muggles and non-humans to bend to the will of witches and wizards? But Dumbledore learned from his mistakes, he learned to value love and to no longer fear death. He understood magic so much more than Voldemort, because he understood all of it, not just some of it.

So when Harry shows up and begins to display all the qualities that Voldemort is lacking, Dumbledore watches closely. This boy could actually do it. This boy could actually break through the holes in Voldemort's understanding of magic. Dumbledore starts on a plan.

In King's Cross station, the chapter is written in such a way where one reader may believe it is real and another may believe it isn't. Everything Dumbledore says is something Harry could have worked out on his own. I personally think it is real, but regardless, Harry learns/realizes this plan, realizes exactly /why/ Dumbledore has always claimed that "love" is so powerful, and why Voldemort's weaknesses were so bad. So when Harry confronts Voldemort in the Great Hall, it is not a mistakes at all that Harry directly references the plot armour, it is intentional, because it is more than just plot armour. Harry does not survive in the forest just because he's the main character, but because the magic that began in the very first book had led up to that moment in a very direct way.

Now, I feel your opinion on the Elder Wand is completely justified. I personally love it, but there is no 7-book-long plot backtracking to support it. I personally think that Harry could have died in the Great Hall and it would not have screwed up the plot at all. Harry had to survive in the forest because that's what the seven books were leading to, countless hints and countless things that led up directly to that scene. But the Great Hall scene could have easily been changed without changing any of the previous books. However, it happens to be one of my favorite scenes in the series. I really enjoy the fact that despite all the of Dumbledore's planning, he messed up. And I find it hilarious that his mess-up actually resulted in Harry being able to survive, and that the only reason Harry even gained power of the Elder Wand was a simple struggle between Harry and his school-boy nemesis - and they didn't even use magic! And Harry did it to save his friends, so out of left field comes a small version of the whole series. Voldemort only took the Elder Wand to kill Harry - because he feared Death. Harry unknowingly came to be the wand's master because of his "saving people thing", or rather, his love for them. It reinforces how futile Voldemort's outlook on life is - how doomed a person with those values is - that maybe, just maybe, Dumbledore didn't need to plan anything, maybe, just maybe Dumbledore was wrong, and prophecies /do/ mean something, and maybe, just maybe love really is the greatest strength of all.

Anyway, thanks for reading, if you did. I know I ramble, but I love the ending of the series, and I feel that a lot of people don't. I just like the spread the love!

Sorry, if I'm misremembering, but didn't the yew wand break when Harry cast the spell at Voldemort when he was escaping Privet Drive?

Also I think saying that Harry didn't deserve to win is missing the point a bit. Harry defeated Voldemort because of the sacrifice his mother made for him. He was able to use the power of the sacrifice because Voldemort is evil as fuck and fractured his soul to the point where he can no longer comprehend it.

I think this is the point - that other people's actions imbued Harry with this strange bit of power that was precisely what was needed to defeat Voldemort. I don't think the book is trying to hide the fact that this happened. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the plot arc had started with this as the base idea and everything else had sprung from it, that's how central to the books I think this idea is.

** It started poorly, it ended poorly, and the middle had several sections that were painfully uninteresting.

The start that sucks is the Battle of Seven Potters, better known as 'the tactical disaster that anyone who's been paying attention would be able to plan better'. It wouldn't be so bad, even funny from a 'they really thought that was smart?' way except that those plans ended up with so many bad outcomes.

Mad-Eye Moody died.

HEDWIG died... in a cage...

George was maimed.

Our intelligence as readers was insulted, and so the real injury is to the willful suspension of disbelief. Mind you, I was thereby prepared for them to fail spectacularly which would ramp up the tension, but it really did more harm than good.

The ending sucked, in that the method of Harry's victory hinged on some overly complicated and unreliable circumstances. Thematically, his victory happened in the forest, but then we got a replacement duel that was so cheesy it made me think of John Wayne movies: despite everything before it, the ending is a duel of leaders won in a single shot, whilst no one did shit but watch them posture and taunt, and then fire. Bad guy dies.

Between this is a bunch of muddling around that stressed our patience just as much as Ron's, to the point that I felt a little jealous that he was getting to step away from the monotony while I was still stuck reading about it.

That's... the beginning of my issues with the last book. I'm sure others can chime in with more, and I'd hate to hog the rant space.

Why did Harry go back one more time? Because Albus wanted him protected a few more weeks while the wedding arrangements were made? So Harry has time to save the Dursleys? What strategic value did that have?

As a sacrifice move, it was pointless and expensive, and the fact that they only lost two and an ear is basically miraculous, given the chaos of open battle.

Here's the too-easy version: Hedwig gets disillusioned and sent to deliver a note to Ron; send Tonks to the Dursleys looking like Piers Polkiss; have Harry take a Polyjuice of Piers and leave; then have Tonks leave as Petunia. Leave the area by portkey or side-along apparation at wherever the transit's next stop was. Rendezvous at the Burrow. Harry's trunk is left behind to maintain the illusion that he's still there. The Dursleys can be moved out whenever.

Done.

****** As a writer, I would have set up a reason why returning to Privet drive was necessary. I would have had Moody, Tonks and Lupin show up at his door a week early of a sudden and have them shuffle Harry and the Dursleys out, creating a running battle where Harry is pursued on a broom. Vernon protests too long and gets murdered despite Petunia urging him to go along, then the surviving two Dursleys get disapparated to a safe place.

All sorts of hijinks could ensue as Harry tries to find a quiet place to get a breath and escape to safety, knowing that any spell or attempt at apparation would be detected.

Hedwig would have died saving him from a killing curse as in the movie- because that's the right way to do it. Hedwig's death was the symbol of Harry's departure from childhood, but she deserved a better death than being treated like an action figure accessory.

Ginny, Luna and Neville might have gone along- the younger girls having ditched their wands so as not to get caught. Help doesn't have to be spells- Dobby helped quite a bit with limited capabilities. For one thing, they really could have used a cook.

Voldemort's death would have been a mad rush of spell casting upon seeing Harry dead, with his protection turning the outcome into a Battle of Agincourt rout, seeing as all his loved ones were temporarily immune to death.

When the dust settled, Harry would be missing along with the cloak, suggesting that Harry had escaped death or returned the Hallow to him. The epilogue would have been Luna describing a creature hunt to the Weasley clan, but it reveals that she tracked him down in a cafe on Mykonos. No scar on his head, no glasses- just a guy living a quiet life.

Good point. Basically, the approach of the "grown-ups" to the conflict was to avoid conflict as much as possible, saving their strength for one last battle. (To be fair, it worked, albeit through a deus ex machina.) The plan was consistent with that: the goal was to minimize risk to Harry, not to maximize the ratio of enemy attrition to friendly attrition.

** - Harry being a Horcrux is weird considering that Voldemort couldn't even touch him before the resurrection ritual negated Lily's protection, yet somehow a piece of his soul survived being attached to Harry just fine for all those years.
- Harry naming his second son after someone who manipulated him throughout most of his youth.
- Hermione and Ron actually marrying and having children together (although lately I'm starting to feel grateful for that, as it has sparked lots of stories about better relationships, Harry-Hermione would probably have faced less of a backlash and I wouldn't have so many amazing dramione and snamione stories to read), I frankly can't think of a relationship more likely to fail. I'd have preferred her ending up alone, or even better, the epilogue not having been included at all.
- The epilogue, everyone ending up with their high school sweet hearts...
- They won the battle against death eaters (questionable, they ran after their leader died) and their leader, but the ministry was still clearly rounding up Muggleborns and such, what happened to that, were there followup battles, did they all just give up when Voldy died? If so, did they all get punished this time or did most of them just got off with a slap on the wrists (again)? It wasn't just a terrorist organization like in the first war, the entire country's infrastructure was complying, one battle, even one as conclusive as the one in the book would not have ended that.

*** You obviously only watched the movies.

Unlike the movie, the final battle in the book was an annihilation battle against Voldemort's army.

Voldemort, in his arrogance, walked straight into Hogwarts courtyard, where disapparation was not possible and thus a death trap. Hundreds of new fighters led by Slughorn, scores of centaurs, and many thestrals attacked his back at once. Because of Harry's voluntary sacrifice, none of Voldemort's spells was binding against Hogwarts defenders.

Unfortunately, none of that was mentioned in the movie.

**** Don't tell me what I have or haven't read. I've read books 1-5 in Dutch and English, and book 6 and 7 in English.

I haven't read book 7 since it came out though, since I hated it a lot at the time. So some details might have merged with the movies.

And I knew about Voldemort's spells not harming the defenders, if you search my post history you'll see I've actually quoted the exact passage explaining it once a few months ago.

The main character I identified with in the series was paired with the main character I hated from book 1 on, even if there were no other issues, I'd still hate deathly hallows (and HBP).

** Specific events and issues aside, I have two major issues with DH:

- Pacing/editing. My impression when reading the book was that Rowling wrote this sprawling thing, and then, some point, she realized that she really was running out of space, and rushed to wrap up the ending, creating very inconsistent pacing. My speculation is that she had the money and the popularity to ignore her editors (who would have advised her to cut some stuff from the first 2/3), and the books paid the price.
- Protagonists win through luck, not hard work and competence (except for Hermione's largely logistical contributions). Again, this is speculation, but I think that Rowling pulled a Calvinist version of an Ayn Rand (or, for more recent example, a LessWrong): there are moral themes and contrasts she wanted to set up, and she did so to the detriment of plot and characterization. [[/u/Taure]] post in the thread summarized it nicely: yes, "accidents", which make perfect sense if one postulates a Hand of Fate that will ensure the good guys win, if they keep their hands clean and not engage in icky activities like guerrilla warfare.

*Edit:* Clarification.

** The structure of the story was good, and the battle was well thought out (the books in reverse, thought I saw a post about it somewhere on [[/r/harrypotter]]). But I get the idea that in order to reach that well thought out ending, some things were overlooked (I still have 3 theories on how Harry survived in the end (blood protection, only one soul has to part or wand allegiance)) and the wandlore was, as someone else here said already, a pretty big Deus Ex Machina.

I also don't know why it was so important to only have Harry, Ron and Hermione hunting down the horcruxes. Why not take Bill and Fleur with them for example? They're loyal and both talented curse breakers. Also, the whole idea of leaving Ginny for her own safety was a bit weird. Many people saw how close they were towards the end of HBP and it wouldn't surprise me if Voldemort ordered Draco and Snape to report about Harry's life and relationships. I don't see Voldemort getting fooled by the break-up.

About the trace: how hard can it be to remove it? I don't imagine it impossible, and a smart and crafty witch like Ginny would surely find out a way around it? I think the whole leaving Ginny behind thing was nothing more than a means to end the series with Harry, Ron and Hermione.

** I liked it is a whole.

Pros:

1.  After HBP's drought of action, the frequent fight scenes were welcome.

2.  Really liked how the book brought you into the 'anyone can die' mindset early on with Hedwig's death.

3.  Voldemort taking over the ministry and Hogwarts via coup was a masterstroke no one saw coming. The Death Eater Government was handled well.

4.  There was an air of mystery right from the start, with Dumbledore's Will and the Deathly Hallows.

5.  Dobby's death was done really well.

6.  The Battle of Hogwarts started out awesome. Voldemort giving Hogwarts his ultimatum and McGonagall spelling the suits of armor for battle give me chills to this day. The chaos of battle and the slow feeling of hopelessness when it seemed that everyone was dying and the defenders were surely going to lose and Harry walking to his death: amazing.

7.  Dat Snape/McGonagall duel.

8.  Many people didn't like it, but I thought the Harry death and resurrection was very thematically appropriate. Harry did what Lily Potter had done all those years ago, the event that was the focal point of the series, and I absolutely love parallels like this. Lily's sacrifice won them the first war, and Harry's sacrifice was the turning point of the second.

9.  The Dumbledore-Grindelwald backstory. Dumbledore revealed to not have been such a goody two-shoes after all. Harry's crumbling faith in Dumbledore and his obsession with the Hallows made for excellent storytelling.

10. “Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn't it?”

    "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding."

    "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you, but no pressure."

    "Don't let it worry you...It's me. I'm extremely famous."

    Never change Ron, never change.

And the cons:

1. Dammit Ron, /why don't you change?/ But seriously, Ron walking out /again/ has to be the least favorite moment in the series. Not only was it repetitive, but it completely negated his character development of the last two books. And we were stuck with Harry and Hermione angsting together for the next few chapters. /Sigh/.

2. Snape's death was kinda eh. A major character should have had a more fitting death.

3. The Deathly Hallows part of the book seemed quite tacked on. I liked the mystery of it early on, but ultimately it fell flat. It was as if Rowling couldn't think of any plausible way to kill off Voldemort, so she made up a super wand just to backfire on him.

4. Far too little of Ginny. Luna was present for quite a bit, but she didn't really do anything until she distracted everyone after the battle got over for Harry to make his getaway. I can't help but be disappointed that two of my favorite characters barely did anything, while another was mishandled. Still, the lack of Ginny brought me into fanfiction, so there's that.

So, overall, it had plenty of good stuff, and some not so good. Not as entertaining as PoA or GoF, but easily beats out HBP.

No it completed it. So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him ("He beat you") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.

** The story spent several months on a dangerous camping trip. Harry magically had to die, but was somehow reborn. Pairings were rushed out of nowhere. Ron/Hermione should never have happened. Deathly Hallows were a great addition to the overall story, but seemingly just appeared out of nowhere, just seemed to be useless filler. "Friendship is magic" defeats the most evil dark lord of the later century. Epilogue had Ron being a dick to muggles. Draco didn't go to jail. Narcissa didn't go to jail.

Honestly, the more I read it, the more I disliked it. I was expecting an epic ending, or some kind of cleverness used to destroy Voldemort. Instead, I got this shit.

It's probably more the epilogues fault for that than anything else. I of course dislike the Ron/Hermione pairing, but I don't dislike the Ginny/Harry pairing, despite what others may think.

***** Good point. I think it's because especially Harry had the idea that relationships and such should wait until after Voldemort was killed. He constantly tries to push his friends away (which gets quite annoying tbh). From the end of book 5 he knows it's him or Voldemort. That's not really helping him build a steady relationship.

In the end it's JKR's choice. She had the idea of writing an adventure book for teenagers, not a romance novel. So she put relationships and boy/girl stuff on the background most of the time. Her book, her choice.

I personally felt like Harry should have been more upset with dumbledore. It seemed like the only reason he got angry at him was because Dumbledore didn't tell him about his personal life, instead of leading him on this gigantic ass scavenger hunt around the country to kill Voldemort.\\
The pacing was uneven to me, especially towards the end. They're having issues all year, but all of a sudden they find and destroy 4 horcruxes within a day or two?\\

** I think the biggest "hate" gets directed at the epilouge, my own displeasure with it included. The epilouge felt off and cheesy.

Then of course the hunt for the McGuffin(s)... sigh. The Horcruxes were, for my taste, a bad replacement for what could've been an existing civil war story. There were even some aspects of that in the book. The Resistance Radio, "Potter Watch" for example.

Also, one could only ignore the incredibly stupid setup for the hunt, if one wanted to enjoy the books. But you all have read enough Dumbledore bashing to know whats up.

Also, the battles were an insult to our intelligence. The extraction of Harry from Privet Drive was laughably stupid. Getting married with hundreds of guests (including high-value targets) in the middle of a civil war is stupid. The list goes on...

And the ending was also rather unsatisfying. The end of Harry's martyrium was actually well done (if you isolate that one scene). Having the hero go before his nemesis to die for the cause is a often used and, in this case, well done way of ending a story. The following duel however... But hey, it ended as it started.

She does explain that he does it in sheer arrogance, but it still remains terribly contrived. Yes, i know that I have said 'contrived' twice. Three times now.

**** The concept of the horcruxes to me feels incomplete. Why seven? Why not 3 a magical number, safer, and tied more with his birth. Why horcruxes instead of something else? And why the hell were they so easy to get? And lets be honest here they were easy to get. Three school children got rid of the majority of them. Dumbledore only succombed to the curse on the ring because he was stupid. Harry and the gang had more trouble getting the locket than breaking into Gringotts. And to say that the cup wasnt cursed was stupid. And what about the amazing plan to kill dumbledore in 6th year?. They let death eaters in via a magical cabinet, hidden in a room full of hidden things, using Darkness powder and a hand of glory. They then create a barrier that is impossible to cross without a dark mark, fight off order members so they dont reach the impassible barrier. Then afterward, they run thru the castle, instead of making a porkey, or flying on the brooms that are right infront of them. Alrighty then. It wasnt the seventh book that everyone should be hating on. Its the sixth. But i digress. Your comment was focused on the concept of horcruxes. My issue with JKR's story is that the concept of horcruxes took over stopping Voldemort they were not the same thing. It was a glorfied treasure hunt for things that felt incomplete to me, while at the same time attempting to make you care about how Harry Hermione and Ron are still teenagers doing something that should have been done by more than just them. Never mind that every single story before the deathly hallows, has the gang saving themselves or surviving. That was the issue. Instead of having them fall into whatever twisted scheme there was, she attempted to force the adventure along .

** The problem, for me, with HPDH is that it mixes two different fantasy conceptions of magic, and does a worse job of it than the previous books. Harry Potter had a sort "scientific" paradigm to its magic. There were methods, if you understood them you could use them, using them creatively lead to victory. It's essentially a video game, or perhaps Magic the Gathering, view of magic as granting powers that can be used in particular ways and countered in other ways.

By contrast, you have a "mystical" view of in-world magic more typical of say Lord of the Rings. The Ring doesn't give any particular powers for the most part, instead it just IS. Gandalf doesn't go around casting Avada Kedavra, he just IS magical.

I don't mind the horcruxes, the mechanics behind them were if anything a little too fleshed out, but what the book in my view should/could have been was an elaborate magical heist film. Harry and co. using tactics and strategy of magic to obtain and destroy the horcruxes, ending in beating Voldemort by clever strategem.

Instead, the magic ceases to be scientific, as in the rest of the book, and becomes mystical. Harry doesn't win by being quicker, or more knowledgeable, or having the better hand; he wins because reasons. That's a really unsatisfying conclusion. Essentially all the mechanical aspects of the world that we've learned (That AK is unblockable and lethal, that Voldemort is incredibly powerful, etc.) are thrown out and replaced with mystical golbedegook.
