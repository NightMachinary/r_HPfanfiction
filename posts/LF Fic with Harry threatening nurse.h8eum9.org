:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read some time ago, the moment I remember most clearly was that Harry and Teddy was at St Mungos (I think, might have been some other hospital) and Harry had to leave Teddy to a nurse.

​

When he did so he threatened the nurse quite seriously with pretty much death if the and Teddy was not in the agreed upon spot whenever he was finished.

​

Anybody know what fic it is?


** I think it's one where he travels back in time because of a vault full of Pixy dust. I think he goes by the name peverell in that story.

*** That's a JacobApples fic, I think Laughing All The Way To London but not positive, could be one of the others.

** I believe the story you are looking for is Laughing All the Way to London by JacobApples

She frowned up at him, "It's a hospital, sir. No one gets attacked in a hospital." Harry smiled at her, and it was his smile that Hermione had called the sign that he had a few loose screws, "I am the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts. I do not know you, I do not trust you. You will sit in that room you say you will be in or you will return my son to me." Her expression turned dark. "Or what?" His smile grew, "Or I will make Albus Dumbledore look like a charlatan." She paled, took Teddy's hand, saying, "Hey little Peverell, why don't you tell me about your pet snake?"

*** It baffles me to read adults written like that.

Threatening a medical professional with violence is when you're pointed to the exit door and told to seek medical services elsewhere. Also, you should fiercely hope to not be blacklisted.

**** I agree Redditor K! It's not "badass" or "cool" it's just being an asshole with violent tendencies and bad impulse control! You'd just get told to leave or arrested for it. People wouldn't just take it and accept it like these fanfic authors love to write fantasies about.

**** It happens a lot more than you think. A good doctor wouldn't refuse to treat a kid over this. One could expect security to show up though.

**** The full paragraph quote gave me some more memory of the fic and in context of Harry (hopefully avoiding spoilers) it is fully understandable (honestly in canon quite a few of them should have issues with the more violent forms of PTSD and paranoia after the war).

***** I mean, canon Harry has a reminder to distrust people in authority literally etched in his skin. Any degree of realistic repercussions to his psyche from canon would mean he's proper fucked up.
