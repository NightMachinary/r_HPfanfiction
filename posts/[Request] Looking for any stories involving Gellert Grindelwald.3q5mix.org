doesn't have to be a large component of the story but I would prefer that, longer stories are prefered as well.


** There are 2 fics with Grindelwald I recall reading and somewhat enjoying.

One is linkffn(Phantasy by Tsume Yuki), the other can't remember the title, but the basic premise was Grindelwald breaking out of Nurmendard, snatching Harry through Privet Drive's wards and raising him.

Found another 2 on my Kindle that I have yet to read, so no promises on quality of writing and story: linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord; The Skitterleap by enembee).

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry

*** Altered Destinies is nice, features the second world war with Grindelwald pulling the strings on the German side.

One downside (at least in my opinion): it features an insanely powerful Harry, which I don't really like.

That said, the writing and style is generally good and I enjoyed the story in general.

** My favorite fic involving Grindelwald is [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]. It's epistolary style which is different, but some of the best writing I've ever seen.
