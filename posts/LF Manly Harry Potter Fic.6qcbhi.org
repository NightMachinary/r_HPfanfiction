I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm so sick of all this angsty-ass harry potter fics where harry is just so fckn emotional. I just want him man tf up and become like a strong leader of the light or something. Maybe he did get abused as a child but he should just put it aside and focus on his goal. When Sirius dies, he shouldn't become a mopy-ass mf but instead focus it all on revenge. I know that he probably is like that in cannon but I'm just looking for something different. btw I'm not talking about manly, like in girl's romance stories, like a dominant guy who is a dick to girls but somehow makes the women fall in love. I'm talking manly, like Rambo, Rocky Balboa, John Mclane or my favorite Captain America. I'm not american btw. thanks :)


** I would say pretty much EVERY post OOTP indy!Harry fic.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
