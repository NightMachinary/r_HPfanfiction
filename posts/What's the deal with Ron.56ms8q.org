Ron doesn't get much respect in the fandom. In fanfiction he's quite often a piece of shit without any redeeming features.

It's a shame, because he's by far the most charismatic and funny of the Golden Trio. Canon Ron is wittier than both Harry and Hermione, and what he lacks in tact he makes up for with dark humor.

All of my favourite lines in the books come from Ron:

#+begin_quote
  "That really captures the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn't it?"

  "Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favour."

  "Well, I don't know how to break this to you... but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts."

  "From now on, I don't care if my tea leaves spell, ‘Die, Ron, die,' I'm chucking them in the bin where they belong."
#+end_quote

That last quote had me laughing for 5 straight minutes when I first read it. Admit it, even at his most immature (like the "amazing bouncing ferret," or his Uranus joke) Ron still made you crack a smile.

Unfortunately, almost no fanfiction attempts to capture Ron's humor. He's often turned into a bumbling fool --- the butt of the joke --- instead being the sarcastic comedian he's supposed to be. If Harry is the prince of sass, then Ron is the king of sarcasm.

 

I blame a lot of this on the films. I know you've probably heard this complaint before, but the movies really did do Ron a disservice. He gets none of the great lines mentioned above. His role as comedic relief is expressed entirely through [[http://i.giphy.com/2afVidyGcVnwI.gif][goofy facial expressions]]. When people think of Ron, they often think of the film portrayal, rather than the real Ron from the books.

On top of that, I suspect some people in this subreddit have been reading so much fanfiction that their perception of Ron has been warped even further.

It's like a cycle of abuse: *fanfiction portrays Ron poorly* → *fans gain a poor perception of Ron* → *fans write more fanfiction that portrays Ron poorly*.

It's a damn shame, because Ron's dark sarcastic wit is honestly his most attractive trait. Ron's humor is what relives the tension whenever Harry get's sulky or Hermione starts to panic. His role in the trio is to stop the other two from having a stress induced stroke.

Taking that away from Ron is like taking away Hermione's brains.

I know you've likely heard all of this before, but I need to rant. I just read some upvoted comments on this subreddit that claimed "Ron wouldn't be a good friend," which is just bullshit. The controversial truth is that book-Ron is the most charismatic of the trio. Whenever the trio had a falling out, Ron could find new friends to hang out with (like Lavender in HBP or Dean and Seamus in GoF), while Harry or Hermione would just sulk by themselves.

Each of the trio has their own strengths and weaknesses, and Ron's strength is his wit and charisma. Without Ron, Hermione would explode from anxiety and Harry would spend all day moping alone in the corner like the tragic orphan hero he is.

It's a damn shame just how much damage the films have done to Ron's perceived character. Honestly, it pisses me off.

 

Also, while I'm writing this huge wall of text I might as well address a couple of other misconceptions about Ron.

 

- "*Ron's best trait is his loyalty*"

This is obviously bullshit, seeing as he runs away in book 7 and he has a fight with Harry in book 4. Really, Hermione is more unwavering loyal than Ron.

As I said above, Ron's best trait is his humor and charisma. He's the emotional core of the group, just like Hermione is the mental core.

People often complain that the camping stuff in book 7 is a miserable slog to read through, and the reason for that is because Ron's normal charm is absent. That's the whole point of the camping chapters; that without Ron's regular antics Harry and Hermione become sulky, unproductive and unhappy.

 

- "*Ron is a pussy*"

In the films, Ron is indeed a massive pussy. However, in the books, he never hesitates to follow Harry into danger. Hermione is the voice of reason, while Ron is just as reckless as Harry.

Ron is also the most brutal of the trio. I know people often give Hermione shit for disfiguring Marietta Edgecombe, but Ron is also a hard mother fucker. While Harry choose to use Expelliarmus during the broomstick chase at the start of book 7, Ron had no problem stunning Death Eaters in the face and letting them fall to their doom. Ron was also the one who suggested killing the snatchers in the cafe after Bill's weeding.

Ron's always ready to do what needs to be done.

 

- "*Ron is unloyal*"

I know I know, I just said that loyalty isn't Ron's primary role in the trio. However, that doesn't mean that he isn't loyal. Ron risks his life for Harry a bunch of times, which is something not many people are prepared to do for their friends. He only has a falling out with Harry twice, and one of those times was only because of the Horcrux.

Additionally, I think the fight between Harry and Ron in book 4 is massively overblown by the fandom. In universe it only lasted for a short while, and, in my opinion, Harry is also largely responsible. Harry makes absolutely no attempts to reconcile with Ron after their initial spat, and in the end it was Ron who put his feelings aside for the sake of their friendship. We empathize with Harry because we see things from his perspective, but I suspect that we would have empathized with Ron too if he was the protagonist.

The saddest moment in the series for me is actually in GoF, right after Harry finishes talking to Sirius in the fireplace. Ron comes down the stairs and asks Harry why he's still awake, and it seems like after weeks of ignoring each other Harry and Ron will finally start talking again. But alas, because his conversation with Sirius was cut short Harry is in a bad mood, and so he insults Ron and throws a badge at his head. It's tragic because that was the perfect opportunity for them to be friends again --- hell, Ron probably only came downstairs because he was worried about Harry not being in his bed. It's such a relatable, immature and human moment that it makes me more emotional than even the major character deaths later in the series. The line about Ron's pajama's being too short gets me every time.

 

Sorry for ranting. My point is that Ron isn't a piece of shit. I can understand if Ron is your least favourite of the Golden Trio, but that doesn't mean he's worthless or unnecessary.

The guy goes on to co-own a joke shop, so for goodness sake write him some jokes in your fanfiction.

 

 

Edit: I wrote the following in response to a comment. I'll add it here too, because it address a few other things I didn't mention originally.

 

#+begin_quote
  Ron is a bad friend
#+end_quote

Nah, Ron's a great friend. And as I said above, the incidents of Ron breaking up with Harry are totally overblown by the fandom. In GoF they were both acting immature, and so they ignored each other for a couple weeks. Big deal. Have you never argued with a friend? Harry forgave Ron instantly, so it's about time you forgive Ron too.

As for the time in Deathly Hallows, I think that is the most misinterpreted moment in the books.

Look, I have some very close friends that I've known for decades. However, I honestly doubt that they would risk their life for me the way Ron risks his life for Harry. Ron is in constant peril throughout the series because of Harry, yet he always pulls through and puts his friendship before than his own safety.

What more do you fucking want? How high are your standards? You would be alone forever if you judged your real life friends the way you judged Ron.

Ron gets mad when his friends are insulted. He feels happy to see his friends succeed. He feels scared when his friends are in danger. That makes him a better friend than most people I know.

And look, even if you ignore all I've said above, Ron is still a good friend. Friendship is 90% about enjoying somebody's company, and Harry and Hermione both enjoy Ron's company more than they enjoy the company of anybody else.

 

#+begin_quote
  I call bullshit on him being the calm one of the trio! That's Harry
#+end_quote

Each of the trio are calm under certain circumstances.

Harry is calm when facing immediate danger, put he becomes hysterical when his loved ones are in danger, like what happened with Sirius, or when Dumbledore was killed.

Hermione can think deeply and rationally, but she becomes overwhelmed when she's under pressure. We saw her get stressed all the time.

Ron can become flustered and angry whenever he's embarrassed (usually because of Malfoy) or because his friends and family are insulted (almost always because of Malfoy), but other than that he's a chill dude. I'm racking my brains, but I can't actually think of a single situation in which he panicked in the face of danger. He got more scared over embarrassing himself during Quidditch than he ever did fighting Death Eaters.

Remember when Hermione panics while caught in the devils snare, and Ron is the voice of reason that snaps her out of it? Or when Hermione is super stressed leading up to the raid on the ministry and Ron reassures her, just like he used to do when she anxious over the exams?

Ron is relaxed about the things that stress Hermione, like her excessive attention to detail and future anxiety. Hermione is calm regarding the things that make Harry emotional, like his cynicism and his "saving people thing." Harry isn't embarrassed by Quidditch, insults and other things that can stress Ron.

They each compliment each other.


** I feel that the problem with Ron for many people is simply that he is /too/ relatable. While we all want to identify as Harry, I feel that many of us see a lot more similarities between ourselves and Ron. We may have family that we take for granted, always wishing for more or better material possessions rather than being thankful for the things we have (compared to the orphan Harry).

Personally, I see a lot of myself in Ron through his study habits. They seem so human, always procrastinating in regards to his schoolwork and leaving assignments to the last minute. It's possible that bashing Ron may be a way for people to distance themselves from these characteristics that we may be ashamed of about ourselves and our own failings. Regardless, it's not an excuse to have so many fics bash on him so often, but it's still something I can sort of understand.

*** In a similar thread from a week ago or so there was a litany of people taking about Ron being insufferable because he goes to a magic school and slacks on his homework or doesn't spend hours in the restricted section learning as much as he can. Of course he slacks off and isn't too curious, this is what he grew up with/around. It's the same as us writing fanfic instead of writing science papers and solving equations in our spare time. It's boring and mundane for him.

That's bugged me.

So I filled in some headcannon to ease my irritation with Harry. Harry had been worked hard by assholes his whole life and suddenly he's warm, has friends, is well fed and he has a choice to slack or not. He slacks.

Understandable.

By year 3 he should have picked up a clue that he needs to get ready because the world is trying it's damnedest to kill him.

So should Ron, for the same reasons.

And yes OP, Ron is a far better friend than I've ever had despite having had/having now some great friends. Standing on a broken leg to shield your buddy from a mass murderer? Yeah, that's a great friend.

**** Don't know if I believe that those two things can be directly comparable. I mean, look at lab classes for example. I had a lot of fun in lab classes; I've build tesla coils, prepared explosions and colorful minerals and done work with wood and metal. It's all very direct and practical.

Theoretical physics on the other is very abstract and something that would usually only be used indirectly and often very far into the future. I think magic classes would be more comparable to lab classes more than theoretical classes.

And yeah, if I woke up as an 11 year old on the hogwarts express tomorrow I'd probably not spend all my time studying, but playing around with magic? Maybe learning how to create dancing creatures of fire or raise statues of water from the lake just because I could? That I'd damn well do.

The trope with a 24/7 studying main character is somewhat unbelievable, especially since young children usually don't have that kind of determination, not saying it doesn't happen, only that it happens rarely. But I do agree with most of the points made here.

One thing that might be worth pointing out is that Rowling wrote characters that actually act their ages most of the time, which fanfiction authors rarely does. For good and ill.

**** But Harry's saving people thing isn't presented as a flaw in the story. Flaws cause their characters to feel repercussions for their actions, and Harry rarely gets more than a slap on the wrist for this actions.

Probably the worst thing that comes out of Harry trying to save people (and it remotely pinned on Harry) is Sirius dying in the Ministry. And even that is painted as "he could've taken Bellatrix seriously", or "he didn't need to come to the ministry".

If Harry's saving people thing actually had reprucussions, he'd have lost a couple untrained students to trained violent criminals in the Ministry, Voldemort would've won, or something more would've happened. The entire experience was a net positive for Harry, even factoring in Sirius' death (which was basically the only negative).

I can't think of any other situation where Harry is obsessed with saving people, this leads to a bad situation, this bad situation is rightfully blamed on Harry, and it strongly factors into the plot.

In fact, in a few situations it actually has a positive effect. In OOTP it got the ministry to seriously fight Voldemort, stopped Voldemort from going after the prophecy, let Harry actually learn the prophecy, had Voldemort stop trying to read Harry's mind, got Umbrige out of Hogwarts, let Harry learn why Voldemort is so interested in him, and leads to Malfoy's arrest.

Literally the only downside is that Sirius died, which affects Harry for a sum total of 3-5 chapters.

Compare this to Ron abandoning Harry and Hermione in DH, where the repercussions dramatically affect Ron (and his interactions with others) for much of the rest of the story.

We aren't satisfied with that, so we "strive" to be someone "better" and more "exceptional", like Harry or Hermione. It took me a long while to realize it, but Ron hate mostly is about fundamental insecurity with one's situation in life.

Agreed. Before the advent of the films, Ron was pretty much Hermione in terms of their popularity. Everyone simply loved Ron, and being an H/Hr shipper and a Ron lover was not mutually exclusive as it is pretty much the case now. But bit by bit, the films put his popularity into question, particularly with PoA and GoF, where Ron's characterization is placed in a much more negative light (Ron's reaction to Snape calling Hermione a know-it all, Hermione saying "kill us before you get to Harry" instead of Ron, etc.).

I would, and have, broken friendships for far less.

Frankly, Harry forgiving Ron after the first task made me boggle in disbelief at how gracious he was being.

And how utterly magnanimous of Ron to "put his feelings aside to resolve the argument" when he was the instigator in the first place, based on trumped up charges and jealousy. What a bloody saint.

*** The thing is, this is totally normal for the age-group the characters fall into. I remember a pair of friends from middle school that would get into horrible, nasty, week/month-long spats. They wouldn't speak to each other, they'd glare and stare and avoid each-other like the plague. Then they'd make up like nothing happened --- back to two peas in a pod. The fight between Ron and Harry is natural and perfect for their characterizations because /that's what kids do/. If they got along all the time, they'd be stiff and dry characters. Breaking off a friendship /permanently/ because of childhood jealousy? That's /way/ more immature. Thank goodness kids are wise enough to forgive and forget.

And remember that this series is from Harry's point of view. We are biased in his favor (besides him being the main character) and thus are limited to his side of the argument. Just because we live in Harry's head doesn't mean Ron does.

I know what you're saying. I used to remember the conflict between Harry and Ron as some epic feud, but after rereading GoF I changed my opinion.

Their initial argument was actually really tame; it only lasted 10 seconds and neither of them said anything too bad. What followed that initial spat was a couple weeks of ignoring each other, which isn't actually that bad either.

I think that either of them could have diffused the situation if they wanted, and it was just their stubbornness that kept it going for so long. I'm confident that if Harry had just approached Ron or made any effort to sort things out, then Ron would have apologized and they would have been friends again. Ron didn't genuine believe Harry put his name in the Goblet, he was just mad at the thought of another year of being irrelevant. They whole things was just stupid and immature.

I'm not saying that Ron was in the right. He should have apologized, and he did. However, Ron wasn't being malicious, and he didn't actually do anything to Harry other than ignore him. Harry also could have stopped things from escalating if he wasn't so stubborn, so I think he was partially responsible too.

The whole situation was just stupid, and I fully empathize with how frustrating it must have been for Hermione.

It certainly wasn't the massive fight or falling out that the fandom pretends it is. Hermione is far more actively belligerent during her jealously of Lavender in book 6, yet the fandom has forgiven her. I suppose unrequited love is more relatable and romantic than Ron's insecurities.

But whatever. If Harry forgave Ron then I don't see why you should still feel affronted after all these years.

#+end_quote

But the point is why should Harry have had to approach Ron? Ron is the one who let his jealousy get away from him. It shouldn't be Harry's responsibility to go to Ron after Ron fucks off.

Extra bit on the whole Harry forgave Ron. This is kind of a complex situation. Ron is the first friend Harry ever had. In other words, at age 14, the longest that Harry had had a friend was 3 years. Harry would have allowed a certain level of sway for Ron simply for being his first friend. No matter Ron's kinda crummy behaviour he was Harry's first friend and Harry would let him get away with things that he shouldn't have.

However, I do I agree with you on the whole Ron's incompetence and such is overblown, but Harry has granted Ron a lot of leeway simply for being his first friend, and i think that level of leeway is too much. Don't forget as well, both in GoF and DH, the times where Harry forgave Ron where times if life or death situations. Adrenaline running high, endorphins, he quite possibly wasn't thinking straight. Not saying he shouldn't have forgiven Ron at all, but when you combine the first friend leeway, and the adrenaline at the time, I think it's clear to see that Ron's instant forgiveness at the hands of Harry are due to "outside interference"

He shouldn't have had to, and he ultimately didn't have to as Ron did indeed come around in the end.

But just because he shouldn't have to doesn't mean he couldn't have. The whole situation could have easily been defused if Harry and Ron just talked things out like adults.

I don't think so. Whenever they fought Harry had expressed regret, missed Ron's company and wished they were back together again.

In GoF Ron and Harry both get detention after mutually protecting Hermione from Snape, and Harry then hopes that this will make things normal between them again, yet neither of them attempt to talk to each other. In DH, Harry and Ron both instantly regret splitting up, but Ron can't return because Hermione's defensive charms and concealment charms are too good.

Harry genuinely loves having Ron as a friend, and he remarks that Hermione's company just isn't the same. Ron is Harry's best friend, not just some "first friend" that Harry tolerates only out of obligation.

** I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that the fandoms' issues with Ron have less to do with Ron as a character and more to do with frustrations with Harry. One of the overwhelming themes in much of Harry Potter fanfiction is to fill in the blanks of not only the Wizarding World but also Harry's family (and his own history.) Because one of the most frustrating aspects of Harry's character is his distinct lack of curiousity about his new world, his family, and magic in general. Its odd because we do see Harry curious about whatever mystery he finds himself in every year, but by the end of the seven books we know more about Tom Riddles family than we do about Harry's. (Like his grandparents names or family's occupations.) Which is baffling considering Harry seems to soak up any information about his parents, but he doesn't actually go looking for it. And so much of fanfiction goes searching for those answers. So what does this have to do with Ron? Ron also lacks curiosity because he doesn't need it. He grew up in the Wizarding World and he knows his family. And I think much of the fandom criticism of Ron is trying to explain WHY Harry has this weird incongruency in his personality. Why doesn't Harry go looking for this information? One explanation is his closest relationships. The answer isn't going to be his relationship with Hermione because she's extraordinarily curious, so exasperating Ron's flaws (his insecurities, his laziness, his jealousy, etc) is a lazy way to explain why Harry isn't curious about his own life.

** I will never understand the hate towards Ron. I will admit that GoF was my least favorite book when I was a kid. I hated Harry's and Ron's fight (there are other reasons too). I thought it was stupid and pointless. But now that I'm older and have reread GoF several times I realized it's part of growing up. When I entered college, I stopped talking to my friend because she got a boyfriend. I was jealous. I quickly got over that and when I told her that we just laughed about it.

It's natural to feel jealous toward your friends despite everything. Ron was just being a teenager and Harry reacted like a teenager. I feel like people forget that HP is centered around teenagers.

It can seem like Hermione is more effective at helping Harry with whatever the plot of the book is, so she overshadows Ron's role. Ron is fun and good-humoured but his influence is more subtle.

** In my opinion the easiest explanation for Ron bashing comes down to the type of story being told. For the most part, Ron bashing tends to be found in AU or at least non-epilogue compliant fanfics that have Harry or Hermione as the lead. These stories tend to have either a Harmony focus or a focus on the Slytherin characters in a more positive light. These also tend to be non-canon romances too, no surprise there. I've found that usually in these stories the war with Voldemort takes a bit of a back seat, or is over if it's EWE, and someone else needs to take the spot of antagonist. Enter Ron. Ron is unfortunately easy to turn into an antagonist because of his flaws, all those things that make him human and relatable, that can be highlighted enough to make him the 'bad guy'. It's easy to take his big flaws like jealousy, temper, and laziness and focus only on those aspects while throwing out his good qualities. I feel it's less about Ron as a character, though admittedly he has his haters as seen, but more how easy it is for an author to shape him into an antagonist for their story. Ron bashing has gone on for so long in this fandom that it's easier to find fics bashing him than fics where he is a decent character. Sadly it's pretty much just fanon at this point because it's so common.

** I agree with most of what you have said however I question if Ron is the most charismatic person in the trio. I have always felt that a) a sulky Harry prefers to be alone and chooses not to have more friends and b) that with his speeches for the DA etc he must have some charisma. I remember reading that everything is bigger and exaggerated in the magical world, in fanfiction this applies to personalities. Add in people who think Hermione can do no wrong and dislike her for 'settling' for Ron in cannon and you find him a victim of character assassination.

** Honestly, I don't like the characterization of any of the characters after 4th book. It's because last 3 books became in-between of child fic & coming of age fic. And unfortunately represented neither. Which causes fans to hate Ginny because her character is undeveloped, she stuck as Mary-Sue isk character & a trophy wife. Fans feel Harry deserves more than a trophy wife(which is incidentally someone who married a Weasley). This Ginny hate also brings Ron & in general Weasley hate. And JKR did as best as she could to make a OBHWF which obviously sucks as a fan. So fans have to dig out Weasley's. Bill & Charlie are cool, twins are too good to bash. This leaves us Percy, a character, I admire most among all HP characters & Ron. Unfortunately Ron is the one who had to take all bashing because Percy is too small of a character to bash.

Personally, I blame JKR for most of Ron bashing. If she didn't have that horrible piece of epilogue & kept relationship open, there'd have been way way less Weasley & Ron bashing. Infact, then we would see way more Harry-Ginny fiction. If you search, you would find there's too many H/G fictions pre HBP or DH when Ginny character had chances to develop properly. And few writers did it much better than JKR.

** Its hard to explain but the problem I have ALWAYS had with Ron is that I see him as a non factor in the entire HP story. Hes simply there. Now I know you can point to a bunch of times when hes been involved, but again, I feel like he was not necessary. As such, I dont "hate" him, but I dont mind stories where hes bashed either.

Now that said..... I think the OP missed another reason why some dont like him.

And I will admit this comes into play for me as well.

I was ALWAYS bothered he was paired with Hermione (whom I felt should of been with Harry).

As such.... there is a part of me that wants Ron gone. A part of me that thinks he is not worthy of Hermione. A part of me that thinks hes stealing a match for Harry and Harry has to "settle". A part of me that thinks he messed things up.

I DO NOT DOUBT that there are others who think the same. Whether they think she belonged with Harry or not. I know there is a large population of readers and writers and fans who think Hermione and Ron was a terrible match and they would be divorced in a year.

This could easily lead to Ron being disliked outside of the other possible reasons listed by the OP.

And OP ( [[/u/Just_in_it_for_memes]] ) if you did mention that and I missed it... sorry.

*** I try to ignore shipping because it doesn't really appeal to me. That being said, I think that the Ron/Hermione paring isn't as bad as you people think, at least not in the books.

In the books, Hermione isn't perfect. She's smart, knowledgeable and clever, but she's also antisocial, dry and not entirely emotionally stable. She's a deep and well rounded character. Her brilliance is tempered by flaws.

 

Remember that time, after Dumbledore's funeral, when Hermione brags about being right about the Half Blood Prince? Harry is busy grieving for Dumbledore, yet Hermione couldn't help but say "I told you so," as though Dumbledore's murder somehow now justifies her petty jealousy over Harry getting better results in potions.

I mean, Jesus, being a know-it-all in class isn't a big deal, but Hermione doesn't know how to turn it off.

Naturally, that moment is excluded from the films. What the films also ignore are Hermione's anxiety over exams, her panicking under pressure, her bossiness, her self-righteousness, her closed-mindedness and everything else that makes her less than perfect.

In the films, Hermione is /not/ a bushy-haired, bucktoothed easily agitated worrywort. No, in the films, Hermione is just fucking perfect.

Film Hermione is stunningly beautiful. She never panics. She never gets scared. She never makes mistakes.

When Book-Hermione is trapped underground in Gringotts, with goblins closing in on all sides, she panics. Luckily, Harry has the clever idea of escaping on the dragon, and the day is saved.

When Film-Hermione is trapped in Gringotts, she doesn't panic, because Film-Hermione is perfect. Film-Hermione has the clever idea of escaping on the dragon. Of course, Film-Hermione isn't scared while riding the dragon, 'cause, unlike Book-Hermione, Film-Hermione isn't scared of heights. Film-Hermione is perfect.

When Book-Hermione is trapped in the Devils Snare, with vines closing in on all sides, she panics. Luckily, Book-Ron keeps a clear head and guides her to a solution.

When Film-Hermione is trapped in the Devils Snare, she doesn't panic. Film-Hermione handles being under pressure just fine, because Film-Hermione is perfect. Film-Ron is, of course, screaming hysterically like a coward, and it's up to our hero Film-Hermione to save him.

This trend continues through the movies. None of Book-Hermione's flaws exist in Film-Hermione, while none of Book-Ron's positives exist in Film-Ron. /Nobody/ is good enough for Film-Hermione, /especially/ not a useless soggy napkin like Film-Ron.

 

In the books, all of Hermione's weakness are complimented by Ron's strengths. Hermione can't handle stress, while Ron rarely gets stressed by anything (outside of Quidditch). Hermione is often dull to socialize with, while Ron is always joking around. Hermione is close-minded, while Ron is open-minded.

When Hermione disregards Luna as a crackpot, Ron is there to remind her that Luna isn't too bad. When Hermione is overwrought with worry while waiting for her exam results, Ron is there reminding her that she's so brilliant that she'll certainly get Outstanding in every subject. When Hermione is on misguided moral crusade trying to forcefully free House Elves against their will, Ron is the one that sees the big picture and tells her that the elves love working at Hogwarts.

Book-Ron and Book-Hermione compliment each other perfectly. They compensate for each other's flaws. To say that they "complete each other" might be a cliche, but I think that's what Rowling was going for.

Film-Ron and Film-Hermione don't work together because Film-Hermione has no flaws and Film-Ron has no strengths.

 

Also, I don't think Harry and Hermione would make a great couple.

Unlike Ron, Harry rarely challenges Hermione on anything. Harry tries too hard to avoid conflict and doesn't call her out when she's doing something silly. Harry is annoyed by Hermione's complaining and worrying, so he pretends to go along with whatever she says even when his internal monologue shows he disagrees with it.

Remember when Harry avoided telling Hermione about Umbridge's detention because he didn't want to deal with how she'd react? Or when he avoided confronting her about Crookshanks supposedly killing Scabbers, even though he secretly agreed with Ron?

Unlike Harry, Ron doesn't shy away from Hermione's bossy side. I suspect that he and her actually enjoy debating each other. Evidence of this is in OotP; Harry is moody and yells at Ron and Hermione to stop "bickering," but Ron and Hermione are simply surprised that Harry thought they were actually arguing.

Another reason I don't think they'd be good together romantically is that Harry doesn't really have fun while alone with Hermione, relatively speaking. When Hermione and Ron are fighting in HBP Harry spends time with each of them. When he's alone with Hermione they just mope in the library while Harry secretly wishes that Ron was there.

When Ron leaves in DH, Harry and Hermione are left depressed in each others company; they barely even speak to each other. Remember, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFe0OR-Vaww][that dance scene]] is only in the movie. In the books, they spend their entire time together moping and crying.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Harry doesn't enjoy Hermione's company. They (platonically) love each other. They're amazingly close /friends./ They care about each other, they appreciate each other and they'd die for each other. However, you have to admit, they don't exactly hit it off as couple. I doubt Harry or Hermione would be happy if they were together romantically.

 

Ron and Hermione work together well. To be perfectly honest, I suspect that some of the Harry/Hermione shippers are guilty of self-inserting. Just because /you/ would love to marry Hermione (or Harry) doesn't mean that they would want to be with each other.

I know these opinions might be controversial, but fuck it. Downvote me.

On a purely intellectual level, and on a personality level, Ron and Hermione dont match up. And believe me when I say those are HUGELY important aspects in a lasting relationship.

Remember, JK herself said she regretted that pairing and the choice she made. She had originally planned for Hermione/Harry.

You are also way too heavily focusing on the "present" and not the "future" of the possible relationships. Comparing tiny little situations within the grand scheme of things, rather then their general aspects and who they would/could be in the future post-Vold.

She didn't say she regretted it. That was a clickbait headline used by articles that took what she said out of context.

What Rowling actually said was that Hermione and Ron's relationship was a case of wish fulfillment on her part. She partially self-inserts as Hermione, and she has a self confessed "weakness for funny men."

Rowling later clarified that they would be fine when Ron got over his insecurities and Hermione stopped being so critical. They might otherwise need "magical marriage counseling," or something to that effect.

Honestly, I think what Rowling said is taken out of context and blown out of proportion.

Well, they're happily married with kids over a decade into the future during the epilogue, so their relationship does work out in the end.

** To me, Ron will always be the third wheel. The guy who only hangs out with Harry because he's famous, after all, he was just like the other kids and some adults when they first met Harry, asking to see his scar and being all fanboyish despite Harry's protests, the only reason Harry befriended him is because he was the first guy his age he met in the wizarding world so he latched onto him like the poor friendless orphan he is.

It was because of Ron (Hagrid too but not as much) talking shit about Slytherin that Harry spurned Malfoy and declined being placed in Slytherin, the Sorting Hat even said that he would be great in Slytherin and wanted to place in there first, but because Harry was brainwashed he demanded to be placed in Gryffindor.

Ron is loud, obnoxious, petty, jealous, lazy, glutenous and willfully ignorant, without Hermione I doubt he would have passed his OWL's.

He kept bitching that he would never amount to anything after his successful brothers yet did nothing to change that, it was only a fluke that Harry decided to befriend him and that's what gave him his uniqueness, without Harry he would have been a nobody, just like he feared.

Has my opinion been skewed by the movies and fanfiction? Perhaps a tad, but honestly, I didn't like Ron even back when I was reading the books for the first time, before the first movie even came out, he reminded me too much of the kids in my school who thought it was cool not to pay attention in class and bragged about how they didn't do their school work.

I appreciate the fact that some people like Ron, but I never will, and nothing anyone says will change that for me.

Harry didn't like Malfoy from their very first encounter in Madam Malkin's robe shop. This was before Harry met Ron, and even before he knew anything about the Hogwarts houses. Additionally, even if Harry never met Ron, I find it hard to believe he'd ever get along with Malfoy. It's not in Harry's character to befriend bullies, bigots or anybody that is sympathetic towards the man who killed his parents.

Honestly, you Malfoy apologists are just as bad as the Ron haters.

 

Ron has the same academic ability as Harry, which Harry reflects upon several times in the series. The only subject in which Harry is better than Ron is DADA, and even then it's only by a single rank (E vs O).

Harry is also just as lazy as Ron when it comes to studying. Ron is never shown struggling with homework that Harry isn't also struggling with.

** Harry Potter is fairly universally loved. I think that many writers like to explore unconventional couples because the HP series is hard to really replicate in terms of plot, tone, etc.

That being said , I think many of us have had a Ron in our lives who was great in our teenage years that became a regret / something to vent over in our early adult years.

Ron in the novels is so lovable and fun. Often Fan Fiction is filled with angst more than whimsy.

** Charismatic? Ron?

Don't mean to offend you, but: What have you been smoking? (and: Can I have some? Might make this world more bearable!)

I see Ron as:

- a bad friend (he betrays Harry twice and even his supposed love Hermione once (GoF and TDH when leaves them in the tent!)) who could have gotten both his friends killed without need (Harry at least has good reasons for endangering his friends - hell, they accompany him willingly after all!)

- a slacker without any great talent (Harry at least has untapped talent in magic (learning the Patronus early shows that IMHO) that's never really used, but he has talent and Hermione is at least book smart!)

- he's also ambitious but doesn't put in the work (despite having great role models (his brothers - at least Bill and Charlie, not that Percy is all that bad: Prefect, good job at the ministry etc.) and good grades being a way out of what he hates most: Poverty!)

- I call bullshit on him being the calm one of the trio! That's Harry (and it's not like Ron's talent at chess makes him a planer or a tactician or a logical thinker!)! Harry is the one thinking on his feet (partly because Mr. Potter can't be bother to ever prepare for a situation - exception: The tournament!)

Because of the Horcrux my ass - sorry, but Hermione did carry it, too (I never understood why they didn't dump it into Hermione's bag or hide it somewhere (a public place, a muggle-repelling ward, a sticking and an invisibility charm is all that it takes -.-)) and she didn't leave (strike out on her own or go with Ron!) so Ron's either disloyal or has a weak mind!

Also, Ron's a user: He only gets a prefects badge because he's Harry's friend and Dumbledore doesn't want to give it to Harry (who should IMHO have gotten it!)...strange how a person hating to be in other peoples shadows doesn't try to get out of those shadows ASAP :( (I am not saying he shouldn't be friends with Harry, but he should have his own friends, his own interests (no: The Canons don't count!) and maybe even a subject he's good at, but when Harry is average Ron is dismally mediocre :(

ps: I am a strange one, I dislike almost all HP characters (exception: Sirius Black!) - but I like the world, that's why I love fanfictions!

  Harry at least has untapped talent in magic
#+end_quote

Harry doesn't have untapped amazing magical abilities. He's not a protegee like Hermione or Dumbledore, and he doesn't have any latent untapped superpowers.

This is another mistake that the fandom commonly makes. Harry did indeed learn the Patronous at a young age, but that doesn't make him a genius. He was highly motivated to learn that spell and he was personally tutored by a skilled professor over the course of an entire year. It was definitely a worthwhile achievement, but considering his circumstances it wasn't unexpected. And lets not forget that the Patronus isn't a god-tier spell, it's something that every other member of the Dumbledore's Army also learned, and they learned it in a much shorter time span than Harry did.

The fandom constantly over estimates Harry's magical ability. It's a shame, Harry never solves his problems by using advanced magic; he escapes through quick thinking, courage and the help of his friends. The only exception to this is when he uses the Patronus in book 3. In every other book he uses bottom-of-the-barrel magic like Stupefy and Expelliarmus; spells that even second year students know.

The truth is that Harry isn't a magical protegee. In terms of skill and ability, he's basically a normal guy. Throughout the books he remarks about how him and Ron and equal in ability, except for in DADA, in which Harry is one rank higher. Ron and Harry and almost identical in terms of ability.

You're not the only one in the comments who talks about Ron "slacking off," but just in case you've forgotten, Harry was just as lazy. There's no point in the series in which Ron struggled with homework that Harry also didn't struggle with. They were both slackers.

Look, I'll be honest, I strongly suspect that many of you fanfiction fanatics have a warped perception of not only Ron, but of Harry and Hermione too. The idea that Ron is holding Harry back is nonsense.

I know this rant is a little off topic, but this is something I see all the time in fanfiction and in the fandom. I think that people self-insert as Harry, and they enjoy the power fantasy of imagining him as some unstoppable badass. However, this is just fantasy, and in canon Harry spends most of his time running away. He's not Dumbledore Jr or something.

In Philosophers Stone, Hermione said that there's more to being a wizard than books and cleverness. Those aren't Harry's true strengths.

 

#+begin_quote
  Ron is a bad friend
#+end_quote

Nah, Ron's a great friend. And as I said above, the incidents of Ron breaking up with Harry are totally overblown by the fandom. In GoF they were both acting immature, and so they ignored each other for a couple weeks. Big deal. Have you never argued with a friend? Harry forgave Ron instantly, so it's about time you forgive Ron too.

As for the time in Deathly Hallows, I think that is the most misinterpreted moment in the books.

Look, I have some very close friends that I've known for decades. However, I honestly doubt that they would risk their life for me the way Ron risks his life for Harry. Ron is in constant peril throughout the series because of Harry, yet he always pulls through and puts his friendship before his own safety.

What more do you fucking want? How high are your standards? You would be alone forever if you judged your real life friends the way you judged Ron.

Ron gets mad when his friends are insulted. He feels happy to see his friends succeed. He feels scared when his friends are in danger. That makes him a better friend than most people I know.

And look, even if you ignore all I've said above, Ron is still a good friend. Friendship is 90% about enjoying somebody's company, and Harry and Hermione both enjoy Ron's company more than they enjoy the company of anybody else.

 

#+begin_quote
  I call bullshit on him being the calm one of the trio! That's Harry
#+end_quote

Each of the trio are calm under certain circumstances.

Harry is calm when facing immediate danger, put he becomes hysterical when his loved ones are in danger, like what happened with Sirius, or when Dumbledore was killed.

Hermione can think deeply and rationally, but she becomes overwhelmed when she's under pressure. We saw her get stressed all the time.

Ron can become flustered and angry whenever he's embarrassed (usually because of Malfoy) or because his friends and family are insulted (almost always because of Malfoy), but other than that he's a chill dude. I'm racking my brains, but I can't actually think of a single situation in which he panicked in the face of danger. He got more scared over embarrassing himself during Quidditch than he ever did fighting Death Eaters.

Remember when Hermione panics while caught in the devils snare, and Ron is the voice of reason that snaps her out of it? Or when Hermione is super stressed leading up to the raid on the ministry and Ron reassures her, just like he used to do when she anxious over the exams?

Ron is relaxed about the things that stress Hermione, like her excessive attention to detail and future anxiety. Hermione is calm regarding the things that make Harry emotional, like his cynicism and his "saving people thing." Harry isn't embarrassed by Quidditch, insults and other things that can stress Ron.

They each compliment each other.

**** Hermione a protege? Damned, that girl is BOOK SMART! Yes she experiments with some things, but it's minor stuff (or stuff that they would learn in school anyway: Later than she does, but they would!)

She does have talent, but she really isn't breaking new ground here (no "12 uses of dragon's blood" or "the dark mark" kind of stuff (and nothing as horrible as horcruxes and resurrection rituals either..."...terrible, but great" that's what Ollivander says about Voldemort after all!) - she's advanced compared to her peers and her believe that she can do it helps, too (doubt after all fucks magic up IMHO, look at Neville and his confidence problem - not to mention his wrong wand!))

Not untapped power in the sense that he could fight 20 deatheaters and Voldemort at once or something like that, but he's got potential (even your supposed protege Hermione had trouble with the patronus at first and she learned it at 15, while Harry did so in 3rd year (!) - 2 years earlier! Ok, he had 1 on 1 teaching, but it's not like Hermione couldn't ask a professor for help if she wanted to, she's every professors darling (ok: Not Snape's) after all!)

The DA is kind of an exception (they after all said that even a lot of adults CAN'T DO IT!)...maybe those adults didn't try hard enough or didn't think they need it, but it supposedly is a very very very hard spell!

I never said that he was a protege, he's got potential (just like Neville and the others do - he just doesn't think so himself, that's why he's using kiddy spells IMHO instead of learning some truly awe inspiring ones or terrifying ones, like say the killing curse (I'd use that on DE's, those dogs don't deserve mercy - no not even simple thugs like Goyle or supposedly coerced assholes like Dracon Malfoy!))

Harry has self-esteem problems (he would never admit it, but he does!). Hermione on the other hand has too much self-esteem and no social grace what so ever (that's why she doesn't have many friends!)

I agree that BOTH are slackers, but Ron more so (he's the one that drags Harry away to: Play chess, fly, play quidditch, talk about the Canons etc.)...Harry doesn't even really have hobbies (Ron's got more hobbies than Harry, so Harry might learn more if Ron didn't constantly stop him!)

I disagree - Harry would be better off without both of them, but if it came down to it he'd be better off without Ron and with Hermione!

I agree with Hermione's assessement, but that's probably his confidence problem (and some of it might even be not wanting to be in the lime light...come on if he was really good at magic that would attract even more - unwelcome! - attention), not to mention the Dursleys lack of showing him that he can do stuff (I know that this is mostly fanon but I think the Dursleys wouldn't like it one bit if Harry had better grades than Duddley - it's never stated in canon as far as I know, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't fit those assholes (they were at best neglecting Harry - at worst they were abusing him...maybe not beating him constantly, but close!))

No, friendship isn't just enjoying someone's company (you have broad definition of friendship :( - mine's quite strict: A friend is someone I can really depend on, somebody who wouldn't betray me, someone who would trust me and depend on me in return!)

Yeah Harry and his self-sacrificing "let's rush in, there's danger" instead of planing an approach and getting help (he more or less killed Sirius - sure that blasted Elf, Dumbledore and Snape share some of the blame, but over all? His need to be the hero got Sirius killed!)

Yeah, Hermione stresses too much - and both Ron and Harry too little!

Ron gets jealous too easily - "You've got money, I'd trade my poor family for your cash!" (sorry, but that's basically his reaction to learning that Harry has got money...despite the fact that Harry would give him some if he only asked and despite the fact that the guy is a fucking orphan!)

A chill dude who robs first years of prank items (contraband) to use it himself? (Abuse of the prefects position!) Bullies Slytherine first years and constantly fights with fucking Malfoy (sorry it's getting old...ignoring Mr. "When my father hears about this" would have helped much more...I'd love to see Malfoy being ignored...or if he has to fight: Damned wipe the floor with the asshole (IMHO Ron loses most of the Malfoy confrontations!))

Yeah, the devil's snare...shows exactly that Hermione is NOT a protege (at least not at practical application in the field)...yeah, Ron was useful there, but over all I would have liked it more if Neville were there (he would have known about the plant, too and so wouldn't have panicked either!))

Yeah, she's good at book learning and details, but I bet that both Ron and Harry could wipe the floor with her in a duel (most of the DA probably could, because until she decides what spell to use she's stunned, disarmed and/or bound!)

She's probably only so anxious because her parents always pressure her (we don't learn much about them, but they are upper-class (or upper middle class at the very least!) and people with that background often drive their children to exhaustion (or worse: Burn out!) in order to get a spot at a good school, at a good university etc. etc....children from those background often take Ritalin or Meta-Amphetamines (legally through a prescription or illegally because they have to in order not to crack under the pressure!))

Maybe...I think the union would be better without Ron thought (either stay a two-some or select an new third member - Neville maybe!)

***** Hermione is rather brilliant, I wouldn't sell her short if I were you. "The brightest witch her age" isn't something to scoff at.

The Patronus is said to be the only spell Hermione ever struggled with, and it's also in her worst subject (DADA). I wouldn't hold that against her when she the best are everything else.

 

I think you're overestimating Ron's negative influence on Harry. In case you've forgotten, Harry was part of the Quidditch team for 5 full years before Ron joined. Ron isn't responsible for Harry having interests outside of study.

I don't think that's true. I'm pretty sure that Harry would have had an exceptionally short and extremely miserable life if it wasn't for Ron and Hermione. It's easy to speculate that if Harry was alone he'd be some studious Dark Arts wielding juggernaut, but I think that's grossly out of character for Harry. Harry becomes miserable whenever he is separated from his friends, and, contrary to emo depression-fetishism, misery is not a productive state of mind.

#+end_quote

What constitutes a betrayal?

In GoF, it was a case of childhood jealousy. Humans do this sometimes; arguments happen and then the mature ones forgive each other. A lack of arguments means they're either soul mates or robots.

In DH, Ron doesn't turn traitor. He doesn't give their location away; he doesn't attack them. He even leaves the horcrux, allowing them to continue their quest. His abandonment had a multitude of reasons. Let's list them:

- The Locket. It's stated that it affects him most. We know from the Diary that horcuxes can possess some form of sentience. Perhaps the Locket saw the most potential for takeover in Ron. This potential could stem from next few reasons.

- Family. The Weasley's place a huge emphasis on family. Ron is out on the countryside, with a friend who has little-to-no plan, while his family could be dying. He listens to the radio, hoping not to hear their deaths.

- He's the most human. As mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/56ms8q/whats_the_deal_with_ron/d8le2t5][another comment]], Harry and Hermione have fewer flaws. Harry is our main character, the sacrificial lamb raised from birth, and the chosen one. Hermione is bright, an eager learner, good-looking when she tries, and has a very close relationship with Harry (brother/sister). Ron is at least subconsciously aware of this; it doesn't help that he's the youngest son in his family. He has a lot of expectations surrounding him and that type of pressure can break people. Humans have flaws and without them, fictional characters would be boring.

And thus he abandoned them. And immediately regretted it. He came back, faced his greatest most terrible fear inside Voldemort's Locket, and grew up.

#+begin_quote
  a slacker without any great talent (Harry at least has untapped talent in magic...
#+end_quote

Harry does not have any more untapped talent than Ron. Don't believe me? Why does Harry never reveal any other powerful forms of magic? Harry's strengths do not lie in magic, and they never would in Rowling's works. Harry's strength is in his /character/; in his /love/. He sacrifices himself for love. He defeats Voldemort with love (twice). He leads the DA through strong character, not power. All the obstacles he faces are overcome, not with magic, but with friendship and character and love. The Patronus? His Prongs is an manifestation of his exceptionally strong character, not some bogus magical core. If you take Harry, remove the prophecy, and raise him in the Weasley family, I guarantee he will come out extremely similar to Ron.

And Ron is a slacker just like every other kid in school is a slacker. When you grow up in the magical world, magic isn't special; it's normal. Tell me, why aren't /you/ out there solving physics and inventing nanobots and landing on Mars? Slacker.

#+end_quote

Horcruxes are immune to Summoning Charms. How would you get that out of an impossibly large bag without saying /Accio/?

And the trio wears the Locket because Harry thinks it's too risky to leave it anywhere else. That's a piece of Voldemort's soul, the key to winning the war. It's their only lead and they can't afford to lose it. However, after Ron's abandonment, they do take some time without wearing it, indicating that they've learned of the dangers it poses.

Why do the Cannons not count? Is an interest in organized sporting not a real hobby? Because a lot of fans on [[/r/nfl]] and [[/r/cfb]] would like to disagree...

And his own friends... are Harry and Hermione. They're a tightly knit trio that's lived through far worse than any other child. And, again, we don't see the series through Ron's eyes. For all we know, he spends plenty of time with other housemates. The same goes for Hermione --- she has a hinted-at friendship with Ginny that we don't see much of because Harry's our main character.

Ron is not disloyal. He stands up to Sirius Black, a madman and murder, with a broken leg to protect Harry. He follows Harry through seven years of insanity. Ron does not have a weak mind. The Locket doesn't break him; he breaks it.

Harry doesn't KNOW any powerful forms of magic (other than the Patronus), but learning that in 3rd year shows that he's got potential (sorry, but the DA is a fluke more or less, because it's stated - by Luping if I am not mistaken - that many (or even most!) adults can't cast a a corporeal patronus, hell it's even extra credit for the OWLs!)

I don't believe in "magical cores" (that's a fanon thing as far as I know)...I think strength in magic comes from believe (if you doubt yourself, your ability etc. it won't work, so conviction does help - that's why almost anything works for Hermione, she seldom doubts her ability to cast a certain spells!)

Yeah, for Ron it might be normal, but it's not for Harry (!) so Ron's slacking is holding our protagonist back (I think most of us would be more like Hermione - maybe not as extreme! - if we were on the Express and at Hogwarts later than like Ronald or Harry!)

Harry thinks - ok, don't the other two have opinions, don't they have a voice, a say?

'k, let's count the team of losers (kind of fits that Ron likes them!) - yes: I know that this is a cheap-shot!)

***** Harry Potter series is great adventure fictions. The idea of magical world is too good. But that's it. I believe in her first few books, JKR rushed through her ideas and missed an opportunity to make the universe more universal. It started as child fic & it should have ended that way. I would happily accept that black and white view if it was child fic. Infact, it was totally child fic upto 3rd book. Then JKR tried to make it young adult fiction. But the black & white buildup(as child fic usually tends to be) was so rooted that it literally became impossible to make it a decent young adult fiction. A most prominent example would be Dumbledore. At the beginning, he was shown almost as Godly. But then she wanted to make him to look less Godly. In doing so, she totally lost control over the character. And that's where this manipulative Dumbledore's incarceration. It's interesting to discuss how JKR lose control over many of her own characters.

  I know you've likely heard all of this before, but I need to rant. I just read some upvoted comments on this subreddit that claimed "Ron wouldn't be a good friend," which is just bullshit. The controversial truth is that book-Ron is the most charismatic of the trio. Whenever the trio had a falling out, Ron could find new friends to hang out with (like Lavender in HBP or Dean and Seamus in GoF), while Harry or Hermione would just sulk by themselves.
#+end_quote

Well we obviously have different opinions on what makes and breaks a good friend. Charisma is probably one of the last things I look for in a friend. Personally I'm not looking for a "entertainer" or "host" in my friends... sure a sense of humor is a plus, but some of the funniest comments I've heard in my life came from people that aren't traditionally charismatic (making a great first impression, "social butterflies").

I used to have friends like Ron in my childhood, before I refined my "screening" process and I can honestly say that I'd never have considered Ron a friend again after the Triwizard incident (I've dropped people for much less from my friend category - which asks for more than being pleasant company; curiously the same kind of people never notice their drop in status). Especially when dealing with life threatening situations I'd rather not have to rely on someone like him.

I think JKR made some serious mistakes with some of her characters (and not only with Ron). I mean it's great that she was able to write Ron as a fun guy who's great to be friends with, but everytime we gain some real insight into his character it is less than favorable (the mirror Erised, Triwizard, cheating to get a drivers permit, his deepest fear in the Horcrux locket [*]).

[*] Honestly, I don't think many people realize how poorly this reflects on his character. His biggest fear at that point in time isn't his family or his supposedly best friend murdered by Voldemort? It isn't even about his love interest being tortured or raped by people who consider her less than human? No, his deepest fear is that he doesn't get the girl in the end and she might be happy with someone 'better' than him (minutes after pulling that same someone out of a freezing cold pond to save his life). I couldn't come up with something more pathetic if I tried and I'm sure JKR didn't want to portray Ron as poorly as it does.

*** As I've said, I think people greatly exaggerate the fight in GoF. Ron says maybe two sarcastic lines towards Harry and then ignores him for a couple weeks, and that's about it.

At this point in time, Ron had already put his life on the line for Harry. He had willing sacrificed himself for Harry time and time again. He sacrificed himself in the chess game. He had faced his literal worse fear (giant spiders) after Hermione was petrified. Ron stood on a broken leg to put himself between Harry and a psycho killer. At the age of 14 and for the sake of his friends, Ron had put himself in more danger than any of us have likely faced in our entirely lives.

Yet you'd be willing to throw away a bond like that? After everything Ron has done for Harry, you honestly think that Harry should just turn his back on him, all because of a momentary act of pubescent immaturity that he later apologized for? What kind of nonsense standards do you have?

  Was that his deepest fear? I was under the impression that the locket was trying to bait Ron into attacking Harry. The locket is intelligent --- it knew it was in danger --- and that's why it tries to drown Harry in the lake. After Ron saved Harry, the locket had only one hope left, and that would be if Ron attacked Harry instead of it. Obviously, the lockets final plan didn't work.

It's just bad writing. It should have showed him visions of their efforts being pointless and everyone dying. The reason Ron left before is because he thought they weren't achieving enough and stagnating. The best way to turn them against each other would have been to make him abandon them again at this crucial moment. Even the desperately starved for affection and friendship Harry from canon wouldn't have forgiven him for this.

If this truly were the most promising angle for the Locket to attack it truly makes me wonder about Ron. It even puts into the question the true reason why he left the first time (frustrated because he couldn't get in Hermione's pants? Jealousy? Obv. that wasn't what JKR meant or intended...)

***** I dunno man, I think you're over blowing the stuff in GoF. It wasn't a massive friendship ending betrayal like you think it is.

I also think you're being cynical and a little foolish in regards to the Locket's vision. The Locket didn't just want Ron to leave again, because then Harry would have destroyed the locket anyway, so showing everybody dying wouldn't have helped. The Locket needed Ron to kill Harry, which is why it showed Harry fucking Ron's romantic love.

We have to remember that the Locket is a piece of Voldemort. Voldemort can't comprehend love. He doesn't understand Ron's feelings towards Hermione, or his feelings towards Harry.

From the Lockets perspective it must have seemed like a decent plan. After all, killing your rival is something a sociopath like Voldemort must empathize with. To him, friends are no more than "asset or allies," to be used and then discarded when they become inconvenient.

Of course, Ron never would have hurt Harry, no matter what the Locket showed. It was a wasted effort. If Voldemort's Locket had any understanding of love he might have recognized the strong bond between them.

To be honest, I am quite worried that the Locket's manipulative vision actually managed to effect you. You're letting literally Voldemort tell you what to think of Ron.

Look, I suspect that you and I probably have a different understanding of the value of friendship. To me, if a friendship can't survive a couple of small arguments then it must not have been a strong bond to begin with. If you disagree with me that's fine; we just have different ideas what friendship means. Let's agree to disagree.

No, in fact I argue with my friends all the time. If someone gets all pissy with me because we had a disagreement it's a pretty good sign that we shouldn't be friends. I just can't fathom anyone I'd consider a friend to not believe me, when I tell them "I didn't do X" - especially if it concerns my participation in a blood sport tournament. No-one is 100% truthful all the time, but what's the point of a friendship if they don't believe in you in literally life or death situations? I just don't get it and I'd never be able to totally forgive it (doesn't mean I couldn't be civil with them after an apology).

You talk about how Ron didn't believe Harry as though that was what this fight was about. That wasn't what there fight was about. It was deeper than that.

Ron didn't genuinely believe that Harry put his name in the Goblet. Ron believed Harry didn't do it. Ron was just upset because he had to endure another year of being a minor character in his own life.

Hermione spells this out to Harry. She tells him that it's not a matter of Ron disbelieving him, it's a matter of Ron feeling disgruntled because of his own insecurities and jealousy.

I'm sorry, but you do not understand what was happening during GoF. Look, here's Hermione explaining things in her own words:

#+begin_quote
  “Does he think I entered myself?”

  “Well . . . no, I don't think so . . . not really,” said Hermione awkwardly.

  “What's that supposed to mean, ‘not really'?”

  “Oh Harry, isn't it obvious?” Hermione said despairingly. “He's jealous!”

  “Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?”

  “Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it's not your fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. “I know you don't ask for it . . . but --- well --- you know, Ron's got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you're his best friend, and you're really famous --- he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . . .”

  “Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him from me I'll swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he's welcome to it. . . . People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . .”

  “I'm not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell him yourself. It's the only way to sort this out.”

  “I'm not running around after him trying to make him grow up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm.

See? Hermione is being tactful and trying to not upset Harry, but even so she's laying it out in no uncertain terms. It's not a matter of trust like you think it is; it's a matter of Ron's dismay at being sidelined and overshadowed once again.

Harry can't comprehend Ron's feelings of insecurity, because since coming to Hogwarts Harry has never been irrelevant or ignored. Ron can't empathize with Harry's exhaustion at being famous, because Ron has never been the center of attention in his entire life. Hermione was absolutely right when she said that simply talking to each other would resolve the whole issue, but they're both too stubborn, stupid and immature to vocalize their complex feelings.

It wasn't a matter of trust.

 

I'm sorry, but you're just factually wrong about both the fight in GoF and the incident with the Locket in DH. In both cases you seem to look at things through a veil of anti-Ron cynicism that paints him in the worst light possible.

Mate, if you look at everything that Ron does with such a level of warped negativity then it's no wonder you dislike him. However, despite your unjust hatred, I still insist that Ron is a good person, and a great friend.

** Maybe if he had a soul, the fandom would be kinder to him.

Also how was Harry "largely responsible" for the GoF fight? Ron refuses to believe that Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, that's pretty much all there is to it. In fact, if I remember correctly, he never changes his mind that Harry didn't do it, he doesn't even apologize and admit he was wrong I think - he simply "forgives" him after the first task, because Harry performed so well. Everyone loves a winner after all...

As for my personal preference... I don't like Ron in canon at all, never did. My instictual reaction to his character was that he unthinkingly attached himself to Harry in order to stand out, maybe catch some reflected glory. Friendship might have grown, but I feel that was the trigger.

Ron bashing is awful though. Especially so, Harmonian Ron bashing. I much prefer fics in which Ron doesn't appear at all (see a Black Comedy) or he is not friends with Harry (Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

** You make very good points but the fact is that i just like hating on Ron and nothing will really change my opinion. It's the same thing with fanfictions with every fanfiction that has a Harry/Ginny pairing.

I understand that Ginny grows as a person and she's really all kinds of badass and awesome if you manage to write her well and the same goes for Ron but I will hold onto my irrational hatred because it makes me feel good, thank you very much.

(I realize that last sentence sounds very sarcastic but i actually /do/ mean it.)

** Not being one of my favourite character I actually like to see Ron in many roles from bashing to part of the group or simply there. This is what fanfics are for: portraying character we know differently from canon here and there

** I disagree that the films are at fault for Ron's portrayal, the entire thing started with the books or to be more specific it started when the books shifted in tone towards a young adult audience. (GoF being the first one)

During the shift Ron got saddled with more negative traits, which is fine, but at same time he turned into an almost exclusive source of conflict for the trio. To make matters worse he was always wrong. This is in stark contrast with Harry or Hermione, when their behaviour caused annoyance with the other two they ended being right, it felt justified to the reader or endearingly they meant well.
