I would say that I am not interested unless and they go all in and use there book and fanfiction knowledge to the best of there ability.

I don't want to read an angst ridden story because the SI is a weak moron that just makes thing worse for some sort of false tension.

I also don't what to read a canon rehash I would rather the SI stays a way from Harry and has there own adventure were they do thing that will make the second war better like kill off the giant spiders in the forbidden forest or assassinate Greyback when he comes into the castle in sixth year buy doing somethings like taking some silver into the room of requirement and turning the silver into bullets and then getting the room of requiem the to give you a snipers nest with a view of the top of the astronomy tower with a sniper rifle that is charmed to never miss its target.

Pretty much give me a godlike SI over a weak moron any day of the week I would rather read about new interesting ways that an SI uses magic over a SI that causes nothing but angst for themselfs and other.


** A good SI is neither passive nor senselessly overpowered.

Why no passivity?

Well, would anyone who suddenly finds themselves in a fictional universe be able to keep themselves from completely effecting events around them? From trying to get to know their favorite characters? From at least exploring this amazing adventure? No, probably not. It's too great a temptation to resist, really.

And even if you /could/ resist it, your mere presence would likely create a ripple effect that would create great differences the further from the start of the story you got. Butterflies and hurricanes and all that.

Passivity would, eventually, be blown out of the water by a combination of established plot and the SI's continued presence in it.

As for the second point, no overpowered characters makes sense. But why the caveat of /senselessly/ overpowered?

Every OC Self-Inserts that I've read tend to be aware that they're in a fictional world, and are frequently fans of it. They have knowledge that other characters lack, so by that alone they are going to have advantages. /But/ -- and this is the important part -- those advantages shouldn't make things instantly easy. Knowledge is not effort: just because you know Animagi exist, doesn't mean you'll be able to become one on the first try. Or at all.

But it's unrealistic to say that anyone in that position wouldn't /try/ to do cool, rare, and powerful stuff. If I found myself with a wand and magical powers, you bet I'll try everything I can with them, even if I'm shit at it.

** Self Inserts to me are interesting only if:

- They're CHARACTERS and not WISH FULFILMENTS. There's a long way from "this character is me, reacts like I would in these situations, and has my general personality/strengths/flaws" to "this character gets to do all the cool stuff I want to do, gets all the cool stuff I want to have, and totally becomes the big hero that everyone loves, and has sex with my favourite character." The first example is an acceptable OC, the second is just a masturbation fantasy.\\
- They don't just take center stage and overshadow all the canon characters. I read fanfics to see my favourite characters from canon... or failing that, OCs that are actually interesting. I don't read fanfic to read about how much cooler YOU are than my favourite characters.\\
- They have a story to tell. "I am awesome and fix everything" isn't a story.

** The thing about Self Inserts is that they are a writing tool, like any other. This means that they can be done well and they can be done poorly.

Why use an SI?

SIs in my opinion are best used to explore underdeveloped aspects of the world that they are in. The main storyline has a plethora of characters in it already, all of whom have pre written backstories and personalities. If you are going to write about a character following and interacting with canon then you would be best off using one of these characters rather than creating an SI who happens to be the same year as Harry and is besties with the main characters etc. That comes across as wish fulfillment and is not interesting to read. If you want to use an SI then make the most of it. We know how the unaware orphan finds the wizarding world, how about the standard muggleborn/halfblood/pureblood child? How about the European witch or wizard who moves to Britain, or the child of a potioneer, an auror or a quidditch star? The possibilities are endless, so don't restrict yourself to the overdone archetype of "child in Harry's year at Hogwarts".

What are the main problems with SIs?

SIs can be done well, you just need to look at the Naruto fandom to see that it is possible to write fantastic SI/OCs that have an engaging storyline. With that being said, why is there such a dearth of good ones for the HP fandom? I think part of the issue is that HP canon is, to a certain extent, solvable. If an SI is written in the canon timeframe then they could technically solve the entire plot in one day by going to Dumbledore and telling him about the locations of the horcruxes. With that in mind it becomes hard to write a believable story that isn't just a fix fic. So how to solve this? In my mind there are two solutions:

1) Use a different timeframe. Make your SI be born in Grindelwald's time, or be schooled before or during Voldemort's first rise to power. This would allow writing freedom to explore a wider part of the universe, whilst also butterflying away most of canon. Furthermore it would be new and interesting, and therefore more enjoyable to read.

2) The slightly riskier approach. Give your character a more conflicted motive to not "solve" canon. Have them be born a pureblood, or as one of the marginalised non-human groups. You could create an intriguing plotline regarding the desire to drastically change the wizarding world whilst being conflicted about stopping/steering Voldemort's more evil impulses.

Why an SI, not an OC?

Generally an SI would be used for one main reason: Agency. As an SI you don't have to write about a childish mindset, and there is always the motivation for your character to get strong/get connected/actually do something. Considering that most stories fail to get to post-hogwarts it's easy to see why writers want their characters to have as much agency as possible.

My thoughts on what to do/ what not to do for SIs.

1) DO make sure they are born in the HP world. If your storyline is that you randomly appear one day on the Hogwarts express then I'm inclined to think that you just couldn't be bothered to write a backstory for your character. More to the point it means you skip out on all the character connections and developments that make your SI an actual character rather than an extension to canon.

2) DON'T make your SI the most powerful person around. For an in-universe reason, it can be argued that natural talent plays a huge role in power, and there is no way that your SI should be more talented than Voldemort. More to the point, from a meta perspective it makes your SI too much of a Mary Sue and devalues all the characters around them. If you want your character to play an important role then specialise them. It's unrealistic for an SI to be amazing at everything, it is much more realistic for them to be really good at potions, or rituals, or warding etc.

3) DON'T pair your SI with a main character. This is a more contentious thought, but the reality of it is that most SIs paired with a main character are written solely for that pairing and tend to be plain terrible. I'll admit that it's definitely a signalling issue rather than a solid rule, but in general the rule should be to write a story not a pairing.

4) DON'T make your character as just an addition to canon. If the story is about the "Golden Quartet" or "Golden Trio - Ron + SI" then don't even bother. Same with the marauders etc. As I said earlier, SIs should be used to explore new parts of the universe, not rehash canon.

5) DO give them their own motivations. Helping out Harry isn't a motivation. Freeing Sirius isn't a motivation. Most SI writers seem to forget that their character has to live in the HP world. As such they need to have their own dreams and aspirations.

In conclusion, don't be afraid to write SIs. Some of my favourite stories have been Self-Inserts, as when done well they can be the best tool for world building and expanding the HP universe. You just need to be aware of what you are using them for, and you need to ask "is an SI the write choice for the story I want to write, or would it be better off with an OC or a canon character?"

*** Replying to an old thread I know but I couldn't help myself.

Going to Dumbledore day one gets the SI mind wiped at the very least. There's no way Dumbledore's letting someone who had a head full of horcrux knowledge easily readable by anyone trained in legilmancy running around free.

I don't see anything wrong with a character who ISN'T born into the wizarding world if the writer is willing to address the problems suddenly showing up causes. Personally, I'm rather bored of the 'born into the world' stories because they often get mucked up with a bunch of chapters about the SI dealing with life as a baby.

** I would like to read a fic where the self-insert is a fan, tries to use their knowledge and falls flat on their face with it, because the books and movies don't show everything. To me that's more interesting than a SI that knows everything or a SI that knows nothing at all.

Depending on the fic, the SI could become a serious asset during the war due to their future knowledge. Alternatively everything devolves into a humor/crack fic, because the SI expects characters to look and act like their movie actors and they just don't. Especially if Rowling is treated as a Rita Skeeter like character that took Harry's adventures as a base and changed and embellished the story as she saw fit.

** Self inserts are never interesting. It's always either too obvious of a reflection of wish-fulfillment from the author, or the same tired "I can't believe I'm in the books, I know things!" kind of story that everyone writes.

Original characters can be interesting (although a lot of those tend to be self inserts as well), especially when they add new storyline options, but this is almost never the case with an insert.

*** The main issue with most SI fics is that the writers mistake knowledge for power. Just because you know the future doesn't mean you can avoid it or change it. The same thing goes for special abilities -- knowing they exist (and have the capability to use them) doesn't equate to mastery of them.

In reality, trying to change the future/plot should have consequences, especially unforeseen ones. And mastering any special abilities? Yeah, that shouldn't be easy. Befriending canon characters? They're going to hold you accountable for things, including all the secrets you're hiding. Telling anyone the truth? They're going to think you're either insane or the greatest bargaining chip they've ever met.

*tl;dr* - Uninteresting SI fics are due to a lack of obstacles and consequences.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks.

If done well, any new character placed within a story can radically change the plot of a story in a believable way. However, if done badly, an SI story can seem like a glorified fantasy of the author, or just a way for them to change the plot to their liking.

** I don't think I've given SIs much thought since I was in my early teens...meaning it's been about 20 years so my thoughts on the matter are a little rusty. 99.999% of the time, they're done by young, really young, writers as a way to transcend reality and become even closer with their celebrity love, fictional or not. Their only purpose is gratification of the author, and that satisfaction comes from the experience of writing. Everything else falls to the wayside including writing quality, plot and structure, and anything else that would help make a semi readable piece of writing for an outside reader. 20 years ago I would have mocked SIs, gone to great lengths to point out all flaws an average SI piece has and list all the literary elements that were ignored. But now I realize, SI is a step in the journey of writing for so many people. Those fantasy drive SIs that you jotted down in your Algebra notebook back in grade 7, led to reading more and more stories others wrote about your favorite band, TV show or book characters. The more you read, the more you wrote, which led to a world outside fan fiction. Just the way playing that silly MASH game with your crush's name led to Homecoming dates which led to mature relationships, SI is just another awkward step, from an awkward time, that by itself is embarrassing meaningless fluff, but when you are able to step back and see it was a springboard into a life long journey of reading and writing.
