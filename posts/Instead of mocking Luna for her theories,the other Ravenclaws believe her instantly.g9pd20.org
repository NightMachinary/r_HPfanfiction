** I would read that. It could spiral, driving all the other houses mad as they keep searching more and more insistently for all the creatures.

Voldemort, hearing about the seriousness the other Ravenclaws treat it as, immediately changes his plans.

The conspiracy about aurors trying to bring down the ministry leads to him ordering his death eaters to make massive donations to the DMLE - After all, they'd need to become strong enough to defeat the minister's army of Heliopaths. Then he could come in after both sides had exhausted themselves for easy conquest!

Perhaps he hires the Goblin nation to find Luna's creatures - surely some of them could be used in his war, and as the Minister devours their race in pies (so that's why he's overweight!) they should obviously be willing. And why wouldn't they take gold to search for something that might not exist? They get paid either way.

** Love the idea of Luna having an innate blessing that's the complete opposite of the "Curse of Cassandra". So much fun you could write with it!

*** I'm thinking something along the line of The Power of Love, like Lilly Potter's but granted to Luna by her mom, so that as long as "she believes in something, the rest of the world Will do as well"
