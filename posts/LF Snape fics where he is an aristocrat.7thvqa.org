I'm looking for Snape/Hermione fics where Snape is actually an aristocrat or very wealthy. He can be a pureblood or halfblood, so long as he's upper crust in the magical world.


** I have an idea for a fic like that. First, you have Snape and Hermione, looking for a place to shag, catching Harry and Ginny shagging in an abandoned classroom. It later turns out that "Ginny" is actually Harry under Polyjuice and "Harry" is actually Draco. Hermione drinks a potion that gives her a [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], and she and Snape join in. Snape uses his wand to [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], but it turns out that Draco (disguised as Harry) is too [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], so they drink another potion to [[/spoiler][CENSORED]]. That's about when Ron comes in, with Ginny (the real one), who immediately goes for Hermione's [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], which would be a problem, but thanks to the Geminio Charm, there's enough for everyone, and while she is at it, Ron [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] Ginny's [[/spoiler][CENSORED]]. By then, the Polyjuice begins to wear off. Now, Hagrid, Dumbledore, and Lucius Malfoy are watching all this...

Anyway, you know what I'm calling this fic? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats]["The Aristocrats."]]

*Edit:* Mixed up who was Polyjuiced as whom.

*** *The Aristocrats*

"The Aristocrats" (also called "The Debonaires" or "The Sophisticates" in some tellings) is a taboo-defying off-color joke that has been told by numerous stand-up comedians since the vaudeville era. The joke was the subject of a 2005 documentary film of the same name. It received publicity when it was used by Gilbert Gottfried during the Friars' Club roast of Hugh Hefner in September 2001.
