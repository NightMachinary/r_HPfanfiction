So some of you may know my fic "A New Better Life". Well I've been writing out the timeline and there is a critical point a ways down the road and I had the idea of, what if the story diverged right there. With Harry and his friends left mostly unchanged in one version and... considerably darker/ changed in the other version.

I dont know what the proper etiquette for this would be TBH and I was hoping some of you fine folks may be able to give me some advise/ point me in the right direction.


** I honestly have never read it but as an author, I wouldn[t split it. It will greatly slow down your uploads and will likely make you overthink each version. Personally, I would say write which ever version you'd like to its conclusion and then if you want to go back and write an alternate version, go for it!

*** I'm already monstrously slow at updating as this is an on the side passion project I'm doing for myself. So I don't really think it will hurt upload speed any.

As to your second part that's my problem I want to write both and cant decide between the two

**** Start writing them both out (not to post) and just see which one comes to you more easily and which one you think will turn out better.

** pick whichever version fits the tone of the pic (as it is at this point) better and continue with that, then post the other version as its own pic and make a note so readers are aware
