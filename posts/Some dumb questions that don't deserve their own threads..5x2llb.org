I've had a few things I've been wondering about and would like some opinions on. If you have any small questions that you've been wondering about that you don't think deserve their own thread feel free to post them in here.

1) What do you consider more impressive for their age, Harry's patronus at 13 against multiple Dementors. Snape's spell creation during his NEWT years or James Potter and CO mastering the Animagus transformation in their fifth(?) year?

I think that Harry's is particularly impressive if the spell is meant to be a struggle for even skilled adults. The fact Amelia Bones made particular note of it is special. I think the spell's difficulty is devalued in the fifth book when he teaches the DA. What people forget is that they didn't have Dementors or even Dementor Boggarts to practice with meaning they didn't have to summon the happiness while it was being sucked from them. I imagine it is vastly different to cast it when you actually need it. For Snape's spells, I struggle, I am aware that I dislike Snape so that may affect my choices but in my head-canon he hasn't so much created new spells but modified existing ones. Take his cutting curse, if we consider it as a modification of diffindo then what he has done is take a cricket/baseball bat and wrapped it in barbed wire and stuck nails in it. It is now a better weapon but totally unsuitable for its original purpose but so long as the killing curse exists it will always be a crude method to kill. We know so little about the mechanics of spell creation I find it hard to judge. He was also several years older that Harry. James and the animagus transformation to me is more impressive that they were able to teach Pettigrew who was supposedly rather poor with a wand. In my mind the transformation probably isn't that hard, I think in fanon its made out to be a lot cooler that it is. Really other that Rita Skeeter what good are the forms in everyday life? Everyday life, not escaping from Azkaban or hiding for over a decade after you fake your death. It might be simple but require a lot of work. Most people would say that's cool but then look at the work and the outcome and not bother. Then again, if only 5 people are registered then it might be crazy difficult and we know that despite their misspent youths they were talented.

B) Next, do we know for sure that Myrtle's death resulted in the diary horcrux. He killed three members of the Riddle family at sixteen and claimed the Gaunt ring which later became a horcrux. The diary contained a copy of his sixteen year old self implying that he made it at sixteen but I don't think confirmed. To me its always seemed flimsy that he made the horcux from setting the Baslisk on her when I thought it was basically a case of wrong time, wrong place not to mention Tom didn't do the killing himself?

III) What curse do you believe to be the most evil? For me the Imperius is by far the worst but I often see it as the nicest. For me the killing curse and Cruciatus do horrible things but what they do aren't uniquie or quite as terrifying. Pain and death can be inflicted in a thousand and one ways but the idea that someone can take away your free will to me is far worse. The idea that a skilled caster might be able to hold it for ages without people noticing is awful. Hagrid said loads of people came out of traces after the first wars so I think its safe to assume it was common which makes Malfoy's defense more believable to the general public. To me the idea that you can act completely normal until you go home and murder your family is far worse than simply dying or being in pain. Sure the confudus charm can make you do certain things but its not on the same level as the imperius.


** 1. Of those options, equally impressive within their fields, though I might give the edge to Harry. Thirteen is young, yo.

2. Murder is murder, whether you use a knife, gun or feed someone to pigs. And Myrtle was most likely. Voldemort was incredibly arrogant, so it would be in character to use only significant murders. And few murders are more significant than the first.

3. There's something about that curse on the Gaunt ring that is horrifying, but I'd have to give it to the curse/jinx on the Defense Against the Dark Arts professorship for insidiousness, the number of lives it either ruined or affected and how it destroyed the continuity of the subject for decades.

*** The withering curse on the Gaunt ring is horrid because of the inevitability. Snape slowed it down but otherwise you'd just have to watch yourself waste away. Yeah there's some mental torture in there to go with the death and pain.

Does the Dark arts curse get bonus points for being so pathetically petty?

** With Myrtle, I would look at how even justified homicides mentally scar even a normal person. There are countless examples of police officers that have been used in a suicide by cop who have severe, long lasting mental trauma. I think the death of Myrtle offered a convenient reason as he HAD just technically committed murder. I have no doubt that the next murder (the Gaunt ring) was where he probably perfected the technique.

** My headcanon is similar to you: I think he never attempted to make second while he was in Hogwarts. Chambers of Secret was opened in 1942-43. Tom Riddle Sr. was killed in the summer of 1943 after Chambers of Secret closed. And Riddle had the conversation with Slughorn in 6th year - 1943-44. So he couldn't create two Horcrux by 1944. Myrtle was just wrong place in wrong time. Riddle family's murder was used for Horcrux.

** 1) Of the three, Snape's spell creation. It's a whole set of spells that are actually useful in a wide variety of circumstances.

Now that we know what getting an animagus form requires (if you take Pottermore to be canon) and that some magical schools have it as a part of the curriculum, the Marauders' achievement is less about managing the magic than it is about pulling it off with only a few people knowing. (Though, with Dumbledore himself covering for them, that might not have been as big a deal.) Marauder's Map is a far more impressive feat, IMO.

Harry's Patronus was impressive, but children only a year or two older were able to get corporeal ones as well in a much shorter amount of time in DA, and we don't know how many could have done it at a younger age and comparable investment of effort, since almost nobody tries. (More generally, since Patroni are pretty useless unless one expects to deal with Dementors or knows Dumbledore's messenger trick, and since it has a reputation of being very difficult, almost no adults try either.) Now, as you point out, DA students were casting on "easy mode", without a Dementor to drain their happy feelings, but when Harry had used his Patronus to chase away a hundred Dementors in PoA, he was casting on "easy mode" as well: they were going after his past self, and the Harry that actually cast it never felt their aura.

B) Good question. I'm not sure.

III) Agreed on The Imperius. Unlike the other two, it doesn't just control a single person; /its very existence/ sows fear and distrust in society.

*** I like to pretend JkR stopped when Voldemort died and there is no epilogue nor pottermore. The only think I really accept from pottermore is Astoria Greengrass is Malfoy's wife and that's mostly so I can think up family reunions with a HP/DG pairing meaning reluctant brothers in law.

** 1) None of the options you listed. Riddle's mastery of magic in his young age is the most impressive.

2) Nowhere was it stated that you had to kill the person directly. Murder is murder, whether you blow someone's brains out, or you set an animal on them and watch them die.

3) No curse is inherently evil. It's the gun control argument, really- weapon control, if we wanted to be specific. You can stab someone to death with a kitchen knife, or you could make a salad.

You could AK someone and kill them in an instant, or you could Diffindo them for minutes while they bleed out.

*** Disagree with your third point. The unforgivable have no other use than to maim or kill, it's not a tool like a knife, a diffindo, etc. You can argue for ethical use, the fact remain that their only reason to exist is to cause harm.

**** Instantly killing someone is not harming them. Imperius curse doesn't harm either.

Cruciatus, yes, is a pain curse, but it does not physically harm a person. It stimulates the nerve centers to give out pain signals. But, as the story is written by someone with a B.A. in French and Classics, it does not posit a true understanding of what "nerve stimulation" is, which opens up a can of worms I'd rather not delve into, at the moment.

#+begin_quote
  Considering that the curse does not physically harm the victim, it is possible that it only stimulates pain receptors.
#+end_quote

This is merely speculation, and it's well known that the wiki isn't a credible source, they use everything, even stuff from the games which many people don't consider canon. Give me a book quote or WoG.

I just personally dislike the explanation of "X magic achieves this effect by manipulating [insert biology/chemistry/physics]". The Cruciatus doesn't stimulate pain receptors. It simply causes pain. The curse is the manifestation of the concept of pain, just like the KC is the manifestation of death - it doesn't stop your heart or something like that, it simply makes you dead. The Levitation Charm doesn't manipulate gravity or air particles, it simply makes things fly.

********* Except we know from the beginning of GoF that when muggles examine a person killed via Killing Curse there is no discernable cause of death, and things like heart failure or nerve damage is a thing they can determine. Literally a "drop dead" curse.

********* We don't know for sure how it works, but we know there are ways in which it does not work. It might be a command for the body to stop functioning and that's that. It might be something that separates the soul from the body and the soul cannot exist without an anchor. It might be something that damages some sort of metaphysical part of anyone's body that causes it to die but makes it impossible for muggle doctors to detect that this actually happened. Or it might be any of a number of other possibilities.

But it cannot achieve its effect by damaging any of the biologically-present parts of the body, so a heart attack or stopping then nerves aren't a possibility. Making the brain short out, likewise I do not see that happening, and so is the case with stopping the flow of blood (would be detected unless the heart stopped too which we already know can't be the case), making the target suffocate, or putting the body in a stasis it cannot be taken out of (I've seen that theory).

******** To be fair, though, even if it did work by simply making the nerves all flare in pain, that is something that can actually cause insanity and/or brain damage if it's happening for too long at a time. That invalidates the person's you were replying to argument that it causes no physical harm, and that's that. The brain absolutely can be damaged if you continue to overload if with a specific signal for too long without any way for it to rest, and the curse very much can do that or at least something close to it (i.e. the insanity thing).

That said, it might or might not work that way, but honestly I could see it happening. It wouldn't be “manipulating [insert whatever]” but simply magic telling the body to be in as much pain as possible, the same way it says to a levitated object to get its ass in the air, and the person's body doing just that in the way it can do that.
