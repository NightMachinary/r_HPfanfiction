I'm about 3/4 of the way through The Prisoner of Azkaban with my 7-year old and she has the wildest theories. She has been convinced since day 1 that Cornelius Fudge is actually Sirius Black.

Actual quote: "have they ever been seen in the same room together? I don't think so."

*** Okay but I can 100% see something like this in the daily prophet.

'After discovering his boggart, Neville Longbottom discovered a shocking secret. His boggart was no one else but Severus Snape. Now, that may not sound like much, but this Snape looked an awful lot like our dearest Madam Malkin, so we naturally looked into this case and talked with the professor. Not only did he look like a greased bat, but he actually denied it while sneering. This could of course only mean he had something to hide. We talked with several unnamed sources and they confirmed our suspicious: the professor always comments on his students appearances and has a trademark walk with his robe. After this, we went to madam Malkin herself. When we explained why we were there, she (or he?) just told us she didn't have time and had to attend to her customers. This wasn't a surprise at all, it must be a busy life, living this dubble live. After discovering the secret of our dearest potions professor, more witches and wizards came out of their hiding and told us they feel like a wizard, while they were born as a witch and vice versa. Will this be the beginning of a new area?

***** Fair, but I was kinda cracking up because wizards tend to believe everything the daily prophet says, so it would be more logical for Snape to accidentally become a trans symbol if the prophet says so. However, I can imagine the Quibbler coming with other even weirder things about Snape etc, just going with the vibe

They have. Sirius borrowed Fudge's newspaper when he visited Azkaban (from which he found out about Scabbers/Wormtail).

Though I can't remember where the reader learns about this information.

EDIT: Both of them are in the same room when Harry is in the hospital wing at the end of book 4.

And in context Fudge was the first to find Harry after he ran away from privet drive and he was in Hogwarts enough to warrant all of Sirius's break-ins.

** It would make no sense for Sirius to be Fudge. He's preventing his own innocence while alienating his godson. It would make more sense if Sirius was fake Moody. Think about it. Sirius is an escaped convince with nothing to do all year. He can't rally up Order Of The Phoenix members because everyone believes him to be a murderer. It would make more sense for Dumbledore to send a Patronus to potential members. So, Sirius being Sirius, decides to kidnap Moody when Harry's name comes out of the cup to protect his godson. All Barty/fake Moody does throughout the year, besides teaching, is brew polyjuice and help Harry survive the tournament. But Sirius doesn't know that he kidnapped Barty Crouch Jr. So both Crouch and the real Moody are inside Moody's trunk. Right before the third task, Barty escapes, kidnaps Sirius/fake Moody, legilimizes him so he knows what happened throughout the year, and then obliviates him so he believes he was actually in hiding, and then makes the cup into a portkey. When he's caught, he's a strong enough occlumens to resist veritaserum but pretends that he isn't so that Sirius isn't credited for his work.
