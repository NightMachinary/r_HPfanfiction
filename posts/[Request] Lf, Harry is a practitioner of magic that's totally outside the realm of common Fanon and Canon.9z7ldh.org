** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] almost satisfies that requirement! Its huge and very well thought out, but the character with the alternate system for magic is an OC. It's a great read, much better than you'd expect, plus Harry is still in the fic from what I remember.

I understand that like many writers, Miranda moved to a job that wasn't conducive to long blocks of writing like before. (I seem to recall she was an anthropologist or paleontologist or something that afforded long blocks of time in the field she could use for writing.) When she was putting out regular updates, they'd come in large chunks, several chapters being published over a relatively short time.

** Linkffn(13082443)

Not exactly what you're looking for, as Harry still uses a wand and goes to Hogwarts, but he studies mostly forgotten Old Norse Magics that invoke the elements. The story itself seems to be a Wrong BWL story starting in GoF, and it's 180k+ words. I don't know if it's still being updated as the whole thing was published Oct 2nd of this year.

I don't think that's quite accurate.

The author took the story down and then reposted the whole thing again on Oct. 2 Before that, the author was posting relatively regularly (every couple of weeks or so) while the story was being written (last update of that installment being June 18).

I do agree that it seems likely to be abandoned at this point, though other stories have picked up after longer hiatuses.

** in the secret language of plants series linkao3(9323225) when harry goes to Hogwarts he's angry and desperately doesn't want to be there (not angsty, it's bc of valid plot reasons) and basically shuns his classes and regular magic (he usually forgets his wand). anyway eventually he starts using magic through music in this really unique way (the music kinda helps him channel or focus the magic and the music influences what the magic is) which I've never seen before! him using magic differently is a pretty big part of the plot (he also breaks some magical rules and has an affinity for animals, if that's of interest)
