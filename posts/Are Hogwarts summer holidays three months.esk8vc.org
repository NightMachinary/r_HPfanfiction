Because in England usually the summers are only six weeks long. Although I'm not sure about boarding schools but I still think it's the same.


** School starts September 1st, and the 3rd task in book 4 is on June 24th. Iirc school continues for at least a few days after the task, so the summer break is probably just July and August.

*** Remember one fic where Harry and Sirius said, "Screw Britain." and moved to the States. Ending had Harry going home after school wondering why Hogwarts was a boarding school. Did British wizards even like their kids?

**** Probably just history? Hogwarts has been around a long time, and probably made more sense to board them than have them go home every day. People go to boarding school in the US too.

** Usually the summer break is from June 20th (the day they board the Express at the end of 1st year) to August 31st. Fourth year is different but it's usually 2 months and change.
