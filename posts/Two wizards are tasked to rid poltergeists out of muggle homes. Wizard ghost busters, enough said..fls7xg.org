** Bonus points if they work for Rooter Wizards Plumbing.

Triple points if they have some kind of EMP reader Weasleys Wizard Wheezes toy that they check after and 'hear a voice.'

Full marks if they run screaming from a room, claiming a spirit is vengefully after them.

Edit: I haven't watched /Ghost Hunters/ for so long, I forgot it's an "EMF" to check electronic voice phenomena. D'oh!
