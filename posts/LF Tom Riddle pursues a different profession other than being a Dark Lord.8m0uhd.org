Rebellion leader, professor, minister, muggle rights activist, nargle hunter, whatever. I don't care if he's still evil, has minions, and/or has horcruxes, he just has to be something other than a dark lord. Fanfics about Quirrelmort being a professor doesn't count. Horcruxes having different professions while his other self is being a dark lord somewhere else doesn't count either. Thanks.


** [[https://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] by Sam Storyteller/Copperbadge is an outstanding one-shot with Riddle as Hogwarts Professor.

** linkffn(Rectifier) Incomplete, but good. An alternative dimension Tom Riddle who ended up a professor and a researcher instead of a dark lord comes to the canon universe. It does a good job of exploring a possible reason for him turning "good" while still keeping him in character.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

  An attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands Hermione in 1944. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
