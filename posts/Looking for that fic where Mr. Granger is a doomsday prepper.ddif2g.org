:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Someone nukes the world, and both muggles and magical folk have to figure out how to survive. I remember a lot of details about this, but I don't want to spoil.

EDIT: found!! Highly recommend it, it's a fascinating read that makes me realize I won't survive nuclear war :)


** Still searching, but I seem to think that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6719282/1/]] is it? Haven't read it but saw the fic you are looking for recommended awhile back and this seems familiar. Still looking if it is not.

Edit:Found the post, think this is it.

*** Hmm. Not a bad fic. I would have enjoyed a bit more focus on the wider societal impact of the nuclear EMP - maybe meeting the people who build bunkers with years of supplies, or having to deal with the mobs at ground level instead of just seeing them from the sky - and a bit less of Harry getting a super-wand, but those are minor points in a fic that shows a fair bit of thought and effort.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.
