Anyone who's read 'Realizations' by wishweaver on ff.net know of other similar stories? I know there are a bunch in this trope, but I thought this one was unique. (I don't know how to do the ff.net link thingy)


** linkffn(Realizations by wishweaver)

Hope that's the one you mean, [[/u/roseworthh]]

You can click on 'Usage' on the bot links to get a full guide but it's really as simple as this to get the right fic in 99% of cases.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
