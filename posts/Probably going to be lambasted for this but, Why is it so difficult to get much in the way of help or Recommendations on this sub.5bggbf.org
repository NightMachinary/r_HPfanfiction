This is going to be a bit rambly im sorry.

I am a simple HP fan, who loves to read fanfiction in his spare time. Iv been reading since i was in middleschool, going on seven years now.

I enjoy Anime and Videogames, and some of my favorite fanfics are crossovers. Due to this im sure that its not hard to realize that i enjoy fanfics that have a more Physical side to them.

During my time lurking through tons of posts over the past week what ive noticed is a bit dissapointing. In most of what i have seen, whenever a user asks for help finding a specific theme of fanfic the replies they recieve either end up being long winded explanations of why their request does not fit into the HP universe, or the replies are filled with the same 20 or so fics.

I understand that many people are on this subreddit looking for in depth discussion on spectacular fanfics. But if you decide to go visit a post and give a reply, maybe you should take a minute to think of what is being asked.

If i decide to make a post asking for some good martial arts harry fics, i am probably aware that the HP cannon has better things than being a martial artist. But i have decided to ask for help finding an above average story that uses martial arts or hand to hand combat as a primary story point. I wouldn't make the post expecting to see 30+ replies talking about how martial arts doesn't fit the aesthetic of HP, How i should read Sunsinger or how training in kung fu takes much longer to train in than most fics say.

I just needed to rant im sorry. I'm just tired of asking for help finding something fun to read that fits the aesthetic i want, and only getting one helpful response because people dont think what in their eyes is a mediocre fic is worth recommending to someone who is asking for it.

All im asking is, maybe the next time you decide to reply to a "Looking for" post you should take a minute to give a story suggestion that fits the theme and that you haven't seen in a while before you mention how what is being asked for has no place in Harry Potter.


** I won't make excuses for other people, but personally I don't keep track of the fics I read. So out of the dozen fics I've read that include martial arts, I'll only really remember one or two, at most. And maybe one of these days I'll go through my favorites list and organize everything in a spreadsheet, but that day is not today.

Frankly, and I realize this is elitist of me, if you want to find fics that aren't recommended then you need to go looking. I have trawled through the archives almost every day for two years looking for stuff that might interest me. My browser has well over thirty tabs of potential fics that I haven't gotten to yet. /I have spent time on this/. And the result is that I have a few favorites I remember and a lot of favorites I've forgotten. If we haven't seen a fic recommended in a while, it's probably because we've forgotten it exists. And if we do remember, it's likely buried so deeply that, for most people, it's not worth the personal effort of finding it.

I'm sorry this is frustrating for you, and I do wish I had kept track of what I read; but I haven't, and I'm not going to retrace my steps. Thus, I can only recommend the few that stick in my mind, or the one that I'm stuck on now.

*** Iv done about the same thing in my time on FF.Net. I only recently started my own account, before then i just had all of my favorites in bookmarks until i had so many that i would loose most of my collection whenever i needed to clean up my list. around 7 years of daily reading has made my new pickings a little slim.

So i do understand, it just gets to me sometimes that with a community as big as this, how difficult it can be to find out of the norm reccomendations. I have run through most of the decent fics that had premises that i was interested in, and when i came to this board i was hoping that there would be something more for me to go for.

And i do understand that this is just how it is, it just finally got to me and i needed to do something to get this irritation out.

** Sometimes people who make threads are too specific or have too many conditions. There are unlikely to be any fics exactly like that. And you also get the opposite, where something really general is posted. In that case they should have used the search bar.

I don't think you can blame people for having a discussion instead of posting fics. I don't think those people are withholding their fic recommendations. If they don't post them, it's because they don't have any!

As for the reason why people don't have recommendations, it's hard to remember all the fics we've read. I think that's one of the reasons why the same ones are always being posted.

Edit: Also, I'm less likely to remember one that's not as good.

** It may seem strange for there to be etiquette on a SR devoted to Harry Potter fanfiction of all things, but there are things that submitters should do before/while posting a request:

1. Use the search bar. >90% of requests have been asked before. If it wasn't for that handy tool, I would probably post several annoying Request threads every single day.

2. Post other stories in the same genre that you enjoyed and say what you liked about them. For example, 'LF WBWL Fics' doesn't give us much to go on compared to 'Please Suggest Something Similar to Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews'

3. Be ready to compromise. If you request fem!slash, powerful Harry crossed over with Sherlock and Star Wars, don't expect there to be many candidates.

** 1. The reason why the same fics get posted again and again is that there are only so many good fanfics in the fandom. I'm sorry but we can't just conjure up fics that don't exist.

2. When it comes to certain themes and tropes, there are no good fics period. Again, sorry, but just because you ask a question it doesn't mean there's an answer.

Reading crossovers and combat based alternate universes for going on seven years makes it hard for me to find many decent fics for that type of set up that i haven't at least tried yet. Its why i joined this board, for help finding new fics to read that fit my taste.

** I have learned that some of the posters in this sub are very, very opinionated. This can both be good and bad. Good in that I have seen some wonderfully thought out discussions of certain aspects of the fandom, and bad in that sometimes it makes you automatically dismiss something that sounds "off." I guess we are all guilty of the latter at one point or another.

There are also certain tropes that people simply refuse to entertain. For me it's using rape or child abuse simply to add drama to your story without addressing any of the mental or emotional issues that come afterward.

Then there are the requests that are so ridiculously specific that there probably isn't a fanfic that meets the requirements. "I want a cyborg ventriloquist Harry Potter who travels back in time to save Abraham Lincoln and then returns to marry Charo. 100k+ words please." I just pulled the premise out of my ass, if you haven't guessed and it is probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard of (although I would probably give such a fic a try just for the wtf factor)

But if I see a reasonable request, and can remember ever coming across a story that meets more of the criteria, I'll try to find a link. Even for plots I don't really like much.

** I think one thing that is true of the internet is that people are going to be lazy. That includes you and everyone else in the world. So asking for requests is riding on the kind-hearted nature of strangers. I will admit that the search tool is heavily underused by most newcomers and searchers. So if you are looking for a certain kind of fic or genre, try the search tool first. Second, if you see request threads that you may be able to help out with, go ahead and comment a fic or two. Or twenty. A community is only as strong as its members, so be a good member and help out when you can. Also, there are some really bad fics out there so finding ones that one would personally recommend can be a bid difficult. But to each their own. The best way to find fics is to just trawl through sites till you find what you want.

Now all that being said, I do think this subreddit is /incredibly/ opinionated. This is good that it promotes clash and discussion, but it also sets taboos and weird cultural laws that become standard especially on this subreddit. And that really kills my enthusiasm in this sub sometimes. Watching a newcomer come on and ask if there are any Harry/Fleur or Harry/Daphne or Harmony fics only for most of the comments to be ridiculing them for liking the trope or bashing most of the fics is well...dickish. I understand that there are only a "handful" of good fics that fit those genres in your mind, but please let every person decide for themselves. If you are going to call a book good or bad, please explain why you think so. And be respectful about it. For example, A Cadmean Victory is a fic that really often gets bashed on this sub (and its almost become my calling card to defend it in my mind), so whenever it gets brought up most the threads following it all claim its bad, its too AU, its too edgy, and never explain why they thought so. I'm not asking people to make their criticism into dissertations, but please be respectful and elaborate if you can. Maybe some other people don't have the same objections or like those kind of fics.

I find that there are alot of people on this sub who take a holier-than-thou approach to fanfiction and it really rubs me the wrong way. I wish this community would be more open and, for lack of a better word, relaxed when it comes to fanfiction.

** I would have argued the exactly opposite, funny enough. I see endless posts asking for weirder shit than I could ever imagine or want to read and there is never any mocking and normally at least a couple of people have suggestions.

As to why the same fics come up it is because you can only easily recall so many fics. I see requests for marriage contract fics and think "well there's hundreds of those" but I can't remember any because I have read them once and discarded them. But I do remember /The Amalgamation Agreement/ for example becuase it is recommend frequently and so I post it and it perpetually remains a frequent recommendation.

I am frustrated by the repetitive nature of the recommendations. To say that they are the only 'good' stories in the fandom out of however many hundreds of thousands - well, really, what an arrogant suggestion! Especially as some of the recs really aren't that great. They obviously meet a specific fandom requirement, but in terms of writing quality, very few of them would stand up outside fanfiction.

But regarding the limited number of recs, there's a lot of people on this sub, and a lot of different tastes. Finding someone with the exact same taste as you is going to be pretty damn near impossible, so unless you're after a pretty common trope, most of the recs you get are going to be popular and well-known, simply because that's what everyone's heard of. Unfortunately that's a bit of a downside of having a niche taste.

Crossovers are even more of a mixed bag quality-wise than other types of fanfic, and quality seems to be the driving force of this sub.

I wish I could be more of help to you! I don't know off the top of my head any martial-arts-centric stories, but if you listed off a few animes or games you'd be interested in reading crossovers with, I could see what I could track down?

*** Thanks for the reply and good points all round, and yeah i understand that's the case. Personally i just enjoy a fic that doesn't use oc's, doesn't go edgy and sticks to the rule of cool, Seeing a moment where an author can make me imagine a truly badass fight scene or where two of my favorite worlds come together into a stupid but fun mix up.

Martial arts stories were just an example i used, but i will admit i have been looking for a while for a good warrior harry fic. Something that has a real adventure vibe, and has harry using some fighting skills, be it with weapons or his fists.

as for series' that i like, Full metal alchemist, Fairy Tail, Fate stay night, Bleach, One Piece, Avengers, any Final Fantasy, Dragon Age, are all some of my favorite series, but i seem to have scoured their boards for most of the decent stuff.

I remember some Fullmetal Alchemist, Final Fantasy ones that were REALLY good. Avengers is a favourite of mine as well. I recall linkffn(Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewellyn) off the top of my head. I'll be home in 12ish hours or so, and will dig into a search over the next day or two!

Something doesn't have to be 'good' by the standards of the sub to be a fun romp and an engaging read. If all literature had to be of great quality, there wouldn't be romance novels for sale in the supermarket.

***** Child of the storm was the shit! I will admit i got into a lul between chapters at one point and had a hard time picking it back up after 3 weeks or so.

As for the "Fun" not needing to be "Good" point, that's exactly what i enjoy! A lot of my favorite series are shonen, and those things are full of bad cliches and cringey/goofy moments. But that's why people love them! Stupid but epic moments, with a decent plotline and a good ending are about all i really need in my fanfiction.

**** You might want to look into Naruto crossovers, as that is a pretty fighting/martial arts focused fandom and its the most popular crossover with harry potter. However again there aren't that many really good fics and a lot of bad ones. And many of the good ones are abandoned.

Do you have any One Piece recommendations? I've looked briefly before but didn't find that many that seemed appealing and were either still active or complete.

** I think it's displaced frustration at not being able to help. People go into a post to read what someone is looking for, hoping they'll be able to rec something, but then find they have never read, or indeed even imagined, any fic like what the poster is looking for. And neither has anyone else responding.

So then they start to think about why that might be, why no one is writing these martial arts Harry fics- and their explanation they've just thought up, of why there is no such thing- they give /that/ to the poster instead. Because they feel bad that they have no rec to give.

  I enjoy Anime and Videogames, and some of my favorite fanfics are crossovers. Due to this im sure that its not hard to realize that i enjoy fanfics that have a more Physical side to them.
#+end_quote

I don't even realise what you mean by "physical side", and I'm very big anime fan, played quite a few video games too.

#+begin_quote
  During my time lurking through tons of posts over the past week what ive noticed is a bit dissapointing. In most of what i have seen, whenever a user asks for help finding a specific theme of fanfic the replies they recieve either end up being long winded explanations of why their request does not fit into the HP universe
#+end_quote

Which absolutely makes sense considering that bad ideas are bad, and sometimes it's worth explaining why they're bad.

#+begin_quote
  or the replies are filled with the same 20 or so fics.
#+end_quote

Because the questions on this subreddit are very repetitive. I have my list of recommendations from which I copy-paste the fitting fics, and those are usually the same ones.

#+begin_quote
  I understand that many people are on this subreddit looking for in depth discussion on spectacular fanfics. But if you decide to go visit a post and give a reply, maybe you should take a minute to think of what is being asked.
#+end_quote

The people who start discussion about given idea having merit in HP universe think about what's being asked, otherwise they wouldn't start discussion.

#+begin_quote
  If i decide to make a post asking for some good martial arts harry fics, i am probably aware that the HP cannon has better things than being a martial artist.
#+end_quote

Well, yes. Cannon usually shoot. That's much more fitting for them than fighting hand to hand. Also is this what you've meant by "physical" side? How in the world is this related to liking anime and video games?

#+begin_quote
  But i have decided to ask for help finding an above average story that uses martial arts or hand to hand combat as a primary story point.
#+end_quote

But considering that this isn't a good idea, it would be hard to create and even more hard to find fic that uses it and isn't shit. Well, unless you go full AU and replace HP magic system with some magical martial arts. But then you could just read Naruto fic instead.

*** Thanks for the reply.

- Physical Fanfics- what i meant about Physical fics, was that if the fic has decent grammar, keeps most characters In-Character, and makes use of some good fight scenes (usually by mixing some kind of martial fighting style in with spellcasting) then im likely to enjoy the fic. And from my experience you get more of this kind of fic from crossovers.

- /Which absolutely makes sense considering that bad ideas are bad, and sometimes it's worth explaining why they're bad/- I mostly disagree with this, i am of the opinion that no premise is inherently bad. How a story comes out is independent on what ideas the author uses.

- Having a list for the most obvious fics of a set trope that you think people will ask for is the problem in my eyes. Take a look at the martial arts theme i mentioned. Its so damn annoying that any time i see someone mention a martial arts Harry fic i usually only see Harry Potter and the Sun Source

- When people start discussions on this board, i understand that they are going to mention how the requested idea will fit into the HP universe, What i mean by my post is that, When you go to a post that says "Looking for Gundam Pilot Harry" then the post is asking for that kind of fic, and the poster should be aware that to get what they want they have to go into AU territory. And they are probably posting here because they want to see the HP characters or setting with a major difference.

  Some people are not looking for the best of the best stories, they are just looking for a fun story that isnt full of grammatical errors, misspelled sentences, and is just generally a good time to read.
