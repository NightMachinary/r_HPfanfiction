Im sure most of you know it and are reading it, but it was finished fairly recently and the ending was pretty great. One of the more original HP fan fics I've read recently.

** I personally couldn't get into Blindness(or the fics that are in that genre).... The reason why is i don't get the point in making the character blind or Deaf then say cause magic we are going to give the character a way to see or hear better than if they were normal.... That made no sense to me, If heard a lot of good things about blindness and I hope that people get enjoyment out of it, I just couldn't

*** I think the point is to show how different Harry's world is. How different he is from other people is actually a big part of the plotline and is very important for the ending the author came up with. And alot of what he can do comes from him being blind and being able to see in an alternative way. It's not just something the author put in for fun and then forgot about. It's always there, and it's very integrated within the story. Even the author's narration is different because of it.

It's a good fic. If you're ever going to try a fic about blind Harry make it this one.

**** I mean cannon harry is very different from everybody as well. That aside I get the point, and from what little I have read I will agree it was integrated well. I just can't personally get into it. When I hear blind I want to read about someone being blind (though that probably wouldn't be very exciting) or someone that is blind becoming able to see. It just feels kinda misleading to me I guess to have the story about blindness, when the character gets arguably better vision that a normal person has

***** Yeah, I understand. If you went into it expecting a really disabled Harry you'd really be disappointed.

*** That's fair. I think the idea was that him being blind allowed him to see in a different way, which comes in to play really interestingly (not just the usual way).

The writing is really good - much better than 99% of fan fiction. The author doesnt a good job of crafting a story. Put it this way - this is one of the few fan fics that could've existed on its one, without the overall structure of Harry Potter.

*** Same, I couldn't really get into it. Completely a personal preference thing - Blindness is super fucking well written and really descriptive. However, I found it too well written and slightly too AU for my taste. I enjoy fanfiction that reads like fanfiction, Blindness reads like a full blown fantasy novel. There's not even that much world building but it's too much for me. While I like a story with a different take on things, the whole staff thing got blown out of proportion, and I realize the general public of the Wizarding World would probably react like that, but it felt really overblown to me. Completely a personal opinion, it's a really great story but I can't really stomach it.

**** I know what you're talking about. For me I felt that way about Lippert's James Potter series. It was so well written but it didn't feel like the HP world anymore. Like, the author put in so much of his own stuff that it felt like it's his own world already rather than JKR's.

***** Lik Blindness isn't even that AU, it's just I have REALLY low tolerance for AU. When something stops reading like a fanfiction, I stop reading it

*** Oddly enough, that was the reason I DIDN'T read Blindness for a long time, despite it being recommended. I never felt up to reading a story with that disability at the center of the story and was pleasantly surprised to find it didn't dominate the story, just provided a catalyst for the AU changes. The story butterfly effects pretty far from canon pretty early because of the changes, but not in a way that bothered me.

Hopefully if anyone else was on the fence for this reason, they'll give it a shot, I highly recommend it

That's the best part of the fic... I mean that it immediately drops the bomb of Harry not even attending Hogwarts. Most authors who attempt fics like this don't have any vision and go through all the stations of canon, except Harry is blind now, so he can't play Quidditch without a cane.

** I liked the fic overall but it was clear the ending was rushed. I get why the author wanted an end to the story, but I would've been better if they didn't try cram it all together for the sake of an 'official ending'
