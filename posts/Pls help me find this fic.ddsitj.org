:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm gonna copy and paste an ask because it basically describes. If anyone knows if it's been archived or the author ?

I'm looking for an in-progress fic it's post-war---golden and silver trios returning for 8th year, they are all sitting in a classroom and bickering when something goes wrong and everyone's children (as teenagers) come from the future into the classroom. Draco and Hermione's son comes back and her seems to really hate his dad for some reason, and is like a few other teens come back I think Pansy/Ron's kid is one of he ones who comes back too? It was less than 10 chapters long I think? Please help! Some kind of globe/orb thing appeared and it exploded and the children came out of it (?) and Scorpius had an american accent (?) and he hated Draco because Draco and Hermione divorced and I think Draco wasn't around, and Harry and Luna's daughter has an Australian accent.
