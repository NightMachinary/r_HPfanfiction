** Vox Corporis. H/Hr. Harry is a black panther. Hermione is a lioness.

Accidental Animagus has Harry as a cat but I haven't read it.

Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived has Harry as a pheonix, although I find magical forms to be a bit silly.

There's one more I remember with him as a black cat. He's embarrassed about it so doesn't show many people. It might be the Merging but I dunno. I remember Daphne Greengrass plays a big role in the story though.

**** Oh, that's right, I forgot that one. I feel like someone may have made him a stag just like his dad, too. But it seems like he's usually a predator.

** linkffn(Breath of the Inferno) the author said this is on hiatus until he figures out what to do but, I don't know how he ran out of ideas I mean it has so much potential, Harry was a dragon kind of based off of smaug from lord of the ring.

  [HIATUS - Read Profile!] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Runestone path) Shadow Panther, can walk through shadows. As far as I have read (I dropped it because I got bored of it) it didn't seem too overpowered.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** If you don't mind a Harry Potter/Pokemon crossover, then you could try this one? (linkffn4826372)

As one might guess by the name of the fic, Harry turns into a Mew.
