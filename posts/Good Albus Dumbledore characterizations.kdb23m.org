Don't want any bashing. Now: Things he did in canon is one thing, but having him steal Harry's money, having him use Harry for his fame/fortune etc, is not okay at all.

He doesn't have to be the main character, though he can be. I just want good Albus Dumbledore characterizations, he can be a super minor character, if you want.

Anyone can be the main character/on any site/any length/old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** LinkFFN- Found by swamygliders Its only one chapter but it is good. I really like this author in general you should check out their other work.

There is another one that I often see recommended on this subreddit, but I have not read it before and it is called LinkFFN- Albus and Harry's World Trip by zebjeb

I know there are others, but I can not think of any other fics at the moment

** "Good Albus Dumbledore characterization" is my personal holy grail of fanfic, so I have accumulated... a lot. Broken into three loose categories:

Fics that focus on Harry & Dumbledore:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22190359][worth a thousand words]] linkao3(22190359) - oneshot (highly recommend the author's other HP stuff, too)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343) - WIP
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641464/1/Forgive-an-Old-Man][Forgive an Old Man]] linkffn(5641464) - oneshot
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788265/1/Tis-the-Season][Tis the Season]] linkffn(8788265) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24458131][Fashion Advice and Butterbeer]] linkao3(24458131) - oneshot
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308375/1/The-Petrov-Gambit][The Petrov Gambit]] linkffn(13308375) - oneshot

- [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mpDBEsC3QscSlHi_YsIvQbLwZyad1231/view][ON THE VARIOUS METHODS OF MAGICAL TRANSLOCATION: A REVIEW]] - oneshot, written in the style of an academic paper, with Dumbledore as the author. Surprisingly readable, and Dumbledore's character shines through clearly.

Harry Is A Dragon features one of my favourite Dumbledores - he's fundamentally silly, but entirely competent in dealing with situations like Harry nearly getting expelled (for being a dragon).

Albus And Harry's World Trip has them both getting ousted from Hogwarts, so in response Dumbledore drops all pretense and starts training Harry himself. In the form of mercilessly trolling /everyone/, and expecting Harry to do it back.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]]

It's an AU Dumbledore cos the fanfic is about how Harry travels to an alternative universe after Voldemort's been defeated. But I do like how Dumbledore's been characterized here and rhe relationship he shares with Harry. He's sneaky sure but he's not cartoon villain evil. Even Harry's original Dumbledore just has the things that happened in the books (well except for book 7).

  Harry just wanted a moment of peace. He didn't want any trouble. But in typical fashion, he falls off a quidditch goalpost and a concussion later he's seeing visions of Merlin's life... or is he just finally going crazy? Harry-is-Merlin reincarnated. Druids, Mordred, Arthurian legend reinvented. Oh yes, and a few dragons.

** If you want a very different Dumbledore character who's still a scheming master manipulator, but also totally on the protagonist's side while also being very very different than normal and a very good quality character, Linkffn(The Granger Principle). Soooo much originality in this one.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
