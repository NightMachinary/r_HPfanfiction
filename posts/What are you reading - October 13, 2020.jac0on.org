** - “To Walk A Mile In someone else's Shoes by IamMegumi” linkffn(7452425) ... good ol' “potion mishap genderbender” (except this is intentional) fem!Harry PWP story. Luna and Harry switch bodies, fall in love immediately (sex next day after getting together). If you are not into long shopping descriptions, don't bother.

- “Trust Is A Relative Thing by Silverfawkes” linkffn(6611208) It starts like rather good Dumbledore-bashing (but surprisingly Petunia-approving) story and wizarding world politics, but it is now turning into Flames/Atlantis super!Harry, and so I am tuning out.

- To have at least one positive mention let me add “History Lessons by Bloodpage-Alchemist” linkffn(4030448) --- short story about how Dudley keeps writing with Harry (and to his later surprise also Dumbledore) during whole Harry's stay at Hogwarts. Well written.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

** Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by TemporalKnight I believe it's rated M I'm only about a third of the way through the 50 chapters but I am highly engrossed. Harry is a savant with magic runes and focuses on them more then his spellwork. It's a Harmony story with the potential for a harem and a side of Ron bashing. Also it feels like Dumbledore will be evil in the end but nothing solid to support that yet. I feel like this Fic needs more attention then it appears to have its one of the best written that I've read in a while.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded by slowfox) It's pretty good. It's kept me engaged for 40 chapters right now. I like most of the characters and the relationships are also pretty good. The plot is somewhat slow, but not slow enough for me to get bored. There's also no bashing.

** Just finished "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13304599/1/An-Ordinary-Magical-Couple][An Ordinary Magical Couple]]", which is a Harry/Daphne pairing. The writing style and dialogue were crisp. The story follows the main canon story line to use as the underpinnings, though does not linger on or rehash all those plot points. Instead, it focuses on other hypothetical moments not highlighted in canon and weaves Daphne into Harry's life in an evolving relationship that is mostly kept hidden from others.

  Harry is just this eleven-year-old trying to cope when Hagrid shows up. Daphne Greengrass is smart, plain, hardworking and a pureblood witch from a family of very modest means. They aren't rich or prominent among the wizarding social set, but they are full of guile and learn fast. Of course they're underestimated, until it is too late.

** Just finished reading /Democracy/ (linkffn(13072492)). It's a pretty interesting fanfic dealing with Wizengamot politics in the aftermatch of the Second War, told from Neville Longbottom's perspective.

The fic mainly deals with Hermione's attempts to reform the Wizarding society, as well as the opposing view. What I found nice about it is that while it's pretty obvious which side is in the right, neither side is presented as either totally wrong or absolutely infallible - both have compelling reasons and arguments that support their point of view.

Pretty much the only compaint I have is that the fic is rather short - then again, this might be for the best, given how many fanfics tend to drag on and on with no end in sight.

Also starting to reread one of my favourite fics - /Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time/ (linkffn(4068153)). Probably one of the best time traveler!Harry fics out there (and, coincidentally, the one that introduced me to Harry/Fleur pairing). Would definitely recommend everyone to give this one a try.

Last but not least, /We Shall All Perish If The Dark Lord Comes: Bellatrix Lestrange in Canon/ (linkao3(23926540)) is an interesting essay with a pretty self-explanatory title.

*** I read /Democracy/ up to and including the point where Neville tells Hermione that if she doesn't like the government she should just leave.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** I've been catching up on The Auction by LoveBitca8. It's a dark AU spinoff of one of her earlier fics. DM/HG, Explicit, plenty of clearly labelled trigger warnings to go around. I didn't think I'd be as into it as I am ---- the premise and some of the magic involved is fascinating.

  In the wake of the Dark Lord's triumph over Harry Potter, the defeated must learn their new place. Hermione Granger, former Golden Girl, has been captured and reduced to human chattel. Sold to the highest bidder as the top prize at an auction of Order members and sympathizers, she is thrust into the rabid, waiting hands of the Death Eaters. But despite the horrors of Voldemort's new world, help---and hope---seem to arise from the most unlikely of places.PART 3 of the RIGHTS AND WRONGS series.
