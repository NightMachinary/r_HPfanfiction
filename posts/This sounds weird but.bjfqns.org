I'm looking for the cliche evil Molly, crazy ginny, super harry, mad food eater ron ect.


** You know what's weird? For all the Weasley bashing Harmony I read, I've only read one fic where Ron is a death eater. Blood pureist, sure, a jerk, maybe, dumb as a doorknob occasionally, but never a death eater. Most of the time he is loyal to manipulative or evil Dumbledore.

*** He's talking about how Ron eats like mad in Fanon

*** Now I kind of want someone to do a serious take on Ron Weasley becoming a death eater. Maybe he gets sorted into Slytherin and falls in with the wrong sort as a result of his animosity with Hermione (as per canon)/Jealousy of Harry (due to getting sorted into Gryffindor)/Rivalry with Draco? Maybe he and Draco become friends somehow, and he pulls a sort of reverse Sirius?

** You know I haven't seen much of those since 2010. I wonder if I've been subconsciously avoiding them or if people are knowingly avoiding these cliches

*** They keep popping up, though they finally seem to be dying off.

Until they do, I keep close boxing them.

** This likely isn't exactly what you're looking for, but this one's got all of that except for the mad food eater ron bit. Note that the Molly and Ginny stuff are in the background, but still present.
