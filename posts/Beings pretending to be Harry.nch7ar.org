Hi, I would like fanfics where someone or something pretends to be Harry like in 'The accidental vessal' where the archangel Gabriel accidentally possessed Harry.

** There are a few I can recommend, but one that I absolutely loved before the author stopped updating on ffn and moved to AO3 is a very slowburn snarry fic (which is really one-sided at first) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11696688/0][Be the death of me]] by Hweianime. It's basically a Harry!Death-the-cosmic-entity fic. It's really funny for the most part, but the snarry is personally super cringe (and this story is part of the reason why I don't like reading them anymore), but it's still a great read. And even though it's basically abandoned on ffn, the author still updates it on AO3 under the same username (last time I checked, at least, which was a few years ago).

P.S. It has Percy/Harry in it as well for a little while, and that relationship is super freaking cute, like, I'd gush everytime I read it for how adorable it is!

Fem!Harry dies, and her body is possessed by a fire spirit who really doesn't understand human motivation.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.
