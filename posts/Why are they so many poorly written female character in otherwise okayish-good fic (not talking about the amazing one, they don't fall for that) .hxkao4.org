And, consequently, *how do you write a character from the opposite sex ?* Because i feel like i don't get where authors went wrong. I mean, if i'm writing women i'll plan a characters with flaws and qualities, add physical characteristics, then add the "correct" female socialization based on where they came from / who where their parents / what society they were in. Add a number on the "performing this feminity" scale and whatever behavioral/thought pattern consequences from past experiences and there you go, a female character with enough background she will hopefully not end as a trophy / MC girlfriend only, but instead will grow and evolve in someone of herself.If i'm writing a male : plan the character, add the physical characteristics too, add the "correct" male socialization + a number on the scale of performing it (it's not ironclad of course, you can definitely have evolution of it if it matters in the story / you choose to make it happen, just like women), and do the rest just like the female character. Their sex don't matter that much honestly.

/Rent :/ So why, why can an author make correct male characters, and suddently when it's about girls they don't know how to write anymore. I was attempting to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/][*/Whispers in the Night/*]] (it's only the last straw that broke the camel back, i've been annoyed for a long time. But i don't recommend it) and the few scenes Bill was in, he was correctly written, as was Ron, but suddenly every girl around want to press their back against Harry ? In what world ? It's not even a problem about harem, because i can understand the fantasy (even if i feel dejected that almost no male harem exist, but one can keep dreaming), i just can't understand at what point an author can say "hum, yes, this one-dimensional, penis-wanting character who happen to be a girl is very realistic. Many reader will identify with her, that's for sure. Should i add a few sentences to make it evident that people all around (teenagers actually) feel a bit lost about what to do with their bits and how to flirt / if even flirting is a good idea / ambivalence or anxiousness about what could come next ? Naaah, let's keep it reaaally simple, surely a pornified version of an interaction is better." //rent over/

I mean, many of us grew up in a time period with the incredible chance to have true friendship from the other sex. The expected social behavior based on our sex is at his lowest in almost two millenium. We interact with each other daily outside of our family unit, why is there still so much misunderstanding ?Do you agree with my point ? Do you think i'm wrong (and if so, i would gladly read why) ? Do you think it's a writing problem, an empathy / ability to think themselves as someone else problem ? a wet teenager dream i shouldn't spend so much time writing about ? I'd like to read your opinion on this, if it's a problem for you too, or if not.

â€‹

Edit : as correctly spotted by [[/u/Gustard99][u/Gustard99]], i wrote this with two unverified assumptions and one sexist bias :\\
1. */Most writer and reader are women./* I don't know if it's still true, but if it's the case then i'm guilty of thinking women not able to be misogynist, which we know is sadly not true (that's the bias btw). Tbh i thought the "enemy to friend to lover" was mostly from women author, with the "nurse complex" still going strong among our group. Who wouldn't want a totally fucked up man only you could understand and bring back in the land of living, only doing that would make him independent of you so you won't because drama is the fuel of life right /s (ugh, just writting that made me tired. On another note, if that's your thing, it's okay, i was mostly making fun at teenager me)\\
2. */Male writer are the author of the aforementioned pieces/*, and as said by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]], women here are not to be identified with. The last thing is, of course, true in our example, but i feel like it's everywhere (toned down of course). You can usually have one correctly written woman (hermione, or the MC girlfriend) but it always kind of fall short after that. If women are the most prolific writer in fanfiction, where are my multi-dimensional with different objective women ? (There is, of course, but i feel like for every correctly written females characters in HP fandom, i must go through 10 mediocre one. I don't feel the same in the Worm fandom for example. Is it because it's more recent ? The MC in canon is a woman ? The original work made some interlude giving us glimpse of other character thought, whereas in HP it's not the case ? i don't know...

Thanks for your answer.


** Because harem stories are a male power fantasy and females are usually used as props. Reverse harems the opposite but same (usually more developed though but rarer to find?). I prefer reading polyamory fics since it's more focused on actual relationships involving more than two people and there are some great tags on AO3 to narrow down different sort of poly ships.

*** Yeah, i get that. But doesn't it end up dull after a while of always writing the same things ? Don't they feel a bit silly about writing character like that ? I guess people can actually read through these parts, but it always breaks me out of the story in my case. Like, in a world of actual magic, with dragons and soul anchor, the thing making me close the tab is "nah, one girl doing that, okay, every girl, that's definitely not real"

  how do you write a character from the opposite sex ?
#+end_quote

Like any other character. Perhaps a tad less crude in dialogue, I have yet to see a group of girls/women banter like guys (would it still be "I fucked your mum" or do women default to the father?), but still, we aren't that different.

Not every woman is a feminine Disney princess, I still fondly remember a classmate who was better than any of the guys in basketball and we joked that she'd beat any guy up if he tried something stupid. Another friend was by far the filthiest person I ever knew, including the guy who goes to BDSM meet-ups, and she wasn't shy about it. She drank and cursed like a sailor. She'd ask people about jerking off in class, about the porn they watched, to rate the other girls based on various physical attributes and so on. She was a blast to be around because you never knew what hilariously filthy conversation would come next, and who was going to be her poor victim.

I feel like dividing characters simply by male and female and then applying the appropriate traits does them a disservice. Not every guy is Rambo, not every girl is Sleeping Beauty.

*** Yeah, totally agree.That's why i don't understand, i believe most of us have mixed sex friends, so why the dichotomia between the real word and fanfictions ? Is it because most of it are written by teenager / young adult ?

For the crude thing, i think it would varie on how casual they are with each other. I don't think "i sleep with your father" would be used as a banter (because it /carries a notion of/ slight power imbalance for women / a slight "sex as a power fight". Mind you, i used to say it for a while, but written it would be a female character trying hard to "fit-in" with the "bro"/trying hard to be the cool, not bothersome, absolutely not feminist because they can't take a joke" girl - which you can totally write, and which i totally was for a time)In a mixed group, if you want to shake things a bit / provokes laugh, i can definitely see it used.Anything else, sure: jokes, personal wtf funny stories (my personal favorite), well-timed innuendoes...

EDIT : I, uh, thinks it's "friend of mixed gender" actually. "Mixed sex friend" sounded right in my ming but i assume in english it means we all have a lots of sexfriend ? Keeping it for the laugh anyway.

This is not the aim of the authors of harem fics. The world "harem" is entirely apt: the women in these stories serve as the idealised sexual possessions of the main character; they are not intended to have personalities or act in realistic way, and readers are certainly not expected to identify with them.

** I think part of it is that boys are discouraged from liking 'girly' things, which extends to books and shows that are by and about girls and women. So they don't get that influence of identifying with female characters and seeing them as a diverse group of fully-formed human beings with complex interior lives, at least not to the same extent that girls do with male characters. Because women generally read/watch male-oriented media more than men read/watch female-oriented media, that skews what gets made and published and how people get portrayed. And it affects women too, to a certain extent - it's not that unusual to find female authors who oversimplify or demonize the female characters in their own works.

"Harry bangs all the hot girls" seems like a genre where realistic characterization is particularly unnecessary or even counterproductive to the fantasy. It's not written for me, and I don't object to fanfic-as-wish-fulfillment, so I suppose I worry more about the larger trend and the way it bleeds into more serious work.

***** It wasn't a criticism, it was a point. Media, as a whole, isn't really designed for women. Even most so-called chick flicks are written, produced and directed by men which young girls then watch and are conditioned to think is normal behaviour.

And no, it wouldn't have sold as well and the reason is a bit more complicated than that: fantasy novels aren't for women, you see. I should know, I had /teachers/ giving me funny looks when they learned that I had read The Hobbit or LoTR or Sword of Shannara, since really - shouldn't I be reading The Babysitter's Club instead? Maybe some Nancy Drew? Science fiction was considered worse than fantasy in some ways, but make no mistake: before the mid/late 90s, a girl reading fantasy or sci/fi was frowned upon, even stuff that was obviously written by a woman such as Anne McCaffery.

I was allowed to read Clan of the Cave Bear and its sequels, which was basically porn without plot caveman fanfic, when I was fifteen and nobody batted an eye while The Wheel of Time got me strange looks for fuck sakes.

***** Plenty of my friends prefer to play female characters in video games if you have the choice, myself included. Granted, Jane Shepard shooting her way through an space roboter invasion is a bit different to Holly going to magic school, but I think that if you make it clear that Holly isn't having the stereotypical "Disney Princess" arc, most dads wouldn't mind their sons reading about a girl fighting magical Nazis.

****** That's like, now. But look at the major (90') fantasy / science fiction works, most main character are male. In my teen age, I read Eragon, Harry Potter, lords of the ring, Ranger apprentice, all of them overly male, with hardly any significative friendships between gender. I played male character in video games because most of the times they either allowed me undercover status (not being harassed gaming), or their stats were just better (like climbing two unit in one move whereas the girl could jump two block away.. in a setting with a lot of climbing.. yeah, no thanks, sticking to the most apt character) When I went for a more mature / political fantasy, I ended up reading GOT, assassin apprentice, Janua Vera, terry pratchet, hyperion and Endymion. Still, women were few. We are nowadays seing more female protagonist, and people being more at ease with playin them, and sure, it's cool it's finally happening, but the struggle to get there did happen.

I agree with you that now, people are less bothered by which gender / sex the main protagonist is, but that's because we (as a society) finally ended up seing women as capable fully fleshed character, not because there wasn't a need, a want to have fully fleshed women characters.

******* Honestly, the books I've read most as a child/teenager were "The Famous Five" (in German translation). Two girls, two boys, a dog. I've read LotR, but other than that and Harry Potter, I couldn't find a fantasy series to get into. My local library had a few Star Trek novels, but those were hit and miss tbh. The Hunger Games was pretty boring IMO, I lasted some 40 pages of Twilight. Then techno thillers (James Robinson was available in my library, I got into Clancy later on). I would agree that there are few women in those, but there are few which good techno-thrillers which are more than just spy stuff. I've yet to find an equal to Clancy, so caring about the plumbing of the mc is kinda pointless when there's not a lot to choose from in the first place.

Right now I'm reading "From the Azure Main", where the MC is Margareth Thatcher. I'm pretty sure that I would have enjoyed that a decade ago as a teenager (if available in German back then). A bunch of local crime thrillers have a female MC as well, but honestly the appeal of those were reading about the local area.

****** I tend to play female characters in games like Mass Effect because the voice actors are usually better. Shepard's male VA got better over the games, but the first one was pretty rough. I had a friend make fun of me for roleplaying as a girl until I convinced him to play the game as a female and he agreed it was a much better experience.

Men have been fond of narratives about women since time immemorial. Sappho and Corinna's poetry, Sophocles' /Antigone/, Aristophanes' /Lysistrata/, Ovid's /Heroides/, Jane Austen & the BrontÃ« sisters' novels, Tolstoy's /Anna Karenina/... -- the enduring popularity of these works renders your point moot.
