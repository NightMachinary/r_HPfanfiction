:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I was looking for this fic that I didn't see any update lately and oddly I couldn't find it in my bookmarks and I really want to read it again so any help would be greatly appreciated. Firstly it wasn't an old fic Fem!Harry time or dimension travel maraduers era.And she became 14-16 yo Helena(I think that was her name) Gaunt. Her parents (who's job may or may not be curse breakers) dies and she goes Hogwarts.She became fast-friends with maraduers. I remember her talk with Sirius about some music band and Sirius telling her that James' father took them to the concert And there was this scene where in the defence class someone in slytherin tries to shoot a spell at Lily but Harry blocks it Lastly Harry accidentally stumble upon maraduers when they are animagus and lupin werewolf.And she run.And then when the danger over Sirius takes her to the castle princess style. I'm pretty sure it was Sirius/Harry

#+begin_quote
  The Veil of Death can only reap one soul at a time, so when Harry follows Sirius through in a desperate bid to save his godfather, it only reaps the horcrux out of his scar before tossing Harry's soul back in time to the Marauder's Era. Waking up as a new person with sixteen years worth of new memories was not part of Harry's (admittedly rash) plan. Waking up as a girl, even less so. But if it will give him the chance to save not just Sirius but his parents as well, Harry isn't going to complain. Fem!Harry/Sirius Black Or in which Harry tries to help his dad win over his mom. Sirius tries to win over Harry. Voldemort is a total psychotic creeper. And Lily is just done with all of them.
