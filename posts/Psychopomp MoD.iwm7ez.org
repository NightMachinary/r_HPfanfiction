I mentioned this one in another thread, and now it's bothering the hell out of me.

The war has ended and Harry vanishes. The story itself is a series of snippets about when people who went to school with him see him - either during their death, or the death of a loved one (somebody's Aunt, Neville's Grandmother, etc). I believe it's a oneshot, though there could be a couple chapters with multiple sighting in each one.

Either the first lines or the summary itself includes something to the effect of "The first person who spotted Harry was NAME when..."

I believe it was on AO3, but it's possible that it was FFN as well. Thanks!
