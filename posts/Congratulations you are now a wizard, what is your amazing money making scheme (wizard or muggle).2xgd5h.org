***** It's just as likely that the use of a time turner would alter the past enough that the stock investment wouldn't work out, since stock value is dependent on people buying stocks, and stock prices affect (effect?) the company's attitude. Plus you'd have to hide the stocks from yourself until back in the present or you could technically go insane. You might not be looking directly at yourself, but you would be confronted with the fact that two of you existed at once, which is what I always thought actually drove the wizard insane. Plus, if you didn't wait then you'd get rich early, not have to go back in time, and create some sort of weird time loop. Actually, what if that created a parallel universe where you discover random wealth, become a horrible person and you come back to a present where everyone hates you?

Sorry... I got a bit ramble-y there.

** Legally? Get a portkey licence and market same-day global package delivery to large companies. As long as the muggles don't know, it's legal. Alternatively, find a way to brew a potion that slowly restores a human body to peak physical condition and sell it as an energy drink. And to that guy that came up with using the reparo on antiques to fully restore them, kudos to you oh dude lost in the mists of time.

Illegally is where it gets interesting. Weapons, drugs, people are the current staple of international criminal organisation. The problem is that it's insanely difficult to actually move these shipments across borders without being detected. So act as a middleman and portkey cargo across borders for the various cartels. Take half for yourself and use gemino on the other so that you can sell to other interested parties. Using compulsions would make an enforcer's job a lot easier. Assassination? Pfft. No wards, no problem.

On the wizard's side of things, anything electronic where legal, poisonous where not. Basically, criminals need ranged weapons that don't emit magic. Muggles have been spending centuries developing them. Hello muggle/magical crime crossover.

** Option 1: Time Travel + Muggle Lottery + Muggle Stocks. Step 1: Wait for the winning lottery to be announced. Step 2: Travel back in time 6 hours (or less if possible) to buy the ticket. Step 3: Check whether any stocks have risen greatly in the last six hours. Step 4: Go back in time 6 hours and buy those stocks. Step 5: Sell the stocks 6 hours later (at the time you started to go back in time). Step 6: go to step 1 or 3.

Option 2: Arbitrage. In the books, 1 galleon is 17 sickles and 1 sickle is 29 knuts. Because we don't know the size of the coins, we don't know how the arbitrage would be done, but, with a fixed relation and coins made of valuable materials (silver and gold), as the muggle market fluctuates, there will often (if not always until the coin relations or coin size changes) be money to be made buying silver/gold to be sold for galleons.

Option 3: Reparo business. The spell reparo seems to be somewhat overpowered. Even if it doesn't work with objects containing any electronics, there are still old things that never contained electronics (e.g. old planes/tanks/ships), and new things that don't contain electronics (e.g. expensive watches). A wizard could presumably use reparo multiple times a day for a large profit.

****** Harry Potter is set in the 1990s, a time during which the value of gold was much lower than today. Say the galleon is made of 14 karat gold, at the price of gold in 1990s, the coin could be about 0.6 millimeters in diameter and weigh about 1 gram. This is about twice as large as the smallest coin in human/muggle history:

[[http://www.wscbrc.com/archives/coins-broke-world-records]]

It's theoretically possible (not likely) that the goblins followed the price of gold and galleons were discontinued in the 2000s or the ratio of gold sank below 50% in galleons as the price of gold rose in the 2000s, but the price of gold in the 1990s allows for tiny galleon coins of 14 karat gold.

[[http://i.imgur.com/8rEeFKi.png][I may have given this considerable thought.]] The assumptions used in that were 1) pure gold, 2) galleons the size of a £1 coin. Since we don't know the size of galleons that seemed as good a choice as any. Pure gold is unrealistic but doesn't affect the values /that/ much if the fineness is reasonably high.

On the other hand, maybe the exchange rate is so low because the gold is very impure. I'm not sure if debasing their currency is in character for the goblins or not.

Create a spell to separate X items in the basic element. "hyperpure silicon may cost as much as $100/oz." And we know that most of the earth crust is made of silicon. Or make diamonds out of any carbon compound. (harder than just making pure silicon because you have to re-arrange the atomical structure) If you can make a spell that separates the compouding elements you can get actual 100% purity (technologically impossible) .

Really the possibilities are endless.

I really doubt that a spell like that is hard , hell it's a "stupid" form of transfiguration and/or vanishing (just vanish everything it's not silicon/carbon and you're set) , you need some understanding of basic chemistry that's all.

** Along the stock line.... If you're discounting time turners (which considering they are highly regulated is easy) You could still have Harry do the standard Wall Street method: Options contracts. This could be augmented by divination, which is never explicitly refuted.

The way Options contracts work:

When a stock will go up:

Pay a premium (usually some fraction like $.25-$5 per share)

You control the contract for 100 shares which costs that fraction * 100(i.e. stock XYZ costs $18. You buy the Strike Price contract of $20 where you pay $1 premium=100*1=$100). This contract says you have the option of buying the stocks at $20 before the expiration date regardless of the actual market price.

If that stock goes up (i.e. XYZ goes to $25) you sell your contract for the difference to someone who wants it, and then pocket the difference (25-20=$5 *100 stocks=$500) Your % gain is $500-$100=$400 divided by what you spent ($100)=400% profit.

The caveat is that if the stock goes down, you are out $100 (i.e. 100% loss)

When a stock will go down

You pay a premium to someone.

You own a contract that controls 100 shares which costs the premium/100 (i.e. stock XYZ costs $20 you buy the strike price of $20 where you pay $1 preimum =100/$1=$100) This contract says you have the option of selling 100 shares of stock XYZ for $20 per share and the buyer (who you paid $100 to) is obligated to buy the stock at that price.

If the stock goes down (i.e. XYZ goes to $15) you buy 100 shares of the stock for $15, and sell them for $20 and pocket the difference ($20-$15=$5*100stocks=$500) Your % gain is $500-$100=$400 divided by what you spent ($100)=400% profit.

The caveat is that this assumes you have enough money to buy 100 shares (i.e. $15*100=1500) and if the stock goes up you are out $100 (100% loss)

These figures are slightly inflated, but not unrealistic. It is more likely that the % profit is going to be in the realm of 50%-200%

Assuming Harry has access to his canon "fortune," of say, 1,000,000 GBP, and he trades with 10%, he is trading with upwards of 100,000 GBP. If does 5-10 trades of 2% risk (2% of 100,000=2,000GBP) and makes a profit on the majority of them say...80% with an average of 100% gain, then he makes 600% profit per month (i.e. 600%*2,000GPB=12,000GBP/month).

The percent gain on his total trading money would be %12 per month.

These figures are not unreasonable for a trader in real life (Some exceptional traders make 20%<), and if Harry were augmenting his trades with divination (not necessarily visions or reading stars, but some of the many various forms that Hermione refers to as "wooly"*/) then this figure can be raised to as much as 30-60% per month. If Harry did this every month he could grow his fortune by as much as 72% in a year (10% of fortune/60%/month*12months=72%). That means in one year he makes 720,000GPB per year, which is some serious capitol as an individual.

If you're talking about make in the millions/billions per year, the only way to do that is by making a business. In that case, there are many many other ideas.

** Hermione may hold skepticism for these branches of Divination (as Trelawny was basically a fraud), but I think they would hold more credibility if used to predict things like the collective psychology of a stock market, vs whether someone is going to break a tea cup in the next hour.
