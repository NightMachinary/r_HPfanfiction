Hey guys! . I'm looking for the best Marauders era Fics, no time traveling or anything like that.

If there is anything from 1st to 7th year and beyond awesome!

And thanks in advance!


** Once again, the correct answer to this request is

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean69)

A brilliant follow of Remus from 1971-OoTP. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll cry some more. The OCs are incredible, you'll fall in love with Grant. Get mad at Livia, be amazed at the magic, have the spotify playlist on repeat. Laugh at the Clock prank and mad at the Snape prank.

It's hands down the best Marauder fic I cannot reccommend I'd enough.

** 'POTTER'! 'Potter 'by TinaX2 on Wattpad. No joke this is the best fanfic I've ever read. Its got a great sense of humor and a great storyline. The love interest is Sirius Black. If you check out the author, shes got a ton of other fanfics which are equally as good. I also suggest 'Muggle' by her. YOU WILL LOVE THE BOOK I AM NOT EXAGGERATING
