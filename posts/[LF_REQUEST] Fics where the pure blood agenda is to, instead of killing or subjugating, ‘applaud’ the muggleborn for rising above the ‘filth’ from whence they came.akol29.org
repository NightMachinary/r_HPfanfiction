I asked a similar question, once, and was turned away. So, now, I'm wondering if there are any fics where instead of scapegoating and hating the muggleborn for some antiquated reason they instead accept them as a part of the community, indoctrinating them to hate muggles, perhaps, and using the manpower for something productive. Like becoming the only sentient species on their planet. Whatever floats their boat.


** Isn't that what Grindlewald espoused? He hated muggles, not muggleborns.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
