The post 'Lily sorted into Slytherin' a couple of pages back made me think of those fic's where the author makes Lily a parselmouth in order to explain Harry's parseltongue ability (whether because they don't like it being transferred via horcrux or horcruxes in general etc), and how it's just there purely to explain Harry having the ability, while making no real change to Lily herself, with her still being a Gryffindor and still being chased by massive Slytherin hater James etc etc.....well what if that was the basis of an fic' itself? How would that go? A fic set in the marauders era with a Parselmouth Lily Evans as the main character.

I can't see her arriving at Hogwarts ignorant of the ability (even Harry knew about it, he just didn't know the significance of it) whether that's because she sees a snake out and about (like in fic's when Harry sees one in the park or the back garden, which I've always thought was very unlikely, I live in England and I've never seen a snake in the 'wild') or much more likely at the Zoo or a pet/reptile shop like Harry did in canon. But whereas Harry was ignorant of the significance, Lily is best friends with Snape, who would know. So Lily talks to a snake at the zoo or something and when she hangs out with Snape and they're showing each other magic and stuff Lily mentions that she spoke to a snake at the zoo, and Snape's absolutely gobsmacked and tells her all about parseltongue and how it means she must be a descendant of Slytherin himself and how that means shes definitely going to be in Slytherin with him (IIRC Snape always knew he'd be in Slytherin and just hoped somehow Lily would join him) and hes just all really excited about etc and how she should totally get a snake as a pet.

Ergo Lily goes to hogwarts just expecting to be sorted into Slytherin, it's not like she knows about the anti-muggleborn stuff or the War or Voldemort, she just knows her best friend is expecting to be in Slytherin and with her being a parselmouth she just thinking 'how could I not be' sort of thing. So when she gets to the hat she gets sent straight of to Slytherin with a talk from the hat about how she'll 'be great' but she has to overcome adversity etc. Her parseltongue ability would need to get out, whether because she just tells them to get them to stop treating her like shit for being muggleborn, or Snape convinces her to tell them for the same reason, or Snape tells them himself to protect her, whatever, but it would get out to Slytherin, and they'd be like 'She can't be a muggleborn', 'Does that mean shes related to The Dark Lord' etc and start treating really well and stuff.

So you've got a 'On the Way to Greatness' type of thing where Lily is balanced between her muggle heritage etc and Voldemort and the Death Eaters, with her natural talent for magic and curiosity having her delving into the Dark Arts while at the same time having resist the 'Dark Side' because shes still a muggleborn at heart.
