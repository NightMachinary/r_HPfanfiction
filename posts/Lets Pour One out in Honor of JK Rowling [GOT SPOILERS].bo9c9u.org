I know we like to hate on the epilogue, the movies, the cursed child, etc, but I'll give credit where credit is due; she didn't write the trainwreck that was Episode 5 of Season 8 of Game of Thrones.

So thank you JK, for not having Hermione avada kedavra up the whole school right after Harry kills Voldermort

Because that's basically what happened in GoT

EDIT: I love all you beautiful people, we managed to get the threadly "Sum of their Parts" Rec in too lol

It'd be more like if Hermione killed Voldemort while Harry was on the other side of the castle screaming at a giant. After the battle, Lucius becomes the main antagonist, because this happens halfway through the book for some reason.

Then, after Pigwidgeon and Luna are killed in a surprise attack on Hogwarts grounds by Karkaroff back on the Black Lake on his ship which somehow no one sees, Ginny releases Fiendfyre on all of London just to get to Lucius, killing hundreds of thousands of innocents in the process.

Down in the depths of the Ministry of Magic, Narcissa and Lucius hold each other as everything collapses around them, their whole story having become largely pointless. In the last chapter, Harry kills Ginny and then goes to live with Hagrid in his hut. Oh, and Hedwig is there, having been abandoned by Harry earlier without so much as a goodbye.

Edit: Go back and rewatch all the seasons, and then come back and tell me every scene about the Army of the Dead isn't a complete joke now that you know how it ends. Their military strategy against the Dead was dreadful, and yet they /still/ won.

What was the point of the strong focus on the Night King now? What's the point of Bran being the Three-Eyed Raven? What of the prophecies? Why not dedicate Season 8 to the Night King then an additional Season 9 to Cersei? HBO was more than willing to give the show an extra season, but the writers refused and rushed out this mess.

Sure, in the books. But there isn't even a Night King in the books. They've deviated enough from the books to let the Night King speak. There are a thousand different interesting theories about the Night King. The fact that they were unable to make him compelling is due to laziness, not a complete inability to do so.

Or, again, just don't have seven seasons of build up for him. Or at least don't rush the conclusion to both Cersei and the NK in one short season.

******** I think it would have been far more interesting if they lost Winterfell and had to retreat south, a season where these characters who hate each other have to come together to defeat a common foe.

You can have a satisfying end to the Night King, you can throw in some good White Walker lore, you can keep Cersei around as a compelling enemy, you can keep the politics and amp up the tension, and you won't throw nearly a decade of buildup out the window.

The amount of backstabbing and general politics in something like that could serve much better as a buildup to Dany's madness, too. Hell, just moving Rhaegal's death to Ep 5 would be so much better; have the bells ring, then have Euron kill Rhaegal, /then/ have Dany lose her shit.

But instead we got a season of nonsensical military strategy, deaths for the sake of shock value, and entire arcs made completely pointless due to the writers wanting to wrap it all.

I'm sad.

That was their function. Their "Big deal" was to create a united front in Westeros. An event that will unite Kingdoms. The North was alone, with the Vale as well as a claim to the Riverlands. The regions that still has firstmen descendants living there.

Now, the North made an alliance with Daenerys to fight a common enemy. Then Jon fought alongside her against Cersei. Because if there were no White Walkers. Jon could've said "No. The North'll stick the rest of this out. Thanks."

And united as a people. Not united behind the same monarch candidate.

​

As I said, if there were no white walkers. Jon could've let the things in the south happen while the North laid dormant. If Dany won, he could still take the knee. If she lost, he could still maintain the North as a Neutral party to the entire affair. Read up on Moat Cailin and the lack of easy access to the North.

And if Dany won but lose at least two dragons, Bran could deal with the remaining one. And he could easily tell where they should focus their forces on potential naval landings.

Dany needed Jon as a sign that she was willing to make amends, his house was part of the rebellion after all.

Sure. Sure. Let's forget Dorne, the Reach and Littlefinger's plots that would've torn the realm apart anyway. And I mean that they are united in that, maybe this is a turning point that makes the idea of a nation-state possible. Hence, "Not necessarily united behind the same monarch candidate"

​

And you know what would've been really amazing if they had the capability of filming 24/7 for three years with all the episodes written before they shot the first episode. Hence all the actors would age as much as their characters are. We can argue about what could've been done all we want, but at the end of the day between characters being condensed and storylines being simplified all the way back in the Glorious season 1. It was already too late to make the story larger and more grand than it has been.

** Nah, I'm more upset about the completely brain dead military strategies and tactics of those writers. The social media has literally eviscerated the whole thing.

On the other hand, I will make the argument that the plot in DH is just as bad, if not worse. The protagonists had no coherent strategies and only reacted to whatever those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums threw at them. If it were not for a heavy dose of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope, the victory would certainly be Voldemort's.

Fortunately, HP series benefits from the fact that it's still a children's/YA series and a fairytale. JKR didn't have to deal with all those nerds and armchair generals who have mostly stayed away from her works.

  Adaptation is a different skill set to creating something new. And creating something new that fits with something that is adapted is miles harder than that.

  And to further complicate things, they had child actors that play children. They could never not have rushed the story. 1 season to 1 book was never a good ratio to begin with. And the actors were growing, and it became more and more difficult to hide that they were not in fact children anymore. Much to some people surprise regarding Season8Episode2.

It wasn't HBO's decision to shorten the season. It was D&D's. And as a result the show has suffered the last 2 seasons. They could have easily extended season 7 and finished off the white walker threat smoothly and saved the final season just for Cersei. Instead we got this shitshow of a half white walker/ half cersei season where the pacing was faster than Usain Bolt.

******* Early on they made the decision to make 1 book = 1 season because of child actors. And no shit them stopping to grow in height around season 2-3 saved the selling that they were still children. But that doesn't help when they've set a course that's condensed characters and story arcs to make it possible to do an adaptation that includes child actors and that's possible to be done in 10 episodes a season for roughly the amount of books there are going to be.

​

The show did not suffer because they had fewer episodes, it like anything suffered because they went past the books with as I said, the skill set of adapting vs creating something new vs creating something new that can realistically be considered part of what they've adapted.

​

You really think that season 8 would've been miraculously saved if they've completed the NK invasion in season 7? And smoothly? This is not meant to be a story of smooth anything. Why do you think they've for the most part put the turning points in the 9th episodes? That's both because they happen while there are still chapters left in the books, but also because they aren't smooth and easy. The same way nothing in the universe has been smooth and easy.

Dany's character exists as a parallel to Jon's. Jon take extreme actions as well, but on the opposite side of the coin. He takes extreme compassion, making peace with the Wildlings and letting them trough the wall. While Dany butchers entire families that was remotely related to the Slave trade. Effectively ruining the ruling elites of the cities she 'liberated' and the put in a Sellsword as the leader.

She's said since she met Tyrion that her aim is to "Break the wheel" Meaning to abolish the aristocracy, but again she's removing one ruling class only for another to take it's place. In this case, one that will work directly against her. The Maesters.

** That's a terrible analogy. Hermione wasn't the product of incest, abused by her family. She didn't lose all her closest friends. She didn't have a family with a dark past.

A better analogy would be Sirius, mad with grief over the loss of Lily and James, going out and in a fervent rage /actually/ killing Pettigrew and 12 Muggles. And as far as we know, Sirius had definite intentions of killing Peter no matter what, no matter what the consequences would be for him.

Dany was always a 50/50 chance, and almost every decision she's ever made, has always been her teetering from on the edge, only to be saved by her advisers.

Now, with Ser Barristan gone, Ser Jorah gone, Missandei executed in front of her with her final word being /Dracarys/, with Varys betraying her for her nephew who rejected her, and Tyrion constantly failing her, Dany trusted nobody, and had no one to keep her in check. So, mad with grief from Missandei and Rhaegal, her dragon, she hears the bells, and realizes, the throne is hers. She won the Game of Thrones....and it does not feel satisfying. Her enemies have not yet suffered for the pain that they caused her, and winning the throne did not snuff out her rage, it does not satisfy her need for vengeance.. Not when she's all alone in a country that distrusts her, that hates her, that /fears/ her so much more than they could ever love her.

And so, after days without eating, and possibly without sleeping, she embraces that. Let them fear her, to know true terror, and never question her authority again.

Dany's descent into madness is very reminiscent of Azula from Avatar: the Last Airbender, and I thought it played out fantastically.

******* Yep exactly. I figured GRRM was being equal when all his characters did terrible stuff. They aren't exactly nice people. And considering her revelation about Fire & Blood comes after being disturbed by the violence in the fighting pits it doesn't make sense to consider it a particularly bad ideological reversal. The slavers /are/ horrible, GRRM made a point of how truly terrible slavery is.

Jon, Arya, Bran, Tyrion face the same struggle of trying to remain moral as well, but on a much smaller scale than Daenerys, dealing with much less issues. Jon when faced with crises fails utterly. Yet somehow we were meant to see a distinction between them.

They all started from significantly better positions than Daenerys as well. She had no moral guidance (beyond perhaps Ser Willem Darry) and was a beggar and a slave to her brother. Yet she worked her way up the ladder by pure force of will. In the end however, Daenerys starts with nothing, and ends with nothing. So not only are you cursed by genetics, but are also never able to rise out of your origins. It's certainly a tragedy. But just because it's tragic it doesn't make it good writing.

Ultimately I think GRRM has the problem of his story getting away from him. He is not a planning author compared to say JK Rowling (who wrote copious notes on how the series would progress). As a result, his twists won't make much sense to what came before.

You seem to want it to be about Genetics. Jon was half Targaryen, half Stark. So shouldn't he be half mad then by that logic.

As someone else put it:

#+begin_quote
  Several years ago, GRRM vouched on behalf of a fan's blog post concerning Dany's character that referenced a particular passage. The passage was about how Dany saw weakness in herself for being anything less than the dragon, a rejection of any method that was soft and merciful. Anything that wasn't 'fire and blood.' She could abandon innocence and Innocents if they were problematic. In essence, Dany originally feared being like her brother/father but saw the practicality of 'waking the dragon.' And the beauty of Dany's storyline is how we justified her violent tendencies when her goals aligned with our morality. But now we are confronted with who she truly is. Someone who justifies whatever means to their end.

Another rundown of the Madness of the Show.

So now it is that "Nymeria acts on Arya's emotions". Which one is it. Is Arya a cannibal in disguise that controls Nymeria and makes her eat people or was she just watching trough her eyes unaware that she can control her? Further isn't Dany bonded with her Dragons as well. So by your reasoning, Dany is just bloodthirsty because that's how dragons are.

  That was meant as sarcasm... Dany pretends to be something new. Someone better than any that came before. Yet she choses the more violent action available to her whenever she can get away with it. She doesn't do peaceful decisions unless she must.
#+end_quote

I am aware, and that's why I responded to it as I did. It is indeed biased.

Janos Slynt is considered a justified execution. Janos Slynt begged. Janos Slynt asked for mercy. Jon didn't give him any and we cheered.

Daenerys is faced with slavers that George RR Martin couldn't make more depraved if he tried (seriously it's horrific, they literally feed children to bears). She responds with violence no more than Jon did to Janos Slynt, his own personal vengeance. Yet, one is wrong and the other isn't?

#+begin_quote
  As someone else put it:
#+end_quote

I presume they are referring to the Meereenese Blog. In which case they are actually adding their own interpretation which was not there (nothing to do with weakness). It was purely about her own inner conflict between choosing peace and war. She can't stand the continued suffering of the slaves, so chose war.

How are you reading it as contradictory? Arya /is/ in control of Nymeria. Nymeria is acting on her personal will and thoughts. Her utter rage. And her love for her mother. Jon, Robb, Bran similarly. As we are told, the relationship between a direwolf and a human is different than to any other creatures. You wed them for life.

The dragons don't have the same relationship with Targaryrens. It is no where near as strong.

However their nature is a reflection of the Targaryrens, but dragons aren't bloodthirsty. Dragons are dragons. They don't hunt humans. They aren't cruel, they don't seek power. They can cause massive amounts of damage, but it is not out of violent urges. They are tools in truth.

******* In this case that Bittersweet is they're alive. But to be honest, I can't see two books covering these last 3 seasons that much better. They also have 25x the characters, and there doesn't seem to be much if any consolidation of narritive arcs there. No Firstmen union. No throwing the Reach and Dorne into the fire. etc.

So, either as some others have said, the WW's come south of the neck. Or It'll be solved by the North alone. And then we have the southern issues with Faegon arriving ahead of +Cersei+ Dany and Varys still being a mystery. Though one that's heavily implied to be backing some sort of Targaryen restoration with the most common reading being that he wants a Blackfyre restoration. But either way, the makeup of that story will be so different that it's impossible to say that just on a surface level they'll have the same ending.

** I was /expecting/ a full Mad Queen - it was foreshadowed in the books too.

Also, it reflects a favorite theme of GRRM's here:

The defeated Death itself - a Death of Ice, the natural death of winter and old age...

Yet, these same heroes, because they could not let go of their hate and anger, sought vengeance over justice, and destroyed that which they sought.

Dany tore down that which she had dreamt of with Fire and blood - and the heroes of the North were turned into villains, murdering and raping...

We are left thinking - if only she had let go of her hate...

Also, note that there were numerous parallels - in particular, the final scene with Arya and the Hound, which took place wherein her first teacher (the water dancer) told her to run, and gave his life for her.

When Arya accepts her final teacher's advice, and again turns to flee, she repeats the same final words - "thank you"....

The overarching themes, this Song of Ice and Fire, whose last movement is the first wrought in fire and blood, are /good/.

However, because the writers rushed (they were asked to do 2 more seasons, but they have an offer from Disney, and they wanted to leave), the set-up for all of this was variously never done, or done briefly and poorly.

For example, the J/D relationship never felt real, because unlike previous arcs, all we got was lots of "You are my Queen", instead of scenes that actually developed the thing over many episodes.

Without that setup, the climax, cool as it was in its effects, falls flat, feels unreal, unexpected, unjustified - in short, unsatisfying.

Either that, or GRRM let the writers in on how he powers his Horcrux via the tears of the fans.
