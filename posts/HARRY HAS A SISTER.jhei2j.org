Any story with canon pairings that have Harry having either a twin sister or younger sister who is sorted into Hufflepuff. Yes I know it's kinda exact, but if anyone's seen a Hufflepuff sister story, let me know. I wanted Hufflepuff bc I've already read a lot of Slytherin story's, and I'm not to keen on another Hermione. (I love Hermione, but there could only be one true know it all at Hogwarts.) So any suggestions? Or is it a lost cause?


** "Potters against the World" From FF.net Mind the description and ratings though, if that's not your cup of tea. It's by a very good author. If nothing else, check out their other story "Hedwig Slightly Unhinged" which was really enjoyable.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
