Just not drarry. Also please completed


** It's not actually complete, it it does end on a spot that could be an acceptable ending, and I think it's worth reading despite it's incomplete nature.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

** Northumbrian has a lot of this. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is a good example, with Harry and Ginny and their children moving into a new neighbourhood in the countryside.

And despite sort of following canon, linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay) is almost a slice of life, because it so effectively derails and defuses the canon threats. Instead of fighting Voldemort every year, he's focused on preparing for exams, working with the "unusually shaped" students (a Sphinx, a merman, Fluffy's niece...), and discovering new fantasy novels, especially the ones about dragons.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
