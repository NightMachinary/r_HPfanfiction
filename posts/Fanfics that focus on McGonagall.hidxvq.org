Im looking for fics where McGonagall takes on a parent/mentor role to either Hermione or Harry. Bonus points if she ends up becoming Headmistress, but it's definitely not a requirement. Preferably no crossovers or gender switches. Thanks!


** This fic linkao3(The Cat Came Back by LullabyKnell) and its sequel linkao3(Take it to the Man in the Moon by LullabyKnell) are one-shots and quite short, but they fulfill the requirements. McGonagall disobeys Dumbledore's orders and takes Harry away from the Dursleys to her brother Malcolm.

** I'd say Through the Fire, though it's more literal. The premise is that McGonagall refuses to let Harry be left with the Dursleys, and proceeds to raise him with the help of Remus.

  Minerva McGonagall checks up on little Harry Potter and finds that not all is as it should be. She makes a decision that will change everything for the Boy Who Lives.

** Linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) is my creation. It has McGonagall working herself to the bone to invent an entirely new transfiguration discipline - a reverse animagus transformation - in order to help Harry, who's been turned into a giant, five-headed dragon. It's definitely more of a mentor relationship than a parental one.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)
