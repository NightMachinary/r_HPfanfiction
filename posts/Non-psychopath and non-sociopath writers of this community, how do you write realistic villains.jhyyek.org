It seems that sociopathic/psychopathic villains is a common trope of this fandom: whether it's a Voldemort devoid of empathy, a charismatic leader such as Grindelwald, a master manipulator Dumbledore or even a vengeful Harry... they all seem to have complete disregard for human life and people's wellbeing. Being non of this, I can not identify with them and I am really struggling writing their thought process. How do you guys do it?

Note: don't worry... if you can share some tips I won't think of you as being any of the above. The purpose of this question is to get some tips on writing such characters since I, for one, can't identify at all with them and I can't figure out their reasoning behind their atrocities.


** Keep in mind one simple fact - there's no such thing as a villain.

The villain is a character unto him/herself. Their motivations might be selfish, they might be overly emotional, they might suffer from sociopathy or psychopathy, but in the end, no villain has ever thought of him/herself AS a villain. They're only ever trying to get things done, either for their own good or what they see as the good of all.

It might only take having a child the 'villain' knows get molested for the 'villain' to decide that all pedophiles need to die. He/She is doing the Right Thing... or are they? Is the 'villain' smart enough to get away with murder? What if they are, and they later on find out that some politicians bankrolled the pedophiles to provide them with children? Suddenly politicians start turning up dead. The 'villain' still thinks they're doing the right thing, and they might be, or they might not be.

Ultimately, a villain is just a character whose motivations are opposite to the protagonist.

In the scenario above, maybe the MC finally takes down the 'villain', only to discover his/her motivations and then take up their cause as Just and Right. The best 'villains' are usually not so different form your MC.

*** I adore your example because most people would tell you that they actually aren't Villains, because they're killing pedophiles.

But it's still human's life who are lost. It's still a complete disregard of human's life, of what is right and wrong. And still killing in cold blood. And with a mindset as you describe, it's likely killing innoncent people, and in the end starting to kill people that might maybe have the tinest little link with the pedophile rings, even if they never did nothing bad.

It's not that hard to get into the mindset of a bad guy. We all have it, when push come to shove. We just don't have this extra thing to act on it, (or lack of something).

*** There's one thing that tou did wrong in your explanation. There are characters that are downright evil and know It. Sometimes its good to have a literal devil as a villain, they're mor relatable but most of the time poses more threat than other villains, because they dont have ideals ir dreams, they Just want others suffering.

** Too many authors think that evil people must act like totally rude jerks or monolithically evil sadistic serial killers, but our real world actually offers much more compelling examples.

One such monster, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler][Heinrich Himmler]], Reichsfuehrer of the SS and the chief architect of the Holocaust, was a loving father and decent man. After the war, his daughter [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudrun_Burwitz][Gundrun]] continued to support her father's cause.

--------------

Another monster, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot][Pol Pot]], leader of the Khmer Rouge, is supposed to have a really pleasant personality:

#+begin_quote
  Pol Pot displayed what Chandler called a "genteel charisma",[436] and what Short described as a "magnetic personality".[344] As a child, his brother characterized him as having been sweet tempered and equable, while fellow school pupils recalled that Pol Pot was mediocre but pleasant.[436] As a teacher, he was characterized by his pupils as having been calm, honest and persuasive,[436] having an "evident good nature and an attractive personality".[103] Chandler noted that he had the "common touch" when interacting with people;[437] according to Short, Pol Pot's varied and eclectic upbringing meant that he was "able to communicate naturally with people of all sorts and conditions, establishing an instinctive rapport that invariably made them want to like him".[438] Many observers commented on his distinctive smile.[438] When speaking to audiences he usually carried a fan, which in Cambodian culture was traditionally associated with monkhood.[256]

  Pol Pot was softly spoken.[439] During speeches he was serene and calm, even in the midst of using violent rhetoric.[440] Chandler noted that when meeting with people, Pol Pot displayed an "apparent warmth" and was known for his "slowly uttered words".[441] Kong Duong, who worked with Pol Pot in the 1980s, said that *he was "very likeable, a really nice person. He was friendly, and everything he said seemed very sensible. He would never blame you or scold you to your face."*[439]
#+end_quote

But his deeds show something completely different:

#+begin_quote
  Pol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an agrarian socialist society that he believed would evolve into a communist society, Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on collective farms. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. *These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the Cambodian genocide.*
#+end_quote

Cambodian [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields][Killing Fields]] have to be one of the darkest chapters in human history (beware reading that article!). Also, *Khmer Rouge is the only real world regime after ancient times that attempted to create something like a marriage law*.

** You have to keep in mind that all have different motivations and backstories, belief and values.

Voldemort devoid of empathy can be hard to identify with. Until you try to see his point of view.

So, Magical World is Voldemort chosen home. And he want to be the boss of his home. But his home is full of vermins. They're rats and mice everywhere (that muggleborns and half-bloods). There's crockroach and other such insects. What do you do when your home is full of those things ?

You get ride of them. And you'll do everything you can think of finally be able to enjoy your home, and feel at home in your own home, no matter what.

For Voldemort, other people are those vermins. And he needs to get ride of them. They aren't human life nor people. Not really.

As of Manipulator Dumbledore. It is more complex. This is my personal opinion, but I don't think Dumbledore has a complete disregard of people wellbeing or human's life. However, he believed in the Greater Good, and that sacrifices, huge sacrifices sadly had to be made. He hate having to do it, but he believed that he has to, and that there is no other choices, and no alternatives. So he raised Harry to be a sacrificial lamb, with all the pain in his hurt, but truly absolutely believing it is the only way to save the thousands and thousands people that Voldemort threatens. To him it's Harry OR everyone else. What is one single life, against thousands ?

As for vengeful Harry.... this is the easiest, to me. It's a value system that is the easiest to adhere to because we all have it. If someone do something wrong, they have to be punished. We all have wished pain to people who hurt us. Who never wanted their bully to be punched or received the same treatment that we had ? Who never said that this child molester should be hang and left to rot ? Who never ever thought that Dolores Umbridge deserved whatever the Centaur did to her ? Even easiest, no one is sad that Voldemort died. And yet, it was still a human life.

So Vengeful Harry we all already have the mindset. We just need to adapt it to lesser crime.

** I imagine people with complete disregard for human life consider people like normal people consider characters in a video game. I'm currently writing a Tom Riddle centric story, and when I have to come up with what he does in a situation, I imagine the situation being inside a video game. If I want to play further, I need to solve the situation with what means I have. The people who die for Tom to get what he wants are, in a way, meant to be killed.

** First, you start by listing a series of goals the villain has. They can be anything as long as they're ambitious. Second, you write out how they would achieve such a thing-people, resources, political power, money, write it all down.

Those individual bits are now the new short term goals your villain has. Then, take a look through a history book to find how dictators and criminals achieved those goals and have the villain try and do the same.

Death Eater attacks? Have them be Viking Raids where the goal is to loot and plunder ahead of killing the defendants.

Imperius-based assassination? Meant to tie up loose ends and further the interests of affiliated candidates.

Torture Dungeons? Intelligence gathering.

It's easy to write villains as criminal psychopaths by doing it like this. As long as you don't outright state why they're doing these things, then that's what they come off as.

**** Gladly!

Let's take Voldemort. He's operating on the assumption that he's the best, and, well, he is. He's smarter, better, more handsome, more powerful, the kind of objective superiority that would make one very lonely even if one isn't also an orphan and a psychopath (see Dumbledore). And then, also, he's an orphan and a psychopath, who is an outsider entering the wizarding world where prejudice is rampant but people hide theirs, and people seem obsessed with rules that don't apply to him... of course a normal person would have dealt with these emotions through means other than murder, but he's got these emotions and he's driven, ultimately, by human feelings. Psychopaths and narcissists are very empty and a sense of emptiness and looking for the answer in the wrong place is something everyone has felt, I think, after all.

It's just you and I are content with relationships, art, pets, sports, whatever floats your boat, really, and Tom Riddle needs more.

For example, he murdered Myrtle to prove that he was the heir of Slytherin, because he was in dire need of a heritage, as an orphan, and suddenly found out that he's got one hell of a heritage, and couldn't resist it.

(Self promotion time, I write as pet_genius on Ao3, but tbh my works would only appeal to Snape fans)
