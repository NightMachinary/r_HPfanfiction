Like the title says, I'm interested in fics that center around Snape, or feature him as the main character. Any era is fine, as long as they aren't non-magical AUs, gen or romance, as long as he isn't paired with any of the Malfoys, other Death Eaters, or any of his students. I'm mostly looking for longer fics (50k+ words, but I'll take shorter), preferably complete.

EDIT: I meant that gen or romance is fine with me, as long as it isn't with a Malfoy, Death Eater, or a student.


** Here are a few mostly shorter fics. For me, they fall into the category of brilliant character studies.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/317755][Father to the Man]] by Delphi, Snape/Filch, features young Professor Snape and also 5-year-old Snape, has a hopeful ending.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/65865][In Memory of Sigmund Freud]] by Delphi, McGonagall/Snape, Moody/Snape, features Snape after his first year of teaching, does not have a hopeful ending.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857][Into the Fold]] by pasi, a long fic that focuses on how Snape ends up joining the Death Eaters. There's also a brief but excellent fic about Snape's last year, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/256113][Penultimate Acts]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306/chapters/26132727][Puzzle]] by we_build_the_shadows_here, Lily survives the slaughter at Godric's Hollow and is cared for by Snape. Lily is brilliant and necessarily manipulative, Snape is still bitter and dark.

I would also recommend these three short, linked fics for a different take on Snape's background and upbringing. They refer to an older, more mythical form of magic than we see in the books.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]
