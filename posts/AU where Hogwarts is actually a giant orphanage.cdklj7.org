** Hogwarts has a fifth house for "orphans" (actually muggleborns who were kidnapped from their parents and obliviated) in linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died). Hermione is one of the brainwashed soldiers loyal to the Minister Malfoy who were raised in that house. The other good guys all spent the last 20 years or so in France while Britain became a dictatorship.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
