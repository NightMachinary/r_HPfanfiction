Has anyone bothered to read [[https://www.amazon.com/Case-Fanfiction-Exploring-Pleasures-Practices/dp/1476668779][The Case for Fanfiction: Exploring the Pleasures and Practices of a Maligned Craft]] by Ashley J. Barner?

Thoughts?

More importantly, has anyone read a case study and/or article on the sociological effects of fanfiction? In particular, ones that you resonated with or simply hated/liked?

I'm wholeheartedly aware that my habit of reading Fanfiction is an indulgence and an act of escapism. I'm only asking because I'm curious and nosy.


** I haven't read the referenced article, but how is reading fan fiction any more of an indulgence and escape than reading mainstream fiction?

*** Using the book's title was more aimed as an introduction than an attempt to focus on the validity of her work. Not discrediting it. I don't have the education or the case studies to refute anything that she says, I'm just much more interested in the particulars of one's own personal experience or opinions from previously read articles, possibly the book as well, that focus on fanfiction and its sociological effects. I especially want to hear from this group, since I'm fortunate enough to be a part of it. Thanks for the provided information, of course!!! I very much agree. I should've made myself clearer.
