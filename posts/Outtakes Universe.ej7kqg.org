Hi everyone. After 9+ years of reading HP fanfiction, I think it's time for me to act on my long-time intentions. This is one of 2 pieces I've written (and both are first chapters of potentially mid-to-big length (is that even a term - big length?) stories) and I honestly can't remember what prompted me to write this monstrosity, even less than 12 hours after I did write it...

Enjoy, I'd presume?

EDIT: I remember after seeing the summary now. Well ya can't blame for liking my tea with a little extra something in it.

  Inspired by everyone's favorite tea loving uncle, obviously. Rated M for reasons I shall not be disclosing at this time. Only small updates, but will hopefully be semi-frequent.
