** Got to be Blessed Blood.

It just pushes the angst to comical levels, what with the fade to black "It's for the Greater Good," Dumbledore sequences, or Harry having his British citizenship removed because of him 'cheating his way into the Tri-Wizard Tournament.'

I think the pinnacle for me was when Harry died, the horcrux was removed, and he was gifted Excalibur by the Lady of the Lake. All that, and he /still/ allowed ManipulativeDumbledore.exe to take the sword from him and send him back to the Dursley's to be beaten mercilessly with a pair of jumper cables.

** There's a Mass Effect AU where the Quarians decide to uplift the Third Reich in 1943. Tagged MShep and Tali so I kept reading in the hope that they'd show up eventually. I also wanted to read about the Eastern Front but with the Germans fielding future tech against waves and waves of Russian. Or the space Wehrmacht taking on the Reapers.

Instead we get a shitton of OCs who have never heard of rational thought but there are enough hooks to keep you interested for far too long.

** Way back when the Fellowship of the Ring movie first came out, I found online "The Very Secret Diaries of the Fellowship of the Ring" I think it was called. Aragorn was a "pervy Hobbit lover" with much cuddling "for warmth". It was hilariously written. Dang! Now I want to find it again.

  So this is a new idea I had, featuring your fav trash son Kylo Ren in an arranged marriage AU. The First Order is looking to expand their allies. Corellia is known for its great Starships and royal family. Kylo acting like a spoilt child takes exactly what he wants, that thing being Princess Cora Ardmore. But with Kylos reputation she isn't exactly thrilled at the idea. Is there anyway he can get her to fall for him?

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP

  Tom and Harry are soulmates in every sense of the word. They are partners in crime (surprisingly, it isn't usually murder), lovers, and there was that whole fiasco with Harry being a horcrux at one point, so. They would both say “Till death do us part” but the fact that Harry is the Master of Death, and Tom is his soulmate, means that neither of them can actually die. It's much harder to get bored living forever when you have somebody to share every moment with, after all.

I think it was a Harrymort fic and Luna and Harry joined the Dark because dumbledore helped the pope summon a demonic Spanish Inquisition which brutally tortured witches and wizards and Harry was a seer and felt the torture from the perspective of the victim
