My standards aren't too high. I don't mind Mary Sues as long as they aren't too atrocious so pretty much anything works. I've also really love for any Potter fics that have [[https://i.imgur.com/zwh2H.png][Gilgamesh]] in them, so if you guys know any, that would be fucking amazing. Here are some of the one's I've read so far:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]]

- A female Harry is raised by Coriolanus Snow (The head guy in the Hunger Games). Definitely my favorite fic. This thing has given me most of what I consider my headcanon and holy shit is the second task amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]]

- Not so much a someone else raises Harry as it is a Harry raises himself as a kleptomainiac.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]

- Harry is raised by Gellert Grindelwald

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowlege is Power]]

- Harry is raised by Remus and Neville is the boy who lived.

The Denarian whatchemacalits

- Harry gets raised by an eternally horny angel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10442758/1/Divine-Words][Divine Words]]

- Harry is raised by Medea of Colchis (Fate/Stay Night)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]]

- Harry is raised by Lockhart

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3509790/1/The-Wizard-of-Gotham][The Wizard of Gotham]]

- Harry is adopted by Poison Ivy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]]

- Harry gets adopted into the absurdly advanced society of The Culture.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3515603/1/Vanishing-Illusions][Vanishing Illusions]]

- Harry is Viktor Krum's adopted brother.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4547694/1/James-Castle][James Castle]]

- Harry is raised by The Punisher.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing Up Black]]

- Harry is adopted by a couple of Squibs who happen to be members of a certain noble and most ancient house.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]]

- Harry gets abandoned in the woods and grows up on his own thinking that he's an elf.

- Couldn't really get into this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]

- Harry gets adopted (kidnapped) by notrious spree-killer Sirius Black

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/2/Odd-Ideas][Harry Moody]]

- Harry gets grabbed by Alastor Moody. To find the other parts of this one click on the list of chapters and read the titles until you find something either labeled Harry Moody or titled with something Moodyish.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]]

- Harry gets raised by the Lovegoods. Probably one of my favorite fics.

HPMOR

- Only part I enjoyed about this was Quirrel casting the standard counter-charm for a Boggart. Other than that it seemed like Authorial insert wank and general Potterverse bashing. I did like what he did with Hermione and the troll though.\\

A bunch of Avengers crossovers

- Haven't read any good ones yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763234/1/Herwald-von-Einzbern-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Herwald von Einzbern and the Philosopher's Stone]] and it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6873874/1/Herwald-von-Einzbern-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets][sequel]]

- Harry gets adopted by the Einzberns and shoved into the Grail war to protect Illya or something along those lines. Story starts post-war with Harry heading to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][Harveste]]

- Harry murders the Dursleys and gets adopted by the Addams family. This one's mostly in oneshots, so you'll have to take a look at the author's profile for the rest. Last time I checked he was on the Half-Blood Prince.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]

- Sirius finds female!Harry in a child brothel. Look, I know this one sounds weird, but give it a chance. This fic is nothing like what I just made it sound okay? There's one pedo in this fic and she's not Sirius.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One: Becoming]]

- Sirius nabs Harry and he grows up travelling around the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]]

- Harry gets adopted by Lord Voldemort. Couldn't really get into this one. Does it get better after that interrogation thing?

Anyone got any other suggestions? I love crossovers, so those are definitely more than welcome.

#+begin_quote
  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.
