Can we try use better names for ancestral homes and hot have everything be: manor this or manor that. There are so many better names whether it be Potter Place or Longbottom Hall. Instead of manor use hall place abbey god even castle could work.


** Agree so hard. It's one of my smaller pet peeves when every ancestral home is named manor -- Potter Manor, Longbottom Manor, Nott Manor, Greengrass Manor. I've even seen Weasley Manor and people calling Grimmauld Place ‘Black Manor'. It's honestly annoying. ‘Malfoy Manor' has its merit because of ‘M -- M', but there's so much more words authors could use -- estate, hall, lodge, park, cottage or it could simply be a name without a mention of a family name like Netherfield or Pemberley. It's a small thing but one that can make story less generic and more atmospheric.

*** Literally there's so many names if they insist on having the family name in it to switch it up a bit like it's unlikely to even have their family name as the actual name of the house it may informally be called Malfoy Manor but it likely has a proper name. And the grumpily place thing annoys me aswell especially when they try say it's the black ancestral home like no that's just their London home they very likely have a country estate with a stately home

** I have a headcanon (and it's something I intend to include in any future story I may or may not write) that the Greengrass ancestral home is called "Verdant Villa", in part because it's an actual Ancient Roman Villa that's been maintained, and occasionally refurbished (with actual windows and the like), since the oldest ancestor of the Greengrass family to live in the Isles (though the surname is a few centuries younger than said ancestor) was granted the plot of land in Roman Britain.

** I have le Palais des Beaussiers in my pic which is the ancestral home of my mc's family. His family name is not Beaussiers, because people don't normally have the same name has their house.

*** Exactly that's another thing that annoyes me it's normally named after their estate or maybe the name of their title but rarely their name but I'm going one step at a time lol like the potter home would if anything be called Pevverel something or the other

** My own headcanon for the Longbottoms, as an old family from a part of the country with a deep magical heritage is that their family seat is Malkin Tower. It was the home of the family at the centre of the Pendle Witch trials: in our universe, its location is lost to history. In the Potterverse, there's a parcel of land on the moor above Newchurch-in-Pendle that's hidden from the muggles...

(It also remedies JKR's shocking ignorance of the /actual/ magical history of the country her books are set in.)

Malfoy Manor makes sense in light of the bit JKR gave out about the Malfoys coming over with William The Bastard: Armand Malfoy was granted the manor for services rendered during the Harrying of the North, and the family have lived at two sites within the Manor: up until the 17th century, in Malfoy Castle on the highest hill in the Manor. Thereafter, on the proceeds of nefarious dealings they built the current Malfoy Manor House on a stretch of upland across the river from the castle in order to get away from their muggle tenants in the village.

Grimmauld Place is only one of many houses included in the Black family entails and was the only piece of real property settled on Sirius before he ran away from home. The settlement was ironclad enough that it couldn't be revoked when he went to Azkaban, although everything else in the Black estate beside some minor investments got settled elsewhere while he was inside. The Blacks aren't as 'ancient' as they crack on they are, so the property portfolio didn't include a castle or a stately home, just a /lot/ of really nice houses all over the place. The result is that when Harry inherits from Sirius all he got was really just the house and some cash.

(In case you hadn't caught on yet, I do actually know how real property and inheritance law and settled estates work: Sirius had living family when he got imprisoned and they absolutely would have cut him out of as much of the inheritance as they lawfully could.)

Want me to go on? I've got a lovely one for the Parkinsons on the basis that a family by that name endowed a chapel and school in the Forest of Bowland...

*** I love your first few points and yeah the Malfoys coming over with William the Conqueror makes sense for them to have a keep or something that later developed into one. it wouldn't surprise me about the long bottom and I'd love it to be true it's a shame Jkr was so ignorant. While we don't have as fleshed out as a history of the blacks so we can't really say how the black estate is and what it consists of as we know that they at least think they are wizard of royalty and in a world like there's high society wouldn't let them get away with claiming that especially in a world with the Malfoys I wish we got a bit more insight into his inheritance from Sirius and how it's worked because the inner details really make a story for me

You can get away with a surprising amount in a milieu like that by sheer audacity, especially in the kind of strait-laced /de bon ton/ circles where the sanctions are all indirect and you're brazen enough to just ride out the gossip and pointed looks. Which an entire family of slightly mad dramatistes could very well have done a couple of generations back once they made the transition from 'merely prosperous' to 'new money'.

****** You don't claim to be ancient and noble if you actually /are/.

If you actually /are/, everyone just /knows/.

By the same token, the only way the Malfoys get away with acting like utter parvenu arriviste trash - which they totally do - is because everyone knows they've been here since the Invasion.

******* I doubt most of them know to be honest it doesn't seem like something they would know I know they'd know the main family history but that seems irrelevant as once you get to a certain level like them it's just assumed they've always been there and we can tell that Malfoys are likely lower then the blacks as the next head of the family married a black from the cadet line and Belatrix married a lestrange who are also a massive influential family. We don't know if they all claim that it could very well be a title that slowly became associated with them over the years

** Yeah! Could go for some mononymic thing-suffix kind of names too. Ravensholme or the like. Or something named to mark something local, maybe it's built on a green hill in Wales so the place is called 'bryn gwyrdd'. Plenty of ideas for names, and I say that as someone who can't name places for shit.

Still gotta keep it short though. Remember, people have to shout this shit out when they're floo'ing.

**** I mean, we've never really seen the Magical World be all that good at security. Their unrobbable bank was basically robbed twice (Quirrell only didn't get the Stone because Hagrid had removed it earlier), Hogwarts basically had an open door danger policy, and the Ministry would lose a fight with a badly behaved blancmange. So, it'd fit for them to not really take that into concern.

** I've always liked the term 'Longbottom Hall' to describe Neville's ancestral home.

Currently writing a story where I refer to Malfoy Manor but also to Parkinson Abbey and Castle Nott. I haven't described Zabini's home yet but I was planning on him just referring to it as 'the villa'.
