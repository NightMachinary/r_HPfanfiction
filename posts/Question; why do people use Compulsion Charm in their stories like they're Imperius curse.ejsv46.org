*** No she didn't. The imperius curse and the memory charm aren't the same thing since one modifies memories and the other keeps a grip over a person's actions, actively controling them.

***** My comment was more about the technicality of things, not the morality. Personally I don't see the big deal about people using the unforgivable curses straight up if needed. Many characters in canon did. It's only super complicated if u get caught. Harry used the Cruciatus curse on one of the Carrows after he had spat in Professor McGonagall's face and McGonagall herself used the Imperius curse on him right after. That was one of my favourite scenes in all the books. And the Ministry itself allowed Aurors the use of unforgivable curses during the first war when things were really looking to be going south. I wish people would use the unforgivable curses to their full potential in their writing.

****** Yes, Unforgivable curses are quite problematic.

Obviously, soldiers in the war should use all lethal means required to eliminate the enemy threat (yes, there are rules of engagement and the priority should be incapacitate and only then kill, but it may very well come down to killing), and considering the alternatives the Killing Curse seems like the most humane and hygienic to its alternatives (Cutting Curse, Reducto, etc.). Could the Severing Charm be lethal, or is it just good for cutting textile? If the former, is it wise to teach it to the second year students (or even the firsties, the canon is not clear on that one)? What is the functional difference between it and /Sectumsempra/?

I can imagine quite number of uses of /Imperio/ and memory charms by Healers (accepting horribly tasting medicine, resolving some mental health issues by the direct memory manipulation), and if you know anything about the pain management, I can imagine that overwhelming some part of the body with /Cruciatus/ curse can help in some situations, if that curse can be made topical (which doesn't seem to be the case in the canon).

On the other hand, it seems to be a mistake on JKR's part that Harry's uses of the unforgivable curses (both Imperio in the bank and Crucio against the Carrow, and perhaps even the failed attempt to Crucio Bellatrix Lestrange) has not been punished somehow by the eternal justice.

******* As far as I recall, thanks to Harry's utter disinterest in actively learning anything about his new world, it was never really covered in canon why the Unforgivables were so... unforgivable. They could be massively morally corrupting, eating-your-own-soul, dopamine-flooding and addiction inducing and we'd have absolutely no idea. The only canon reason we ever seem to be given for people not using them is that they're illegal to use and that you need to enjoy pain for the Cruciatus. Rowling seems to have just invented them so she'd have another reason to point at the Death Eaters and go 'Look! Look how EVIL they are!'. I mean, the Killing Curse supposedly kills people by ripping the soul from their body and yet the Ministry uses the Dementors Kiss which does the same.

Basically, yeah, it's like SurbhitSrivastava says, Compulsion Charms are a 'light' way of mind control without all the illegal, Death-eatery baggage. I think there's also a degree of Pop Psychology in there - Compulsion sounds more realistically psychological. Also sounds more clever and tricksy as a method of controlling people than just imposing your will and going 'DO AS I SAY'. Faery Heroes by Silently Watches is a good example of that latter aspect.

I'm really happy Rowling didn't go there, it's such a cheap concept. Unfogivables are bad because murder is bad, midcontrolling other people and torturing them is bad, not because there's something inherent to the spell itself. Of course, sometimes it's a necessary evil, and that's why not only Death Eaters use it, but also Harry and yes, the Ministry too (Aurors in the first war, which may or may not be a good thing).

Also, these spells are considered unforgivable from more of the legal standpoint, as in no law-abiding citizen should ever use them and they are punishable by Azkaban. Not because slashing someone's throat with a cutting spell is somehow morally better than using the Killing Curse. Tom Riddle created his 1st horcrux using Myrtle's death, and he didn't even cast any spells to kill her. In HP's universe, it still was considered a murder that tore his soul, because it's the intent and not any kind of particular spell that matters. So using Compulsion Charms with the same intent and purpose as Imperius is not in any way 'lighter'.

********* I agree that's a crappy idea, but my point was that they could be and we wouldn't know because Harry never bothered to open a book aside from the Horcrux (possibly some kind of unconscious PTSD, I guess. :D).

That is also the point. Things like the compulsion charm are perceived by writers as 'lighter' because they're not illegal, not because of any morally corrupting, eat-your-own-soul (etc etc) difference (unless they have a headcanon the Unforgivables are like that). It's somewhat like legal highs or cannabis being perceived as a lighter drug than heroin or cocaine.

Getting into morality with Rowling Magic is difficult - murder is illegal so the Killing Curse is illegal, sure, but then why isn't the other deadly curse illegal or why is this one so well-known to be illegal that it gets a snappy name, or why isn't a painless insta-death curse legal for medical euthanasia, or the Imperius legal to combat serious addictions or self-harm, etc. - though I can see your point and you do make a good one. It does border on tautological for a lot of writers though - the Unforgivables are unforgivable because they're really illegal and they're really illegal because they're unforgivable, etc etc.

At the heart of all this (and apologies for the mild tangent, perils of taking a philosophy A-Level), Rowling's complete lack of worldbuilding that isn't immediately relevant to her plot means writers have to add in their own bits to account for different plots and for most people those bits are obviously going to reflect their own moral perceptions of canon. I say most because there are some rather depraved Harry-cuts-his-cocaine-with-the-tears-of-his-enemy's-children fics out there and I like to believe their writers don't actually believe in doing those things themselves.

******** Completely agree with what you wrote. Of course, we don't know whether there are some really good reasons, why the unforgivable curses are so unforgivable. Just one clarification:

#+begin_quote
  that you need to enjoy pain for the Cruciatus
#+end_quote

You don't (and it is important for my medical use of the curse). I mean, you don't need to /enjoy/ causing the pain, you have to /mean/ to inflict the pain, and I can imagine healer really willing to inflict the pain on one part of the body to numb against some other pain coming (e.g., amputation of a limb).

********* I haven't read the books in a while, nor do I have the time to pick through my double-packed and completely unsorted shelves to find them and check, so I was going off what the harrypotter.fandom wiki said - Bellatrix apparently claimed that you had to enjoy causing pain to make it work.

We all know how accurate the wiki is, so you could be right for all I know. :)

I am curious as to what the point of your medical use would be, though. Sure, neurologically we only feel one pain at once, but it's pretty accepted that it's always the worst one that grabs our attention. And pain-relievers are a thing.

********** Well, OK, it all depends on how much we trust Bellatrix to be precise and exact (OotP, chap. 36):

#+begin_quote
  “Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson ---”
#+end_quote

For me there is crucial difference between “want to cause pain” and “enjoy it”. I am not sure what to think now.

Therapeutically, and I am not a doctor by any stretch of imagination, I only worked as a secretary for the professor specializing in the research of pain, I believe there are treatments of pain, when the nervous system is so overwhelmed with a pain that it basically shuts down and it is not able to perceive any more of it. Therefore for some ultra-traumatic operations (like that amputation) where even pain killers are not sufficient (pain killers are usually not that great for bone pain) and it is necessary to have patient for some reason conscious, one way is to do exactly this. Overwhelm the nervous system with pain so much it shuts down, and then it doesn't feel other pain. It is a way more complicated than that (of course), but I believe it makes some medical sense.

*********** Heh. Touche. Though I'm not sure Bellatrix is any more unreliable a narrator than Harry, given his emotional troubles.

Come to think of it, if it was true then that would seem like an interesting, semi-canon-supported reason for them to be Unforgivable compared to things like Compulsion Charms and whatnot. You have to WANT them. Like, really, really want them. So long as you get the incantation right, you can half-arse pretty much every other spell, but the Unforgivables are the ones you have to want the effects of to cast. And since the effects are villainous, you'd have to want villainous things.

Huh. I did not know that. Certainly an interesting idea, regardless of its possible academic veracity. It'd also fit tonally with canon and medical practice, since it's stated that overuse of the Cruciatus is what broke the Longbottoms, not just 'use' of it. You might wanna try google something called 'The Toothos Principle'. It's some interesting philosophical notes from a game on a topic rather like this one. You might get something useful out of it for your story.
