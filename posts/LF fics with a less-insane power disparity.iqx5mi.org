We've all seen it. Voldemort/harry/dumbledore shows up and whips the asses off all 30 of their opponents. Everybody likes a good peer fantasy, no shade to that kind of story, not from me. But at the moment, I'm very interested to see if there are any stories in which the difference in magical power is less ridiculous. Where, instead of voldemort or dumbledore fighting ten people at once and folks going "well what did you expect," it's considered a marvel that voldemort can fight 2-3 aurors at the same time, a la Dodging prison and stealing witches (as weird as bits of that fic are.) I suppose I'm just a little tired of the only formidable fighters being harry + his close friends, dumbledore, and voldemort/his inner circle. Please recommend some fics that feature genuinely dangerous combatants in a war that involves "a wizard that went as bad as you can go."


** I tend to agree with you, however unfortunate it is that originality is rarely employed, what you mention (excluding Harry) IS canon, so it is somewhat natural that authors don't deviate that much.

Dumbledore did wipe the floor with the Inner Circle in 30 seconds or so (after the Order's best fighters lost in more or less equal numbers). If Voldemort couldn't handle large numbers, he never would have risen to such great heights.

It isn't like with regular weapons (guns/swords), where even the world's best would be overwhelmed by 5-6 moderately skilled opponents; conjuration, transfiguration, area-effect spells - all of these make one powerful wizard a superhuman. It would be like complaining that Magneto beat 5 members of the X-Men ("but there are more of them than him!").

Tl;dr - superpowers make quality much more important than quantity, and it is hard to run away from that fact. But please do share any fics that manage it well ðŸ˜‰

*** See that actually ties into my one of my other issues with hp fanfic. People write voldemort as a brute-force psychopath. He's rarely showed to be intelligent, or cunning, out even particularly charismatic. It's always "you failed me so I am going to torture you with pain so bad they put you in jail forever for doing it one time." That is NOT how you get followers so loyal they refuse to give you up even under threat of having their fuckin souls eaten.

**** Agreed, but once again, canon!Voldie was a cardboard cutout of a real antagonist. Look at his GOF plot. It was Joker-levels of insanely convoluted. He's cartoonishly evil; we never once see the sort of brilliance required to conquer a nation in canon.

I absolutely HATE Voldemort as a villain; in my opinion, the best HP fanfics introduce OC antagonists (Bungle in the Jungle, Gentlemen Usher of the Scarlet Rod, etc.).

Let's face it, Malfoy and Umbridge were far more effective and competent villains than LV was. He was just a murdering psychopath with daddy issues. Yawn.

***** Well that's the point of fanfic, innit? To improve on that which you see wrong in canon? Can you, maybe, link those stories with the oc antagonists? Pretty please? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

****** I completely agree with you :) Just wanted to offer an excuse for why you see it so often. As for OC!villain fics, here's the two best (and my own, which I think is amazing, but certainly not in the same league as the others lol)

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]) - quick note, this fic is written in 2nd person, which is a little jarring, but it is INCREDIBLE.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

** Starfox's fics feature weaker wizards/magic where tactics are more important to combat that magical ability. You may enjoy them.
