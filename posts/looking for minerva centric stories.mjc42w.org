I read one last week that was a minerva/moody pairing and it was wonderful. I'd like to read more centered around mcgonnagall. any suggestions?


** This is a nice oneshot that I thought was interesting. Just what Minerva thought of Remu's at school.

*** that first one was sweet. I actually have an idea bouncing around that minerva raises remus through his Hogwarts years. I really want to write it and get it all down. the vibe is the first one is what I'm hoping to capture.

  'When you change into an Animagus? Does it hurt' Remus asked quietly. Minerva sighed. There are many similarities between Animagus and Lycanthropy... Minerva has a better understanding of both than most. A short oneshot into a conversation between McGonagall and young Remus before a full moon.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347][Hold the Line]] and [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/tag/minerva_quartet][The Minerva Quartet]] both by the same author. They write Minerva really well. Are you into AD/MM? I can find more recs for that.

*** mmm, not really. the one I read last week had a chapter of ad/mm that served a purpose, but knowing that ad is gay makes reading any romantic entanglements between them awkward at best.

** The ffn.net author MyDearProfessorMcGonagall writes a ton of great stories featuring McG as the main character! She had a story that was basically 100 drabbles throughout McG's life that was really good.

And seconding Just a Random Tuesday, that's such a great fic!
