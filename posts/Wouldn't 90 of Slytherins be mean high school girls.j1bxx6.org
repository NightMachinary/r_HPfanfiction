Never thought of this before, but the portrayal in fanfiction is always Mini politicians or baby death eaters which isn't all that realistic.. then I thought back to high school and the hight of ambition there would be making a higher level sports team or getting good grades but when it comes to 'cunning' or duplicity I can't actually think of anything besides girls gossiping, being fake friends and scheming to steal each others boyfriends.

I though it was a funny thought and I imagined lord Potter Black Slytherin Peverel memorising the Prince, the art of war and the 48 laws of power in order to become king of Slytherin and restore dark magic traditions, only to end up in a mix of an American high school drama and a soap opera :D

Thoughts or other examples of real life (pre) teenage Slytheriness?


** I mean, yeah, that's pretty much Draco Malfoy, isn't it? He's not some sophisticated plotter, he's a rich kid who makes fun of less popular kids. Pansy Parkinson acts the same way. If Voldemort had never come back, it would have been all adolescent posturing/bullying for seven years.

  She has two gladrags purses and a silver Firebolt

  I hear her hair is insured for ten thousand galleons

  I hear she's been asked to represent the wizarding youth... In the ICW

  One time she met Gilderoy Lockhart at a portkey station, and he told her she was attractive.

***** The whole thing with the Battle of Hogwarts is that most of the people fighting were kids. The narrative needed at least one of them to die, and not just some background character like Lavender Brown or Colin Creevey. That basically limits it to Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, or the twins.

Molly dying would be different. She's older and has lived a good life. That hits very differently from someone in or just out of school. We all expect our parents to die before us.

**** Why? Bellatrix is crazy and overconfident and was in Azkaban for a dozen years. Molly raised seven high-maintenance children and presumably used magic every day for all those years - plus, her kids all seem above-average in the magic department (2 Head Boys, 2 extremely creative troublemakers) and there's little indication that they get that from Arthur. Why do people assume she's incapable just because she's a stay-at-home mom?

***** Yes but Bellatrix was able to defeat Sirius, though I suppose he's been highly out of practice for 12 years and I didn't see him using a wand in GoF or a lot in OotP. She also has 2 more years of practice where she is fighting for Voldemort and getting back into form Sirius is probably stronger than Molly, and we see no evidence of her previously that she's a capable witch. I mean Harry could defeat a boggart that made him fall to the floor and start shaking, and she a fully trained witch couldn't.

Bellatrix was also trained by Voldemort and a highly capable witch in things like the mind arts, dark magic, defensive magic whilst I highly doubt Molly.

Being head boy is not a sign of power- it is mainly given to those with good behaviour.i doubt all of her children were high maintenance like Bill, Charlie, Percy and it is just basic household spells that most people can do.

Molly defeating Bellatrix was terrible, as it should have been either Neville, Augusta or Harry. Realistically she would have been wiped out by Bellatrix in under 30 seconds.

We don't assume she's incapable because she's a stay at home mom, but because we see no evidence that she is capable. Bellatrix was a big character, and he death was very important so it felt wasted that someone like Molly killed her just cos she shot a killing curse at Ginny. Like Neville had his parents tortured into insanity, and Harry had the closest thing to a father killed by her.

Also some people hate her because she shouted at Sirius and apparently gave love potions to Harry. I don't like her cos she's overbearing, annoying, a bad mother and she shouted at Sirius.

****** I'm under the belief that the best one to do her in would be Neville. His whole life was overshadowed by Bellatrix's cruelty. Much Like Harry and Voldemort. Neville and Bellatrix squaring off would be a long fated duel. A Right to bring Justice to a Wrong. As for Nagini, Ron would be a great character to do her in. Sword of Gryffindor in hand. His moment. Although I would have preferred a Slytherin Showing up with the Sword of Gryffindor. Sorta a moment for all to realize that anyone can be brave and noble. Perhaps even a death eaters child to do it. A showing of how The cycle of Hatred is being broken. That Act would open for a flood gate of Slytherin children to flood the battle scene and overflow the Deatheaters caught by surprise.

***** Well Bellatrix did have a few years and lots of opportunity to get back in shape and I think her duel with Sirius was supposed to be pretty high level already and she'd only been out for a little while at that point.

That being said, I do like the idea of Molly being a secret badass, like her being an ex dueling champion or having a lot of combat experience from the first war, but hiding it from the kids.

  On a related note, JKR's bias also made the Molly vs Bellatrix fight too easy for the former, who won just because of Rowling wanting to show how maternal love trumps obsession.
#+end_quote

You're forgetting that Bellatrix lost because she kept taunting Molly. She let her guard down at just the right moment for Molly to get in a killing blow.

The exact same thing happened to Sirius, who taunted Bellatrix after a spell missed.

** Dumbledore once said he thinks they sort too soon. But if they waited until the students were teenagers, most of them would end up in Slytherin.

Alternatively, if everyone was resorted every year like some people have suggested, I imagine that most kids would be in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff for their first few years, and then move to Slytherin around fourth year. And Ravenclaw would mostly be full of fifth and seventh years who really care about their OWLs/NEWTs.

**** That's not really true. Yes, the Hat seems to take someone's preference into account when sorting. But I don't think there many examples of someone going to a house they were entirely unsuited for.

- Harry might have done well in Slytherin, but he clearly exemplified Gryffindor traits much better.
- Hermione would have fit well in Ravenclaw, but her Gryffindor traits constantly showed through.
- Malfoy was rather brash and not particularly cunning in the early books, but what eleven-year-old is? But he clearly valued Slytherin traits, and showed more of them in later books.
- Pettigrew didn't show any Gryffindor traits when we see him, but that was long after he was sorted. As a child, he may have shown more Gryffindor traits, or those traits may at least have been the ones he valued and wanted to develop.
- Crabbe and Goyle never showed much in the way of traditional Slytherin traits, but they also didn't show any traits linked to the other houses either. But they probably valued Slytherin traits more than the other houses' traits, and it's easy to imagine that they probably had some ambitions, but weren't smart or hard-working enough to do much with them. Plus, even though some fans try to pretend it's not, blood purity was an unofficial trait of Slytherin at that point.

Maybe you had other people in mind, but those are the main ones I've seen people argue about. So I would argue that the Hat has never put someone into a house they were entirely unsuited for because they asked for it. It may take preferences into account, especially when someone could fit in multiple houses, but it doesn't let preferences override its decisions entirely.

And remember, the Hat sorts based on what traits someone has, what traits they value, and possibly what traits it thinks they need to develop. But it's not a seer, so it doesn't know what type of person someone will actually end up becoming.

Now that I think about it, someone should write a fic where the Hat is somehow sent back in time and chooses to sort everyone based on how they turned out in the original timeline.

***** Honestly the only thing I can say to that is you have to take the circumstances into account. People naturally adapt to their circumstances if someone is sent to gryffendor instead let's say slytherian or ravenclaw they will naturally adapt to what their surroundings are. Anyone could really do good in just about any house the hat is supposed to send people to where they naturally will flourish but personal choice in the matter honestly seems to play more of a deciding factor in the matter.

I've thought it would be interesting to see a time travel fic where Pettigrew was shown to be a Gryffindor according to the morals of the time period he landed in (basically, arguing that he doesn't fit a modern definition of Gryffindor but Hogwarts has seen hundreds of years so he would have fit into that house at /some/ point in history).

He thinks Pansy is pug-faced, and JKR has said she represents all the girls that bullied her so she loathes Pansy. But she leads the gang of Slytherin girls-- its stated on several occasions. I think she's absolutely a mean girl, and probably cute too, but the bias of the canon perspective would never let the reader see that.
