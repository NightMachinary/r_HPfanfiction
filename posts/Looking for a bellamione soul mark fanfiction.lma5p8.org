I honestly think I have read all of them but looking for new ones they can be in A03 and wattpad. Just looking for something new to read I also like alpha, omega, beta dynamics thing but think o have only found one good one. It can have smut but not BDSM I can't read that. I also don't mind time travel. I won't read Harry/Hermione or Hermione/Ron
