I'm thinking like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Eagle of Truthiness). Someone who hasn't already taught DADA canonically.

*** Stephen Colbert as the DADA professor?

The Dumbledore in that story really is daft and dangerous!

** I don't think Kingsley ever taught in canon, but I've seen him as DADA instructor in several stories. There is one story in which Connor MacLeod (of the clan MacLeod) works as DADA professor. It was pretty cracky, but still enjoyable.

  The powers of the immortals combine in the one receiving the Prize. In the film, upon defeating the Kurgan, Connor MacLeod receives the gift of telepathy. What if he were also gifted with magic? HP/Highlander first film crossover. Not slash.
