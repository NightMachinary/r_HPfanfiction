Ronald Weasley never knew he was brilliant before he stumbled upon Muggle mathematics. Hermione might be the brightest witch of her age, but her husband is now on his way to becoming the brightest astrophysicist.

Featuring :

--- Smart Ron winning lots of chess games ; --- And pretending to be a simple Muggle as he completes his PHD at Cambridge ; --- Arthur being super proud of his son's interest in Muggle sciences ; --- Hermione/Ron genius super couple.

Had this crazy idea yesterday. Please make it real haha.


** May I introduce linkffn(13230340)? While not a core part of the story, a subplot /does/ concern Ron becoming enthused with astrophysics. It's currently only in fourth year, so no PhD yet, but I could see happening it in the future I suppose.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** I wish the writing was a bit better. It's slice of life but it feels a bit empty or uninteresting, especially as it progresses and doesn't feel like there's any meaningful challenges. I just read the author's Pok√©mon fics today and their style worked a lot better there, probably something to do with actually having Ash travel around and meet others, instead of being confined to a castle.

**** It's true that there's not much conflict and it's very fluffy on the whole, but OTOH I think it's a nice palate cleanser for those exact reasons. And the actual writing quality (grammar and whatnot) seemed perfectly fine to me, so no complaints there.

***** I do like stories with no conflict and fluffiness, that's why I really like their Pok√©mon stuff. I just don't like the execution of this particular fic as much, though I'm having problems pinning down exactly why. I'd have to reread it and jot notes to be sure, but I think I felt like it was teasing challenge and then everyone else swoops in and it gets resolved. It's unsatisfying, either he should overcome it or the challenges shouldn't really be there. Their story with Ash as a Zorua felt much more satisfying, slice of life where the problems and miscommunications are resolved by being a Pok√©mon. I guess I'd say that the problems exceed the scope of a normal slice of life, but get resolved like a normal slice of life, and that doesn't mesh as well personally.

** linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) is the first in the Mischief's Heir series. Harry is adopted by MCU Loki, develops an interest in space travel and a secret space program. Ron is brought in to help early on, though Hermione is left out until late. Featuring plausible older brother Tom Riddle, environmentalism, breaking down house boundaries, and the wizards working to bypass doom and colonize another planet before SHIELD gets too nosy about these super-powered freaks not under their control.

It's not exactly what you're looking for, nor Ron centric, but it's close enough you may be interested.
