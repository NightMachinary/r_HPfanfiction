I can't for the life of me remember what story this was. I think Hermione had to get married, so she chose to marry Snape because it was "convenient." It takes place in the middle of the war, and Hermione is forced to meet with Lucius and Voldemort in order to keep up the facade that Snape is a spy. I also remember that (at first) Snape feel ashamed about being her husband. Can anyone help me?
