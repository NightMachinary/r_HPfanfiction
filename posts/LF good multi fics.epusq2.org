Fics with actual character development no soul bonds no magic helping things alongs

i have no problem with marriage contracts if they are well done and the original contracts had an actual purpose rather than just be a plot device to give harry a harem

fics where characters dont just blend into each other and the relationship takes actual work

preferably all the characters have actual flaws as well that get pointed out like harry being academically lazy unless it involves DADA or if Hermione is there then her being bossy like real peopleforced into a situation that they are trying their best to adapt to
