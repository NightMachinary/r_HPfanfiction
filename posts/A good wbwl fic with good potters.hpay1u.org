  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** I wish there were more twinfics with good potters. In addition to three black birds which someone else mentioned there's Genius Fratris, but it updates pretty slowly. And also Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by Santi is a classic. I prefer when both the Potters and Dumbledore are good which is even harder to find.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.

** Birth of a Phoenix has minimal bashing: I can see how this situation could happen even if I don't agree with it at any rate. There isn't even Dumbledore bashing (even if you might want to punch him). linkffn(3503388)

  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.

#+begin_quote
  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
