I'm working on an old plot bunny of mine - an HP/Batman crossover. Current (and, hopefully, final) set up is Damian Wayne in Ginny's year, with Colin Creevey being his Watson and the main PoV. Basically, it will be a different approach to the hunt for an Heir of Slytherin, with little to no contact to what Harry, Ron and Hermione will be doing, although they, just like Batfamily members, will make some appearances.

It's just... kinda slow going at the moment. I have a solid enough grasp on Wayne (although I cheated by using post-Gotham Academy Damian, who is less of an asshole), but Colin is a rather hard PoV to write for me, since I do not remember being eleven all that well and I have never been so cheerful to begin with. I have been rereading his canon appearances, but there's not much. Is there anything Colin-centric out there?


** The only thing that jumps to mind is linkffn(weasley girl by hyaroo), except not the one that's going to pull up, but the sequel (secrets of the past?). Colin is a bigger part of the plot than he is in cannon and I quite liked the, uh, energetic characterization.

Also, I'm thinking of a very fic called linkffn(accountable by Dyce) that is, be warned, pretty weird. It's a year 8 fic and he makes a photography project that was pretty memorable-it might help you with colin-as-artist, if that's something you're exploring.

** My own story at [[/r/magicmuggle]] features Colin fairly regularly.
