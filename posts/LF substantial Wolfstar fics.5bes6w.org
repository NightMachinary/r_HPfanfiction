** I've got a few!

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivors Guilt Series]] - This is an (almost) canon-compliant remus/sirius with PoA and the years before that told from each of their perspectives. Then after Remus realizes Sirius is innocent, the final fic in the series is of the summer they spend hiding together in the Caribbean.

- [[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] - One of my favorite marauder fics. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/987408][Stealing Harry-verse]] - This is the first book in an AU series where Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius, is sorted slytherin, and is best friends with Neville, Draco and Padma. These fics are really well written and are an interesting and satisfying AU. The kids are also written like kids and not as mini-adults like many hogwarts AU fics. However, this verse isn't finished and after the third year the author just gives notes on what she planned to have happen going forward.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109][Text Talk]] - I was unsure weather to list this as it's really AU, but it's one of my all time favorites. This is a GREAT non-magic modern MWPP AU where Remus isn't at hogwarts. He is homeschooled and has a chronic illness (it starts a little "a fault in our stars" like). It's really well done, but so AU that it's barely fanfic.
