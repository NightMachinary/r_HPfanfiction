I'm looking for stories about the Black Sisters, with them as the main characters. Is this so far fetched? It's just such a good treasure trove of possibility I cannot imagine there not being fics about them.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5538558/1/In-Which-the-Princess-Rescues-the-Dragon][In Which the Princess Rescues the Dragon]] is a well-written fic set immediately after DH about the relationship between Narcissa and Andromeda. There's also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8979772/1/Black-Blood][Black Blood]], which is Andromeda-centric. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5614038/1/Sisters-Forever][Sisters Forever]] is a series of oneshots.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923251/1/Druella-Black-s-Guide-to-Womanhood][Druella Black's Guide to Womanhood]] is probably my favorite of the five, and is probably closest to what you're looking for. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2489360/1/A-Keen-Observer][A Keen Observer]] is Ted/Andromeda, featuring her sisters as well. It's probably the most popular Tonks/Andromeda fic.
