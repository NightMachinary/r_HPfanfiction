I've been looking for a while so I don't know of it got taken down or what. The basic gist is that ginny's brothers find out her and harry are dating. They confront harry abd try to get him to dump her cause of the danger he's putting her in or something. Anyway, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley walk in on them doing this and yell at the boys. Harry goes and tries to break up with ginny but she doesn't let him and she goes with on the horcux hunt. They get engaged too. Really going someone knows what this is. Thanks :)

  What happens when the Weasley boys try to interfere in Ginny and Harry's relationship? Will Harry succumb to their threats or will fate intervene? Will Ginny have any say or will she never even know? And OK cause I was asked to, characters are acting OOC.
