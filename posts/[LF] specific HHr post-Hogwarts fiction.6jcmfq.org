Hello,

I would be forever indebted if someone could help me find this: The fiction has both the canon relationships, but also a Harry/Hermione interlude when the couples break-up. Harry loses his memories of his relationship to Hermione in an accident in the Auror department and Ginny takes him back. As a result of this, Hugo is Harry's son but Ron claims it is his to protect the secret. Hugo grows up with Hermione as a single mother, and attends a school in Canada to become best friends with a Muggle and werewolf that Hermione established. There is someone claiming to be another Master of Death that only fears Harry because he is the owner of the Hallows and the plot is based on this, as Harry uncovers his past relationship with Hermione and Hugo's true father in flashbacks.

I hope this rambling can narrow it down for someone. I would love to read it again

Thank you for your time!
