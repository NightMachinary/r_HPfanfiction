when writers get creative with these it makes my day, some favourites off the top of my head: ‘gay mentor charlie weasley' ‘a lot of tea' ‘angst but this fic isn't out to hurt you' ‘wanking..i mean a lot of wanking' ‘awkwardness' ‘sentient doors' ‘harry potter in a towel' ‘minor slut-shaming?' ‘you'll hate ernie after this fic' ‘sorry not sorry' ‘tell me about the typos you find' ‘it's quite gay' ‘impulsive idiocy'

these are not from the same fic.. would read it if they were though

edit: you guys need to really lighten up oml

** I wouldn't read a fic with those tags, cause I don't fancy much smut, but yeah it sometimes can be quite amusing to read the tags. Problem of potions has ‘Professor Snape is still a terrible teacher' ‘he's lucky Harry has such low standards'. But tagging every single character that appears is really annoying because sometimes that character appears for only 1 chapter

'The war went VERY badly for the Weasleys'

'Myrtle is and remains DEAD throughout' (Ugh, don't ask me what I was on when I wrote that one')

*** I dont mind it when its only a few and they actually provide some non spoiler information about the fic that will help me decide if I want to read it or not. The problem is when there are so many tags that you have to actually scroll a bit to get to the summary, it's ridiculous and completely unnecessary.

**** Some writers don't care about you though, they're writing for themselves. And no fanfic is "necessary" so I don't know why you're annoyed at a writer for doing something you don't like. They didn't do it for you. It's only a "problem" for people who feel entitled to things, and if you'd skip a great fic like Nightmare Club (I recognised 'sentient doors') because you had to scroll down, then good, you don't deserve it.

****** I can't speak for all writers, but there have been a lot of discussion about this on the Drarry Discord. Some people post to have a personal record of their progress with the craft, some to share with friends, some to mark the completion of something. A lot of people there post to be part of the community, and only really care if the other community members read, and what they think. I know very few people who agonise over what strangers or non-writers think. We were actually talking today about how nice it would be to restrict access to your works to only certain users, like back in the livejournal days. Back then you shared with a select community not with everyone, so it was easier. No one felt entitled to what you'd written. Now there's so many people who think it's okay for them to throw their opinions at a writer because 'you did this in public', even though the writer had only posted for the intent of sharing with friends. I've even had friends approached, and asked 'Hey, i like your writing, can you write a fic for me with this and this?' By complete strangers. I don't know where that level of entitlement comes from. I've also had a friend publish chapter 2 of a 15 chapter work, and someone came along and told them that if she was doing A, then her premise was weak and she should do B instead. It's like... why do you think this needs to be said?

As for me, in general I guess I care about my readers if they seem nice, but the ones who whine that I haven't catered to their whims... they're a joke. Why would I worry about their opinion? Same as people saying they don't like my outfit -- i didn't get dressed in the morning for their benefit so why are they bothering me with their problems? It might be hard for Gen Z to understand, but not everything used to be so public. People used to bother other people less. It was nice.

I hope that answers your question? Please do feel free to seek clarification, I do find the topic interesting.

(As an aside, AO3 has only just made it possible to turn off comments. Last week I think. Previously all you could do was untick them being sent to your inbox or email. I wish turning them off had been an option while I was still writing fic! That said, you're right, I can now go turn off commenting!)

***** Tags are for finding shit and to filter stuff you (don't) like. They are not jokes or one-liners, you have the description and the whole story for it. For every tag, ask yourself if that is something more than 1% of your readers would search for.

Rather than "Harry and Hermione are together", "but it's only an act", "but they might catch feelings", "who knows", "I do", "but I am not telling" that hypothetical fic should merely be tagged as "Harry Potter/Hermione Granger" (from the relationship category, not freeform) and "pretend relationship", maybe "friends to lovers" if that's the angle the author goes for.

People need to calm down. It's only fan fiction tags we're talking about here after all. People write (and read and do everything else, too) for different reasons. If somebody's tagging annoys someone so much maybe the work is not for them, then.

** I probably overtag because I don't read or care about tags at all. But I know that fandom (specifically the Drarry fandom which is what I write for) expects a fairly comprehensive level of tagging. I don't get it, I don't care about it myself, but it's no skin off my nose to tag and potentially make my fic a safer reading experience for the kind of people who do need tags. If it was up to me I'd probably just put the main pairing and whether they bone or not, and whether they die or not, but I get that this is a fandom convention now so happy to go along with it.

**** Absolutely understand that, and agree entirely that you're best to skip any fic that has elements you don't like. I backbutton out of more fics than I read, probably! But tags to me are not a factor either way so I'd prefer to err on the side of caution for the benefit of the easily squicked.

** I kinda immediately disregard fics that feel the need to make up a bunch of tags like "I wrote this at Oh-God-Thirty in the morning", "sorry not sorry", "maybe <insert thing here> if you squint", or other useless non-information.\\
Like, it's fine if you put one in there for humor value but if most of your tags are in that variety I just don't read your fic.

Occasionally I'm surprised and amused by the fact that something is an actual acknowledged tag - linkao3(11291784) this one has "Oh No There Is Only One Bed What Do" which I laughed out loud at when I clicked it and it had a bunch of entries. Also the "<Character> Is Their Own Warning" tag made me chuckle the first few times I saw one.

** I can't remember where I first saw it, but I ran across "Ninety-five things canon did wrong nailed to the door of Number Four Privet Drive" and loved it enough to use it myself.

I've put up a couple of tags of stuff reviewers/commenters have said they liked, on the basis that if one person liked it enough to comment, there were probably a dozen or more who also liked it but couldn't be bothered. So tag it, and let people who like that sort of thing find it.
