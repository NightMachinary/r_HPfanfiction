** To my understanding,

Grey is "Not trapped by pacifist ethics and morality and willing to use lethal force if necessary, but otherwise fair and just. Usually preceded by MC's revelation that killing someone isn't the end of the universe as they know it."

Dark is "Actual Antihero. Willing to use lethal force even if the situation does not strictly call for it, as well as other morally corrupt actions, so long as the end result means the good guys win."

Evil is just straight up psychopathy and sadism.

The way the US treats terrorists would be with delaying tactics and tactical military response, and as such could be considered "grey".

Also, good and bad are subjective.

*** Dark is also often times used as a way to say that harry uses the dark arts and/or sides with Death Eaters/Voldemort and/or is against the OOTP and/or is against the ministry.

** Like how the US responds to terrorists? That could be amusing to read, in a dark way. Harry as Leader of the Light goes to war with France and Aragon on the pretext that they must be funding Voldemort, since Voldemort's name is bastardized French. He sets up security checkpoints that ostensibly check for Death Eaters but don't even look for the Dark Mark. People from the continent are harassed and detained without trial.

Unless you're talking about how the US treats domestic terrorists. Harry pens articles in the Prophet saying how Draco Malfoy was a nice young man and he can't imagine what would bring him to attack another person and he's clearly mentally ill and it's not a part of a larger problem.

*** Actually there is a fic where Britain does almost exactly that. Though it's orchestrated by Malfoy there. In case you're interested it's [[/spoiler][Matou Shinji and the Broken chains. It's fourth part of the series, and I have a filling that I too often mention this fic here.]]

** In the context of HP fanfics...

Grey means 'upstart Harry rejecting Dumbledore's plan and solving the Voldemort thing his own way'.

Dark means 'Harry rejects Dumbledore and creates his own organization including people from both sides who are willing to follow/worship him on the basis of whatever'.

Evil means 'Harry joins Voldemort or simply usurps him as the Big Bad. You should sympathize with him because he's much more attractive than Voldemort.'

For my own in-story purposes, Grey means nothing, Dark means 'willing to use almost any magic or technique to accomplish their supposedly noble goals', and Evil means 'Dark, but also enjoys making enemies suffer in the process'.

** To be honest, it depends on your view of things, but mine is this.

Grey would be a Harry that is willing to use any means necessary to achieve a "light" goal.

Dark Harry would be Harry that is willing to do what he needs by any means necessary, with his end goal being a "dark" one.

Evil I cannot give a explanation for. There is no "evil" there is no "right" or "wrong" there is only one view and another view. We were raised to believe certain things are evil, but others are also raised to believe other things are evil. There is no right or wrong, there simply /is/.

** You can use real World War 2 examples:

Nazis, Japanese = Evil

Soviets = Dark, although Stalin himself was evil

Western Allies = Grey

Fictional Good/Light would get slaughtered in real world.

*** Yeah I wholeheartedly disagree with this. Simply boiling it down to basic terms like this is dangerous. The Japanese were definitely not evil. There economy was under attack by American trade bans, as well as wanting to expand their empire inside of Asia which America was again blocking. Neither of these are evil, and really siding with the Axis was a move born of desperation. Did they do some fucked up things during WWII? Yeah, but so did America.

Nazis are evil, no doubt about it. But you also have to take into account that not all of Germany were Nazis. Most of them were normal people, fighting for their country, unaware of even the existence of the concentration camps. True, it doesn't make the events of WWII any less horrible, but you can't just paint people with a single brush.

Really, the Soviets are the exact same as the Nazis. The people up top, the true believers of the party were awful people. If the Nazis are evil, so are the Soviets. I mean they did horrible, horrible things to Russian Citizens. Stalin and the Soviet party in no way joined with the Allies altruistically. Hell they originally had a non-agression pact with Hitler.

The Western Allies? Ehh yeah that's fairly accurate.

BTW I AM IN NO WAY DEFENDING NAZISM WITH THIS POST, SIMPLY THE REGULAR GERMAN PEOPLE.

**** I suggest you learn a bit about Japanese atrocities committed in China.

'Rape of Nanking' by Iris Chang is a must read.

**** In addition to [[/u/InquisistorCOC][u/InquisistorCOC]], the Japanese took Korean schoolgirls to be prostitutes for their soldiers. Korea demolished all Japanese buildings after WWII because of that and other crimes against their people. The only former colony of the Japanese that were friendly after WWII was Taiwan since they were treated relatively well.
