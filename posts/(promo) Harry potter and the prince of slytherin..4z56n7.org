It has a very rough start, but its amazing down the line. It likes to introduce tropes and make fun of them in a way that doesnt hurt the story. It has a very good take on Harry and a boy who lived as a twin brother. Almost everyone in the story is sympathetic.. cant say more without spoilers but everyone has very good reasons for what they do or say. So many sub plots and clever plot devices. The biggest gripe i have with is that the eleven year olds dont act like eleven year olds, but thats something i dont think ive ever seen anyway. Its going to be in third year a bit over a week and the creator has updated frequently in the past year and a half.

** This is a pretty good read. While Harry has been leveled up, his adversaries have also been leveled up to present a difficult challenge.

** Yeah, great story and I can't wait for 1st of Sept. Not sure about the 11 year olds not acting like 11 year olds bit, I thought the story was ok for that sort of thing.
