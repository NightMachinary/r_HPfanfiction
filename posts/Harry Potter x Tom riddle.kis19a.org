Hey guys, So I'm looking for stories that have harry x tom pairing. I came across Iridescent story accidentally and fell in love with this pairing. So, please suggest me awesome stories (with links) to read regarding this pair.


** Inevitabilities by EclipseWing is AMAZING. I found it pretty recently and binged it, then read it again, it's just so good. It's obviously quite AU, but very much worth it, and writes Tom really well. Can't recommend it enough. Linkao3(16308554)

  Tom and Harry are inevitable in any universe.OR: While Dumbledore and Grindelwald play their chess game across Europe, two young wizards form an unlikely friendship.[That one where Tom and Harry are born in the same generation.]

** Linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord)\\
Political maneuvering slightly obvious, haven't been updated for ages, but a good introduction, leaning towards middle-good on the scale of all decently popular Tomarry fanfictions. Can compare with other fics once you've read more into the pairing.

Linkffn(Again and Again)\\
Loved this concept, wanted to see more of it, but it grew slightly too long towards the end, lovely fic nontheless.

Linkao3(Heir Apparent)\\
Best one I've come across in recent times. In fact, all of the author (MonsieurClavier) their works are nice. Think they write solely for HP.

Linkao3(Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up) Nice slice-of-life fanfic, very chill, good fic to return to when you've had enough of reading politics and wars.

I can't think of any more at the moment.

  "Are you telling me that you sent the entire Root to retrieve your brother?" Hatake Kakashi asked calmly from his position, one hand shoved at his pocket and the other holding a certain book loosely."TEME! THAT'S AN OVERKILL!" Uzumaki Naruto hollered loudly in his ears."Hn." Uchiha Sasuke replied in a monotone.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
