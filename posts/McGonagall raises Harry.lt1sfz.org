Yes, I'm looking for the often asked question; stories where McGonagall raises Harry.a and I don't mean that she takes him from the stoop of the Dursley and hand him to one of her relatives, but stories where she actually raises him. Preferably over 60k wording, no Ginny pairing.

Please don't suggest "Harry McGongall". Already tried reading that one and didn't like it :)

Thank you!


** This is not exactly what you asked for but it has the beginning of McGonagall raises Harry. ItÂ´s really funny, probably one of my favorite HP fics.
