Hi everyone! I really enjoy fics that have OCs or AU and do time jumps well. See, I really like the establish the childhood/ setting, and then fast-forward to an age where the characters are well, less children.

Like, maybe the first few chapters are childhood- first few weeks of Hogwarts... Then /time leap/

Any recommendations?


** Not sure that I know many that fall into this category. You don't seem to have a character request either. Here's a good one-shot.

** I've always thought it would be neat to see a disoriented Harry kill someone without being aware that he was pushed into the past.

Something like apparating in Hogsmead during a battle and exploding Snape only for Aurors to show up. Harry escapes not knowing WTF is happening but slowly figures out that he wasn't in the middle of battle. Time jumping screwed with his brain so his last memory was a combat teleport to ambush Snape who also happened to be right there after he time traveled. Harry realizes that he just murdered a teacher in full view of everyone as his long term memories start to sort themselves out.
