** lol dude, are you mad? You might as well post a clip from Ben Shapiro or Milo on [[/r/politics][r/politics]] lmfao!

What kind of people do YOU think read FanFiction? Successful ones?

Regardless, I don't think it was that well done. If it was more subtle and paced slower, it'd be loads better. Perhaps through the perspective of one of our characters.

Honestly, I think Hermione being the establishment candidate with Ron being the Trump-esque guy would work more. Making up a name like you did just detracts from the whole thing.

The whole avalanche of shit happening just felt incredibly contrived and rushed.

I like the concept, I think it could either be very humorous or serious, but your execution of it needs some serious work.
