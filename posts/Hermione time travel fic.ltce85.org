So this is one where it starts off with Hermione and Remus (I think they're the last ones alive together). Hermione was reading a letter from Dumbledore where it turns out she's related to him (as his granddaughter I believe). Remus ends up giving her a gift before she's transported back and time. That's all I remember. Not sure if I read this at AO3 or at the fanfiction.net app


** Some of that sounds similar to Debt of Time, Where Remus gives Hermione a gift and a letter before she is sent back in time. It's most likely not the fic you are looking for though, as Debt of Time starts after a mostly canon end to the series with lots of people still alive, and Hermione ends up related to the Potters, not Dumbledore.

*** Thanks for the suggestion, but no this one isn't it. Sounds interesting though and will try to read this
