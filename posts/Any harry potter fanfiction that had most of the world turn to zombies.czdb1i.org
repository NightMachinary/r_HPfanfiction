I've never read it, so I can't tell you if it's what you're looking for, but I hear it's good.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

  After Voldemort, there was this. The clock is ticking to create a cure to the unimaginable horror that currently grips the world. Hermione finds herself unwillingly allied with the most hated man in Wizarding Britain.

** I want the same, sadly all i seem to find is slash fics :(

Well, actually really just want to see Harry abusing the shit out of having magic. Mokeskin pouches to hold tons of varius goods, transfigured golems/animals to fight zombies, magical zombiekilling traps, treehouse that needs broom to get to. You get the drill. Harry flies around, magicking up transfigured hunting parties everywhere, looting, and doing whatever the hell a zombiekilling Harry does best.. Sadly most of what i have found is angsty, with weak magic that doesnt work against zombies, or transfiguring isnt a thing.. Or Harry suddenly cant use magic.. (thats the fun part!)
