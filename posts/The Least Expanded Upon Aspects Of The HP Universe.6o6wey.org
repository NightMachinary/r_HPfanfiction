** Interesting question.

- Does the wizarding world have complete freedom of movement, or are there magical borders?

- What happens to the magical government of a nation if the Muggle territory is annexed by another Muggle nation?

- In practical terms, what happens when the ICW censures a magical government? Can the ICW force a head of magical government to resign?

- What is the balance of power between the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic?

- Can someone please turn off the car alarm outside my house?

- Connected to the above annexation question, what happened during the colonial era? Was magical India administered by Indian or British wizards, or some kind of hybrid? At the very least one assumes that Indian wizards were somehow prevented from using their magic to help their Muggle counterparts expel the British (perhaps by a strict enforcement of the Statute of Secrecy). What about the so-called "white empire"? Was magical Canada ever directly administered from Britain?

- At the time of the HP series, were there any other wizards of the Dumbledore/Voldemort calibre around the globe? If so, what were they up to? (Other than Grindelwald)

- How many Aurors could a wizard like Voldemort simultaneously fight and defeat?

- WHAT DID JAMES AND LILY DO???

(Do you remember how, back when the books were first coming out, before each book JKR would tease certain questions which the next book would answer? Every single time she said the next book would answer the question of what James and Lily did for a living. They never did. She's since stated in interview that they were full time Order members, but still...)

*** Just for fun, imma answer those.

- I like to think that in essence the borders are open, stemming from the age-old tradition of Grand Tours among wizards. As a whole, the wizarding world is much more connected to each other than the muggle world.

- Depends if the wizarding side has participated in the war. If not the muggle government may have to deal with two separate Ministries (councils, whatever...) that govern the two magical nations within the one muggle nation. Deriving from that I always assume that the magical borders in Europe look way different than those of muggle Europe, with the changes starting and getting exponentially bigger from the Statute on.

- I like to think that the ICW is the ultimate authority on issues regarding the Statute of Secrecy. If a nation threatens to break the Statute, the ICW will declare it a threat to / and enemy of all wizardkind and either rally forces or press down on the nation with sanctions.

- What it should be is a Executive - Legislative/Judiciary setup. However, I imagine the Minister to be democratically elected while the Wizengamot is an Elder council. Respected members of the population may be added by Elders already in the council by vote. Given that Ministers seldom are non-respected members of society, the only thing keeping some of them out of the Wizengamot is age, some perceived failure in their character that the Wizengamot Elders dislike, or whatnot. Ministers are, however, mostly also part of the Wizengamot which sometimes results in them having almost dictatorial powers.

- No

- Colonies were mostly a muggle thing. As said before, wizards had these freedoms pretty much since they discovered flying and apparition. Though when global empires, like the British one, became a thing, some of the border issues became rather urgent to figure out. In short, power discrepancies between indigenous and colonial forces were less or almost non-existent when it came to magicals. While the British had to fight a bunch of bronze-age warriors, the magicals faced equal, or better opposition. It comes back to the massive difference of borders I described earlier. Magical US, for example, is far from being half a continent big. They share this territory with the magical part of the indigenous population, sometimes rather strictly separated, sometimes melting together slowly, but steadily. Same with India, Australia,... In addition to that, magical nations are mostly an amalgamation of enclaves, since they have close to no use for the land in between, thanks to apparition, Floo,... . So the concept of a magical nation is fundamentally different from their muggle counterparts.

- Yes. Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald were, in essence, scholars. They used their knowledge for different philosophies, but to get there they had to delve deep into academics and obscure knowledge. Their calibre of wizard is rare, but far from unherard of. Dumbledore being the greatest wizard alive, or Voldemort the worst Dark Lord ever, are statements deriving from a british perspective. There are other, equally brilliant wizards as Dumbledore out there, and there are other dark wizards who match Voldemort in genius and violence. What are they up to? Shaping the wizarding world in their image is what.

- I only remember that "The Aurors are coming, Tom" was a real threat spoken. So there is a realistic chance that enough of them can take Voldi down... with Dumbledore in the mix... ah, whatever.

- Full Time Freedom Fighters.

***** *Grand Tour*

The Grand Tour was the traditional trip of Europe undertaken by mainly upper class European young men of sufficient means and rank (or those of more humble origin who could find a sponsor), as well as young women if they were also of sufficient means, and accompanied by a chaperon, such as other family members, when they had come of age (about the age of 21 years old). The custom flourished from about 1660, until the advent of large-scale rail transport in the 1840s, and was associated with a standard itinerary. It served as an educational rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations, and from the second half of the 18th century, by some South and North Americans.

*** Personally, I believe the wizarding world to be restricted by geological and cultural borders, but I think there are big empires that does not exist in the muggle world, like Rajasthan and a Zulu empire.

It is a possibility that the Indian wizards had a similar "Country or kind" debate, and kind won. I don't think british wizards cared much about the outside world, especially after the statue of secrecy

!!! This was my headcanon for North/South America for so long. Why should North American magical governments mirror muggle ones? Muggles migrated for a lot of reasons, none of which would have prompted wizards to go with them in great numbers.

Just for added contrast with Europe, I think magical folk predominated over nonmagical folk and the two weren't divided. I mean, they probably would be divided within society (squibs and muggles being the exact same thing here, with basically a presumption of "pure" blood otherwise)--it seems unlikely the squibs would be anything but an underclass of some kind. But magic wouldn't be a secret. The arrival of hoardes of magic-ignorant European muggles prompted Statutes of Secrecy in North America and magical society is now hidden. I'm picturing the size of the magical population in North America being about the same as the nonmagical population. Cuz magic. But anyway, North American magical communities eventually excised their muggle counterparts and basically left them to rot. Bummer. Why didn't they just kill the invading European muggles? Dunno.

I thought about this a lot more after Fantastic Beasts came out.

I'd like to imagine Russia was full of them due to the nationals own value of power. Voldemort probably wasn't that big of an issue to the Russian Ministry of Magic, so they did nothing (especially seeing as how no one from the British Ministry asked any other nations for help, which I find incredibly odd).

All of them. That would be a quite interesting scene to write in a fanfiction, just Voldemort killing a bunch of Aurors that have surrounded him, kind of like Harry in Kingsman The Secret Service, in the church scene, if you've ever watched the movie.

She's probably the most inconsistent author when it comes to that. I like to think that it's because all the good drafts of character development are on some hidden island because she was too self-critical.

The fandom fights over this question so god damn much. Hogwarts and Diagon are too small, the Ministry is too big. JKR sucks at math as we all know and it's just so annoying.

Why haven't wizards taken over the world?

The fandom likes to argue this point as well because just using the rather small amount of random utility spells you could outproduce the muggles by a significant margin. Instead of huge swathes of migrating harvesters, you have a witch conjure and/or animate a bunch of plows. Instead of Scotland Yard you have a point me spell for stolen things and veritaserum for interrogation. There's magical solutions to so many mundane problems.

Neither wanted to eradicate Muggles.

Grindelwald wanted to rule Muggles.

Voldemort wanted to eradicate Muggleborns but shows no interest in repealing the Statute of Secrecy. Indeed he seems to be careful about never crossing the line in exposing the magical world.

I would qualify this. Wizards are only going to be interested in wealth that gives them the ability to purchase the goods and services they desire i.e. magical goods and services. Not all of Muggle wealth qualifies. Commodities like precious metals and jewels will count, but it's not clear that all commodities are valued by the wizarding world (e.g. aluminium) and there's also a vast amount of Muggle wealth which is I think too abstract for wizards: fiat currency, bonds, equities, derivatives, etc.

It's possible, but contrary to word of god:

  *Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?*

  As a vast number of people have pointed out to me in the last twenty four hours (some of them related to me by ties of blood) Colin DID develop a photograph from his camera in 'Chamber of Secrets' (my previous answer stated that he never did so).

  Cameras, like radios (or, as the wizards call them 'wirelesses' -- they're always a bit behind the times when it comes to Muggle technology) do exist in the wizarding world (there's a radio in the Weasleys' kitchen and we know there are cameras because of the moving photographs you see everywhere). Wizards do not need electricity to make these things work; they function by magic, but in the case of such objects the wizards liked the Muggle invention enough to appropriate the idea without adding cumbersome plugs/batteries.

  I have an old notebook in which it says dev sol (potion) magic [indecipherable word] photos move. Adept as I am at interpreting my old scribbles, I can tell you that the original idea was that wizards would use a magical developing potion to make their photographs move.

  SO... *as Colin's batteries can't work in Hogwarts, clearly his camera is running off the magical atmosphere and he is then developing his photographs in the magical potion that causes the figures therein to move. All of which goes to show that Colin has a lot more initiative than I ever realised.*

  The poll question answer has also been queried, but I didn't get that one wrong -- for details, see P.S.

  I have learned something from this experience, which is that when you read through twenty chapters at a sitting, then decide to do some FAQs for the website in the early hours of the morning, you mess up. I'll make sure I'm a bit more alert for the next batch.

It could have been used to discover the New World centuries before European Muggles did so. It could be used to power mass production and a consumer society without scarcity.

But the thing is, most wizards seem to have little interest in these things. The Muggle impulse of "you do it because you can" doesn't appear to be present in wizards (excepting the odd explorer type). Most wizards seem perfectly content with the simple things in life: good food, good company, family, the outdoors. Wholesome, unambitious pursuits.

Oh I completely agree. But I don't think you need to take the phrase "magical battery" so literally. It doesn't have to be a direct parallel of electrical batteries, only with magic instead of electricity.

All that the idea really commits you to is that it is possible to enchant an object such that it allows electrical items to work without an electricity supply. You don't need there to be a pool of magic for it to draw from like fuel, nor does there have to be a magic-electricity conversion or anything like that. Nor does it commit you to the idea that the same object could be used to cast or sustain enchantments.

Going back to my original post, we do know radios and the like don't work. Computers etc, do you think that is magic at work? Ignorance on behalf of those doing the enchanting? My least favourite explanation I've read is that Magic has a place on the EM spectrum.

Simple electronics appear to work or at least can be made to work. Is there a complexity function that causes magic to interfere? Does it have to be a persistent enchantment like those protecting Hogwarts that cause things to fail or perhaps a teacher cursed muggle objects at Hogwarts so they wouldn't be distracting.

************* I would say that it's not magic per se that causes electrical items to fail (because otherwise all magic would be incompatible with electronics, which is not the case). Rather it's because Hogwarts is such a magical place.

I think in general the fandom has taken a rather too physics-inspired approach to the idea of Hogwarts being a magical place. They seek to explain it in terms of some kind of interaction between magic and forces of physics. I reject this in terms of a more fairy tale understanding of "magical". Something more abstract and harder to pin down, something like how Dumbledore calls music magical, something that captures the same kind of meaning as "special" as when you say "Disneyland is a magical place".

It's not an atmospheric effect, it's not something measurable, it's not a feature of magical geography. It's a function of the place's history and status and the activities that occur there. The education of magical children does not make a place magical by virtue of some quasi-physical effect where casting spells loads of times in one place makes that place more magical, but rather because educating young minds in magic is highly magical per se. It's special.

On a related note, I also consider this highly magical nature to also be how so many adventures happen within Hogwarts. The magic of the place makes "story book logic" apply. I like to think that all the students of Hogwarts have their own little adventures, though admittedly not as grand in scale as Harry's.

This same effect is what prevents Muggle objects from working. It's not because they're electrical and magic interferes with electricity. It's because they're Muggle, and Hogwarts is simply too magical for things that are too Muggleish to work there. I also imagine, for example, that guns would not work at Hogwarts, even though they are mechanical not electrical. They're just too Muggle.

  Electronics fail around Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

That's not what the books say. Hermione quotes a written by wizards for wizard (with known wizarding supremacist slant, if not anti-muggle) as muggle technology (from the examples given we can conclude it means electronics specifically and not any product of mechanical or chemical engineering) "going haywire". This does not mean it fails outright (although the fandom generally reads it that way), it means things perform in unexpected ways.\\
Now, we know that wizards are generally less than adept at using muggle technology. In addition a Scottish member of the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group once pointed out that the presumed location of Hogwarts is less than ideal when it comes to radio reception or access to mains electricity. Finally, even if we are charitable and say that the tests performed to found that claim made in the book were done in the mid-to-late 80s, computers and radars (examples explicitly given as being problematic at Hogwarts) generally were not easy to use. Let alone by a wizard knowing next to nothing about muggle technology and arrogant enough in his wizarding way to believe he knows what he is doing.

Taking all that into account, we have some wizard handling muggle technology and making assumptions about what is supposed to happen.\\
So let us look at some examples:

- Radios - pretty easy, assuming a battery-powered portable radio was used. Expected: turn it on and you can listen to some station playing music. What happens: No FM reception as the surrounding mountains block the radio wave and there is no broadcast mast serving this uninhabited area. AM and shortwave reception are spotty, stations appear and vanish between attempts to tune them in, weird noises occur. All this can easily be mistaken for the radio acting up instead of what it actually is - the way radio works on medium and short wave. Radio wave propagation is massively dependent on the conditions in the ionosphere and thus the time of the day. Remote stations may interfere with closer ones at night but not propagate far enough during daytime. Even the positioning and turning of the radio, aligning and mis-aligning the antenna inside it can easily be misinterpreted as magical interference.

- TV - pretty much the same as radio compounded by the fact that it is even more finicky

- Radar - I'd say just about every issue with it can be attributed to user error, from not setting it up correctly to mishandling when using it to not being able to interpret the return image correctly.

- Computers - If they even set one up correctly they are now at a blinking dot or bar on the screen. What now? Nothing is happening! Without typing in the correct words and symbols they won't get any further. Without extensive study of less than accessibly written documentation or having a mate guide them through they'll get nowhere here. If they perform their tests with a Sinclair Spectrum that will even during normal operation output all kinds of weird noises and sounds that can be misinterpreted as faults. If the test has been longer agao than that, say with an Altair 8800, then all there is is a box with some switches and "random" lights. What now?

***** I always imagined wizarding space travel to be entirely devoid of actual aero- and astronautical ideas. Rather, they can "jump" from planet to planet by the use of magic, never leaving the atmosphere.

It really depends on what limitations you want to set, and I've explored both ways before. I came to like the idea a lot that wizards can just teleport a "colony-pack" to Mars, make it set itself up by Animation Charms and then connect it to a Floo Network. Calling "Earth-to-Mars Foyer" you can just step into the fireplace and step out into the first glass-dome on Mars. For more planets, rinse and repeat.

I mean, we have practically no knowledge of the history of the magical world. So, by just picking through the history and mythology of witchcraft in Europe, the idea of a Coven as a form of organisation, maybe even as a cultural institution comes to mind. If you want to believe the church, those groups would be rather free in their lovemaking and heathens all around. So taking those forward in time, there may be a cultural acceptance for variants of love and relationships that the christian-based morality of 20th century muggle-UK wouldn't condone.

I may have been unclear, but this sentence is asking if it is a historical basis for present behavior /in the universe/. As in, inside the fictional world of Harry Potter.

Which is why I got snarky when you asked me for a real world historical basis. I have no idea about the accurate history of witchcraft in Europe. I hear stuff and let myself be inspired. How Covens actually worked, or if they existed as portrayed in the first place is, to be quite honest, not important. Which is the same approach Rowling (probably) took when designing her wizarding world.

Of course the fact that covens (Why capitalized? that led me to the first confusion, where I thought you referred to some specific example) were connected to witch-cult theory (aka witches being remnants of pagan cults) - which is definitely not something Rowling was going for, I doubt that theory had any bearing on the universe.

JKR has said via Twitter that the Wizarding world doesn't really get hung up on people's sexual orientation. Admittedly, she's retconned a lot of stuff, but my guess is that sexuality in general isn't really discussed that much in public. I would say that people like Dumbledore and Charlie Weasley are probably "in the closet", although I would also guess most wizards and witches don't really care about what's behind the closet doors. Sure, there might be some gossip, but it would be more of the "who-are-they-dating" kind than anything judgmental.

Also, if you can multiply food, can you, say, buy an eggplant and multiply that, then leave an eggplant to multiply a few days later, also applying this to all other foods, thus never have the need to buy food ever again? Because that seems kind of broken. Food would be insanely cheap this way, since you could theoratically feed the entire Weasley household on a combination of one egg, one potato, one bean, etc for an entire meal, a month even.

There is at least a suggestive answer to this. We know from Pottermore that the Malfoy family was gifted a large amount of land by William the Conqueror. The way to generate an income from land is normally farming. So it is likely that the Malfoy family owns a large amount of farmland (presumably occupied by tenant farmers).

There are of course plenty of hanging questions about this. It's possible that the tenant farmers are Muggles, unaware of who their landlord really is. Even if they are wizards, it's possible the land is used to (for example) rear magical animals rather than foodstuffs.

But it presents at least one possible answer to the question: the Malfoy family owns a large part of magical Britain's food supply.

I mean, despite their supposed poverty, the Weasley family never struggles for food. In fact they seem to eat like kings. (They also own a 6 bedroom house with a decent amount of land attached, so I think it's clear that they are poor in terms of ability to buy magical goods and services but doing pretty well for themselves from the Muggle perspective).

They don't pay a mortgage or rent, insurance premiums, electricity/gas bills, water bills(?), cable/internet/phone bills, etc. They have a garden and probably a few producing animals.

Maybe like 80% of Arthur's paycheck goes to food and that's why they're always scrounging when it comes to other basics like clothes, school supplies, and /wands/ of all things (that was so dangerous)? You'd think they'd be doing a lot better financially by the time Ron's in school seeing as how there's only 3 people to feed 8 or 9 months out of the year.
