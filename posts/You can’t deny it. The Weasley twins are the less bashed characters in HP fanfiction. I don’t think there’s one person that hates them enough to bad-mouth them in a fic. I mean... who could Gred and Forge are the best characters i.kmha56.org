** Fanon vs. canon for the Weasley twins [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm#sweet_Twins][here]].

#+begin_quote
  Fanon tends to paint the Weasley Twins as lovely, jolly boys. In canon, however, when they were little they beat Ron's pet Puffskein to death for fun (it's mentioned in the marginal notes in the original Fantastic Beasts booklet), tried to get Ron to take an Unbreakable Vow which could easily have killed him, burned a hole right through his tongue and traumatized him by turning his teddy-bear into a giant spider while he was holding it. It could be said that they treated Ron rather worse than Dudley treated Harry, with added magic, and they continue to be nasty to him even as adults - they don't even give him a family discount in their shop, or credit, but are rather unpleasant about him having to pay on the spot, and make an obvious and ostentatious show of how much more they value and like Harry than they do their brother. [Could jealousy be a factor here? Do they resent the fact that Ron has captured the loyalty of Famous Harry Potter to a greater extent than they have?]

  At Hogwarts they commit criminal blackmail against Ludo Bagman, carry out unethical and unauthorized magical experiments on children and Muggles, jeer at eleven-year-olds just for having been Sorted into Slytherin, and threaten to rape Zacharias Smith with an implement. ["'Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?' enquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags. // 'Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred." And yes, this sort of thing is sometimes said as a joke but the jokes have a standard pattern, and this seems at least half serious.] George uses a Bludger to launch an unprovoked attack on Snape when he is refereeing a Quidditch match, even though if he had succeeded in knocking Snape off his broom in mid air the man could well have been killed.

  Their attack on Montague is particularly vile. They stuff him into a broken magical box too small to lie down in, without food or water or lavatory facilities, and then send him off into wizard space without any idea of how long he'll be gone or whether he'll have any air beyond what's already in the Vanishing Cabinet, or whether he'll still be able to at least use his wand to summon water. It was only good luck that Montague was only missing for around 32 hours and wasn't returned weeks later, dead of thirst, and as it was he was so badly damaged that weeks after his return he was still in the hospital wing being spoon-fed (although he did recover by the end of the year). And all this just for taking a few points, and for being a Slytherin.

  Worst of all, according to Ginny the Twins were seriously planning to let off Garrotting Gas - which judging from its name and Ginny's comments is probably lethal - in a school full of children. If the gas really is as fatal as Ginny implies, then what they were planning was a major terrorist attack, in a high school - and not even a terrorist attack done to express some serious political grievance, but just because it amused them, which takes them into the same sort of territory as the Columbine killers. Ginny does not seem to find this surprising.

  Indeed, the Twins are so obviously criminal that I wonder if Rowling was inspired in part by the famous 1980s case of the Gibbons twins. Isolated by the bullying which they suffered at school because they were the only black children in a rural Welsh village, and perhaps also a little autistic, the Gibbons girls developed a private language which excluded outside contact, fell into a folie a deux and ended up spending fourteen years in the state hospital for the criminally insane at Broadmoor, after embarking on a campaign of arson.

***** Hermione didn't just blackmail Skeeter. She kidnapped her, threatened her, and extorted her. Basically she committed several felonies. And that was JUST with the Skeeter case. Canon Hermione was not nearly the darling of fanfic any more than the twins were. Let's remember that she set a teacher on fire a few months into her first year of school; the WRONG teacher at that! She was a sociopath at best! Rowling had a weird habit of giving her "protagonists" a pass when they committed crimes very similar to the people that they were fighting against, sometimes with far weaker reasons, just because it might be funny from a child's perspective.

****** True. But, while I don't think Skeeter deserved what happened to her, let's not forget that she caused Hermione -- a minor --- to both have severe emotional/mental stress and be ostracized in wizarding society. And since it seems like the wizarding world has no laws protecting minors in this scenario, I can't exactly fault Hermione for taking matters into her own hands in this scenario.

Similarly, Ludo Bagman felt no remorse about stealing what was equivalent to the life savings of the twins. Granted, he lost out too (IIRC), but to take the life savings of minors is just trashy. However, since there also don't seem to be any laws protecting minors here, there would've been no legal repercussions for him doing that. Of course, one could argue that the twins don't really deserve the money back considering Mr. Weasley warning them not to place any bets, but they're /teenagers/. Since when are two troublemaking teenagers going to listen to their parents?

Also, I wouldn't call Hermione a sociopath. Not only is it an outdated term, but it is also not a good term to use when talking about children or even teenagers. After all, both children and teenagers (especially teenagers?) tend to have a self-centered view of the world, because while they may naturally be empathetic, empathy is a /skill/, not an inherited trait. And we can see the protagonists develop this skill throughout the series (i.e., Harry feeling sorry for Snape despite what Snape did to him, Hermione feeling a bit sorry for Draco in HBP, etc.), although we admittedly see Harry develop this far more due to the series being almost entirely in his POV alone.

But Mr. Weasley also placed a bet with Bagman, so the warning was clearly "you might lose your life savings," not "Bagman isn't trustworthy." If it had been the latter, then I think that argument might hold up.

******* sociopath: noun, a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.

That pretty much sounds like canon (not fanon) Hermione to me. She actively alienated everyone around her for most of her life, only made friends in a life-and-death situation, and those were her only friends for the rest of the series. And if she had a conscience, it wasn't all that evident in what she did. Aside from all that was mentioned in my post above, she also body-binds Neville for doing the right thing, stole from a teacher to make an illegal potion that had long-lasting negative effects on her, assaulted a fellow student (granted, he's an asshole), actively aided and abetted a criminal via illegal usage of a controlled artifact, attempted to lead a coup, intentionally led the worst teacher around into the hands of known rapists, and so on. By the end of the series she has committed dozens of straight-up felonies, and that's not even counting any of the "crimes" she committed against Voldemort's illegal government. She's a career criminal by the age of 15, who is only "friends" with like-minded criminals who she depends on to survive. If that's not sociopathy, then it's close enough for government work. The only reason to brush aside all of her crimes and mental problems are due to her being a main character in what starts out as a series for children.

******** It doesn't sound like her at all. Lol üòÇ she was angry because she thinks house elves are slaves. Commiting crimes does not automatically make your a sociopath. Hurting people does not automatically make you a sociopath. Getting in trouble does not make you a sociopath. What is her reasoning and intention when she makes a decision? Does it effect her emotionally? If she able to empathize?

According to your description everyone in the entire world could be considered a sociopath.

Examples: King Joffrey From HBO's "Game of Thrones Joffrey Baratheon, the prince who becomes a young, vicious king in the medieval fantasy series, has all of the characteristics of the classic definition of antisocial personality disorder, including hostility, callousness, antagonism, a short temper, and a lack of empathy. "He's sadistic," said Michelle Stevens, PhD, a psychologist in private practice in Los Angeles and a consultant on the TV show "Bates Motel." He's violent and petty --- all just for his own pleasure."

The Governor From AMC-TV's "The Walking Dead"

In a post-apocalyptic world in which flesh-eating zombies roam, the Governor creates a utopian town where people can get a sense of peace. Behind the scenes, he's brutal and bloodthirsty. It's easy to think he's a psychopath, but it's not so. "He's a man who is probably narcissistic rather than psychopathic," Leistedt said. The Governor likes power and wants to be the man who saves everyone, which doesn't describe a true psychopath. He also has feelings and emotions, as viewers could see from the way he tried to find a cure to save his daughter.

Dexter Morgan From Showtime's "Dexter" Dexter Morgan is a remorseless serial killer who revels in setting up a "kill room" and strapping his victims to his table. There's something about Dexter that doesn't jibe with true psychopaths, however, said Julia Samton, MD, director of Manhattan Neuropsychiatric in New York City. "He's responsible and consistent at work," she said. "Most of the sociopaths we study are not this high-functioning." In general, it's hard for most people to refrain from showing their pathology in other parts of their lives

Psychology is not your forte.

Copying the definition does not mean you understand.

Let me copy since traits of a sociopath with you.

Death Eaters, respectively in the late bind have examples of people who may be psychopaths or sociopaths.

Signs of ASPD in adults

The signs of ASPD can vary widely from person to person. In addition, one person's symptoms may change over time. When reading through these signs, keep in mind that all humans exhibit this kind of behavior from time to time, especially when they're upset. They aren't always signs of ASPD. Unlike someone having a particularly bad day, people with ASPD never feel any remorse for what they've said or done, even if it caused someone a great deal of harm.

1. Lack of empathy

One of the most notable symptoms of ASPD is a lack of empathy. In response to another person's feelings, they may come across as:

cold

unfeeling

callous

overly critical

harsh

People with ASPD don't always realize how harmful their actions are. In other cases, they may simply not care that their actions hurt someone.

Symptom: Lack of empathy

Perhaps one of the most well-known signs of ASP is a lack of empathy, particularly an inability to feel remorse for one's actions. ‚ÄúMany people with ASP do seem to lack a conscience, but not all of them,‚Äù he explains. Psychopaths always have this symptom, however, which is what makes them especially dangerous. ‚ÄúWhen you don't experience remorse, you're kind of freed up to do anything---anything bad that comes to mind,‚Äù says Dr. Black

Symptom: Callousness

Some might be openly violent and aggressive. Others will cut you down verbally. Either way, people with ASP tend to show a cruel disregard for other people's feelings

1. Disregard for right and wrong

People with ASPD generally have no regard for boundaries, rules, or laws. Someone with ASPD may:

lie

cheat

steal from others

break laws

be in constant legal trouble

be in an out of jail for minor to major crimes

When disregarding right and wrong, people with ASPD usually don't consider the short- or long-term consequences of their actions.

1. Wit and charm

In addition to their more negative behaviors, people with ASPD often come off as very charismatic and charming. They may use humor, flattery, intellect, or flirtation for personal gain. In other cases, they might use these techniques to get someone to do something that's harmful to them.

Symptom: Manipulativeness

Sociopaths tend to try to seduce and ingratiate themselves with the people around them for their own gain, or for entertainment. But this doesn't mean they're all exceptionally charismatic. ‚ÄúIt may be true of some, and it is often said of the psychopath that they're superficially charming,‚Äù says Dr. Black. ‚ÄúBut I see plenty of antisocial men in my hospital and in our outpatient clinic and I would not use the term charming to describe them.‚Äù

Symptom: Difficult relationships

People with ASP find it hard to form emotional bonds, so their relationships are often unstable and chaotic, says Dr. Black. Rather than forge connections with the people in their lives, they might try to exploit them for their own benefit through deceit, coercion, and intimidation

1. Impulsiveness

People with ASPD tend to act without considering the consequences. They might regularly engage in life-threatening activities without considering their own safety or the safety of anyone else involved. This impulsiveness and disregard of consequences puts people with ASPD at a high risk of developing an addiction to a substance or behavior, such as gambling.

1. Arrogance

People with ASPD may act as if they're above those around them. In addition to acting extra confident, they may also be condescending or easily irritated by others, especially those who disagree with them.

1. Aggression

People with ASPD are often psychically or verbally abusive. They may physically harm people without any consideration of the resulting injuries to the other person. Verbal abuse might include:

insults

deprecation

negative statements

public or private humiliation

Symptom: Hostility

Sociopaths are not only hostile themselves, but they're more likely to interpret others' behavior as hostile, which drives them to seek revenge.

Symptom: Deceitfulness

Sociopaths have a reputation for being dishonest and deceitful. They often feel comfortable lying to get their own way, or to get themselves out of trouble. They also have a tendency to embellish the truth when it suits them.

********* Well, I'm not going to respond point-by-point to this long-winded and self-contradictory rant. But I will say a few things. First, I have no idea why you brought up Joffrey as an example of debunking Hermione's sociopathy, but it sort of undermines whatever point you were trying to make. I don't watch Walking Dead so I can't comment on that character, nor Dexter. But in the latter case you seem to be conflating psychopaths and sociopaths, which are not the same thing, so when you say that psychology is not my forte you are correct, but you're not exactly showing top-level credentials there yourself. As for all of the traits (all of which are labeled with the number 1 for some reason), they ALL sound like Hermione. Granted, she's not too far down that path because at least sometimes she can be considerate, but I think "high-functioning sociopath" isn't out of the question for her. Granted, that term is generally not applied to kids since most kids haven't fully developed empathy, and thus the phrase "all kids are sociopaths" has some truth to it. But she's far more vicious than most of the characters in those books, and I include the Death Eaters. She rarely if ever thinks of the consequences of her actions, or how they'll affect other people. Hell, she Obliviated her parents because it would be too much trouble to explain things to them and convince them to leave for their own safety. She didn't even give them a chance, nor a thought later. Look at what you wrote and tell me what among that long list can NOT be applied to Hermione. And I LIKE Hermione. I like that she's complex. I just don't like how everyone forgives her many, MANY flaws in order to look at her as the Perfect Protagonist. She's not. Not by a very long shot.

********** I agree that sociopaths are in a scale. Some are worse than others.

But just because some actions may have negative consequences that does not mean she is a sociopath. That is true in real life also. People do really fucked up shit without being sociopaths or psychopaths.

She really only takes drastic/manipulative measures when there is danger. And it saved them again and again.

If it's true she was a sociopath then there would be indicators in her everyday life. In her day to day life what has she done that is so horrible?

She doesn't harm people because she enjoys it. She doesn't manipulate people to do her bidding. She's incredibly responsible. She really doesn't have any social charm (unlike a lot of psychopaths and sociopaths).

It's the same as saying a soldier is a murderer because they have killed people in a battle. Yes, they killed someone, but it's not the same as murder.

Regarding her parents,well, there wasn't much choice. What good would telling them do? She doesn't ever want to be used against her parents or vice versa. They cannot defend themselves against wizards.

I can't say that I would have done the same thing but as far as we know they were safe. The Deatheaters had already gone after first generation wizards and their families. + She is known to be Harry Potter's best friend. Possibly more than that. Her family would have been a high profile target. As far as we know they survived and that was the goal.

****** Skeeter was harassing Hermione and her friends all year and trying to ruin their lives. I don't think she deserved to be kidnapped but that's what happens when your society has no laws protecting children from libel and 15 year olds are forced to take things into their own hands.

As for setting Snape on fire, she legitimately thought Snape was trying to murder her friend, which considering what an abusive shitbag of a teacher he is, isn't that crazy to think even if you /aren't/ watching him try to pull off a what looks like a curse.

I definitely don't think Hermione is as flawless as fandom (or the movies or JKR for that matter) makes her out to be; she can be pretty insensitive and downright cruel at times.

Also, for it to work the twins would have had to get their hands on a wand, which means one of the people with wands in the house was careless. The twins were physically punished for that.

Acid pops are sold in Honeydukes. They do not appear to have an age restriction on them. Ergo the twins gave Ron a /commercially sold sweet/ which Ron could have presumably purchased himself. The twins were physically punished for that.

The spider incident. The twins were /five/ and Ron (then three) had just broken Fred's toy broomstick. Fred very likely had an outburst of accidental magic which turned the teddy bear into a spider.

So to recap. We have one incident of accidental magic, one incident of giving their younger brother a sweet possibly with malicious intent and one incident which might have been malicious but may not have been. Two of those instances resulted in Fred (and possibly George) being physically hit by their parents - once with a broom and once presumably with some kind of object - as punishment. By contrast, Dudley was never punished for hitting Harry and was, in fact, encouraged to do so.

Not limited to:

Hermione's reaction to Snape's +"I see no difference"+ "insufferable know it all" remark is evidence of HGSS

Realising Snape was a good person all along is a part of maturity, and anyone who still thinks he is more bad than good is either a child or still has unresolved issues with their own teachers.

JKR's ex-husband beat her, therefore JKR is attracted to men who beat their wives, JKR said she likes James, therefore JKR is attracted to James, therefore James might have ended up beating Lily

And numerous other examples of Snape and Slytherin apologia.

  Indeed, despite the Shrieking Shack incident, the fact that Hermione was so upset because Snape made a not all that insulting comment *she was used to hearing from her friends* could be seen as evidence for the HGSS scenario. We've seen how Hermione hung on Lockhart's every word in second year, and the fact that she minds Snape's opinion so much could be evidence that she's transferred her crush to the man who defeated Lockhart in a duel.

Or, you know, I don't care if my friends take the piss out of me because we're mates and I know they don't mean it, but I'd be upset if it was some random, or God forbid a teacher.

I think someone mentioned that the author of these essays said they knew John Nettleship, who was the teacher JKR based Snape on, and they don't appear to be fully able to separate the two.

I can fully believe that if they were one of Nettleship's students, they had the kind of quasi student-teacher friendship in which they wouldn't mind being called supposedly disparaging things, I know I've bantered a bit with some of my teachers, but Snape and Hermione clearly don't have that kind of relationship. Snape's remark was intended to be mean spirited, and it upset Hermione.

Not only that, but he refused to let her go to the Hospital Wing, thereby allowing himself to punish her for leaving class without permission if he were so inclined.

Going off more of the essay:

#+begin_quote
  He is certainly never remotely as vicious and abusive as Dumbledore, his own teacher, was to him when he was twenty and trying to defect. But he does seem actively to enjoy causing mild to moderate stress and frustration, and scoring off people - even people who are in his power and so can't really defend themselves - in a very childish way, and he cheats by behaving like a name-calling student to the students, and then pulling rank if they respond in kind. He likes to annoy people, to wind them up and then watch them do a slow burn so he is, at least in this fairly limited way, a spiteful gloater, and the crack about Hermione's teeth and the childish accusation of "know-it-all" suggest that the problem may be that Snape doesn't know from one minute to the next whether he's staff or student. He is, after all, the youngest teacher in the school (except, briefly, for Remus, who is just a few months younger), teaching in the place where he himself was taught, with colleagues who have known him since he was eleven and sometimes treat him as if he still was.

No, it was because Montague had cast his lot with the Inquisitorial Squad, a group of students filled with the children of Death Eaters who were being encouraged by Ministry officials to punish wrong-think. It was quite literally a Junior Death Eater organization.

#+begin_quote
  Worst of all, according to Ginny the Twins were seriously planning to let off Garrotting Gas - which judging from its name and Ginny's comments is probably lethal - in a school full of children. If the gas really is as fatal as Ginny implies, then what they were planning was a major terrorist attack, in a high school - and not even a terrorist attack done to express some serious political grievance, but just because it amused them, which takes them into the same sort of territory as the Columbine killers. Ginny does not seem to find this surprising.

#+begin_quote
  Indeed, the Twins are so obviously criminal that I wonder if Rowling was inspired in part by the famous 1980s case of the Gibbons twins. Isolated by the bullying which they suffered at school because they were the only black children in a rural Welsh village, and perhaps also a little autistic, the Gibbons girls developed a private language which excluded outside contact, fell into a folie a deux and ended up spending fourteen years in the state hospital for the criminally insane at Broadmoor, after embarking on a campaign of arson.

*** *TLDR:* This is the biggest load of logical fallacies and Slytherin apologist garbage I have seen in a long time. The writer constantly frames the twins actions in the worst possible light, often making baseless assumptions to do so, despite supposedly writing purely about canon. As such, the validity of anything they say on the subject should be questioned.

Like every other character in the books, and every person in real life, the twins are not perfect people. They are generally good people, but they have flaws and have made mistakes. But focusing only on those points is disingenuous and hypocritical.

#+end_quote

Emphasis on "when they were little." While most of those were rather mean-spirited, it ignores the fact that basically all kids are sometimes cruel to each other, as it takes time for them to get a firm grip on morality.

And acid pops are sold at Honeydukes, so they are clearly not really harmful. Trying to pass that off as a terrible thing they did doesn't help the writer's credibility much.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You could say that, but you'd be wrong. The evidence for that position is flimsy at best and reeks of false equivalence.

#+end_quote

They have no obligation to give Ron a discount, and they didn't offer one to Ginny either. Ron was clearly taking advantage of their expected generosity though, since he was "laden with merchandise" and had "many boxes." Perhaps if he had shown some restraint, they would have been kinder. And their "show of how much more they value and like Harry" all happened in the back room, so it was not "obvious and ostentatious" at all. And Harry was the one who gave them the money for the shop, which they considered a loan, so of course they want to pay him back.

#+begin_quote
  At Hogwarts they commit criminal blackmail against Ludo Bagman
#+end_quote

Ludo, the adult who defrauded some children. And really, "pay us what you owe us or we'll seek legal action" is hardly blackmail, even if they did call it that. The twins clearly have the moral high ground here.

#+begin_quote
  carry out unethical and unauthorized magical experiments on children and Muggles
#+end_quote

They'd already done plenty of tests on themselves, professional healing was readily available, and the kids were willing volunteers who were financially compensated.

And the only muggle they experimented on was Dudley, and is anyone honestly going to argue that he didn't deserve it? Saying that they "experimented on muggles" is an obvious exaggeration attempting to make them sound worse than they were.

#+begin_quote
  jeer at eleven-year-olds just for having been Sorted into Slytherin
#+end_quote

They made hissing noises (that the kids would be unlikely to hear anyway) at kids sorted into Slytherin. That's no different from roaring at Gryffindors or cawing at Ravenclaws, unless you think there's something inherently wrong with being a Slytherin, in which case you've bruined your argument.

#+begin_quote
  and threaten to rape Zacharias Smith with an implement.
#+end_quote

Calling that a rape threat is another obvious exaggeration.

#+begin_quote
  George uses a Bludger to launch an unprovoked attack on Snape when he is refereeing a Quidditch match, even though if he had succeeded in knocking Snape off his broom in mid air the man could well have been killed.
#+end_quote

1. If Snape can't safely referee a Quidditch match then he shouldn't be up there to begin with.

2. The fact that there are not several Quidditch deaths every year strongly implies that there are additional safety measures or that they are not playing at dangerous heights. And Harry and Neville have both fallen from brooms without major damage.

3. If they are at fault for that, then the entire Slytherin Quidditch team is guilty of attempted murder.

#+begin_quote
  Their attack on Montague is particularly vile.
#+end_quote

No, it wasn't. I've gone over this before, so I won't go into detail, but the summary is "Montague was an awful person who deserved what he got, the entire thing was his fault anyway, and the twins had no way to know that anything bad would have happened."

#+begin_quote
  Worst of all, according to Ginny the Twins were seriously planning to let off Garrotting Gas - which judging from its name and Ginny's comments is probably lethal
#+end_quote

This entire accusation is built on this flawed assumption. There is no reason to believe that the Garroting Gas doesn't just cause some unpleasant but nonfatal choking, as the name was clearly just chosen for the alliteration. And Ginny's comments were made when she was specifically trying to keep people away, so some exaggeration is to be expected.

#+begin_quote
  what they were planning was a major terrorist attack, in a high school
#+end_quote

Again, this is a major exaggeration.

#+begin_quote
  and not even a terrorist attack done to express some serious political grievance, but just because it amused them
#+end_quote

Has this writer completely forgot about Umbridge?

#+begin_quote
  which takes them into the same sort of territory as the Columbine killers.

#+begin_quote
  that I wonder if Rowling was inspired in part by the famous 1980s case of the Gibbons twins.

But the writer has presented no evidence for this comparison beyond "they're twins who were sometimes mean." This is pure false equivalence.

And even if it were true, it would undermine the writer's point, because it would mean that the reason the twins acted the way they did was because they were victims of extreme bullying themselves, probably from the Slytherins.

I have yet to read a /good/ bashing fic in any fandom; even if it's bashing a character I don't personally like, it's all about imagined slights, exaggerations of misdeeds, and the author virtue signaling, not /what actually makes said character such an asshole/.

*** What a load of crap.

Others have addressed the things they did as small children who really wouldn't know better (though it can never be said too often that acid pops are literally sweets, not some sort of controlled substance).

Montague was a terrible person and it's not like they knew he wouldn't be able to get out. He's almost certainly a death eater sympathiser just like all the other Slytherins who were helping Umbridge.

They never did let it off and there's a good chance it's not particularly lethal, what's a bit of garrotting to a wizard anyway, this is a society that sees broken bones as a minor inconvenience to be magiced away in seconds.

Bludgers get hit at children all the time as part of the game and they're fine, so Snape would be too, besides which if there's a character who could use a iron ball to the head, it's him. What sort of vile human being spends most of his life bullying children from a position of power.

Threatening people with what is clearly some sort of joke implement (it comes from a joke shop bag, it probably does something amusing when you poke people with it) is hardly plotting rape.

As for the store, Ron was never their favourite family member and had no reason to expect a discount, whereas Harry literally handed them a big bag full of gold to fund the whole setup, it wouldn't exist without him so some free products are hardly unreasonable.

** What bothers me in most of this discussion is that pointing out the bad things the twins did, isn't made ok by pointing out what Malfoy did. Malfoy is a racist piece of scum, and he is only seen as redeemable because fanon gave the little twit leather pants.

We all know that the Weasley twins are almost always on Harry's side when the rest of the school isn't. I think the only exception is in book 1 where Harry & friends all lose 50 house points each, and they all have Harry for it. Doesn't the entire Quidditch team address him as "the seeker"? That includes F&G. I find this incredibly harsh and kind of a let down of their characters.

On the question of whether the behaviour of the Weasley twins is simply magically means spirited or down right bullying I kind of want to point to the pensive memory of Snape and the Marauders.

That is also magical, but intense humiliation, always directed at the same person. That was some intense bullying.

Frankly, I think the only way to figure this one out is to write several character studies on Molly, McGonagall, Neville, and maybe even Montague, and on how they perceive the actions of the twins.

** My Armchair Psychoanalysis (TM) is that much of the most blatant bashing happens in Independent/WBWL/Powerful!Harry fics. Those fics are characterised by Harry defying and rebelling against the adult figures in his life, particularly Dumbledore. They also tend to rebel against the canon ethos of overcoming force with love by focusing on power and skill. And, they explicitly reject the canon ending of a government job and a marriage to Ginny, in favour of some Lord-dom (if the fic makes it that far) and a relationship with (de facto OC ice queen) Daphne Greengrass, (beautified, nicified female lead) Hermione, (supernaturally beautiful) Fleur, or similar.

This, in turn, prompts bashing of Dumbledore and everything associated with him and of Ginny and everything associated with her---and the Weasleys fall into both categories. But, Fred and George, they exemplify rebellion against authority figures, both those of the school and those of their family, which makes them allies to the fic rather than enemies and exempts them from the bashing.

And, since the fic embraces pursuit of power and revels in moral compromises, all those bad things about the twins that [[/u/davidwelch158]] quoted are a feature rather than a bug.

** Arguably, although as others have raised, some of that could also be framing.

It's kinda interesting as an adult to see JKR's bias shining through. On the surface, for example, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle are described pretty consistently as bullies, but in terms of what they actually do... iirc, mostly they call other kids in their year names, and on only one occasion that I remember, they indirectly curse Hermione via a ricochet.

Meanwhile the Weasley twins canonically...

- steal

- drug younger students without consent or warning

- 'prank' other students in their year and other years in ways that aren't easily removed

- curse other students painfully (yes, they are Slytherins, but still)

- bait a Muggle into harming himself in a way he won't be able to reverse and which will probably cause PTSD, and don't apologize

- damage property that doesn't belong to them

- undermine Prefects and the idea of authority in the school

- arguably bully Ron a bit

But JKR doesn't have an issue with any of that. Because Gryffindors can't be Bad.

They constantly hexed Neville, wished death on other kids, called them racial slurs, bullied Harry and Hermione so badly in GoF that Harry was on the verge of fighting anyone who talked to him and was in awe that Hermione was able to walk with her head held high everyday, tried to kill the Headmaster, almost killed their classmates, used an Unforgivable on their classmate, and let terrorists swarm the school. I dislike the Weasley twins, but Malfoy and his crew are much worse. Also, Hermione /did/ call out the Weasley twins for their cruel pranks and for testing them on first years multiple times, so it wasn't like the books didn't at least somewhat acknowledge their cruelty.

I mean, we could also make the argument that Hermione, Ron, and Harry abduct and drug fellow classmates before stealing their bodies which is a pretty gross violation of agency, as well as Hermione abducting and imprisoning an adult for at least several days and setting a teacher on fire.

But it was in direct response to, and investigation of, Draco's very public statements that he supported the attacks on students. "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"

It may not have been the cleverest or most practical plan, but ethically speaking, it was used only to investigate a plausible suspect for a string of serious crimes.

Hermione imprisoning Rita Skeeter...well, it's questionable, but usually there's more of an ethical concern about adults imprisoning children than the other way around. Diminished responsibility as a minor, etc, plus the fact that Rita only got into that situation by breaking the law in the first place.

It's not a criticism, just an observation.
