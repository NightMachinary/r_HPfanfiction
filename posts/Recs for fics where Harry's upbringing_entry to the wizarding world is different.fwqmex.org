I've just reread The Perils of Innocence, as a new chapter was posted, and it's given me a huge desire for stories of a similar type.

I'd like recommendations for stories where all or part of Harry's upbringing is different (and not just "he was raised by Severus", something for imaginative), or where his introduction or entry into the wizarding world is different.

Please don't recommend Methods of Rationality though, I tried it and got fed up/disinterested.

I'm not bothered about which pairings (but no HP/LV please), though I prefer stories that don't have a strong focus on pairings.

Any recs would be greatly appreciated ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks!

Edit: I'd much prefer completed fics, but regularly updating ones are ok too.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/438516/chapters/747149][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] is my absolute favorite pre-hogwarts fanfic. it's got a crack premise but it kept me hooked all the way through. it has a couple completed sequels, too.

*** Yes, I've read that before and it's fantastic! A ridiculous but hilarious premise, that ends up working really well through the story. More stories like this would be great üòÇ Thanks for the rec.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist.

** Th√© newest I've found is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23032858][Another Year One AU]] by Anna_Hopkins. It's gen (and it'll probably stay gen) with LV as teacher and mentor.

For now, it's only changing the fact that instead of Hagrid (I get the feeling that LV did something to him, like with the dragon egg), Quirrel/LV came for Harry. It's a small change but it's already very different! The take on the house elves backstory is interesting. And LV isn't "nice", even Harry knows that he's aiming for something. It seems promising!

** I've been reccing this a lot recently for some reason.

Though the circumstances are the same, Dursley's being who they are in canon, the resulting Harry, certainly isn't.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker Here's the summary:\\
* What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse.

#+begin_quote
  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
