I'm looking for fics where Harry has people in his head, sort of like mental partners he can talk to, whether it be Voldemort or an OC.

The more AU, the better.

Fics like the following: linkffn(The Denarian Renegade; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Hit the Ground Running by Tozette)


** linkffn(10959046)

Only two chapters so far, but its incredible, slow updates though.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  At the final battle for Hogwarts, Harry Potter defeats Voldemort... mostly. But maybe a part of him never wanted to kill the Dark Lord in the first place, and maybe that part of him is a little bit stronger than the boy hero we all know and love. HPLV, NC-17

** Technically, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has Harry asking himself what his inner Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, etc. would do before making a decision (not to mention his Dark Side). :D

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
