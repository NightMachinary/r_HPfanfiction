iirc hermione was suffering some kind of mental trauma post war and she'd split from ron. harry kept trying to get her to get back together with him. she's at what i think was medical school?? which is where she meets draco again, and had a problem with sometimes overusing sleeping potions. hope this is specific enough!!
