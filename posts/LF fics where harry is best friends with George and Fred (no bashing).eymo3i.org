As the title says, I'm curious about stories where Harry is closer with the twins (but honestly retains as much as his own hate for bullies that he doesn't became a master pranker Ã  la James Potter). But at the same time something without Ron bashing or other people bashing, if possible.

Thank you for your time reading this :)

**** It's a flair. You can edit yours on the right side of your screen (underneath HPFANFICTION : 41111 BELIEVERS IN MAGICAL CORES....etc)

My headcanon:

I think Ron and Lavender could have worked out if Lavender chilled on the PDA and Ron actually cared (because I do agree that Ron did take advantage of her feelings towards the end). For all Lavender's faults, she showed obvious, consistent interest in Ron which is more than I can say for goddess Hermione. Ignoring the bickering aspect of the 'ship, Hermione never saw Ron's potential and constantly put him down - [[https://www.quora.com/Isnt-Hermione-somehow-harsh-to-Ron][see this link for more]]. If my crush complimented our mutual best friend, calling them 'fanciable' and 'scarred' and 'tall' when I'm all those things as well, I'd take that as a sign of disinterest.

If they had talked things out and made more of an effort, they could have gone somewhere. It's really sad that their relationship was played for laughs and so that Ron could become 'deserving' of Hermione.

***** Sorry I'm not about to see the link because i have the feeling it will lead to a character bashing post, but it's interesting to read a bit about someone else's ships and headcanons. Thank you for your time and the double explanation, the one i asked and the one you graciously offered me.
