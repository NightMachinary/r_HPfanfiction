Does the notice me not charm ever appear in canon? It feels like canon to me, but is that because it appears in practically every single fanfic?


** Fanon-developed, but there's enough basis in canon to support it. Thus, you'll never have a reader try to dispute it.

*** Indeed, something of the like (maybe not as powerful!) must exist in canon, otherwise people vanishing into walls (otherwise the plattform for the Hogwarts Express would not stay secret!) would be noticed, just like dingy little pubs accepting tons of people from outside and them not coming back out (or less people coming out)...also the Knight Bus! Damned, the noise it makes would draw a lot of attention!

** It's fanon. Canon does have the Muggle-Repelling Charm (Repello Muggletum) which /may/ be how the Leaky Cauldron is hidden, however this is not confirmed by any canon source.

*** Leaky Cauldron isn't hidden by a Muggle Repelling Charm, Hermione's parents took her to Diagon Alley. Harry, in Philosophers Stone, describes himself as not being able to perceive the Leaky Cauldron until Hagrid told him it was there. Harry is obviously not a Muggle.

***** Sort of. The only reason I think it isn't a Fidelius is because the Leaky Cauldron actually takes up real space instead of having it's location magically compacted to those without the secret. Like if you read OoTP, Harry's description of Number 12 coming to existence for him was very different than him suddenly noticing the pub.

** I'm rather surprised at the misinformation in some oc the other comments. The charm is definitely canon, though the name is fanon. Harry describes the Leaky Cauldron as being hidden from his perception until Hagrid told him it was there, while all the nearby Muggles were unable to perceive or notice it at all.

Philosopher's Stone:

#+begin_quote
  "This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place."

  It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.
#+end_quote

Harry is obviously not a Muggle, nor was he "repelled" from going near it, so it wasn't the Muggle Repelling Charm. It's a canon spell.

It's not clear, based on this line only, whether or not it affects everyone unless they are made aware of the object or area being hidden, or if it only affects muggles. Harry might have "not noticed it was there" solely because it seems rather unremarkable, not due a magical effect, whereas the nearby muggles clearly are affected by some sort of magic.

As an aside, I wonder how closely related it is to the Fidelius Charm. The effect seems similar, with the caveat being that in whatever effect is hiding the Leaky Cauldron, all those aware of the secret are themselves secret-keepers.

**** I don't think that's right. Harry makes it clear he didn't spot it until Hagrid said it was there, not that it was unremarkable and so he didn't see it (the Muggles missing it clearly aren't being repelled they really just couldn't see it). It doesn't really resemble the Fidelius to me since that seems to alter the world in some way, the space seems to expand to reveal the object once you have the secret.

But the Leaky Cauldron is explicitly said to occupy real space (Pottermore confirms this with a humorous remark about the blueprints of the surrounding businesses) and that those who don't know it's there simply have their gaze "slide" passed it in a way that prevents seeing it. As the Muggles aren't repelled and Harry doesn't seem to see it when they stop, it looks like he was affected by the charm too.

*** I think that's a huge leap to take.

Harry literally found out about magic about 12 hours ago. He has no idea what to expect.

The Leaky Cauldron is definitely charmed so only wizards can see it, but I always interpreted Harry having to have it pointed out to him as a quirk of the human brain, not some magic spell.

Can you see how maybe Harry may have missed a dingy old pub that no one else can see when the prospect of grandiose wonderful magic is all he can think about? There's no magic about /that/.

**** The problem is Harry missing the pub fell right in line with all the nearby Muggles missing it too. And as Hermione's parents brought her to the Leaky Cauldron to get her books in Diagon Alley, it's pretty clear you have to know the pub is there (Muggle or wizard) to see it otherwise how would they have found it? Or any Muggleborn, really.

**** I don't think so because the Fidelius removes the secret (usually a location) from the rest of space. The Grimmauld Place is described as literally expanding into existence while leaving even the homes directly adjoining each other unaware of the hidden location. Harry says that the Muggles had their gaze slide passed the pub, not that the pub was non existent to them. Pottermore confirms this manner of hiding the pub, pointing out that the blueprints for the two stores surrounding the Leaky Cauldron have an unexplained gap in them where the place is, which doesn't occur with a Fidelius.

***** I dunno- you can't map a Fidelius location, right? And the Death eaters eyes just sort of slid past where they knew the building should be.

And Harry didn't see the Leaky Cauldron until he was told about it- essentially the same as a Fidelius. The descriptive language is a little different, but it's a very similar effect.

** In my opinion, there seems to be 2 components to this:\\
The Canon: as others have said, when Harry and Hagrid first go to Diagon Alley, Harry does not notice the Leaky Cauldron without having it pointed out to him. The way he describes others- how their eyes "slide" from one store to the next means that they cannot perceive the pub. We also know that this magic is not strictly affecting Muggles OR Wizards; we can assume it might affect wizards less than muggles but that's speculation. We do know that Harry didn't notice it without having it pointed out to him. We also know that the next year, Hermione's parents (who are Muggles, of course) are able to get into Diagon Alley via the pub, so it's not a Muggle Repelling Charm, which we know to be canon.

The Fanon: People have extrapolated the above scenario into the "Notice-Me-Not Charm" the name of which is definitely fanon; the effects of said charm range from canon, to ridiculously overpowered, depending on the fic. Because the spell is never explicitly explained in the source material, different authors have extrapolated different power levels for this spell. Some of these are ludicrous, and as others have said, negate the use of spells like the Disillusionment Charm.

The way I view it, it seems likely that at least one of a few options in canon are true:

1. it's a spell similar to the Fidelius Charm, and can only be done on buildings.
2. It's a difficult spell. In fanon you see people using it constantly; if this were so easy to use, why didn't we see people using it all the time in canon?
3. The spell doesn't exist at all in canon.
4. We see the world through Harry's eyes and he hasn't come across the spell.

I think that it's probably some mixture of options 1, 2 and 4 and that it's a difficult spell, not as strong as the Fidelius, and also not something that Harry ever came across.

*** I think it's more akin to a weakened alternative to a Fidelius since the Fidelius actually completely hides the location (even the space it occupies) from those without the secret, while the NMN only prevents others from seeing it while still leaving the space occupied. Pottermore says that the space the pub is in is verifiable on blueprints for the nearby businesses; there's a gap no one can explain. I doubt it can be used on people, however there's one thing neither of us considered:

The Knight Bus. It eludes Muggle attention and perception as well, and is very mobile. So it might be applicable elsewhere. But in terms of usefulness in duels I doubt it's good. Since your opponent presumably knows you're there, the NMN would be broken if Harry's experience is anything (it broke as soon as he was told the pub was there, seemingly).

** The all encompassing mega-stealth solution for all your detection and non-detection needs that the Notice-Me-Not is in so much fanfiction, is fanon. Worse, its often a very apparent lack of creativity. If an author can't think of a creative way to get his character to stealth through somewhere and only uses the "lol nobody notices me now after this simple swish of my wand - /problem solved/", I'd have very little confidence in the rest of the story.

What is canon, however, are many different charms that do different things, and combined or for specific scenarios or targets, they can produce the effect of the Notice-Me-Not.

Excerpt from the Goblet of Fire.

  “Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face. “Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.

  “But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise. “Everyone knows that . . . well, everyone who's read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”

  “Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on --- how d'you hide a place like Hogwarts?”

  “It's bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger, do not enter, unsafe.”

  “So Durmstrang'll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?”

  “Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have Mugglerepelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they'll have made it Unplottable ---”
