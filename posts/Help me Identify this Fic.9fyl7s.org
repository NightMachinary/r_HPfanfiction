Can't remember anything about it other than a scene involving Draco's badges during Goblet of Fire. The badges flashed to a bunch of different things insulting Draco, including things along the lines of:

"support the Malfoy parents, the shame is overwhelming"

"Draco Malfoy, amateur wizard"

etc. Thanks in advance for the help, not being able to remember is driving me crazy!

I was annoyed that I literally read this two days ago and couldn't remember the fic, then I realized I could just google your first quote and find it instantly.

*** D'oh, my Google skills must be weak, because that's exactly what I tried first, but I included "Goblet of Fire" which makes it not show up. Thanks!

**** no problemo, I'd only have been annoyed if I couldn't successfully search up the fic since it would have bugged me for ages after. I think you know the feeling!
