**** Well, they tortured both him and Snape using Muggle means in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929). But I made up the second part.

***** I actually remember a fanfiction where Draco was tortured by muggle means, which involved breaking his fingers and then forcing them back together jo so they could do it again next day, at the end Draco dies and becomes one of Hogwart's ghosts Maybe i mixed up different fics, but IIRC, this was from a fanfiction called Cruciamentum Eternus

#+begin_quote
  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist).

Torturing fellow students as a firstie. Using swords and healing afterwards is a bit bothersome, might learn Crucio later.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
