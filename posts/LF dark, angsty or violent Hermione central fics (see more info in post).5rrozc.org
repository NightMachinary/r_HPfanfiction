I'm looking for fics that are:

- Dark
- Violent
- Angsty

I don't mind torture, death or non-con. (Though I'm not interested in non-con between the main pairing. That's Stockholm syndrome, not love.) I don't want ANY fics with a relationship between an underage Hermione (under 18) and an adult. Hermione must either be 18+ or there must be time travel involved in some way.

Pairings I like:

- Draco x Hermione
- Lucius x Hermione
- Sirius x Hermione
- Remus x Hermione
- Severus x Hermione
- Theo x Hermione
- Blaise x Ginny

No WIP's or abandoned fics please. Just completes. :)

*** It's a complete fic, epilogue compliant (but Ron is barely mentioned) fic that is a vengeful monologue/revenge on Ginny for reasons. Oneshot.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

** linkffn(Fervidity) Very dark and violent and has quite a bit of smut later on. Edit: Just read your note that you want completed fics only, you can just ignore this then since it looks like this fic is on Hiatus

*** Fervidity is an interesting one. It's delightfully un-angsty, and yet, it kind of goes off the deep end, kind of how porn often puts weird contrivances into the plot in order to facilitate sex of the kind they want to show (or so I heard <_< ). My summary (from a while ago):

- More-BAMF-than-canon!Hermione who is still recognizable: Cool.
- Poses as Snape's illegitimate daughter to help subvert Death Eaters from within: Interesting.
- Gets challenged by Bellatrix, fights, actually pulls off a win with a curse she had invented, and only spares her because Voldemort orders it: Cool.
- Builds a reputation and develops relationships (positive and negative) with members of the Death Eater inner circle, making moral compromises along the way: Cool.
- Is not a blushing virgin (Ron having been her first): Good.
- Oh, and she learns that despite HPverse being far more egalitarian than Muggle and for much longer, and despite women in HPverse not being disadvantaged in matters of violence as they are in real life, Death Eaters have these mandatory monthly "revels" that involve participating in, and I'll phrase this as mechanistically as possible, group sex in which the female DEs must serve as bottoms to multiple partners whom they do not necessarily choose, and nor are the female DEs given control over the mode and style of the intercourse; and where a surprising number of male DEs avail themselves of this opportunity to inflict abuse, apparently unafraid of retribution and heedless of the fact that the next day, they have to rely on those very women to have their backs in battle: NOPE.

#+begin_quote
  *HIATUS*When Hermione Granger is caught by Snape she must fake her death and assume a new identity and appearance as the illegitimate daughter of Severus Snape. Going by the name Mina Graziana-Snape, Hermione must navigate this new world where she's rubbing shoulders with Death Eaters, forced to participate in revels, marked as a Death Eater herself and balancing light and dark.

** I always liked linkffn(Broken by inadaze22) and linkffn(As Certain Dark Things are to be Loved by somuchcloser).

I would also check out olivieblake and colubrina's works - I stay away from the excessively dark stuff so there's a few I haven't brought myself to read yet. If you're okay with Tomione, for example, I've heard linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina) is VERY dark.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

  Dark Magic changes a person. What lines do you cross to kill Voldemort? What do you give up? How do you live afterwards? Dark, some sex & torture. Hermione-centric story; slowly develops into Dramione. The wait is worth it. 1 yr post Battle of Hogwarts.
