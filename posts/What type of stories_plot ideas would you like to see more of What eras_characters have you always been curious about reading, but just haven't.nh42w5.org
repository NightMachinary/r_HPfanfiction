I'd love to see more Order Missions, oddball team ups, etc.

I'd love to see more Auror missions that aren't Harry focused. More for Tonks, Kingsley and Moody and the like.

I'd love to see more stories where Sirius lives and where Sirius living really affects the plot.

I'd love to see more stories focused on Death Eaters and even Snatchers and other bad guy characters.


** I always try to get my hands on any Professor!Harry fics. They're criminally underrated and few in number. Seriously though, suggest if you know any!

In the same vein I want to read fics where Harry isn't an auror and has instead chosen an interesting new occupation. Quidditch Player Harry! Traveler Harry! No Real Job Harry, even!

  ‚ÄúYou understand, Professor,‚Äù Harry began, after a moment, ‚Äúthat I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain.

** As a genre I'd say espionage.

There's lots of room in an espionage setting. Can make it a fun romp a la Roger Moore era Bond or a more gritty action pace of Craig/Dalton Bond or Bourne with lots of tradecraft and action. Also room for moral ambiguity as well, say there's a wizard running a trafficking ring of magical creatures that Harry's been tasked to a kill/capture order, but his handlers order him to stand down because said wizard has intelligence on an upstart dark lord type. What does Harry do given his "saving people nature", go after him anyways or investigate the nature of why he's being told to stand down?

** I absolutely second espionage. There's so much fascinating potential in spycraft with magic.

I'd also add in Cosmic Horror - mainly because I adore that stuff anyway, but I have seen it work real well with Harry Potter.

Would also enjoy more esoteric magic - the Department of Mysteries, X-Files type stuff. :)

And finally, Cursebreaking. For what's basically globetrotting Indiana Jones action, Cursebreaking is really not a widely used genre and that disappoints me. Even the 'Cursebreakers are the trainspotting anoraks of the Wizarding World' interpretation of them would be something I'd like to see more of.

And era/place-wise, I'd like to see more originality and distance from the 20th and 21st centuries. What are wizards in Ancient Greece like, or witches in magical china? What will the wizarding world be like in two hundred years?

** I'd like some more major overhaul AUs. Or maybe some more teen or young adult Harry being dragged into a different world(like crossover/original/somewhere away from magical england). I think I'm just so tired of reading about purebloods and muggleborns. So very tired of lordships and politics.

** So I have a few ideas, I'm trying to formulate into a story that I've discussed before. In terms of era, I feel there is enough material from canon or supplementary to make a satisfying historical fiction story, like the goblin wars or pre founders story.

I'd kinda like to see a Young Dumbledore story, around the time of the death of his mother, meeting Gellert, and culminating in the death of Ariana. An interesting character study, but also exploring the relationship between Ariana and Aberforth.

Secondary to this, because I'm bored of the traditional three time travel settings; Marauder's Era, Riddle era, and founders era.

A time travel story that sends Harry back to Dumbledore's youth, to help prevent the rise of Grindelwald as, in this plot, it directly facilitated the rise of Voldemort. This would also possibly include Harry meeting and/or living with his namesake and expanding those characters but possibly also a sort of Boy/girl next door friendship/romance with Ariana. Idk its a loose idea.

** I'd really like to see more Unspeakable!Harry stories.

It would also be nice to see more of other canon characters going back in time to change things other than the usual Hermione and Harry. So far, I've only come across a few Ron, Percy, Padma/Parvati, Regulus, Sirius, Snape and Lily ones.

I'm also a big fan of Professor Harry fanfics as well and I'd like to see more of older Harry interacting heavily with the Black family (again time travel).

** - Tom Riddle, whether older or teenager, helps Harry in some way

- Older Tom Riddle adopts Harry (not necessarily as a kid but as a teenager)

- Percy and Oliver friendship fics. Whether multi chapter or one shot. Most of their fics are them being paired together and I don't like the pairing

- Percy being a good big brother to his siblings and Harry in some way

** 1) I would love to read a quality AU post war story about Harry the gruff adventurer/monster slayer, who comes to Hogwarts to teach DADA ten years after the end of the war. McGonagall, while very fond of Harry, is almost going insane because of Harry's teaching methods, and generally easy going attitudes.

Harry slowly chips away at McG's stony exterior and they eventually begin a very passionate relationship. Mind you, mages live for a /very/ long time in this AU, so the age difference isn't that much of an issue.

2) We need more quality non smut Harry/Tonks and Harry/Fleur.

3) A proper story where Hedwig turns out to be a woman under a curse, which Harry somehow discovers after the war, and he goes globetrotting to find a way to counter the curse.

Edit: 4) A noirish detective story, featuring Harry the PI, and Narcissa Black as the femme fatale, and perhaps Tonks as the other possible love interest. Points for being pulpy.

These ideas aren't the most original, and I'm a hopeless romantic, so I absolutely prefer my stories with a pairing üôÇ

I would also like a marauder era fic not focusing on the marauders. Maybe Benjy Fenwick or Dorcas meadows could be the central character.
