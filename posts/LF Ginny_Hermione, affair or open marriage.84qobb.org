Actually i want to read Fics fic Hermione feels the attraction about kissing a Girl/Woman. She asks Ginny (can be any other Woman) and she accepts it. Should be Epiluge Complaint and either they are having an Affair or with the Knowledge of Harry and Ron.


** This one! It's a Hermione/Ginny story

*** Wow, finally a rec. Thank you! Now thats a very long Fic. Can you maybe the chapters with the "Hot" passages? I know it might be a built-up process, but it would be good to have a View about when to start for the Epilogue-thing.

**** It's a long time since I read it, it was literally my first fic! It's a very good story in general and definitely worth the read
