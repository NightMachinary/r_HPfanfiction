  After the war Harry Potter is once again sacrificed for the public's peace of mind, and is locked away in Azkaban on his eighteenth birthday. Four years later, he is visited by the British Government and offered freedom in exchange for his unique views and skills. Armed with his new identity, Harry is released into Muggle London and pointed towards the nearest corpse.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) he's an auror, he really should have seen the signs earlier but he was busy with the Crouch case, as soon as he's assigned to the Night Nargle case he deduces the identities of the thieves with just some bushy brown cat hairs...

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
