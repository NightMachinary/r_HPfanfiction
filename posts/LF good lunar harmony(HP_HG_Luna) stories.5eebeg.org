*** I wouldn't read crack'd mirror because of the pairing, but because it's ridiculously funny crack. The part with Snape being tasked by Dumbledore to disrupt the ritual at any cost is still one of the funniest things I've ever read.

I mean, Robst is on there like 4 times. Faery Heroes is decent but does involve some pretty awkward Ron bashing... as in (iirc) they kill 11 year old him for things older him did. Or something like that. You might be able to narrow it down with variations of HH/HG/LL in the search bar as most such fics advertise it in the summary.

*** Isn't Faery Heroes the one where they [[/spoiler][killed Ron because he dosed Hermione with a love potion-memory eraser potion, after they came back? I'm pretty sure that he, as a Death Eater himself, came back as well, but most of his memories were lost, and he only associated what he did remember with a dark interpretation of Harry, while he believed himself to be light]].

It's not the best story out there, but it's not the worst, either. It's certainly good enough if one is willing to overlook whatever bashing there is. After all, bashing is inherent to most stories, and it's only a minority of the longer ones that both avoid some form of bashing, and are actually good enough to read - i.e., I mean a story that has a good, memorable concept, clean grammar and spelling, and doesn't just shoot itself in the gut with poor reasoning, pacing, or overused clich√©s.

What's the general phrase that leads every TVTropes fanfic recommendation page? "Proof that only 10% of this fandom is worth reading."? In my experience, only about 10% of that 10% actually avoids unreasonable bashing of some form, without actually building the characters up to that point first, while still being memorable. Even then, the authors who do put the effort in to explain just how and why "Ron becomes a Death Eater", or something of the like, in a reasonable example of character progression are still generally memorable.

**** Before I answer your question, I noticed your account is newish, so here's some tips. The reddit formatting is different than phpBB/other forum formatting you're used to. Links look like this: =[Link Text](http://www.url.com 'hover text')= and is how we do spoilers here by doing =[hidden text](/spoiler 'hover text')= [[/spoiler][hidden text]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/][Here's a really good resource for the rest of the reddit formatting.]]

As for Faery Heroes, I don't recall Ron coming back, but he did dose her with a potion. I completely agree with you analysis of the fic.

*** They don't kill 11 year old Ron for something his older version did; they kill 16 year old Ron for something he did himself.

**** Must have been something of robsts I was thinking of. In my defence, i haven't read any of his stuff since about chapter 10 of Harry crow and followed Faery Heroes from roughly the end of 2013 til it was concluded and haven't picked it up since.
