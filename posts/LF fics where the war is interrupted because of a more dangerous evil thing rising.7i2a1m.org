** I saw one where the war against Voldemort was thoroughly interrupted by mass EMPs going off throughout the whole world, because of a magically-assisted terrorist attack.

But I didn't like it because of the goblins being too obnoxious and wandlore taking up too much space and stuff, it just turned into Super!Harry Gets A Mansion rather than really focusing on the trouble Muggles were in.

** So I've read one that sort of fits what you're looking for, but not exactly. Harry and Voldemort switch bodies, which at first is the main focus, but then there is a muggle militia that starts attacking magical villages so they call a truce and this is the focus for the rest. I just looked it up and it eventually becomes Snarry, but IIRC, they don't really focus much on that. linkffn(5118649)

*** Thanks ! If the pairing is too detailed I'll just skip the bits that don't interest me, I'm in it for the plot and it sounds interesting. Thanks again !

  How much of what you are depends on your environment? If everything changed, who would you become? Harry Potter is about to find out. If it would save everything he loved, could he become a Dark Lord?

** Have you read Hayseed's "Getting the Hang Of Thursdays"? It's Hermione/Snape light, but deals with a time loop trapping Hogwarts and the war being affected by it.

**** You're welcome! Leraiv Snape's Forbidden Fruit series might also be sort of what you're going for in terms of something bigger than the war taking importance alongside the war and is Hermione/Snape. Unfortunately she's never finished the (I think necessary) sequel "Paradise Lost" :(

*** If that's the one I'm thinking of, /damn/ that was depressing. Time loops can be great when done well and this one was fantastic - but not in the way I normally look for. (In my opinion, of course, and the major examples I remember aren't HP - Mother of Learning linkfp(2961893) is a fantastic original fiction and Time Braid linkffn(5193644) wasn't bad either)
