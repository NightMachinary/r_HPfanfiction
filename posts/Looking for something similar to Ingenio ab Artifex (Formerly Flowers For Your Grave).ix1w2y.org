Title pretty much

Just happened upon this fic (hugely underrated, really deserves more recs - can't believe it's the first time I've seen it linked on the reddit), but yeah, devoured it, loved it, want more. I've already read most of the Harry/Fleur pairings on fanfiction but in case I've missed anything, or on AO3 since I don't explore that as much. Wondering if there are some other fics similar to this, in writing style if not storyline.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography. For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.

** I'd recommend removing the bot link. It's technically a violation of rule 8, the content being as suggestive as it is and Harry being a minor and all. Also, if you haven't seen the thread, I'd recommend reposting this request on [[/r/harryandfleur][r/harryandfleur]].

Lie I've Lived is the obvious rec here, given the intense similarities.

If you like that style of character, Wastelands of Time is very, very similar. Flawed guy, beat-poet style subculture, bit musical (though mostly quoting and humming along in Wastelands rather than playing), etc. Also has some of him working through some mental health stuff too. Don't go in expecting Harry Potter though. It's basically a different story and setting slammed repeatedly into the Harry Potter universe until bits stopped falling off, then the cracks get pasted over with Kerouacian swagger. I don't remember him going near Hogwarts once in the entire fic.

Are there any particular things you liked more specifically than the writing style - style of Harry's character, the ship, the development of the ship, any plot elements, etc? It might help narrow down some more stuff.

*** Whoops. Didn't know that lol, I'll get rid of it.

And yup I've actually already read both of those already haha, great reads for sure.

The style of Harry's character for sure, too many "OP" Harry stories just send him straight into godmode without him really having to work at it, this strikes a nice balance with that I think. The ship is also fairly well done, though I think it's more a byproduct of Harry's character than the ship itself.

**** Yeah. Not a definite violation, but better safe than banned. Apparently since it's only direct links that are against reddit rules, you can link to the profile and just name the story. For future reference. :)

Hmm, okay. That narrows it down nicely, thanks. I've definitely got some stuff I've read that fits that, I just have to check if I've sorted it back into my category folders yet or if it's still in the unsorted mass. I'll get back to you ASAP. :)

Have you read When a Veela Cries? Would that kind of Harry fit your request too? It definitely has a good power-build journey, I'm just checking the character. :)

If you haven't read it and don't like the first chapters, do keep reading. There's a strong tonal change once Harry gets to France and the introductory events are a rather dramatic way to sever Harry from his old life that isn't really referenced much after that point either. It gets really good in and after France though. :)

  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
