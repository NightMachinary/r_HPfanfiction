A lot of the time I see Hermione written as good at theory but less strong at the practical side of things. I wonder if that comes down to her one bad DaDa exam in POA?

I always imagine Hermione as quite a creative duelist or fighter due to her general aptitude, research to find new spells, and quick thinking, but I haven't seen this kind of Hermione in many stories (Hogwarts Battle School would be a notable exception).

I don't mind what pairings (or none), what age the characters are or how AU it is.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Well, there's a counter argument to what you think (and it's something that does appear in fanfiction, too):

Hermione is not great in thinking on the spot (think about the Devil's Snare in the first book...she knows fire can harm it but thinks about damned matches instead if using her wand until someone (I think it was Ron) that she's a witch!) and about which spell to use (as several might work in a certain situation...that's something where her broad spell knowledge is more of a problem than a gift! Harry has it easier: He will use the few spells he knows well and otherwise will dodge and weave and use his agility to his advantage!)

As for a fanfiction with a great and fighting Hermione?

I'd have said: Dangerous by Blacklotus (it was on GrangerEnchanted, but I don't know if the site still exists...clicking on the link from Google didn't work ("Problem loading page"))...maybe someone has that backed up?

Note: That one wasn't finished, but it wasn't bad IMHO, the plot would be:

Harry left after defeating Voldemort (he couldn't handle living in Britain anymore) and when he returns the Ministry (and others!) tell him that Hermione has become a terrorist (which is true, she's taken fighting for the equality of Muggleborns to lethal levels!)

**** look.. I liked it. it's fan fiction. if you want literature.. try a bookstore or a library. the request was for Hermione as a good fighter/duelist. The story fits the bill. Moby Dick was written by Melville, lots of good stuff in there, give it a try.

** linkffn(10070079): Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but this one delves deeply into spell creation and arithmancy (duh). She's not a conventional duellist, but she whips up spells on the fly on multiple occasions due to insane mathematical skills and is generally extremely creative when it comes to magic.
