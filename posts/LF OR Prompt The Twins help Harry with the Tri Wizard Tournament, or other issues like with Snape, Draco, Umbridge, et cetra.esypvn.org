As it says. I love the Weasley twins, and feel like they're often just used for comedic use, even though they're both very smart, given their creativity, and ability to create things/think out of the box.

Also, I'd rather have very little twin speak, doing it occasionally is fine, but doing it every single chapter normally kills it for me.

I'd like to imagine them helping Ron, Harry and Hermione out, if they ever did ask for their help. It could be for something minor, or major.

Maybe the older years also join in to help, like Angelina, Alicia, Katie, Lee and such, or maybe not. Not too picky on that.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, No Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy, et cetra.

No Draco/Hermione

Can be on ANY Site.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.


** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Jeconais' Hogwarts Dawn]] fulfills most of the requests. I personally like the fic, but it does require you to accept some absurdities. It also hasn't been updated since 2014, but it has 186k words.
