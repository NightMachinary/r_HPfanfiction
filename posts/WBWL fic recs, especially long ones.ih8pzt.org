I'm very interested in stories where Harry is sent to the Dursleys - or elsewhere - while his brother is kept because "he's the Boy-Who-Lived!" or where Harry is kept but his parents neglect or even mistreat him in favor of his brother.

I'm especially a fan of the second where his brother is older and tries to take care of Harry, and the former where they have an incredibly antagonistic relationship (Prince of Slytherin by TSM is probably my favorite story ever).

Can I get some good recs please? Slash, het, gen, anything is fine. No fem!Harry though.


** I haven't read either of these but I frequently see them recommended:

linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) and linkffn(Saving Connor)

** Sarcasm & Slytherin series on ao3 is really good! I started reading it right after finishing PoS to get over the withdrawal symptoms lol.
