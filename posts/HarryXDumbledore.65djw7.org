*** He never says /which/ Dumbledore. Could be Aberforth, who is like, three or four years younger than Albus. Or Ariana, through time travel/Resurrection Stone shenanigans. Or going for Hyborean Age-old with the Kendra or Percival Dumbledore options.

** My favorite (though the only one I've ever read) Harry/Albus is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4847537/1/Ephemeral_Time][this one right here]]. It is unfinished though. And hasn't been updated in like 4 years afdsfads.

Doesn't detract from the great read it was, though.
