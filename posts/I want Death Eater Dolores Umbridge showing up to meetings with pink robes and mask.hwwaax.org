Suggestions would be cool too. I couldn't find any and I'm surprised no one's written a Death Eater crack fic with this very scenario.

Like, how would any Death Eater or Voldemort himself tell her she needs to stick to their dress code without completely losing all their dignity?

I need this in my life guys

  Why are all the Death Eaters acting so strange around Voldemort today? Just a little humorous oneshot, so not to be taken seriously!

** In an effort to retain some form of anonymity, the Death Eater dress code is altered thusly:

1. A Death Eater is required to wear robes and a mask comprised of ONE and only ONE Primary, Secondary , or black, if you prefer.

Death Eaters are thusly completely flabbergasted when they show up to Diagon Alley in said robes, in order to mayhem when they find themselves cheered on by the Muggleborn and more than one Death Eater is left wondering what sort of spell "Go go Power Rangers!" is and why it doesn't appear to be working and why Voldemort has seemingly gained the moniker "Zordon"

*** "Um, my Lord..." Lucious Malfoy squirmed internally. He detested being the one to bring this up to the Dark Lord attention, but knew that letting the issue be, not correcting it before the next meeting, or what's worse, a raid, may end up way worse.

"What is it, Luciouss?" Voldemort look down his n-... /looked down at/ his underling magnanimously.

"I must inquire about one of our newest recruits... Namely, about Dolores Umbridge attire."

"What's wrong with her attire?" the Dark Lord looked honestly puzzled. "And why are you bringing this up to me?"

"Ah- it's-" Lucious floundered. What's wrong? WHAT'S WRONG? /It is pink, my Lord./ He did not voice the obvious.

Voldemort was still looking at him piercingly.

Lucious feld cold sweat carving it's way down his back. He was missing something.

"It's nothing, my Liedge... Really nothing."

****** /Hogwarts, the last battle/

"You already lost, Voldemort! Everyone stood up here today to fight you. We even got your right hand woman, Dolores Umbridge!"

Voldemort's angry snarl melted into puzzled frown. That name... It jogged something in his memory but he honestly couldn't tell what Potter was nattering about.

"What?"

"To be honest she wasn't hard to spot... Those bright pink robes...

"WHAT."

"Every student she taugh honed on it like bees to honey..."

Voldemort felt like his last brain cell sputtered and died. His Death Eater. Was wearing. Pink. And, apperently, was killed because they through the color was the insignia of power. Which... just NO.

Oh how he wish for that Dolores Umbridge, whomever she was, however she /dared/, to live, so he could torture her to oblivion and beyond...

His face must bore truly horryfing expression because Potter halted in his recounting.

"... So yeah, she's very dead." he ended lamely.

Voldemort skreethed in outrage. Harry took it as a sigh to resume their duel.

*** I just don't see Voldemort making a reference to it. He's supposed to be this lofty figure, and it would not look good for the overall image he's trying to cultivate. My opinion, anyway.

But even if he does do this, (“Dolores, that color gravely offends Lord Voldemort's sensibilities,”) I'd like to see a crack fic of her first meeting and everybody's reactions to the pink.
