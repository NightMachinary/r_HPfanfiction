They can be 18, 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's or so on. I just want stories with the main characters as adults.

Can be Marauder's Era, Golden Trio Era, Next Gen Era or any other kind of Era.

No Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's please.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco Hermione. But am fine with any other pairing from Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but constantly updated is fine.

Can be Canon or Not Canon


** Grow Young With Me recently updated. Harry is widowed and raising his three children, but struggling without Ginny, and then a quirky, clumsy, funny girl pulls him out of his shell and brings light back into his life.

  Amazing banner by Carnal Spiral at TDA

  Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in a battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world they worked so hard to build.

  The centenary of the Battle of Hogwarts is less than a year away, and the Wizarding world continues to move forward. Modernisation requires change, and some things must be swept aside in the name of progress. Buildings can be demolished and statues, even statues of deceased heroes like Harry Potter, can be relocated. Can't they? Hubert Dalrymple has a problem.

Technically isn't all fanfiction not canon? If you want canon then you have the seven original books.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** There's the Albus Potter Series by Vekin87, a complete series of 7 books that start right after the epilogue. Very good stuff, feels very much like the canon books IMO.

EDIT: Whoops, didn't completely read that, Harry and crew aren't the main characters, so it's probably not what you're looking for.

**** It starts right after the epilogue and Albus Potter's the main character, so adults aren't really the focus other than how they relate to Albus' perspective.

*** Note: obviously the bot wouldn't link my stories because it hates me.

I'm always scared to recommend fics I've read years ago. I started reading fanfiction about 10 years ago when I was 12, so my history is full of unspeakable fics... So I'm afraid that my standards were much lower (but today they're way too high, it makes up for it!).

I think they were adults, it at least started at the lady year of Hogwarts...

Linkffn(Somewhere in Time by Serpent In Red)

*Not a Tomione*

The next has only adults, and is an all time favourite (I'm a total sucker for closed time loops). Who knew this ship works so well?

Linkffn(choices by random-fruitcake04)

Are you interested in the one where Tom Riddle ends in the end of 1990's and starts the death eaters with Hermione, Harry, Luna, etc, etc...? I think it's:

Linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina)

When it's Colubrina, you can know it'll be damn good. She has some that are not Dramione, give her a check. (If she's a he, I'm deeply sorry).
