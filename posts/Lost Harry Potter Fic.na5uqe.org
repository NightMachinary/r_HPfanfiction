:END:
Hey so I read this hp fic a couple of years ago and I've been thinking about it and trying to find it again to no avail. If anyone can help me or direct me to a sub that would be better for this, I will take anything.

Here's a list of the stuff I can remember (some of the details are really random lol):

- Harry/Draco, Super evil Dumbledore, Ron bashing
- Harry mpreg - it happens on his birthday by accident, basically there was an old Potter/Malfoy gay couple who did a ritual on their line so they could be pregnant whenever a Potter/Malfoy came together - theres like this old picture that they find with one of them in a car (i think?) and they can see the belly through the window
- Harry uses this belt that hides his pregnant belly, and one day hes in the library massaging his stomach and ron spys on him, then passes the info to dumbledore
- Pretty sure draco and lucius are on good terms, pretty sure the belt was given to harry by narcissa
- I think that harry and draco were somehow not living in the dorms for some reason, can't remember why
- Its definitely not a creature fic or ABO
- It's also on AO3

I know it's not much to go off, but if anyone could help me that would be greatly appreciated. If anyone wants to know something else, I can try to see if i can answer to clarify. Thanks :)
