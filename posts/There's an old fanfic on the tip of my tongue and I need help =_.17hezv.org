Ok so I'm remembering an old (pre-OoTP I believe) fanfic that I remember as being pretty good. The biggest details that stick out to me are that it was Harry/Ginny, Sirius was alive and being a father figure, and in one scene (around Christmas time I think, so about halfway in) the gang was invited to an Irish Ceilidh dance. I vividly remember them interacting with McGonagall at the dance, discussing tartans. That's all I can really remember, other than the sense that I really enjoyed it when I read it all those years ago. Does it sound familiar to anyone?


** I searched 'Harry Ginny tartan Ceilidh' and came up with this, which is quite old and seems to fit most of your description: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/24/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]]

*** Yes! That's exactly the one! Thank you so much, I don't know why my similar searches didn't come up with it... You've taken a load off my mind.

***** It acts like a regular old "oh this happens because shitty reasons" fic at the beginning, but then subverts it all halfway through. It's not the best out there, but it's damn good. Also, it's complete. And has a completed sequel. Since the comment you replied to, I've finished about 80% of it. I honestly can't remember what happens next because it's been years.
