Only ever read one where he's a Nundu Animagus, and it was so boring the way it was portraied, so I'm curious for another. Just pls, no Slash


** Hermione blinked. "Harry?"

Harry groaned. "Did anyone get the plate on that lorry?"

"Harry... do you know what you've been for the past five minutes?"

"Some sorta cat thing, right?"

"You were a Nundu, Harry. A /Nundu/."

Harry's eyebrows raised. "Huh. That's cool."

"COOL? YOUR ANIMAGUS FORM IS THE LITERAL MOST DEADLY CREATURE ON THE PLANET AND IT'S COOL?"

"Yeah. Hey, do you think Dumbledore would mind if I went and ate Voldemort now?"

"THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! WHAT HAS THIS WORLD COME TO?"

"I think I should go talk to Hagrid. He'd probably be really excited."

"HOW DO YOU KEEP DOING THESE THINGS? WHAT EVEN ARE YOU, HARRY?"

Harry looked at her like she was an idiot. "A Nundu animagus...?"

"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"

One of my favourite fics because of the romance in it is "The Legacy". Super slow burn but more realistic because of it, at least in that particular situation.
