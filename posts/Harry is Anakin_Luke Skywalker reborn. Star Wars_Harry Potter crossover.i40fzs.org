** "So," said the Goddess, smiling a terrible and knowing smile, "I ask you this - who is the one who is prophesied? His mother died because of a Dark Lord while his father screamed about betrayal from a best friend. He was sent to his aunt and uncle who did their best, their very best, to keep the boy grounded, /normal/ - but the boy dreamt of flying and thought of school as an escape from the grinding labor of his days. The old man with the white beard told the boy about his power, but he did not tell the boy the whole truth. He gave the boy an item of incredible power, an heirloom from his father, which the boy treasured. Secretly, he had plans for the boy. Beside the boy was the clever girl and the best friend who did seem to abandon him in a moment of greatest need - but he came back. The Dark Lord tormented the boy, but drew his notice to how very alike the two of them were - what similarities they shared. So which of you two am I speaking of?"

Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter stared at her.

"Trick question! The answer is both!" she cheered.

"Also in the books you end up married to a redhead," she added.

**** +And the stuff that comes after the original ending is stupid.+

Seriously though, a reincarnation fic would be interesting. I have actually played with the concept (for Luke, not Anakin) a bit. Especially if Harry is reborn while some OT Star Wars characters are still alive...

** There was one with the opposite premise; Anakin was Harry reborn, but it was unfortunately deleted.

**** Is this from /Tardisistheonlywaytogo/. I Think that is the authors name but I can't be sure

Ginny is Padme. She's glad to see him but they get into this huge fight after she learns about Leia being tortured. Anakin gets angry over house elves

** The closest one I recall is the excellent and ongoing /Balancing The Scales/ by Nemesis13. /Harry/ isn't the reincarnate though, rather:

Blurb: At the start of KOTOR I, Darth Revan and Bastilla end up Negative Space Wedgied to Earth when Harry is around six, almost literally stumble across him (because force), and immediately adopt him.

Spoiler as to who the reincarnate is (it's a few chapters in): Lily's Protection was some ancient, dark ritual Lily Potter invoked that more or less sacrificed her soul to Magic/the Force to do with as it pleased in return for saving Harry. She was reborn in the distant past as the woman who would become Darth Revan. Darth Revan wants to hug her son and murder idiots, and her son is currently napping.

In fact, I'm going to go reread it right now.

A second ongoing fic (that is updated far more frequently) is /Of Clones and Wizards/, by Zirakinbar. This one also is not a reincarnation fic, rather a nasty interaction with the Mirror of Erised drags Harry into the middle of the Clone Wars. It is of particular note because Harry only has a first-year education, so he has to get /really/ creative with what he knows, unlike many other crossovers where he's older, more savvy, and tossing complex wards and powerful spells around left and right.
