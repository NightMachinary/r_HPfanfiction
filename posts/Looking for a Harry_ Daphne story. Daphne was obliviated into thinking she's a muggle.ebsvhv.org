I read this some time ago and didn't favourite it. Harry was looking for Daphne and accidentally found her working in a cafe. I remember later they were at Daphne's apartment and Harry sees her wand displayed on the fireplace, but Daphne tells him it's just a toy and there is no magic. I think they were in a relationship previously, but someone kidnapped Daphne and obliviated her and stopped her from using magic. So Harry went looking for her.


** You are thinking of the epilogue to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7]].

*** Ah, thanks. I've no idea why my mind just jumped straight to the epilogue, but that's it.

**** Probably because the epilogue is better than the rest of the fic

***** Honestly, it reads better if you treat the first eighteen chapters as an abandoned fic and the epilogues as a separate story.
