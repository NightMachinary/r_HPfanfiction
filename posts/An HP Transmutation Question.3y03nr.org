I'm probably asking too much of magic when I want it to make sense, but I'm writing a fanfic that will be demanding that magic do just that:

There's that pesky rule that you can't make gold without the philosopher's stone. What makes gold specifically such a special snowflake aside from the historical failures of real life "alchemists" to transmute it?

Would it be fair to say, that instead of the actual rule being 'no transmuting gold' it's actually 'no transmuting elements above X?' and Gold was the one people cared about enough to make a proper discovery of it?

IFF that's reasonable, would it then be reasonable to set X as Iron? AKA the element where stars start to lose energy on the deal instead of gain it? This would then explain the Wizarding currency system if NONE of the metals their coins are made of can be magically produced except by using a sorceror/philosopher's stone which is apparently the magical equivalent of a controlled supernova.


** I was trying to think of a good chemistry-based reason for the transmuting issue when a thought occurred to take a more thematic approach, as magic often does.

Transmuting may in some sense depend on previously-Vanished materials to make replacement matter in certain patterns. Finding leftover animal carcasses, broken furniture and blocks of collapsed wall would be relatively easy, but who in their right mind would Vanish gold or silver? Or even steel? As rare as many elements are in nature, they would be doubly rare in the Vanished stockpile for being valued.

That's the thought, anyway.

** You are assuming that magic works with hard rules. It does not. All evidence suggests magic works poetically towards an end goal, it does not have one single effect.

You are also assuming that Chemistry is valid. It is not. J.K Rowling stated that magic bypasses 'mundane nature' (Physics, Chemistry, ect.).

Magic is limited only by magical rules which is why it takes the same amount of effort to magically levitate a feather as a Troll's club. Mass does not limit levitation.

It is therefore reasonable to state that the number of nucleons in an atom has no effect on the ease or possibility of transfiguration or transmutation, rather Gold, and the other substances mentioned in Gamp's law have a /magical/ property that prevents transfiguration.

So how does magic define Food (also mentioned in Gamp's law)? It does not do it with any Physical or Chemical property but once again with a Magical property that identifies that it is food.

*** On Gamp's law I have several thoughts, but specific to the food question; there's something about living things that when consumed becomes spiritually sustaining. Conjured food or food transfigured from never-living things would lack that quality of being spiritually satiating. The end result is that conjured or transfigured food may fill your belly but steals away sustenance.

This may also explain Twinkies.

Either its not a pig, but rather a flesh-golem type being that has no nutritional value (Or perhaps the nutritional value of eating a desk) Or there's some additional trait of [FOOD] that the pig would lack such as what you described which is very possible in a world where souls aren't just real but something you can interact with meaningfully.

You can eat it (it won't revert to something terrible in your stomach) but it's not a sustainable cornucopia. Alternately, the duplication may be drawing other nutritionally equivalent supplies from the Vanish-space to make up the difference. I'm not keen on this as it breaks the whole 'conjuring nutritional stuff (that you didn't Vanish first) is impossible' and makes it 'conjuring food is a bad bet, because there's no way to tell if you've got the full value version or just a simulation of satiation.'

***** Maybe it's that transfigured materials turn back into whatever they were before once consumed, which would be bad. Likewise, conjured stuff would turn to nothing which would also be bad. And duplicated food would have a diminished value (if you multiply it by two, it means you have two copies at half the value, with half of each copy being basically filler made with magic) so it wouldn't be good to eat it but at least it wouldn't shock your system that badly once it reverts, just ... turn from genuine food into something with nutritional value of junk food.

******* Well, that's what I think, but yeah, what you wrote. I mean, that would be what makes the potions actually have their place in the setting, since just charming something would make the magic go away, mostly or completely, once it's consumed, whereas potions would start their work then. And that's also what would make the power requirements on the unforgivables exist, as they do in canon, and still make the casting actually require a proper set of mind; at least as far as I see it, with them being just concentrated desire to kill, hurt, or control, attached to a big enough piece of magic.

Basically, human bodies do absorb magic naturally, and then either give it out as it goes or use it if they are currently casting a spell. And potions are special in that they take magic from the bodies rather than giving out their own magic the way everything else does. Because, you know, no magical cores or anything so magic is in the environment and human bodies are used to absorbing it and giving it out back all the time.

Of course, there's no proof one way or another since Madame Rowling did not really say anything on that topic (that is, with transfiguration, potions, and unforgivables; magical cores are most decidedly not a thing in canon). So for as long as you make it internally consistent, you are allowed to choose how it works and not care if others think the same or not.

**** You can still write a rational fanfic without making magical limits be related to mundane Physics and Chemistry which they are canonically clearly not. As magic is canonically mostly predictable, it does have laws. JKR just never explained them. I think a more interesting rational fanfiction would be one in which the laws and limits of magic are explained so the reader can predict the outcome instead of imposing mundane Physical and Chemical limits on magic.

I'm unsure how exactly to go about this in this case although wordhammer's idea is good but I don't think your idea in the second half of the post thematically fits with HP magic. Magic like in the OP would be interesting but it would not be HP magic.

It would just require coming up with an internally consistent set of laws /from scratch/ to work with which is... daunting... and still leaves me wondering just /what/ is so special about gold to magic.

If it has nothing to do with chemical properties then... I haven't the foggiest why gold, and I think I want it to apply to silver and copper too since that explains the use in money handily.

Also: I think I /personally prefer/ (which is not to say that it's correct) the idea that the rules of the universe are consistent in a way across both the magical and the mundane, but that its the types of investigations that muggles vs wizards have conducted that yielded their different understandings.

** Someone mentioned Gumps law (that you can't transfigure food). Explaining Gumps law together with the impossibility of transfiguring gold would be economical in a good way. You know, trying to explain the most facts with the fewest assumptions. That's how, according to my understanding, science tries to do it.

Now, the obvious explanation for both is that JK Rowling didn't want magic to be too powerful. If magic can produce anything (including food), you don't need an economy, at least not one that resembles our own. If magic can produce gold, you can't use it as money. Something needs to be used as money (since JK Rowling didn't want the wizarding world to be too alien), so it might as well be money.

Now, those are out-of-universe explanations. But, since they are the true reasons, maybe the trick is to make them valid in-universe explanations. Both rules (Gumps law and the no-gold-rule) are there for a purpose. I know of two ways of how things with (apparent) purpose come to be. They get designed (by people or gods) or they are effects of selection (darwinian-evolution, antropic principle).

Maybe those are not the true rules. Maybe you /can/ produce food by magic, but there is some reason why wizards belief that you can't.

Maybe the reason gold is associated with money even in the muggle world is because you can't transmute it.

Its was made my Flamel to help broaden the horizon of the people of the Enlightement but he had to withdraw it soon after since with the turning of their personl values, actual values changed as well for them. The Philosopher Stone made it possible to transmute gold from anything since it allowed the caster to ignore its value.

** Scientific effects happen for reductionist reasons that ultimately have to do with molecules and chemistry and simple physical laws. You can't have a scientific device that can transform matter into anything except food or gold, because the only thing special about either one is that they're important categories to people; the universe doesn't really care that something is food or not. It's all made of atoms.

Magic doesn't work that way. Magic is based on the principle that the categories that humans use to divide up the world are basic categories upon which the laws of the universe work. Food and valuables are important categories to humans; if magic is real, they are also important categories to magic.
