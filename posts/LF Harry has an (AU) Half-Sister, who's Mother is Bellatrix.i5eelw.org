i would like to know, if there exists fics that have said content. It can be a total AU Fic or a Canon/AU crossover. But i would like, if the fact that Harry having a Half-sister is suprising for him, even if its an AU one....and possibly even more, that the Mother is Bellatrix.

It doesnt have to be Bellatrix, but i had imagined it would be a pretty result. It can also be Narcissa or let it be Andromeda. Bella would fit, because she is the only ones of the Nobles, who isnt married....as far as i know and ... well, considering from the Canon.

Obviously the AU Bella wouldnt look like her Canon Counterpart, but be in a healthy condition.


** Bellatrix is certainly married in canon, to Rodolphus Lestrange.

*** Didn't stop her from having a child with Voldemort... but I don't really consider THAT content canon.
