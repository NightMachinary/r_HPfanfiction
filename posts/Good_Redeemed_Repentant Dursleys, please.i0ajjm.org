In the mood for some wholesome content. Reconciling with family is pretty wholesome, isn't it? Can be pre-1981 (Lily and Petunia making up before the Potters are attacked), pre-Hogwarts (the Dursleys decide not to be vindictive asses towards an innocent child), or post-war (Vernon and Petunia come to their senses and realize what Harry had done for them; Dudley was already making this journey in book 7). Keep it clean, please.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21500365/][The Ghost of Privet Drive]] is a SI story where the MC ends up in kid-Harry's head... as a semi-Ghost.

The MC ends up possessing Petunia then Vernon; They come around when they notice how things work better when they are decent, and the MC gets/builds a body of his own.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian) Petunia is a squib that reconciled with Lily and regularly interacted with the magical world under a fulse identity, and secretly from her husband, until Harry gets dropped off and Dumbledore forcibly disconnects them until harry gets his letter. Vernon is on the fence about magic for a while but he eventually gets mostly over it; individual wizards are still weird, some are still freaks in his mind, and he thinks Dumbledore is trying to con them somehow.

Bit of a fix-it fic but its got a sense of pacing most of those don't have.

  UPDATE (1 MAY 2020): Now being re-written thanks to my wonderful beta [[/u/wrackspurts][u/wrackspurts]]_nargles! Re-written chapters will be marked with an asterisk.Why were the Dursleys so mean?Harry's personality, his actions, his choices, even those in the later books, are all influenced by his upbringing at the Dursley's horrid household. Had he been raised differently, would he have made the same decisions? Would he still have been on the side of the Light? Would the story of Harry Potter still fundamentally be the same as we know it today?What if the Dursleys were good? And not only good but kind? And raised him right, in a loving household, as he deserved?A prologue to Harry Potter-Dursley-Evans And That Supremely Surreptitious Stone, but a work that can be read alone as a short story. Follows the same flow and structure of the first chapter of the first book.
