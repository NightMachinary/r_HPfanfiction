Do you know how popular the trope in which the mean girl wants the brooding bad boy at all costs and puts him in a situation like this is? That actually is a trope in many genders / sexual orientations, not only gay men.

*** Oh, here's the easily offended one. I mean- OoOoOh OBVIOUSLY he meant deep down that all gay men are trash rapists that deserves to fucking die, the line "anything" in fact express that in this situation Snape already knew the torture he would be going through but couldn't do anything.

But seriously get a life, stop searching the "if it were said a bit differently and with other words, by exagerating a bit this part and forgetting that aspect of the writing, it'd be racist". It's pathetic. You're pathetic.

**** You say that like this is the only joke made ever in the world. Am I easily offended or do I just hate old and shitty jokes that continue to say the same (untrue) thing and perpetuate lies that actually have real consequences for people outside of a fanfic sub

I write erotica, and the fucking the boss trope can be hot af. there are ways to say ‚Äòthis is sexy and consensual and everyone is having a fun time' but OP declined to give us those easy tells. Instead, we have a person with all the power, and a desperate person with none, and he says ‚Äòbend over the desk'.

That's not sexy or funny my dude. That's rape, and acting like this isn't something dudes joke about all the time is pointless, because I've heard it

And on top of all of that, there are posts like this on here all the time with this exact joke, so it's not even an original joke
