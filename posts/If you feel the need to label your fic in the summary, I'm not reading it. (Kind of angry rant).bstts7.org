I can't do it, I'm so sorry. If you feel the need to put Independent!Harry or Manipulative!Dumbledore or shit like that in your summary, then that's gonna be a no from me dog. I can't do it, it just screams incompetence. Like, I'm sure there are good writers out there who do this, but why the fuck can't we read through the story ourselves and find out slowly that Dumbledore is manipulative, or read and watch Harry become independent without being told beforehand? It's just, it annoys the piss out of me.

There, rant over.


** I like the labels. That means I can seek out specific types of stories.

** IMO, it's because some people prefer specific fics, like Independent!Harry for example (me lmao), because they can't stand seeing a weak Harry; or Manipulative!Dumbledore because some of his "Greater Good" acts are morally questionable and they want to read something that shows clearly that he really is manipulative. So the labels are there for people searching specifically for these fics.

**** Huh it's been quite a while since I read the books But what I was trying to say there was some of the things he did (like leaving the Philosopher's Stone in a easily found space with bad traps to test Harry(btw I may have mixed some of this stuff with fanon)) that were "Greater Good" actions (potentially endangering students or something) and not Dumbledore literally using the term "The Greater Good"

***** This interpretation is fanon. I mean, it could be so, but it could be also explained (and be still 100% in harmony with facts from canon) that it was just honest mistake and he truly tried to protect the stone by means he thought were sufficient but turned to be completely inadequate.

Yes, it is hard to believe, but in all honesty, I still believe more in the interpretations of linkao3(14078862), or linkffn(12155794) (I have plenty of objections to the latter story as such, but its Dumbledore is one of the best I have ever read): he was just truly getting old and he makes bad mistakes.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** You must be new to the fandom.

After a while of reading through subpar and dubious quality fanfics, readers and writers want to see and show the tropes. I don't want to read 15+ chapters to find out Dumbles is manipulative if I don't like that kind of thing. I want to see it front and center in the summary or the first AN before the story starts. Saves me time on looking through shitty stories.

If a writer is well known/rec'd here often, then yeah, I expect better. Starfox, WhiteSquirrel, mugglesftw, etc -- I know what I'm reading, and I like what I'm reading. They have a type. But if an author is new or lesser known, tags really help.
