A post on how characters handle the existential problems that come up when they are inserted into a fictional world. I'd love to hear both your thoughts and of any fics you have read that deal with these issues. In this case, insert refers to when a person from the 'real' world is thrust into a fictional setting. Usually referred to as "Self-Inserts (SI)'s" unless it is painfully clear the author is writing a separate character. For this post, we'll define insert as "Character is inserted into a setting from a work of fiction that the character knows is a work of fiction". If they don't know its a work of fiction they are in, it is simply an OC.

I'll start out by noting that Inserts are relatively rare in HP Fanfiction, when compared to fanfiction set in more radically different universes (say, Mass Effect or ASOIAF). HPverse tends to user different mechanics to accomplish the same thing. ("Regular person" put into the story? He is just a regular muggle who finds his way into the magical world. "Person with advanced knowledge of the plot?" Character tends to timetravel instead of being someone who saw the story and was inserted. However, even if there are less, there are still plenty of inserts, and some of these points might be relevant to these related plots. It is fine to link/discuss fics set in a non-insert situation that have to deal with the same underlying issues.

To start, inserts would have to the concept of 'fate' or an 'author' to deal with the fact they are in a fictional world. This seems to usually be brushed off and yet is super important. Fictional worlds are usually quite exceptional, missing the chaos and humdrum of the 'real' world. The series of coincidences that have to happen for a good story (and for all the romantic loose ends to tie up and to fit the pattern of a story). And before they can really use any of the knowledge/skills they bring, they need to know what kind of situation they are in. Seems to me, there are three basic setups:

- *Seer Author* The author of the books they read was getting visions/inspiration from what they saw from another world. Of course, the author fixed up the story to make it a better story. This is going to be pretty bad on our traveler, as they can't fully trust what they know (After all, maybe the author glazed over the death of a character they happened to like. Or they changed a bad ending to a good one, to appease the editors). On the plus side, this one is pretty detectable by the traveler and doesn't pose as many existential problems: They will notice the differences between what they heard and what they see, and know that they are simply in a place a story was based on.
- *Holodeck Program Activated* The world follows the (usually unlikely) series of events from a story until the traveler disrupts it. Then it can go widely off track (Butterfly effect). Think the Holodeck from star trek telling a story, but then extrapolating the players changes when they make them.
- *Fate-Driven Story* The unlikely events happen this way because some unseen power forces them to happen this way. In this situation, even if the traveler intercedes, points critical to the story (Think: Harry going back to Durdleys every year, or there being a climatic fight at the end of the year) continue to happen. The traveler can change the contents of the event, but there is no hope of changing the formula.

For the second and third situation, you have the added drama that the traveler finds themselves in a constructed world. Depending on their spiritual views, this can either be problematic or very very problematic. Plus you have the whole "do i have a right to change things" and "Am I even 'real' anymore?". This is particularly true by the second and third type, although you do see this sometimes addressed ("This world was created when you were inserted, but now they are as real as you are" or something)

Honestly, It seems like this is the first thing any inserted traveler would have to deal with, but I rarely see it tackled. Some stories take one of the above modes and run with it (Natural 20 is very much in the "Fate Driven Story" category, and it accepts it. A lot of time travel fics go with the 'Holodeck mode' model), but rarely do we see a character trying to figure out what the rules of the universe they find themselves in are. Which seems kinda silly, because they actions they can take are going to be enormously effected by that.

tl:dr; Thoughts on an inserted character dealing with the fact they are living a world of fiction, and some of the hidden horrors that might imply?


** There's a fourth situation, though, isn't it? Which seems to be what most SI fanfictions are running on. Namely, the /Harry Potter/ universe is as real as theirs, and simply /happens/ to resemble the book series from their home world; the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum physics is correct and they've somehow traveled through dimensions to another universe. That it would resemble /Harry Potter/ doesn't need any particular justification: if there's an infinity of universes, it's only likely that some of them would resemble famous fictions from other universes more or less closely.

*** There's a fifth, too: universes are really easy to create without realizing it because the multiverse is effectively the collective dream of its inhabitants. Since time isn't a thing outside the context of a universe, there is no bootstrap paradox either.

*** I had kinda excluded that one (Called it an OC, since it is a character in the world instead of one brought into it). They can certainly be written as a self insert, but a little of the existencial problems of visiting another universe goes away so

All Christians and Muslims and most other religious people believe something like this. This doesn't appear to be as fundamental of a problem to their existence in this world as you make it out to be.

  Plus you have the whole "do i have a right to change things" and "Am I even 'real' anymore?".

(Cue: "It's all part of God's plan" or something like that)

I agree that those are probably good questions to ask by the protagonist, but I don't think they are "big" problems for someone involved in the action: He/She can just answer "yes" and "yes" and move on from that.

This is a great idea for a crack fic where the SI, instead of following the plot and main characters, becomes a total recluse and investigates philosophy and metaphysic because he wants to discover the /nature/ of this new world and how it came to be and what that means for (his) reality.

Just my 2 cents: If you find yourself in a world that's supposed to be "fictional", yet everything behaves and acts the same as if it were the "real" world, the words "real" and "fictional" clearly don't have the meaning that you thought they had and should stop thinking in those terms until you redefine them.

How do you know that anything you experienced before this even was even "real" (still using words that appear to be meaningless now)?

Epistemology is hard. I'm not sure it's the appropriate subject for a HP fanfic.

From the constraints I put on it, they are. Not because of lack of interest, but because there are other outlets to use. HPverse has quite a bit of "character discovers hp world is real", sometimes having that character come from a world without the hp books, other times having them exist but be distorted. Since there is another viable way to introduce modern (and relatable) characters to the setting, you are less likely to be a "Alien Space Bat transported me to a fictional world" that you see all over some IPs...

Abrahamic religions (which are a far cry from 'most other religions people btw) were what I was referring to by "very very problematic". They rely on the notion of an absolute god, and don't generally smile on the notion of some other entity taking its place. Alternatively, believing the god of their new reality is the same as their old one brings up theological questions relating to a more "activist" god in one universe vs another...

Those were the follow on questions. I was thinking the interesting part would be the struggle to figure out the constraints of their knoweldge (simplified: what kind of insert they are in)...

Kinda the entire point is that they do not act the same. The real world is messy, and rarely involved concise stories or plot armor or convienent plot twists...

So, the characters in the fictional world should be able to figure out that it is fiction because it is so 'unreal'?

What if there's an even messier world outside of ours, shouldn't you be able to notice how fake this one is? Also why do you equate messiness to reality? Maybe in reality everything is supposed to be nice and orderly and the messiness is what's fake?

If I imagine a person from the real world that's nice and orderly, that person might be shocked how everyone believes this one to be real, no? "That's not how things are supposed to be in reality!" she might complain.

** Interesting post. I can't really comment on SI fics as they exist now, as I haven't read any in full, but I agree that existential dread is a good and sensible topic for them to broach.

The few I have looked at seem to all have the insert thrilled to be ripped from their mundane lives. I'd like to see a more nuanced one where they're torn between a new life of magic or trying to get back home to their loved ones, or, better, they want desperately to leave, and the plot is them figuring it out, possibly making friends along the way who are sad to see them go.

*** It is a lot more common in fandoms where you can't imagine that 'its really happening in the background of the real world'. ASOIAF is full of them. And quite a few "Harry Potter & Co get Inserted into ASOIAF". Some of them are even good. (And some of them are horrible. There was one where the insert declared he wasn't a psychopath and proceeds to murder everyone he sees because it is ASOIAF. That author has... interesting tastes :|).

(There are a few ASOIAF inserts into HP, but so far every one of those I've read has been bad :( )

**** So some of them have it in the back of their minds they may have only been shifted geographically? That makes sense. Less interesting conundrum though, I think.

Ha. It's weird to me how many people seem comfortable sharing themselves and the indulgence of their most taboo fantasies, even anonymously.
