I am so confused and annoyed by this. Why do so many people want to read about Harry as a girl. Like... that's not how the story works, there's AU's and then there's this. It's honestly ridiculous. Anyone else feel the same way when they see all these fics with Fem!Harry???


** Considering the amount of Harry/Death Eater slash I'd say that female Harry is one of the mild AUs. There's a 50/50 chance that a child is born male or female. If you compare that to the odds of Harry being bi or gay (<5%) and being attracted to the war criminals who murdered his family (0%) Harry being a girl doesn't seem so immersion breaking after all.

And femHarry stories tend to be more creative (at least the femslash ones I read). There's a remarkable lack of cringeworthy I will not be controlled speeches, the plot is more original and best of all, no +girl collections+ harems.

***** 'Effects and Side effects' on ff.net is pretty good Harry is turned into a female and has a harem but can turn back into a male. I like this fic especially because it concentrates Harrys struggle as a female and his/her feelings. At least in the first half

** What's much more baffling than fem!Harry is posts like these.

Why do you care what others read and write? A story works however the author wants it to work. If an author wants to make a girl go through Harry's hardships, they can.

**** Female Harry is not even that strange. So the protagonist has different plumbing? Definitely the weirdest, most unrealistic shit in fanficton. / s.

*** If they wanted to have a story work exactly like it did in canon, they shouldn't be reading fanfiction :/

I enjoyed what you have so far of Iris Potter, btw.

**** Yeah, I've never really understood that. If we had to stick to the standards of these types of people, we'd have a hell of a lot less fanfics around.

And thanks! I'm glad.

yeah I really liked it; tbh it's one of my inspirations/motivations behind writing my own fanfic (which I just started writing) about fem!ron (well, my other motivation is literally just wanting to write femslash heh)

** It actually bothers me more when they write Harry as a girl yet she still has the same personality as canon Harry, makes the same decisions as canon Harry and people treat her the same as canon Harry.

Changing the main characters gender is completely different to changing minor e.g. does the prophecy still apply if it doesn't, does that mean the Potters are still alive? Did Pettigrew still betray them? Did the Lestrages still go to prison? So many things change when you change the gender.

*** Actually no, that's what I hate the most. I don't understand when they are so many changes for just a gender change. Why would Pettigrew not betray the Potter? The prophecy never said anything about the gender of the chosen one. And Voldemort doesn't act sexist enough to dismiss a person just because she is a girl (He personally trained Bellatrix who is a women). Why would the Lestranges not go to prison, they attacked the Longbottoms not the Potters.

While I don't particulary care about Harry's gender, I hate it when too much change appears.

In this part, neither pronouns are used. And because of Snape not hearing the full thing, it the only part Voldemort knew about.

** I think it'd be interesting if a spell backfired or went horribly wrong and ended up changing Harry into a girl- that sounds really amusing. But if you're talking about him being born and raised as a girl, it seems like he wouldn't be the Harry everyone fell in love with when the books first came out. Boys and girls can easily be raised differently just because of gender and previous notions of how each gender should be raised/treated. The core personality may be similar but a femharry I would still view as an OC.

*** That's how I view the majority of Harry Potter fanfiction. Usually Harry is so far outside of canon that he may as well be an OC. I don't see how having Harry be born female and exploring how that would change his personality and his interactions with others is any different. I would prefer to read a more canon like female Harry than read those fics that make Harry super OP, where he learns all the powers, is brilliant at politics, "independent", evil, or a lord of many titles and has a Harem of girls or whatever else.

**** Yeah, I've noticed with HP fandom I prefer the ones that are truer to the canon. I just get turned off when they go so far off the characters from the books, when those are the people I want to read more about.

*** If a female Harry still captures the spirit of the original one I see no reason to call her an OC. I mean, there are thousands of stories where Harry gets buggered by Death Eaters (Snape, the Malfoys, Riddle) and no one complains that it should be an OC. And suddenly being into men AND into the terrorists who wanted to exterminate your mother while serving the guy who murdered your parents is far more OOC than Harry having tits.
