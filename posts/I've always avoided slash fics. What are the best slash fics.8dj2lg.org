Here's what peeves me: slash fics (in my experience) are almost always written as a hormonal sex romp with every conversation and situation loaded with poorly veiled innuendo. No substance, just "their eyes met across the room" and top/bottom jokes. Also, fuck /blushing./ Nobody blushes /that/ much. When somebody is blushing every other paragraph, it's not cute. That's gotta be some kind of cardiovascular problem.

I just want to read a story with real substance to it. There's a real plot, some kind of serious problem that needs fixing, and also the main characters are gay. Voldemort is on the loose, wizard fascism is on the rise, and the main character is gay. Gringotts got robbed and the cops are hot on the thief's tail, oh and the main character is gay. Centaurs are a menace to society, centaur bounty hunters are after them, and they're all gay. I just need SOMETHING happening.

Feel me?


** Dude, you've reading the wrong slash. I don't know what pairings you're interested in, so here's a bit of everything?

linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run; Tea and No Sympathy): Drarry fics. Neither are that serious in tone, and the second has more focus on their relationship, but that's because the plot revolves around it somewhat.

linkao3(Stealing Harry; 73 Aberdeen) Wolfstar fics. The first is a classic, but I haven't read the rest of the series. The second is a First War fic.

linkao3(The Train to Nowhere; No Glory; Hauntingly; A Dangerous Game; Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls) Tomarry/Harrymort fics. Hauntingly is wild and any sex scene can be skipped, but most shippers enjoy it. ADG is still ongoing, and the last's plot isn't that intense.

linkao3(Butterfly Heart; Counting Bodies Like Sheep; Love's Loathing; Horror of Our Love) Still TMR/HP/LV, but major AU's. Any of the Fictionist's works are amazing, but none of them are very Wizarding Britain besides the two linked. HoOL is abandoned, Harry is a bit blush-y, but the plot is wild and keeps escalating.

linkao3(face death in the hope; Lithium; (honey) there is no right way): some others. Regulus/Harry, Tomarry + Cedric/Harry, and Cedric/Harry. The second is more psychological than something huge, but it's very well written.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  "You know, I lied about glory and honour," Jon said slowly and held the haft of his sword a bit stronger. "There is no glory in death. It's only blood and pain and, if we're lucky, we will die before they could make us dance, using our guts as strings." The White Walkers attack the defenseless Wall, and destruction seems inevitable. However, no one expects a young southerner girl to change everything and everyone - including Jon Snow.

  It's a crazy world torn straight out of a horror movie - the undead roam the earth and destroy everything in their wake. When Harry Potter narrowly escapes a horrible death he finds himself a companion in Tom Riddle - a mysterious, heartless man who doesn't hesitate to take lives to save his own. Savage as the man is, Harry still finds himself enthralled... He quickly starts developing strange needs and feelings.When they decide to finally find a safe place to settle down for a while they encounter dangerous enemies on their path. Tom's past demons come back around to haunt the both of them and it becomes very clear that even after the years they spent together, Harry really doesn't know Tom at all.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within.

** Linkao3(secrets by vorabiza)

Relatively little sex (2-3 scenes in 400K), believable (slow) development of relationship, unique plot outside the relationship.

It is true that a lot of slash is /about/ the slash - that is, they're romances, not adventure/war stories with an incidental pairing, which is the case with a lot of het HP stories. When you're asking for recs, just specify that you don't mind some slash, but you aren't looking for a romance (or erotica).

** linkao3(Third Time's a Charm by steph7of7) is one that mostly deals with post-war PTSD - it's Snape/Neville. No sex scenes, lots of characters ineptly dealing with their issues. Manages to have Snape say the line "Welcome to my quarters, Hermione, you interfering pervert. Tea?" and be in character.

linkao3(Elegy for a Goat by perverse_idyll) is ummm... well, it's Aberforth/Snape for one. Deals with the war, spywork, the usuals. Very well-written.

linkao3(Three Men and a Baby by flibbertygigget) is a fun one. Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban and instead has to figure out raising baby Harry. Snape/Sirius by the end.

linkao3(That Awful Boy by paracosim) is an in-progress fic that's shaping up to be an excellent Fifth Year AU featuring some slowburn Snupin. Has a Snape that's nasty, heart-breaking, and completely incapable of dealing with his trauma.

** Also, one that almost doesn't qualify - just PG slash. Linkffn(you're a wizard, harry by shedoc). Definitely more of a mystery than a romance. She has other stories, nothing explicit, kissing only onscreen, so to speak.

I also personally love linkffn(harry potter and the soul gems) (and sequel) despite the universally hated mpreg - which is achieved through ritual, central to the plot, but not fetishized and not explicitly detailed. Honestly, everyone should try it and give it through chapter 3. There isn't even any romance in the first story, though there's a reference to something unrequited.

[[http://www.sabershadowkat.com/harrypotter/heartofslytherin1.html]]

I'm not normally into m/m slash, but Saber Shadowkat was one of my favorite Buffy(/Spike) fanfic authors, so when she(?) branched out into HP fanfic, I decided to give it a shot. Heart of Slytherin is a great story about Harry and Draco having to work together for reasons, and something developing between them. Highly recommended, as I highly recommend most of her Buffy/Spike fanfics as well.

** Slash isn't usually my thing but Flamethrower on ao3 is a very talented writer and all of their fics are slash.

Edit: found one of the ones I enjoyed. The first twenty chapters were better than the second twenty five but still good overall.

  HPDM slash. The day Harry stops Malfoy and his son from being bothered in Diagon Alley starts a strange series of interactions between them. Who knew there was a pure-blood custom for every situation? COMPLETE.

** linkao3(Requiem at Dusk by Femme) - Snape/Harry, Harry descends to the Underworld to retrieve his dead son Al. Interesting mixture of mythologies to create a different picture of the afterlife.

linkao3(Thyself a Memory by Nimori) - Snape/Harry, sort of, pre-DH. A brief psychological horror fic that follows Snape after Scrimgeour's Ministry has Obliviated and messed with his mind - and then put him in Harry's care.

linkao3(Finder's Fee by GatewayGirl) Snape/Harry. This is the first in the Finder's series, which also contains a D/s relationship (Harry's not submissive in personality, though). This fic occurs when he's still a student, so it may not be your cuppa. Each installment has its own plot. I didn't care very much for the most recent addition, so if you decide to read this all the way through, stop after Auror's Dilemma, which is first-person Ron POV.

linkao3(The Boy Who Died a Lot by starcrossedgirl) Snape/Harry. Dumbledore gives Snape a Time-turner and a directive: keep Harry alive. Unfortunately, fate seems determined to kill off the BWL, so Snape has to go back in time to fix every death. Great dark humor and Snape POV. No sex scene until the very end, so you can even skip that if you stop reading right before it.

linkao3(Father to the Man by Delphi) Snape/Filch. Young Professor Snape tries to conjure Lily out of the past and yanks his five-year-old self into his present. Filch catches him trying to figure out what to do with the child. As much of a character study as a plot-driven story.

linkao3(Snitch by Delphi) Snape/Krum. Viktor Krum starts receiving anonymous letters telling him the whereabouts of escaped Death Eaters, and he feels compelled to investigate.

linkao3(Night-blooming heartsease by julad) Snape/Neville. Neville is assigned to help Snape during the war, and he learns about plants, potions, and himself. Great battle sequence. Written before DH, possibly before HBP, so Snape is somewhat OOC.

linkao3(The Soul Adores by Maeglin_Yedi) Harry/Tom Riddle/Snape. Tom Riddle appears in the locket and starts talking to Harry. Harry tries to outsmart him. It doesn't go as he expected.

linkao3(358691) by xylodemon. Snape/Sirius. Basically a portrait of Sirius as a desperate, self-destructive soldier in the first war.
