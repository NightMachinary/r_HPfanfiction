** Privet is a kind of garden plant, specifically used to form hedges. Mrs Figg lives on Magnolia Crescent. Magnolia is also a garden plant. Areas of housing built at the same time are often given similar/related street names. That area of Little Whinging has streets named after garden plants.

** Privet is the most boring, ubiquitous, normal hedge in Britain, it's a slow-growing, small-leaved evergreen and it's everywhere.

Not only do you get the echo of Privet/ private, you also get the most boring name for a street possible. It might as well be called Hedge Street.
