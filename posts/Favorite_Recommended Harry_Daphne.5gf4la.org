**** We still get a lot of discussion on some threads but ones likes ths come up every week. When posted this was actually the second Harry/Daphne request thread in 12 hours. No-one wants to rehash all their Haphne favourites and reasons again and again but I guarantee that if you replied to someone asking about a fic they'd recommended then you would get the discussion you want.

*** Thanks for recommending Whispers in the night, it's fast becoming one of my favorite fanfics of the year! I love stories that have a Bill Weasley that acts as a friend / older brother character to Harry, and I'm a big fan of mature rated stories changing the age of the characters so that the whole narrative makes more sense and doesn't feel dirty to read.
