** It's unfinished but Adventures in Magick by Pseudonymous Entity is one of my favorite funny fics and is currently over 100K words. I reread it often. Hasn't been updated in a year and a half, but I've seen stories come back from longer gaps. linkffn(11671069)

** There's definitely a theme to my favorite long comedy works! No bashing, good plot, still funny:

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1618564][The Devil You Know by SilchasRuin]], Harry's Horcrux wakes up after a fall and starts giving him... advice? guidance? Well, it tries to help and hilarity ensues.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is a creative version of this same idea. It's better to go in knowing less, but I love how the writer explores the idea of autonomy and what it means to be human.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] is famous enough that it might not be worth recommending, but I really loved it. It's super funny without bashing. In this one, the horcrux is living Harry's life, trying not to attract attention.

EDIT: idk why the bot is vexing me so these days, but it didn't get all my links, so I have edited the post to have hyperlinks.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
