I've really been liking linkffn(Bound in Servitude) which has Harry as the 'master' of two sexy demons.

linkffn(Arcane Academy) has some demons in it as well.

Are there any other stories with demons/the devil in it? Slash would be great but not required.

  After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

  Harry and Tracey find themselves in a different world, where they encounter powerful sorcerers, great warriors and hordes of undead. It is the world where a danger can await you everywhere, where the great demons roam free. Eventually HP/TD. M for blood and violence.
