Or is really good at one of the subjects like potions or something? Preferably no Weasley bashing but I wouldn't mind it if the fic is good


** Well, /The House of Potter Rebuilt/ linkffn(11933512) features a Harry who likes learning about magic, but the prose style is very dry. Like, eating cornflakes without milk dry. YMMV.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** Ummm, there are tons. Mostly WBWL, Time Travel or indy!Harry stories. Also any Ravenclaw!Harry stories. There are really a lot of them.

One I would recommend, just because I like the humour:

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

*** Sadly this one loses focus about halfway in and starts dragging on and on and on instead of continuing to harness this theme.

Also it's a tad shitty with how Harry is denied agency based on the fact that his friends "know how to handle him"

*** That was great, was laughing my ass off at some points, and the writing was really well done. Reminded me of that Askreddit question today of knowing someone incredibly smart but them not knowing it themselves, very relatable to a lot of the comments on that thread. Thanks for the rec!

** Harry loves potion-making in this fic, though he isn't great at it at first - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]])

The learning is a bit more of a past-tense thing, but Harry is a curse breaker in this fic - linkffn(13318951)

I don't really know what to exactly say about this fic, but Harry and Dumbledore's method to approaching magic is really cool to me. It hasn't updated since 2015 though, so keep that in mind when deciding if you want to read it - linkffn(10758358)

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
