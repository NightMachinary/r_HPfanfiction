Basically, the title. I've read a couple of the 'what makes you stop reading a fic' pages and noticed a lot of people were saying first person and now I'm curious - what's the beef with that POV?


** First person, more than third, risks sounding like a self-insert fantasy. Especially if the POV character is over-powered and unrealistically desirable. I've read and liked plenty of first person novels, but in fic where I am very likely to be reading the work of a beginning writer, I'm going to back away quickly and move on.

I'm sure there are great first person fics, but I'm not willing to wade through all the, ‚ÄúI looked in the mirror. Over the summer my skin had become flawless and my hair thicker. My eyes were still a brilliant shade of penetrating green and they sparkled even in the dim light of the train station loo. This year at Hogwarts would be great. I couldn't wait. I stepped back out onto the platform and smiled at Daphne Greengrass. It was clear she didn't know who I was. She blushed, the first sign of the ice queen melting. I planned to thaw her all the way through.‚Äù

** Writing a 1st person really well is HARD. I can knock out a third person short story that's just under 1,000 words in under an hour easily on my phone bored at work.

It would take me hours of working on Word with Grammarly and Hemmingway to write a decent first person fic the same length.

If I wanted to write an excellent first person fic that length I would probably spend a few days on it.

Most people don't spend nearly that much time getting first person right. The issue is you have to draw the reader in, instead of reading a movie (non-interactive experience) in first person you are reading an adventure you are part of (an interactive experience).

That is difficult to portray for several reasons. We all experience the world differently so that creates a large barrier from the start. Overall it's a mess to do with well.

*** Well firstly, thank you for introducing me to a new writing-helper in Hemmingway - it sounds like something I might actually use when I have the money for it.

Now that I think about it, I do think you're right about first person being difficult to pull off, especially considering we're playing around with other people's characters that we would have to learn rather than merely make-up as with original characters. It seems like that's the big dislike for this style of fiction here: simply that most examples of it are quite bad. Probably a challenge in that, for someone to write a good example of it.

Hopefully the request thread that somebody else put up around the time I asked this will give some good recommendations. :)

*** That's interesting, since I've found it easier for me to write in first-person. Maybe it's because of...empathy reasons? Or maybe I'm just bad at both and I'm experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect.

**** I'm sure there are people who are naturally good at writing in first person. Same as talented swimmers and singers, no sense in saying it's not possible. You may well be one, I don't know, either way so long as you enjoy what you write it's fine no matter what.

** I like them only when done well, which is rare. I think it works only when there's a reason for it to be told in first person, like the narrator is literally telling the story to another character, writing a letter, making a statement to the police, confessing to a priest, bragging to the guys at the pub, whatever. Then there's lots of opportunity for the character's personality to shine through in the way they censor themselves to present the version of the story they want others to believe. If the narrator's only audience is the reader, it doesn't ring true. Why is this person talking to me, telling me all these private things? I don't even know them.

*** That's... a really interesting point. I've never heard it quite put like that, but it really makes sense. All the good first person stories I remember reading, every single one had a good conceit like that. Huh.

I don't think I've ever read a Harry Potter fic that actually nails that unreliable-narrator, communicating-your-story conceit. In a fandom of a million million stories, that seems like an odd gap to miss.

*** Agreed, first person fiction (even non fiction) isn't my jam anyway, so it has to be good to make me want to continue and sadly,while I give them kudos for trying, I've found most fanfiction authors simply aren't good enough to nail it to a level I want to read(although there have been a few good enough).

He'll, in another fandom, a book written by a professional and skilled author, took ages for me to actually get into, meanwhile another trilogy by him, in the same universe but set in third person (for the most part) I got into right away, But again, with a different professional author I got into his book series right away despite it being first person.

I guess I'm just fussy with my first person five.

Thinking about it, it may be linked to how I learn skills in general, by watching and doing over being told how to do them. So I feel I more like to watch a story unfold, than be told the story by narrative. To me too, first person narrative always has the feeling of a story and events already having been experienced by the character and is simply a retelling where with third person narrative it has a more unfolding feeling regardless of the tense it is in.

** honestly, I'm just not used to reading in first person. all the fics I read in all the fandoms are in 3rd, so first or second person would just weird me out. the Harry Potter books themselves are in 3rd, so it feels even less natural for me as I like hp fics that "feel" close to the source material

*** I've seen it work well in crossovers with fandoms where the original work was in first person. Switching between first and third person when switching between POV characters helps keep the characters having a unique voice and also maintains a bit of the original feel of both settings.

** It is certainly a valid writing style but it is more difficult to pull off correctly. The insidious part is that the aspects of it that make it difficult are subtle and so an inexperienced writer might push through and keep a story first person when a more experienced one will realize to switch it to third. This doesn't mean that all first person fanfic is bad, but it is certainly more likely than with third person.

**** You pretty much have to touch on the character's inner thoughts in every scene while third person has the option of stepping back and just explaining what is happening. This makes it important to study human psychology to make sure it feels natural. You will at some point be writing something that doesn't match your thoughts but might resonate with other people if you do it right.

An aspect of this is you have to use an Unreliable Narrator. It doesn't have to be any major twists, but it should be clear that we are seeing events filtered through the character's biases. What is important to them isn't always what is important to the story.

It is also easy to slip into the trap of making the character OP and using them as a power fantasy. You still have to show flaws and have them be flaws the character either can't or won't fix. It's alright if they improve on some but you shouldn't let them fix all of them. At times, that might me you have to write things in first person that you personally think are wrong either factually or morally.

And practice does help. You just have to acknowledge that few things are easy the first time. You have to open yourself up to criticism and changing the way you do things. As these elements can be used in third person (it just doesn't rely on them) I recommend experimenting with them in limited forms there before you switch over to first person.

*** Heh. Same here. It's understandable though - when you've got a fandom of a million million fics like this one, you've gotta learn to be picky or you'll be reading fanfic until you die and still not be done with 'em all.

** Echoing a lot of what other people have said, but first person needs to be done RIGHT. You really have to nail the balance between constructing the narrative and expressing a unique voice for the POV character. ("I was frustrated at our Keeper's inability to block the Quaffle" versus "Merlin's tits! Why the hell couldn't our Keeper block a single bloody shot?") Then once you find a character voice, it needs to be kept consistent (unless there is a narrative purpose to not keep it consistent).

You also have to reveal the POV character's flaws without them being self-aware of those flaws (something that should be done in 3rd person, too, but it's far more difficult in 1st).

It can also become repetitive. Even though it's in first person, avoid using "I" too much; it's possible to tell the story without starting every sentence the same. ("I watched Gryffindor win the Quidditch match" versus "Gryffindor won the Quidditch match.")

Soooo... my main issue is that the vast majority of 1st person fics are just badly written.

** The last 1st person I remember is reading Wildbow's (non HPfanfiction) stuff.

I liked it.

I would read 1st person ff if it was recommended.

Really could use some 2nd person ff, but I understand that that's quite difficult... I definitely wouldn't attempt it. Best 2nd person production I've come across in recent memory: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI]]

** First person feels too intimate to me for the characters of Harry Potter. I can't imagine them in first person, it has to be third (or second).

Whilst I don't mind if it's an original character or other minor characters.
