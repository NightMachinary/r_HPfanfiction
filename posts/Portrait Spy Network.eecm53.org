Is the portraits in Hogwarts being spys for Dumbledore canon or fanon?


** Define “spies”. Yes, it is true that Phineas Nigellus Black spied on Harry & Hermione when they were on run (so he can tell Snape that they camp in the Forest of Dean), but that's the only recorded case of spying on students of Hogwarts (and even that was outside of the school). Otherwise, they functioned more like advisors and message carriers for the Headmasters rather than spies.

*** I read a lot fanfics where Dumbledore uses the portraits to spy on the students of Hogwarts.

**** Pretty sure that is fan au stuff. Portraits never had any real intelligence or learning capability until Rowling's needed one to help her plot move along. Each book that came out opened tons of plot holes in the books before it.

She was really bad at coming up with solutions to things she needed and not caring about the consequences of them in relation to earlier books.

Portkey, floo, apparition, Phoenix Fire Travel. Why the hell were none of these used to get Harry to the Dursley house?

Instead a literal half-giant rides a flying motorcycle instead. This is better how exactly?

It was better as she hadn't made those ideas up yet so she couldn't use them. So take everything with a grain of salt and use it however you want as she clearly did not think of what learning and spying portraits would mean in comparison to her earlier books.

***** I noticed. In retrospect, Rowling is actually a rather terrible writer.

****** This feels like the criticism of someone who's never written a comparable original work. It's not easy. Your average writer would not be able to write a million word series that could withstand the scrutiny of hundreds of millions of people better than Rowling did. She might not be a great writer, but she's certainly not "rather terrible" either. If she was, we wouldn't be here.

******* I have said it before and will stick by it still. Rowling's is a good story teller and a horrible world builder.

She told us all a great story that millions love. She built that story on a shaky framework at best which is not surprising. She was busy telling us a wonderful story, she wasn't concerned about building a world, this is a story.

Not sure if that makes sense but that's how I see her as. It explains the plot holes and contradictions, stories are only go forward, you don't go back with them. So you keep moving forward and any little issues new parts of the stories make in the older parts don't matter. That part of the story is already told.

Like I said hard to explain, my father and his father are/were story tellers. I grew up doing so and now my son is as well.

Stories don't care about self-consistency, they are there alive and breathing telling you about themselves.

Books and novels are not stories usually. They are ordered, checked for contradictions, and make as much sense going backwards as forwards.

Not sure I'm explaining it right, hopefully you understand I am not against Rowling's work. I enjoy it, they are just not a book series, they are a story collection, at least to me.

******* Perhaps I should have phrased it better. Rowling certainly did right in creating a world that is both fascinating and enjoyable. She made a story that was enjoyable to watch. However, it is apparent that she had a habit of not looking ahead or behind to make sure that what she wrote stayed in line with the rest of the series. She would add things that were rarely if ever seen again for either shock value, momentary wonder, or plot convenience. She would also write things in without stopping to think of the possible repercussions of it. She is an average writer who made a surprisingly successful series.
