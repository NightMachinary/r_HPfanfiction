I was just wondering if there are any GOOD fanfics that follow right after the DH. I've read a few that were pretty good, but focused way too much on Harry and Ginny. Are there any out there that focus on things other than just Harry and Ginny?


** linkffn(Australia by MsBinns) is a directly post-DH fic about Ron and Hermione in Ron's PoV.

** /Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ is a very high-quality fic that takes place just after DH. Don't let the pairing (a weird Hermione/Draco/Neville menage a trois) throw you off; the writing is absolutely /spectacular/, and I've never come across anything quite like it before or since.

** The first thing I thought of was Kanedax's After the Flaw, it's set between the last chapter and the epilogue and I remember loving it quite a bit. Never finished its sequel, but I probably will now that I remember it.

Tried to find it in an archive but seems like it's just on his live journal: [[http://kanedax.livejournal.com/171048.html]]
