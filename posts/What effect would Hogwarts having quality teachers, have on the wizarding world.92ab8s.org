so in canon, it's pretty hard to argue that a lot of the teachers at Hogwarts are downright awful. Hagrid, Snape, Trelawney, and pretty much every Defence teacher might be knowledgeable but they're awful at communicating that information.

If a good chunk of the population gets educated at Hogwarts when they're young, substituting those teachers for ones that are actually capable probably could have a huge effect on society, and also how Harry's story plays out. Maybe there'd be more Aurors if someone other than Snape was in charge of potions and less people were put off getting the requisite mark, which could have a big effect on the course of both wars.

I'm sure there's a tonne of ways it could go, so I'd love to hear some of your speculation! Cheers


** Kids would go to school and learn and have fun instead of being on the frontlines of a war. The adults should have to fight, not them.

** I suspect the adult population would be magically weaker. By "competent teachers", people generally mean "let's Muggleify Hogwarts". But procedures and paperwork and health and safety don't feel very magical to me. It would literally suck the magic out of the school. I think you need a bit of danger and adventure in your life for magic to properly flourish. Neville certainly needed it before he showed any accidental magic!

** Well, the HP series would not exist if it contained competent adults. That starts with Tom Riddle's childhood and ends with three minors being basically left alone to save the world.

Everything, literally everything, would change.

** Dumbledore puts in a lot of effort into guiding the obviously disturbed 11 year old Tom Riddle. Riddle becomes his protege, and they make great strides together. Dumbledore catches Riddle investigating Horcruxes - he's a far more knowledgeable wizard than Slughorn, so he's able to explain in great detail why cutting your soul into little pieces is a tremendously terrible idea. Perhaps Dumbledore appeals to Riddle's confidence/arrogance and challenges him to make his own philosopher's stone instead, even offering his own assistance in doing so.

Either you end up with an un-aging but far more mellow - possibly even good! - Riddle, or with a far more skilled and learned immortal Dark Lord.

 

Book 1 - They don't try to use a school as a magical Fort Knox. Period. They also don't send kids into the horrifically dangerous forbidden woods as detention. What the actual fuck.

Book 2 - Kids are getting petrified by some unknown? Shut down the school and figure it out.

Book 3 - The professors all go on strike. Soul devouring misery monsters that have loose leashes and spotty target selection being used as guards? Ha!

Book 4 - This tournament can /very easily/ be organized without a freaky ancient magical artifact that compels people to obey it. Not really a direct part of their jobs as teachers I suppose, but there's no friggin' way Barty is able to pass himself off as Moody for a whole year.

** A book in which the kids are the heroes needs to have incompetent adults. Therefore the teachers at Hogwarts are also woefully incompetent. Plus, many of the Professors are caricatures of teacher stereotypes.

I think if we're interested in making the adults competent, we need to look at some of the statements made about Hogwarts. It is mentioned several times that it is the best school for magic out there. Of course, you could argue that every school says that about itself. Whatever you decide.

Snape is an awful teacher, but we don't have any information on wether or not his teaching actually hurts the workforce. Never forget that we see the HP world through /Harry's/ eyes. I myself have made the experience that many of my peers have found the teachings of a Professor I abhorred to be adequate, or even good. Maybe its the same for Harry (and the people he hangs around with).

In any case, I often go to these questions with a mindset of "benefit of the doubt" towards the decisions made by the characters. For example, I wrote the employ of Trelawney as Dumbledore trying to get rid of the subject all together. He can't really do anything about the curse on the DADA position. I assumed that Snape is more of a university professor than a teacher - as in, he doesn't teach, he lectures - and if you can deal with that or not isn't his problem, in his mind. Hagrid I figured was just inexperienced as a teacher, but on a good way to becoming a great one hadn't it been for all the hurdles laid in his way.

That one is a given conclusion. Assuming a normal distribution of grades, more students have EEs than Os, so demanding O as a standard excludes the majority of eligible students. By doing so he takes away at least half of the potential applicants for any job which requires a Potion NEWT.

** If there were quality teachers and competent adults we would have a very boring series about a kid in magic school learning stuff.
