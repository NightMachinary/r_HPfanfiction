Please let me know if this is against the rules and I'll remove the post, but I'd love to gather some more interest in this event!

Currently being hosted on Facebook in a group called Draco's Den is a fest call A Slytherin in A Pub. Just search Draco's Den on Facebook and the group will come up! We ask that you answer the three questions for admittance.

A Slytherin Walks into a Pub and meets....?

It's finally time to complete that sentence and see what wonderful stories our wonderful members here at Draco's Den can come up with!

All we are asking is that you when you sign up, you write us at least 500 words and share it in our AO3 collection as well as the album here in the group prior to October 31st!

If you finish your first prompt and feel like taking on the challenge again, come on back and fill out the form again! The admin team will be happy to give you another prompt as we participate along too!
