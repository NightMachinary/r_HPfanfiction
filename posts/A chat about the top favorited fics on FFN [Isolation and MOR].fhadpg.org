*Isolation:* Okay, I've been meaning to ask this for a while now, but never got around to it... Is Isolation by Bex-chan good? It's the number one favorited story on FFN so I feel like I /should/ read it, but I /never/ see it talked about here. Also, I have a real problem reading non-harry centric fics. I just love Harry to goddamn much. So if I get into it, I'd like to /know/ that it's good, and its pluses and minuses.

*MOR:* This one, I have read a little bit of. And I've read that little bit multiple times. Mostly, I'm just wondering if I'm alone in my /hard/ struggle to get through this. It seems good! I just... Can't for some reason.

â€‹

Thanks in advance.


** Same. I actually never gave Isolation a try because i really don't like the ship. And yeah i never read non-Harry centric fics either. I really love the character the way he is. But staying in character also eliminates any crack fics which i can read. Always need to check that what i am reading is well written.

Just like you, i have given MOR a try many times...but just can't get through it. Never went past the first few chapters. (I am going to get downvoted for this) but reading it makes me cringe.

*** I doubt you'll get downvoted for saying that, this sub doesn't really like MOR.

** Honestly, what you like in fanfiction is going to be specific to you. I'll start reading just about anything (unless it has tags that I know I'm not up for) and if I don't like it after a while, I stop (unless someone has given me a really compelling reason that it gets better at a specific point).

I read a lot of MOR. Like at least 60 chapters. It's still not for me.

Isolation is a classic Dramione fic. It hit at a very popular time and has had a lasting effect. Is it the best Dramione fic or even the best romance fic? I would say no. But what's great to me may not be what you want out of a certain type of fic.

That was a super long-winded way of saying, try a few chapters of anything that seems interesting or is recommended, but don't feel bad for giving up on something that you're not enjoying - it's not required middle school reading. Literature/fanfiction/art are subjective and it's about what will work for you (but don't limit your options).

**** Yeah, I got bogged down for a while with "top fics" but there are so many good and great fics, some of which will be recommended and some that won't, that may or may not work for you.

Reading is fun! Read what you like to read!

When I don't have new fics to read I start trawling through the favorites section of authors I like.

** MOR is extremely controversial and I must say that I am in the minority in liking it. I really enjoy the writing and the different aspects it explores... but many people are likely to be put off by it being over a million words just for the first year.

*** It seemed /really/ cool. It's just hard to get to. Kind of reminds me of Inkheart by Cornelia Funke.

** I never heard about Isolation, I don't think. As for MOR, I actually enjoy it. I tried getting into the sequel a few times, but I never make it passed the first few pages. Just seems odd and disconnected from the original. I think its by a different author, so maybe that's why

** I've seen isolation mentioned twice in the last 24 hours. Maybe on other fan fiction subs? I seem to remember enjoying it more than I expected. I'd no idea it was now at the top!

HPMOR was one of the first fanfics I followed, and it has a special place in my heart. It's written exactly the way I think. I'm a coldly rational Vulcan, according to some. My 14 year old daughter can't get into it.
