Are there any fics out there where Albus Dumbledore takes the blame for the fall of Voldemort, knowing in his heart that the man isn't truly dead and not wanting Harry to grow up with that sort of pressure? It's an idea that has been stewing for a long time, and I would really like someone with creative talent to have brought it to fruition, though not in the evil!manipulative!Dumbledore manner - more in a taking the fall of the fame to protect the kid. Another security blanket, as it where.

** It's become a persistent fanon idea that Dumbledore anointed Harry as the Boy Who Lived like something out of the Lion King. The fact is, Hagrid talks about a crowd surrounding the burning house - it's clearly a spectacle. It's also important to keep in mind that the Death Eaters realize their master died after going to the Potter house, and Harry is the only one left alive. In the opening scenes of SS, McGonagall asks Dumbledore to confirm the rumors, so the notion of Harry's survival, and the fact that they're calling him the Boy Who Lived spread on its own.

What's the point of this? Any fic where Dumbledore "takes the fall" would probably be contrived, and not very good, unless done very well.

This was a request, so I'll leave you with linkffn(What You Leave Behind). Things go to shit after Voldemort dies. The MoM isn't ecstatic about the Order of the Phoenix and their vigilante actions, and Albus loses a lot of clout, and is evemtually forced out of Britain.

Other than that, it has a well written talented Harry, best friend Cedric, and love interest Fleur. Oh, and bedlst Weasley twins as well. They're side characters so they don't get as much attention, but they're exactly what I expect young twins to be like.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** Well, I was only aware of the mostly fanon speculations that Dumbledore had set Harry up to be a martyr. I suppose I was asking for a truly good character who cares about those he has the misfortune of meeting, and not the vague notions of the greater good he grew up on. I suppose it's the mindset of the community? I mean, shouldn't it be strange to see cliches in fanfiction, specifically and only pertaining to that work of fiction? I try to think away from the pre-conceived notions of the community, though I suppose I rarely succeed in any true amounts.

Regardless, thank you for the recommendation, though I have seen it quite a few times on here for various other requests.

In all honesty, you can either view Dumbledore as incompetent or manipulative. He engineers a lot during his life, but then he dies - needlessly, because he is old and worn and regrets his mistakes. Unless JKR confirms it, there is no true way to know - even then some people would deny it.

Well, yes, you /could/ view Dumbledore as incompetent or manipulative. The reason that these people are in the minority, however, is because it's silly.

Dumbledore was not a perfect man, but he was clearly extremely intelligent and insightful. He orchestrated Voldemort's death a year in advance and from the grave, in a way that ensured Harry Potter, someone he felt extreme compassion and respect for, would survive the encounter.

Were there ways for the plan to go awry? Could it have failed? Sure, absolutely. But he did his best, and it worked.

Is Dumbledore manipulative? When he has to be. And never beyond that.

******* Yeah, I have /definetly/ been changed by fanon ideals, but still - Dumbledore didn't do everything he could have, maybe he tried - maybe he didn't, but that doesn't change the outcome - or that he isn't someone we can interact with.

It's really easy to forget the lens through which Dumbledore was working. He knew Harry was a Horcrux. The obvious solution would be to fix everything himself and then kill Harry and then kill Voldemort himself. He certainly had the power for it - we see him fight and make Voldemort run away like a scared little bitch repeatedly throughout the series.

The problem here, and perhaps Dumbledore's greatest weakness as a strategist against Voldemort, is his love for Harry. He viewed him as a grandchild, the family Dumbledore himself, so similarly to Voldemort and Harry, never had.

He lived his life by his ideals and the one I'm going to talk about, in particular, is one that he imparted onto Harry, "Do what is right, not what is easy."

Harry needed to track down and destroy the Horcruxes himself, not because only he could, but because he needed to know how insidious they were. He needed to know the toll they took on the environment around them. He needed to know, when he eventually found out that he himself was a horcrux, that he had to die. He needed to be prepared to sacrifice himself.

Not because manipulative!Dumbledore, but because Dumbledore knew that if Harry took that step on his own, sacrificed himself for the people around him, that Harry /himself would live/.

You can chalk that up to plot contriveness all you want, but the stepping stones for it were placed as far back, at least, as Goblet of Fire.

I urge you to re-read when Harry comes back from the graveyard and tells Dumbledore what happened. When Harry Potter tells Dumbledore that Voldemort used his blood in his rebirthing ritual, Harry, as our narrator, notices that Dumbledore gets a triumphant look.

But why would Dumbledore, upon hearing this news, be triumphant? Because /years and years/ of planning had come to fruition. Dumbledore /wanted/ Voldemort to be rebirthed using Harry's blood, because he knew, at that moment, that Harry would /once again/ survive the Killing Curse and be allowed to live after the Horcrux was removed.

But... Only if Voldemort /himself/ was the one to cast the killing curse.

Notice how Dumbledore worded his instructions to Snape on how to inform Harry of his being a horcrux. Only when Voldemort started keeping Nagini close to him (when Harry had destroyed the rest, or nearly the rest, of the horcruxes) and he INSISTED, SPECIFICALLY, to Snape, that /"Voldemort himself must be the one to cast the curse"/.

From /beyond the grave/ Dumbledore planned the method in which Harry would sacrifice himself, but only so that he would live.

Dumbledore probably could have saved more lives by taking a more direct approach in the fight against Voldemort, and yes, he didn't. But as a Father, I can't really say I blame him. I'm not sure any number of lives could ever stack up against the life of my son and I feel Dumbledore must have felt much the same way.

So, yes, could he have done more? Absolutely. Could he have done more by Harry Potter? I find it hard to believe that, knowing the kind of person Harry Potter had to be to ensure he got to live a life beyond Voldemort.
