I read it a while back, Harry gets bitten by the dragon in GoF in the exact place the basilisk bit him and because of magic he begins to turn into a half dragon wizard person. It's Harry/Hermione and hermione also turns into a half dragon. I think they turn a bunch of bulgarians into half dragons as well through blood transfusion. Anyway it'd be awesome if someone could help because I've been looking for 3 hours now and my eyes hurt.
