:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A couple years ago I read a fic on FFN.net that I have been trying to find again. Here's the jist of it.

When the Dementors attack the train in the third book, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Luna, (and maybe Ginny? idk) end up leaving the train and running into the forest. The forest is magical and has many many many invisible portals all throughout making it impossible to leave. The group has to learn how to survive in the new environment while trying to figure out how to get out. Later on, Professor Snape happens to get stuck there too, and sorta becomes a pseudo dad to the kids. They find out how to get out eventually and return to Hogwarts and defeat Voldemort by tossing him into the forest.

It's a completed fic and I'd like to say it was between 15 and 25 chapters, but I could be completely wrong. Like I said, it was on FFN.net and I've tried looking for it, but it is impossible to search for HP fics on that stupid site lol.

Any help would be great, thanks!!!


** WoW! This story sounds amazing! I hope someone knows this so I can read it. ^{sry for not actually linking the fic you want n commenting instead.}

** linkffn(802432).

Commonly linked alongside linkffn(7287278) and linkao3(3236603), so that's even more for you.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
