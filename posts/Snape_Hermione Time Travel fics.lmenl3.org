I just read a few chapters of A Gift of Time by Leraiv Snape, and LOVED it, but was upset to see that the fic is incomplete and likely abandoned at this point. I'm therefore looking for Snape/Hermione time travel fics with a similar premise. Specifically, that Hermione goes back in time for a period and forms some sort of relationship with Snape, but I'd also like her to return to the future and have to reconnect with Snape after that. Most of the ones I've come across seem to have her stay in the past and age alongside him. Thanks in advance!


** Hi there! Your request got caught in the spam filter so that's why no one has seen it.

May I recommend Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh and its alternate ending, Divide of Time (so you can pick what Hermione does!). Here's a link: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time]])

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Also, here's a few others:

I've read both of these and 100% recommend them. linkao3(10734054; 24616360)

I haven't read these 2 yet, but they're on my list! They could suck or they could be really good. I'm honestly not sure. linkffn(2901275; 3999957)

  Time-Turners are dangerous devices, and awful things happen to wizards and witches who meddle with time.Or do they?For Hermione Granger, an accident that leads her back in time changes the course of nearly a dozen lives, her own included: love where there was none before, hope where it was lost, trust where it had always been suspect.A young Gryffindor girl that hadn't existed before.For Aurora Snape, starting school when the threat against Muggle-borns and the Chamber of Secrets makes it more difficult to be the Potions master's daughter. Or making Draco see that his perception of Muggle-borns is wrong. And it certainly doesn't help when one of the few Gryffindors who is nice to her is the one person who really shouldn't know her too well: her mother.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort.(It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers... HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect.)

  SS/HG A moment of inattention transports Hermione to one year after the fall of the Dark Lord, but with no way back to the present. Her only clue is an object that she finds between worlds. She enlists the aid of a young Professor-but he has his own agend
