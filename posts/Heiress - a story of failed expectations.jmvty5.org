I'm writing a fanfiction of an OC character, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. I'm starting at year one and my goal is to make it a series that follows her through her time at Hogwarts. The main conflict will be related to the expectations of her family and her intrinsic link to her father (though in the beginning she is under the impression that her father is Bellatrix's husband Rodolphus) despite her many differences from them. Main characters included will be Draco, Harry, Cedric, and an OC best friend.

I'm using this as a fun way to refine my writing skills and would appreciate if some of you would read the first chapter (it's just over 2000 words, a quick read). You can find it on wattpad here: [[https://www.wattpad.com/975429194-heiress-bated-breath]]


** I took a peek. Its well written and I have no complaints about your style. Character is believable but be cautious falling into the 11 year old who behaves and thinks like an adult trap.

There's not too much to day, just because there's not much written. I don't see a draw yet but I'd probably keep reading to the next chapter anyway.

*** Thanks! It's been a while since I've written about a kid, so I'll have to keep that in mind :)
