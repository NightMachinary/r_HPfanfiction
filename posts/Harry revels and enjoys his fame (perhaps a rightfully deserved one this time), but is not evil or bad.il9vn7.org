** Story: Weeb [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003]]

Ravenclaw Harry is an anime fan and tries (unsuccessfully) to build a harem. Shifts time forward a little so Harry grows up with modern anime, and it's not just a retread of familiar moments in Canon. I like the fact that he barely interacts with Draco and Snape at all frankly. It's also finished, which is nice.

** He could hate the Boy Who Lived fame and like his well deserved fame. He killed a basilisk with a sword, that is something to be proud of.

** I'm interested in this too. Especially if it's not too over the top to the point of him being completely ooc. it'd be fun to see him enjoy it wholesomely.
