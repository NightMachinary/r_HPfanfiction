Mine's Harry/Fleur/Hermoine. Was wondering how popular that threesome is and what other people's favorites might be.


** Harry/Ron/Hermione of course, they are the Golden Trio after all.

** Harry/Fleur/Hermione is always good. I also really enjoy Harry/Hermione/Luna and Harry/Hermione/Daphne. For the OT3 without Hermione I'd have to go with Harry/Fleur/Tonks.

** I'm often amused by the nicknames they derive from these sorts of arrangements.

Lunar Harmony for Harry-Hermione-Luna and Menage-a-Trio for Harry-Hermione-Ron are pretty obvious. Any others? I have a few possibilities...

French Twist = Harry-Fleur-Gabrielle

Bitch Battle = Harry-Ginny-Pansy

Mudblood Inc. = Fred-Hermione-George

Superstar sandwich = Harry-Tonks-Fleur

Golden Snitch = Harry-Angelina-Katie-Alicia

Harem starter pack = Harry-Hermione-Tonks-Fleur

**** Yes?

Is the source of your consternation...

- that Fred died? (invalidates most Tonks pairings)
- that they're siblings? (but nothing to say about the French Twist...)
- that they're twins? (haven't brought up Padma-Parvati but only because I was busy)
- that they're two guys? (sorry; menage-a-trio is more prevalent but just as ho-yay)

Mind you I wasn't suggesting these were my favorites, just that the names would be funny.

***** Points two and three made me feel a little strange, but to each his own I suppose.

EDIT: I didn't notice the Fleur/Gabrielle

**** Hmm! None that aren't NC-17. Which, for me, is part of the point. With that in mind, here are two: [[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=704][More Than Fantasy]] and [[http://thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=23170][Snow Turns the World Deaf]]

** I don't have anything in particular, but my two favorite male characters are Snape and Sirius (because they are so much alike, and both would absolutely hate to admit it), and my two favorite female characters are Luna and Tonks... and any combination of three of those would work.
