Let me give an example just in case people don't understand what I mean in the title.

For example, I think Harry/Hermione could have been a thing. I believe the most probable time period for the two to get together was during the goblet of fire. They were just too young to even have much romantic feelings for each other during year one. In year two Hermione was out of sync due to being petrified and in year 3, Harry just had too much on his plate.

I believe Harry and Hermione would have gotten closer since Hermione was one of the few people to believe him for the goblet of fire. Due to Ron not being in the picture, Harry and Hermione would be forced to spend more time together and Harry would have eventually figured out that his best friend was indeed a girl.. maybe after Hermione got her front teeth shrunk.

Your turn!


** Ginny & Viktor - Quidditch rivals, met first as part of the war but later learn to appreciate each other for their humour. Assume any of the other possible hook-ups for Harry made him a lost chance for Ginny and this becomes very believable.

Harry & Luna- she was there at the right time with the right words on several occasions and held no special awe of Harry as a celebrity figure. If Harry was wanting to escape the scrutiny of public life, Luna would be a prime romantic fit.

Ron & Romilda Vane- all it would take is Harry not noticing his condition after he ate the fermented chocolate cauldrons, and they might have discovered a surprise affinity. Romilda was pretty and slightly devious while Ron would have been a good sport about being dosed, especially if Romilda proved less clingy than Lavender.

** I could see a lot happening, if i'd include sidecharacters in my comment, so I'll focus on Harry. Given my recent comment on these things, heres a disclaimer: OF COURSE canon would differ if different pairing came into play. OF COURSE characters would change. Duh. We are speaking about fictional characters, not real people with unmovable ideals and traits (not saying that that is in any way how real people function).

So, when I'm saying that Harry and Hermione would have been a very valid choice at Goblet of Fire, I say that completely ignoring book 5 to 7. For example. Those books would've taken a different course and are therefore irrelevant when discussing a romance that started in GoF.

And that brings me to my first possible pairing. Yes, I think Harry and Hermione would have been a good pairing. Would they have been even friends without her nearly getting smashed by a troll? Probably not, or maybe at a later date. But they became friends, even though some that constantly needed the buffer of Ron between them to work for a extended period of time. /If/ Rowling would have taken that path, Hermione would have to change in book 5 to 7. We know there are some things that Harry dislikes about her, and if some of them would mellow out, I could see this working.

Next up would be Harry and Luna. Book 5 gave us the nice, quirky, socially inept Luna that seemed to always push the right buttons with our beaten hero. Rowling could've started the romance between Harry and Luna right there. I don't think I even have to explain how she'd do it. There are countless stories with the love interest being the light for the hero in times of need. Honestly, this is one of my favourites.

And thats basically it when it comes to Harry. The other girls never got enough flesh onto their characters to judge them. We could go on and on about all the females in the story, since if Rowling would've decided in book 1 to make them important, literally every single female around Harry's age would have been a valid possibility. Just imagine the "Pansy becomes good arc" in OotP. Or the "Susan Bones wants to avenge her aunt" arc in HBP. Since Ginny was barely more than a common side character (meaning character depth) before she entered the limelight, anyone could've been made the love interest with just a liiittle build up in previous books.

** My Harry and Hermione story is like this.

Pre-HBP everything is the same. HBP Ron and Hermione don't decide to suddenly stop trusting Harry, and act out of character spawning a plethora of terrible love-potion fanfiction. Everything else is the same except beyond initial doubt Hermione doesn't act out of character about the potions instructions. She does flip about Harry using the spells.

Ron/Lav still happens, Hermione is still jealous, Cormac stuff happens, Harry and Ginny get together. Snape kills Dumbledore. Basically HBP is the same except without the strange behavior. Also the added bit is after the Won-Won saga Ron and Hermione go on a date to Hogsmead. They would return from this dating laughing about how they needed Harry to come with them next time. The situation between them dissolves without angst or hurting the group dynamic.

DH is still the same until Ron ditches them. I think Harry and Hermione spending all day together alone is the catalyst, obviously. It isn't, we're alone lets bang and fall in love. I think they would both open up and talk about their lives outside of Hogwarts. My headcanon here is that Hermione's parents are workaholics and distant. Also probably not hugely accepting of magic seeing as she spends less time with her parents than Harry does with the Dursleys as the story goes on. Also she found it easier to memory charm them than to explain that then needed to leave the country for their safety.

I think they'd find a new closeness in opening up about themselves, sharing things they've always kept secret. When would then lead to the banging and falling in love.

They have gone to Hogsmeade together without Harry in the past, specifically third year, and IIRC, they seemed to have a good time together. I mean, I suppose this being a "true date" and not just hanging out together could up the awkwardness significantly. I just think that if this were the case it /would/ change the group dynamic. I think Ron and Hermione would feel uncomfortable around one another any time Harry wasn't there going forward for a significant period of time, and canon Ron and Hermione spend a decent chuck of time together without Harry (when he's off doing world-saving things). Still, your Harry/Hermione build up seems a lot more canon-compliant than a lot of the ones out there since it focuses on actual similarities between the characters as opposed to changing one of them significantly to give them similar interests. I mean, I'm never going to be a Harry/Hermione shipper, but this set up feels more organic than a lot of them.

*** I had feelings for a girl for about the same duration, but eventually dated someone else entirely. Just because they have feelings for each other doesn't mean they have to act on them. Sure we're talking about book characters of a adventure, low-fantasy novel. Theres no time for sidekicks to become overly complicated in their attractions. But still, to downright say "They can't be with anybody else, because they like each other" is just ignoring basic human nature.

I could see Hermione with 2 others.

Harry, first and foremost. He and she would have to change a little bit, but both of them don't show traits so unchangeable that I would dismiss the thought entirely. It would have only taken Rowling a few sentences in the direction and H/Hr would have been reality. (Even though it would have completely destroyed the trio structure, therefore you could argue that from an authors viewpoint, this is the most impossible pairing).

Viktor is another possibility. While I get the cultural distance, the physical distance is a joke in a world where you can instantly teleport from one place to the other. I stand by my theory that there is no such thing as a long-distance relationship in wizard society, but merely intercultural relationships. Then again, Hermione is at Hogwarts, so the whole romance would be limited to Hogsmeade, summer and after Hogwarts graduation.

As for Ron, well... He was with Lavender. Honsetly, Ron is someone I could see with a lot of the female characters, so I won't elaborate. From Katie to Parvati to Romilda. Rowling could've given him anyone and it would have worked.

** Almost anyone, within reason. As fiction, and especially as fanfiction, readers, we all have the tendency to forget that relationships aren't nearly as cleanly cut as they're often portrayed to be. We like to point out character interactions as written in the books and relationships we like and totally ignore the fact that people change and relationships aren't as simple as x and y seem really similar, or w and z were really good friends so they'd probably be good together. People meet new people and develop new relationships. Frankly, there are probably fewer relationships that aren't possible than ones that are.

My "should have been canon" pairing is Viktor/Hermione. He's able to understand her better, I think, than Ron or Harry, and we're told that he's a very strong character.

Maybe if Harry had spent the summers at Hermione's instead, then their relationship might have developed romantically. To be honest, I think his life would have to change even earlier than Hogwarts for him to be compatible with Hermione as she is in canon. Maybe if he grew up in another family.

I've been curious about Angelina and her relationships with Fred and George. She went to Yule Ball with Fred and later married George. If Fred had lived, would she be with him? It seems like there could be a bunch going on between those three that we never learned.

** Harry/Hermione has literary problems to it too. I just can't see how they could have been together without pushing Ron significantly off to the side. It would have severely imbalanced the trio, and Harry Potter is a very trio-centric story. Also, JKR downplayed the romance for most of the series, which wouldn't have been possible had the story been H/Hr and Hermione been at Harry's side all the time.

Plus, as other posters have said, Ron and Hermione's feelings had already been acknowledged by GoF, so a H/Hr relationship after that would have been highly improbable. Not to mention, both main characters falling for Hermione would have turned her into a gigantic Mary Sue.

Of main pairings, Harry/Luna could have been done. Not as they are in canon, but with more development in HBP it could have been possible. In canon, Harry lacked a fundamental understanding of Luna (he was baffled when Luna was indifferent towards her bullies in OOTP), so the relationship would need a bit of work.

**** This is true. And even if some change in circumstances had set them up for a friendship, I don't think it would have lasted. It's likely that if Ron hadn't existed, Harry would have ended up bonding with Seamus/Dean or paired off with Neville. And Hermione would still have been in Gryffindor house, so Harry still would have met her and had the opportunity to befriend her.

But even if, let's say, they were potions partners, I don't think a friendship would have taken off.

They don't have that much in common, don't have fun with together, Hermione's not really on the same page with him emotionally, and Harry dislikes her tendency to nag/argue (this is tempered in canon because Ron runs interference).

Depending on the change I think this could make them closer than canon. If Harry didn't already have a bestfriend and he still saves her from the troll I think his character would change dramatically from this.

I think in PS Harry is without much character of his own, due to the way he was raised. I think being friends with Ron made him more Ron-like. Substitute Hermione and you have a recipe for the a more studious Harry.

Hogwarts is a chance at a new life for Harry, and he is far from lazy, yet he doesn't work hard or go beyond the minimal at magic. I really do believe this is the Ron influence. After all Ron is a pureblood from a different home, and wants/expects entirely different things from his Hogwarts education.

**** I would disagree that Harry doesn't have a personality in PS. He's still learning about the world around him, but he has likes and dislikes.

Harry consistantly uses Ron as a buffer between himself and Hermione, and I don't think that he would get along with her as well one-on-one. When it's just Harry and Hermione spending time together, they don't have fun, and they're often on different wavelengths, and Harry dislikes her tendency to nag/argue. The reason their friendship survives in canon is that Harry sees her as a valuable friend and Ron is there to create a buffer. He distracts Hermione when she's nagging Harry, argues things on Harry's behalf, etc.

And remember that in PoA, Harry basically didn't speak to her from Christmas to Easter, and he scarcely seems to notice. Not once does he remark how much he misses having her around or how it's great to have her back again. It's a huge contrast to when Harry angsts incessantly about his three week fight with Ron. When it's just Harry and Hermione spending time together, they don't have fun, and they're often on different wavelengths.

Harry basically ignores/tolerates her nagging because he cares for her as a friend. But if you take friendship out of the equation, then Harry would not seek her out or be interested in spending time with her.

And even if outside forces created a friendship (like sitting together on the train), it likely wouldn't survive because Hermione has a hard time connecting with Harry when they've been friends for years. It would be extraordinarily hard for her to hit the right notes needed to establish a friendship.

There are similarities in their background, and Harry and Hermione could theoretically bond over their lack of wizarding knowledge. However, from the very beginning we see that they take different approaches. Harry's content to learn as he goes, while Hermione wants to preload and read up on everything. This isn't Harry's style, and that's not going to change. They have the same problem, but they're solving it in hugely different ways. Moreover, Harry isn't particularly interested in maintaining a connection with the muggle world (and therefore a connection with muggleborns). Hermione appears to feel the same way way. They're not going to be bonding over the latest TV shows or how much they miss packaged junk food.

I think Harry sees himself as having more in common with Ron. They're ying/yang in some ways (Harry has money but no family, Ron has family but no money; Harry has muggle knowledge, Ron has wizarding knowledge). But first of all, Harry initial connects with Ron because he too understands what's it's like not having money. I think Ron "gets" Harry's life with the Dursleys much better than Hermione does. Hermione is a loved only child who comes from a middle class dentist parents. Neither Ron nor Harry fit that mold, and I think part of their friendship is bound up in that understanding.

***** No, no, no - Harry's the buffer, not Ron (Ron causes most fights, not Harry and not Hermione either!)...sure he dislikes her tendencies to nag, but who wouldn't? (Ron does it as well, hell his arguing back causes a lot of fights...hell, he's more pissed off about the firebolt than Harry is (note: I still think Hermione should have been told off for what she did, as it shows she doesn't trust Harry - hell you could even claim that she thinks he's a danger to himself -.-))

They don't have FUN because Hermione doesn't understand the concept IMHO -.- (she learns from both Ron and Harry IMHO!)

Sure Hermione doesn't get his life at the Dursleys because Harry is mute about it (he doesn't talk about it - hell: It's one of few topics where he puts his foot down and doesn't budge!)...she would probably be appalled if she knew!

****** The thing is that Ron/Hermione's fighting isn't an inherently bad thing. I wrote a whole post about it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3940zv/in_defense_of_ron_and_hermione_arguing/][here]], but I'll summarize.

Hermione is an argumentative person. She argues with Harry and Ron quite regularly. She also argues with Luna, Lavender, Hagrid, George/Fred, Mr. Weasley, Umbridge, Sirius, etc. We don't see that kind of behavior from Ron as much, and it's not Harry's style either.

Harry has been raised by the Dursleys, and is rather uncomfortable with arguing because he associates with genuine hatred/anger. He's also not a big fan of authority or being bossed around, because he grew up getting that kind of thing. However, Ron has grown up in a loud family. He sees nagging as an expression of love, and he doesn't instinctively shy away from arguing. Ron knows that if he gets into an argument with Ginny, she'll still love him at the end of the day.

When Ron/Hermione argue, they don't see it as a negative thing. It's more of a form of communication and an exchange of ideas.

Harry's normal M.O. when Hermione nags him is either ignore, lie, or explode at her. None of these are healthy behaviors.

And one of his frequent coping mechanisms is basically using Ron as a human shield or allowing Ron to engage with Hermione on his behalf.

For example, he queues Ron to engage Hermione here:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh hang on..." said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. "Wait a minute, Hermione..."

  "What?" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.

  "I know what this is about," said Harry.

  He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.

  "Hermione!" said Ron, cottoning on. "You're trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!"
#+end_quote

and here:

#+begin_quote
  "You're not telling me you did fly here?" said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.

  "Skip the lecture," said Ron impatiently, "and tell us the new password."

  "It's 'wattlebird,'" said Hermione impatiently, "but that's not the point ---"

  [they enter the common room and are immediately accosted by the rest of the Gryffindors]

  Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.

  "Got to get upstairs --- bit tired," he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.

  "'Night," Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's.
#+end_quote

and here:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, but --- but ---" Hermione seemed to be struggling to find another problem. "Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he'll be in so much trouble! And it's not nightfall yet --- what if Sirius Black turns up today? Now?"

  "He'd have a job spotting Harry in this," said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. "Come on, Hermione, it's Christmas. Harry deserves a break."

  Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.

  "Are you going to report me?" Harry asked her, grinning.

  "Oh --- of course not --- but honestly, Harry ---"
#+end_quote

Notice how Harry doesn't engage with Hermione about the car (which is normal behavior for him), but he also doesn't want to be the one to tell Hermione that they're going to bed instead of listening to her lecture. He lets Ron say “we're going upstairs” and then just wishes her good night. Similarly, he's not interested in arguing for his right to be in Hogsmeade or the principles of S.P.E.W.

There are tons of moments like this, where Harry allows Ron to make his argument for him while he sits silently by or where Ron heads Hermione off when she's nagging Harry.

When Harry does explode, the balance of power dramatically shifts and Hermione will be described as shrinking back or close to tears. Again, not healthy. The only reason Harry doesn't explode more often is Ron engaging Hermione or straight up telling her to lay off Harry.

Ron doesn't quite share Hermione's zeal for arguing, but he doesn't seem to be able to resist the temptation to go back-and-forth with her. And like I said, Hermione needs that in a partner. Like Hermione, Ron tends to wear his heart on his sleeve. When he's upset at Harry in GF, he doesn't sulk, he tells him why. When Harry disagrees with Hermione, he says nothing. When Ron disagrees with Hermione, he tells her why. When it comes to Hermione, Ron trusts that she won't purposely say anything hurtful/below-the-belt, and that she'll tell him if he's accidentally crossed a line. The reverse is true as well.

--------------

Hermione isn't great at fun. However, she's actually shown having fun with Ron on numerous occasions, despite the fact that the books are from Harry's POV. Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3hu7n0/what_was_rons_and_hermiones_interaction_like_when/cuapd8s][list.]]

--------------

Harry's actually pretty open about his life with the Dursleys. One of his coping mechanisms is to make dark jokes, like saying "they'll be disappointed I didn't get myself killed." By second year, even Ernie McMiillian knows that Harry hates those muggles he lives with, and Harry bluntly responds that "It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them."

Maybe it's because he shares a dormitory with Harry, but Ron is definitely more aware than Hermione. This is the kid who wrote to his mum to tell her that Harry wasn't expecting any Christmas presents in their first year. This is also the kid that he stole a car and staged a rescue mission after not hearing from Harry for about 5 weeks the following summer. And contrast that with Hermione, who was still not really getting it by the end of CS:

#+begin_quote
  "This is called a telephone number," he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. "I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer --- he'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to..."

  "Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. "When they hear what you did this year?"

  "Proud?" said Harry. "Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious..."

** Harry/Hermione couldn't have been a thing because Harry isn't attracted to her, isn't interested in her life, and doesn't particularly enjoy her company. Read [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html][this article]] for further explanation.

Harry and Luna could have been a thing if they spent some more time together and Ginny wasn't there. She certainly seems to be one of very few people who can connect to him emotionally (unlike Hermione who just pushes all the /wrong/ buttons), and he really cares about her. Luna has that softness that can easily get past Harry's "defences", and I think that's what Harry really wants - understanding.
