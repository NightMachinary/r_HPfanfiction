  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) has harry making custom satchels in his first year with his group of friends that'll sell. He also crafts a ghost trap in it.

Linkffn(anthology broken pottery) has a different version of the story where the completion of the satchels is farther along. It's the chapter titled HP& the Darkness Within as well as a few other beginnings of stories, including one where he creates a magical version of the animus from assassin's creed.

  Harry and the Multiverse: stories of Harry and friends in worlds unlike the Potterverse. Crossover starts and stops, ideas that are only half-formulated. Mostly HHr but some other pairings on occasion.

** I read this ages ago and enjoyed it back then, but re-reading it recently it wasn't anywhere near as good as I remembered it. Harry is a Mary Sue but he makes stuff with runes. Try your luck, I guess? linkffn(Runemaster by Tigerman)

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** Okay so this fic is amazing. It's one of my favorite stories done by one of my favorite authors. I don't see it linked as much as I would like. The basic premise is that Harry becomes a blacksmith and uses that ability to get through the triwizard tournament. The are a lot of unique characterizations and over all I love it. I will admit not everybody will, but that's okay

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/]]

The second one fits the bill as well. Now take this one with a grain of salt. I'd you read it and enjoy it that's grand, but if you don't enjoy it I can definitely understand why. Harry is a fashion designer. It's not as bad as it sounds. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11692854/1/Bolt-Fashion]])

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
