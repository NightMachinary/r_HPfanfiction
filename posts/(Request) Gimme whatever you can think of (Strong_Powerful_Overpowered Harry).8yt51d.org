Alright guys, this will be kind of the opposite of the many deaths of harry potter LF post I made before, as I want whatever stupid powerful or very fast learning speed and power increase harry's you have read, are reading, and are going to read, and I even want the ones that you probably wouldn't read because they're cringey in some kind of way, just throw whatever you got at me!

Actually doesn't even need to be on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or A03, because I know there are some that are so ridiculously filled with the aesthetic of a Gary Sue(As in a Harry who is perfect or is pretty good at almost everything, even the fucking) that they don't bother posting on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] because it just feels weird to do that, I definitely feel that(I won't explain).

Just type whatever crosses your mind as a overpowered harry. Also no angst, or at least not a lot because I'd rather not feel anxious and the cause being some fanfiction that I wanted to be a wish fulfillment story. Some things I will example for referencing is that I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/14/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]](that links to chapter 14 because I'm not gonna bother going to the first chapter).

I don't mind a bit of m/m so that doesn't matter. Also Harry gotta be a guy or at least can change forms because it's hard for me to inject myself into the position of Harry if he's a she and only a she because I don't got a V.

But all in the end, in the most basic form of this requesting post, all I want is a bit of strong/powerful/overpowered Harry with /some/ requirements and addons to make it so if you're one of those people who like to give whatever they put out be a good choice a more wide range of pickings.

Also I'm still pretty new to posting so I don't the specifics in the rules like the 1. No Personal Information that is on the right side of my screen, so just point the stuff that's bad in this post and I hope I can edit it later.

EDIT:("Already!?" I know I know, I'm just putting one more thing after just posting it a few seconds ago) PLeASe pOSt OneS tHat arE lOnG!!! Or at the very least 15-20 chapters long.

ANOTHER EDIT: I do not mind crossovers and I guess the chapters have to be long as well...


** Core Threads linkffn(10136172) unfortunately not complete. May be updated later.

Guh I'll try to rec more but right from the top of my head nothing comes right now. Do you mind crossovers?

Little tip: don't look at the length by chapter but by words count. You can have 20 chapter story with <2k words per chapter making <40k words or 5 chapters with >10k words and that's >50k words. I usually consider a fic "long" from >100k words but can go lower if the quality it there.

Crossover :

Star Wars : Let's Try This Again, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Harry Potter: Lost Very Far Away

Witcher : The Swallow and the Dragon linkffn(12343855)

GoT : The Difference One Man Can Make linkffn(11132113)

Well the next 3 are a bit crackish and all in the same series but still quite enjoyable in my opinion : Make A Wish, The Hunt For Harry Potter and Terminal Justice (which is also a DC crossover)

linkffn(2318355; 3032621; 11965672)

A lot of crossover are with a OP Harry and same for MoD, Time Travel, Azkaban and Dark/Grey Harry. There are tons of others but I don't remember all I read.

** I have a good amount of these in my favorites, so here we go:

I read this one quite recently and really enjoyed it, once I made it past the first couple of chapters. Harry does not begin the story overpowered, but he quickly learns and becomes an extremely strong character in the story, soon to be on par with Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort. Unfortunately not complete yet, but the author is still active on his forum (linked at beginning and end of every chapter), so I have hope that he will get further.

- linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang)

Another one of my favorites, that probably says something about me. This story features time travel and an extremely fucked up world, by all modern standards. The plot is impressively complex, in my opinion, and is still being fleshed out. Harry is overpowered from the get go, and he's basically on a mission to turn the wizarding world upside down, from what I remember. The story is incomplete but regularly updated.

- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LeadVonE)

I just read this one yesterday, so it's pretty fresh in my mind. This one is basically a learned Harry who gets sent back in time and doesn't fuck around, at all. This one may not be what you're looking for since it focuses primarily on Harry's relationship with Hermione, but it is quite short and a decent read.

- linkffn(Returning to the Start by Timunderwood9)

I haven't read this one in a while because it disappointed the HELL out of me by being both amazing and seemingly abandoned. However, from what I remember, a war-torn (read: very experienced in combat, but mentally fucked) Harry jumps into an alternate reality with Voldemort into a world where the prophecy never existed. Thus his counterpart is female, has two siblings, and Lily and James Potter are still alive. The author does fantastic characterization (imo), which means she focuses quite a bit on it. This story also has the slowest pace I have ever seen, in that it takes the author 200k words to go like a week or something absurd. This does mean that the plot is rather intricate, if you're into that. I thought it was worth the read.

- linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518)

I'm not sure exactly how overpowered you're looking for your Harry to be, so I'll just go ahead and recommend this because it is another one of my favorites. Harry goes to Durmstrang and gets placed into a bunch of advanced classes, seemingly following in Grindelwald's steps as he becomes a powerful wizard in his own right. I really enjoyed the author's take on Legilimency and Occlumency, and he does a great job of world building at Durmstrang. I'm not exactly sure how overpowered you're looking for, but Harry and his girl are able to turn the tables during an ambush by ten or so attackers in their fourth year. Also features some angst in the form of said girl. This is, unfortunately, another incomplete and seemingly abandoned fic, and the last couple of chapters are only available on DLP forums/wherever they have been copied to.

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

Here's a fic which starts with the Third Task in Harry's third year. Harry is saved in the graveyard by Arcturus Black, who takes it upon himself to educate Harry on his grandfather, Charlus Potter. Harry quickly becomes some sort of prodigy, and ends up taking out Voldemort in an epic duel.

- linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence)

I don't remember much about this one other than that Harry essentially wins the war singlehandedly, then gets the fuck out of dodge and moves to America because he pissed everyone off doing it.

- linkffn(Hail Odysseus by Brennus)

Once again, I don't remember much about this one other than Harry trains his way to become overpowered, takes on Voldemort at the end, gets himself on par with Dumbledore and Grindelwald, etc.

- linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag)

And now, since you said you wanted cringy fics that you'll never read, I post this. Other people seem to like it, and it's brought up in a few of the threads I find on here, asking for recommendations. Personally, I've tried to start it about 3 times, and I just can't make it through the first chapter without closing the ffn.net app. I'm not sure what exactly I hate so much, but I can't stand this fic. But it definitely fits your criteria of long and overpowered!Harry.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
