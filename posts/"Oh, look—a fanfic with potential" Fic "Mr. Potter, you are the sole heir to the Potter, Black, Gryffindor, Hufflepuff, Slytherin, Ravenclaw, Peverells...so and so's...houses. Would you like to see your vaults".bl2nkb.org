Me: /closes fanfic./

Every time I find a promising fic and this shit comes up I feel like banging my head against the wall. I can understand and even want to read about Harry's family history, how the Potters gained their fortune (I know in canon its bc of those hair potions) or "family history" because I do think there's potential to be sought there. James was a rich pureblood who had one of the Hallows, it doesn't take much imagination to write up something interesting about the family. For example, I remember one story where Harry was raised by his family house elf and the rude painting of one of his ancestors, and it was 100% fanon nonsense, but it was /interesting./

If fanfics REALLY want to write Independent! Harry (whether they include the fanon Lord Potter tropes or not), why not show him learning finances (I know...boring. At least it's more interesting than 5 paragraphs about the mountains of gold in his vaults), managing whatever property he has (use those 456 french villas to set up a campground for a House Elf army or smth IDK go wild! Just DO smth with it!), learning his history, investing in promising ventures or using his muggle knowledge for good, making connections with people who might have been family friends, making clever use of his fame, DOING something of significance with the advantages he has besides acting holier-than-thou and steamrolling people with "I am Lord Potter/Black/etc and that means I am right and you are wrong HA"....etc. There's so much potential for actual worldbuilding even if the story is full of tropes, but the whole "I'm an heir to 45678 houses and rich af from the get-go" thing is so lazy.

Forgetting the obvious fact that it's entirely fanon and wish fulfillment bullshit, I understand some authors love the Powerful! Rich! Domineering! Harry route but this is just yawn inducing. Half the time the above-mentioned trope is introduced it's the /first damn chapter/. At least make him /work/ for the wish fulfillment, handing him everything on a silver platter is just boring as hell and cheapens the "value" and "shock" factor (lmao I typed that with a straight face).

I wonder if I'll ever actually find a fic with the "Lord" trope where Harry is given substantial, but limited resources and turns his burden of fame around to being an asset, or uses his brain for once instead of relying on a meaningless name.

*** My point exactly, thank you! I don't mind per say having all the titles and whatnot dumped on him, but show me the aftermath, show me the history, show me the struggle before skipping to the reward! Show me Harry moaning that he's way too young to deal with wizard taxes, show me Cynical! Harry griping with nonsensical laws and muttering that the muggles do it better, show me Clever! Harry using his fame to advertise start-up businesses but demanding a cut of the profits, show me Skeptical! Harry who asks "well, if I'm somehow related to these people with all these obscure blood ties, there must be a heck lot of people also somehow related to me that I can make use of."

Idk just don't drop the gazillion titles and forget about it except for bragging rights, use it to add to your story. Wish fulfillment isn't always bad, it can be very interesting and fun if done right.

**** Having to marry someone (especially someone who wasn't even born when the agreement was made) doesn't make sense, IMHO. James could marry Lily just fine, after all - and she was a muggleborn, so this wasn't some inherited arrangement. In addition to that, if Harry can inherit multiple lordhsips and titles as a single person, why would he need to marry multiple wives at all? What happens if he doesn't marry someone? The title passes to the next heir? Well, that'd be one of his kids. If Harry can hold so many titles, then his kids by the same woman can split them up as well. And if the title goes to someone else? So what? I don't see Harry marrying someone for political or monetary rewards, and if anyone tries to actually force him into marriage... well, good luck doing that to the Boy-Who-Lived. (If Harry's "discovering his inner Slytherin" as the trope usually goes, what's stopping him from simply using his inherited power to change the law trying to force him to marry anyway? Most authors never think these things through. It's just a shitty "Harry has to have so many wives even though he doesn't really want it, but he must" "justification that contradicts everything else in th story.)

What I'm thinking of are obligations that are crazy and a bother, but worth it because the penalty for defaulting is higher than the money and time spent fulfilling the obligation or the time and effort needed to refuse the obligation and ignore the penalty.

The Peverell thing has a lot of potential bc of the Hallows, I wish there was a fanfic that explored it well. Don't even get me started on Black: they probably have SO much dark magic and artifacts and history hidden away in Grimmauld ALONE, but no one goes into that potential except to lord it over the Malfoys or smth.

There's another fic called Elfish Welfare where Harry's raised by his parents' portraits and his house elf, but the one I'm talking about in the OP is different. We need more original ideas like these...

This is why I'm going with the headcanon (and intend to work it into any future stories I write) that the Potter family is barely considered Pureblooded by those in Wizarding Britain that actually care about such things, due to their propensity to marry Muggleborns and Half-Bloods. In fact, Fleamont and James are the only Potters in the past hundred years or so that can even be categorized as Purebloods because of it. Also, I'm running with the fact that the connection between the Potters and the Peverells has been lost to the mists of time; and no, the Goblins do not have any hidden genealogy records of Wizarding families because seriously, why would they even care about such things to begin with?

If such records do exist outside of the families that care about such things, it's most likely in some dusty corner of the Ministry of Magic where things like this are probably kept; along with Birth, Marriage, and Death certificates.

If it's the conclusion, that's when I pull my hair out (not really, mind you, I don't actually have that much left).

But seriously, this kind of fanfiction is really just people writing out their fantasies. They don't actually expect to produce a literary masterpiece. Or piece. You shouldn't expect one either. (And you can tell this kind of story from the first few paragraphs, if not the summary).

About the first chapter thing, I wouldn't mind if it was in the first chapter just as a starting point or something, and the fic builds on it later. But most of the time, it's just there as a "SEE! Harry is powerful! And rich! And special!" and then it's never mentioned again except to brag.

********* There's also the thing unique to fanfiction that it builds upon an existing storyline. An original story starting with a guy inheriting lordships and wealth, and then using the power this grants him to curbstomp some OCs wouldn't interest anyone. We don't care about the OC. We don't know him.

Having this happen to Harry is different. We know him. We know what he went through. We know what his enemies did and will do to him in canon. We don't need to read about how evil Umbridge, Malfoy or Voldemort are - we know it already. Their actions, past and future, already earned them the beating they will receive, so to speak, when the story starts.

It's still not a very good plot to simply introduce a deus ex machina to solve all of Harry's problems, but it's not quite the same as an original story with that plot.

** Pet peeve about these fics: Coins in the vault.

Gryffindor: 19475940 Galleons, 848495 Sickles, and 333333 Knuts.

Aside from the author rolling their face on the keyboard for every set of numbers that are meaningless because they're just establishing "enough to buy everything", the lower denominations irritate me. Why would the Goblins leave several literal tons of Knuts and Sickles, common coins, out of circulation and sitting in a vault instead of exchanging them up? It's like if he inherited an American bank account and they hand him a statement saying 294858593 dollars and 8849493 cents. Who does that?!

Every cliche started somewhere, and then some people took it too far. Don't worry, save that link for a rainy day when you've read everything worth reading and are waiting for updates on all the "good" fics.

Sometimes you are just in the mood for SuperRichLordHadrian tropes. Usually its such a small part of a great fic too and the amount of money is never used or mentioned again. Just skip ahead several paragraphs and move on...

[1]It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to give you an edge over the house/bookmakers such that accumulative wins are greater than losses enough so that you can multiply money, if I decide that that sort of divination 'works'.

Like, if you have magic /and/ you can make lots from little or transfigure, then you can turn wrecks into nice shiny new vehicles, ratty jewels into shiny mended ones, turn cubic zirconia into whatever mineral is actually valuable on resale (not diamond), sell duplicates and run away.....

And any crappy ruin you buy, you can flip with magic, care and time and enough cash for raw materials. I bet it's not that hard to make an infitely-unrolling roll of wallpaper, or colour-change things, and canon established that faking the paperwork is pretty easy and so is polyjuice.

** I have this headcanon that the Goblin Nation hates wizards so much that if you want to get an inheritance or do anything with your vaults you need to jump through twenty three layers of bureaucracy. I saw this fic once where as part of the search for the deathly hallows they realize that he owns one of them (the cloak) and then spends like three hilarious chapters in various meeting rooms in Gringotts, and then had to fill out like twenty three forms (the directions are in the British Wizarding Financial Manual. Flourish and Blotts has one copy, which they use as a doorstop). Anyway, in essence it kind of pulls me out of the experience whenever the goblins are helpful and friendly without you paying for it. They're not your estate managers, they're not your investors. They're a goddamn bank, and the only thing they're there for is a bottom line (side note: since when does Gringotts have an infirmary/ritual room that can magically solve all health problems and get rid of horcruxes? Why is that a thing?)

Another thing that's always bothered me. If you read up on inheritance laws--especially those dealing with property inheritances... those things suck and there's heavy governmental involvement. It doesn't happen in a single meeting with the manager of your local credit union.

Plus, on the inheritance thing, do you ever want to pound your head against the wall because whoever wrote the fic obviously has no clue how lordship shit works? Like, come on. Just because you have a lordship doesn't mean you automatically sit in the house of lords (not even in the time HP wizarding world was based on), British peerage inheritances come into play at 21, and for gods sake YOU NEED A LETTER OF PATENT NOT SOME STUPID RING. Seriously. Putting on a ring with a magic woohoo is no way to run a society, even one with hereditary peerages.

Also, riches and lordships aren't always together. You could be the Duke of Everywhere and be flat broke. Besides, war is expensive and James and Dumbledore definitely spent whatever crazy amount of Galleons you used to have anyway. If anything claiming inheritances would put Harry in debt.

PS The family 'Potter' is not Ancient or Noble. That's a canon fact, and there really isn't any way you can retcon that without redefining JK's Ancient and Noble system to the point where it's designed to give your OC that you're calling Harry Potter an advantage.

Or some previous Potter is a con man where he is the heir of Hupplepuff, which he made up an thus can swear his magic to it but people be thinking....

** Ugh... that trope. What makes it worse is the authors almost inevitably drop in a multibarrel surname that includes every single family name in spite of the fact most of these have been dead for gods know how long.

​

I'll be honest, if Harry was going to inherit a bit, it would be from Potter (father) as the main family, Evans (mother) as a secondary, though unless his mother kept things separate then it's more likely that what he would be first in line for would already be in his family's vaults (the rest would be after Dudley dies without issue and Petunia is also dead presuming nothing else complicates things ala legal inheritance crud), and Black (Sirius) or at least what makes it to Sirius of that family (probably most would have been pointed at Bellatrix and Narcissa (followed by Draco) where possible though some might go to Andromeda and then Tonks). The rest are 'dead houses'. Peverell is absorbed into Potter, at least the route for the inheritance potential, since the cloak is already in their hands. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are never shown as having kids and Ravenclaw's only known child is murdered childless -- to our knowledge -- and haunts the school. For Slytherin, we only know that the Gaunts and Voldemort claimed him as an ancestor, which could be completely baloney but they believed it. Heck, Voldemort himself, while he claimed Heir of Slytherin due to parseltongue, was only really heir to Gaunt and Riddle, Slytherin having long since disbanded or absorbed in, if he had any kids that he claimed in the first place.

​

I'll be honest, I'd love to see Harry's heritage actually explored beyond 'oh, here's a vault of money from your parents' and 'oops, Sirius is dead, he left you a house, some money and an elf'. Heck that might have made a more interesting sequel, especially if it went the 'Real Life Sucks' fanfic route (linkffn(Real Life Sucks by Cheezels) of having him having to learn how to deal with adulthood.

​

The other relatively good route I've seen for 'oh, Harry's got these famous ancestors' tends to be Harry Leferts fics, particularly his Five Nights with Harry (linkffn(11474098)) and Harry Potter and the Shipgirls (on Space Battles and Sufficient Velocity), where he tends to have odd bits pop up in things, like the Potters being magpies, Lily being a pun monster and Sirius or Harry having Blackbeard as an ancestor. In both the fics mentioned (he does have others, though the one I know best goes Equestria way), Harry does stay pretty humble and tends to use the money to help others, like returning a bunch of swords to the Japanese that his family had 'picked up' or trying to rebuild the reputation and infrastructure of Freddy's Pizza, particularly since with the former IJN Nagato adopted him and the latter, he had a second aunt who was involved in the Missing Children's Incident in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.

​

I know for a fic I did recently but haven't published, I was having Azami (femHarry) being related to King Arthur, and eventually adopted by him, but it wasn't going to be like the OP's post, yes she would be an heir after, but this was after the Pendragons were resurrected in modern times having seen the changes as something similar to ghosts between their time and ours. There wasn't going to be any 'you're a princess now', just a girl getting a family that loves her and relatives that might explain some of her weirdness magnet abilities while she went the route of eventually becoming part of the naval air arm post Hogwarts with her actual cousins being ship and marine.

** Yule Ball Drama is a fic that Ive been reading that seems to take these tropes and makes something interesting out of them. McGonagall as an advisor and Hermione as his gf actually makes it somewhat fun! linkao3(Yule Ball Drama)

** Yeah, that Trope gets tiring After some time. The good thing is I found good fanfics in which Harry gets Lordships but either just two or their are not the main Part of the Story. After months of digging of course.

** I can understand Black (due to his godfather, it was likely he was made heir), Potter (duh), Peverell (also duh) and possibly Slytherin (Horcrux inheritance? Conquering rights?). Likely hood is, however, as Voldemort is from the second brothers line (Harry the third's) and is the closest relation to Slytherin alive, Harry wouldn't be able to game headship until Tom truly died. I honestly haven't listened to anything J.K.R said after the books, so I don't believe Delphini even existed. The morphing of his DNA with a unicorn and a snake most likely made him infertile anyways. It would most likely be Slytherin: a couple heirlooms, the gaunt shack Peverell: heirlooms, maybe about 100k galleons and an ancestral home Potter: 100-200k galleons, portraits, heirlooms and an ancestral home Black: 200-300k galleons, heirlooms, portraits, house elf and grimmauld place Even with 4 lordships, I doubt he would have more than 600 thousand galleons because through generations (even with one or two heirs per generation) and numerous wars, wealth dwindles.

** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) while this plays around with a lot of different things, one of the main ones is Harry being Lord, but having to actually fight against Lucius politically and generally not having everything handed to him on a silver platter. He loses, he wins, and while there are some interesting things in his vault quite a few of the additions turn out to be plot-relevant later on.

** Something else i have never seen adressed. The huge piles of money just sitting around in deep underground vaults. You wot m8?

It's a bank. Banks don't keep the money there, they use it. That's why when banks go broke, you go broke aswell. Banks don't just keep you money safe until you come to get it, they invest it and they pocket the profits. This is why banks exist. I can understand renting a vault to store items but actuall coins? It's not how it works.

*** Hate to tell you this, but for a long time, that's EXACTLY how banks worked. Gringott's isn't meant to be a modern bank with a fractional reserve, it's a 17th century style bank where you pay them to keep your money safe for you and to pay out from that stored money to people who have a letter from you.
