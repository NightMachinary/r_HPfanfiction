** There's a fun prompt somewhere on here which I've started a fic for, though haven't updated it in a while because my other fics hog most of my attention. In that prompt, Lavender's name gets pulled from the GoF instead of Harry's. In my fic, I switch POV's between the two, though you can easily focus on Harry of course. IMO it's fun to write a pairing as rare as Harry/Lavender, because 1. you get to explore a rarely used character (or if used she is just reduced to *WON-WON!!!*) and 2., if you go with canon Harry the way I do, it's fun to explore how he would behave if he were to become friendly and then start to fancy a bubbly, touchy-feely girl like Lavender.

It would be like throwing a starving man into the world's biggest "all you can eat" buffet. Harry would be totally overwhelmed, although not in a negative way. ^{^{This}} ^{^{might}} ^{^{be}} ^{^{the}} ^{^{theme}} ^{^{of}} ^{^{an}} ^{^{oneshot}} ^{^{I}} ^{^{am}} ^{^{writing.}}

Yep :D He would be totally unfamiliar with it not sure how to behave, but secretly enjoying it in his silent, subdued way. It's really fun.

I might have to get back to that fic soon.

Edit: feel free to self-promote that one-shot once it's done :o)

***** Do you have a link to your own story? Because I can't find it.

And while we are on the subject of Harry/Lavender, is there any way to write an HBP story which diverges on March 1st 1997 (Ron's 17th birthday) which does not end up dragging Ron through the mud?

Because I constantly run into situations where it would be expected for either of them to bring up how awfully Ron had treated her (and/or that Harry does/would do better). I mean, the whole divergence is Harry comforting Lavender after the breakup, so it would be kinda the main theme.

Personally, I would go about it in a rather simple way. My headcanon dramatic and larger-than-life Lavender would definitely bemoan Ron's behaviour, but I don't think Harry would delve further into that. It would just turn into another bashing fic that way. An example: let's imagine Harry and Lavender hanging out by themselves in the common room, it's late already, yadda yadda. They chat, forget the time or something. Lavender asks if Ron ever talks about her, Harry looks uncomfortable and says no. Lavender is obviously hurt and I just imagine her to be someone who would either cry and talk about all the bad things Ron did or be angry and rant about all the bad things Ron did. Harry, however, wouldn't. He'd sit there, pat her back awkwardly if she cried, or just look uncomfortable because, first, a girl is crying, and secondly, the crying girl is ranting about his best friend. I just don't think he'd be like "Oh yeah you are right Ron was a huge dick". If he ever brings up Ron's mistakes, then he'd add a "but" immediately. "Yeah, Ron was a prat, /but/ he's actually nice/he feels bad about it/he's not so bad/etc."

Those are the ways I'd go about it. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can bring up Ron's mistakes, especially from Lavender's POV, but you gotta use Harry to subdue the whole criticism thing so it doesn't become a bash-fic. IMO.

******* Thanks for the link, I know what I'll read before bed today.

Perhaps it is the scope of the story I am writing which is limiting (oneshot with less than ten separate scenes). Writing out the remaining year would make the negative Ron mentions less concentrated. And I don't want to bash Ron nor do I see Harry doing the "your ex sucks" routine, but rather a "I won't do that to you", which ends up throwing shade at Ron without really being about him (not sure how to avoid this tbh because Lavender would probably need that kind of reassurance after Ron broke up with her in favour of the weird thing he has with Hermione in HBP).

And I need to get them together very quickly since them using the RoR for some quality time is supposed to block Malfoy from using it and therefore unintentionally spoil his whole plot since he can't get the other Death Eaters into Hogwarts.

Which leads to my other Ron-related issue, that he would probably throw a fit if he is released from the hospital wing only to find out that Harry is together with his recently ex-girlfriend and that they look way more comfortable than any new couple ought to (since Harry soaks up Lavender's loving nature like a sponge). Even if Ron would not be suspectible to jealousy, that kind of time frame would make anyone suspicious.

******** Then it's probably best to start this fic pre HBP. OotP would be nice. They could have moments during DA sessions for exampleüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

********* But even if I added a whole book before, the whole premise is that Harry comes across Lavender crying after the breakup and comforts her, from where on things develop. If anything, establishing a solid Harry&Lavender friendship beforehand would add fuel to Ron's inevitable fit when he finds out since now Harry can't even argue along the lines that he has never talked for more than ten words with her. It takes away any plausible deniability.

What you are describing would be an interesting idea for an OotP story, but I've just written something very similar with Harry/Katie, so I'm not really in the mood to write a similar story again, even if Lavender would be drastically different to the Katie I ended up writing. The overall plot stations would be similar. Maybe I'll go back to my own Yule Ball idea after I'm done with the HBP one.

****** This bot really has not been working for me lately. I changed the links to normal links. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You should find my fic now. There are only 5 chapters as of yet, but talking about it made me motivated for it again lol. Chapter six might be worked on soon again.üòÅ

******* Just read it. Absolutely amazing. The plot isn't unnecessarily convoluted but straight and simple. Your characters feel believable and you manage to convey Lavender's bubbly personality really, really well.
