... Vernon snorted back a laugh involuntarily, while an expression of mild horror appeared on his face at the realization that he had found something his freak nephew said amusing.

<EDIT>

Apparently a very similar line appears in the fanfic /Oh God, Not Again/ by Sarah1281. My intention was just for Vernon reacting in humor, and being horrified at finding Harry amusing.

I did not intend to plagiarize a story. I just had an idea that made me laugh and wanted to share it.

On a side note, I think one has to take more than a single line similar to one that appears in another story to be a plagiarist.

*** now I want to see that a timeline where vernon is an aspiring stand up comic.

he actually liked harry's father in this timeline because James potter had so many wacky stories from his school days.

Vernon looked Gruffly at a young harry who had just asked about his parents 'I did not know your parents well, but they had a great sense of humour' Harry looked shocked uncle vernon who watchs tv and complains about the delivery of the comedians on it thought his parents where funny.

I picture vernon acting like a fan watching sports complaining about how the sports man is behaving but only with comedy. "Should have left a bigger pause before the punchline'' '' that Joke was too safe and predictable'' ''this carlin guy is great, wish he was on tv more''

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  "Funny way to get to wizards' school, the train. Magic Carpets all got punctures, have they?"

  "No, but they're illegal in Britain, and I doubt they'd trust us to go straight to school and not let ourselves be seen if we each had one. Not to mention how expensive it would be..."

Clearly it's a 1:1 identical quote.

You do realize this sort of thing crops up a /lot/ in this fandom? There are over 800,000 /Harry Potter/ fanfics on Fanfiction.net alone. For just about every idea that can be had, someone is bound to have thought of it before.

Nearly every prompt that gets any attention on this sub will have fanfic recs because someone already had the idea and wrote it, probably several times.
