One year ago (close to five in character years), we released [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][/Model Hogwarts/]], a [[https://discordapp.com/][Discord]] role-playing simulation for wizards and witches who /just/ missed their acceptance letters. Just to catch you up:

The Model so far has been a resounding success! Classes have been going by fairly consistently for the duration of the model, we have active players roleplaying every day and the model continues to refine itself mechanically, with a full spellcasting system capable of allowing you to practise and cast pretty much any spell in the Harry Potter canon-and quite a few more besides!

We've also had over four years of consistent storytelling, with each IC year boasting a self-contained narrative arc that includes everyone and helps to really emphasise the spirit of adventure and magic at the heart of the setting, along with some seeds being sown for a wider arc spanning multiple years. The students have had big wins, like talking down a murderous ghost and convincing him to join the staff (don't ask), big losses, like the time the students were manipulated into resurrecting a powerful serial killer and releasing her into the world (really, don't ask) and much more besides!

Regarding classes, we have all the basics like Charms, DADA, Transfiguration, Potions, etc as well as a few original world-building classes like Path To Success. We're also offering electives to third years and up! The reason we are posting this ad today is that due to the growth of the model, we need more than one professor per subject, so we are opening up applications for all subjects! We currently have nine subjects which are actively looking for professors - *Ancient Runes, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, History of Magic, Magical Theory, Muggle Studies, Potions, and Transfiguration* - but we accepting applications for the other subjects as well.

** *What this means for you as a professor?*

You get to join a team of super passionate teachers who want you to succeed in whatever subject you want to teach! You get access to a castle of students (we currently have about 160 active students!) and as much creativity as you can dream of. You would teach one one hour class a week, depending on your availability and the availability of your students, you may teach one or multiple years, either first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth year. depending on what is decided by you and your colleagues. You get a small class size of 5-20 on average of engaged students (depending on the year).

** *What Makes Being a Professor at Model Hogwarts unique?*

   :END:
At Model Hogwarts, we do our absolute best to make sure our professors have both the support, and creative liberty they need to make their subject unique, and robust. We have a Department system, where multiple professors teach each subject. So once you join you'll have fellow professors teaching that subject to help you out! Furthermore, most of these subjects do have some existing worldbuilding, however we also encourage our professors to think of new ideas, and you will get the freedom as a professor to further build your subject. We also have a variety of custom-made bots just for the server, including a bot that allows you to learn and cast spells. Upon your selection as a professor, you will have an office channel where you can roleplay with other students! Professors are also more than welcome to take part in plots, and other events around the castle, and are encouraged to do so!

** *What do you need to be a professor?*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what-do-you-need-to-be-a-professor
   :END:
First of all, you need to love Harry Potter. You need to be willing to devote an hour or two every week to classes, but we hope you'll have so much fun that you'll stay longer. You need to be passionate about making this project succeed, and invested in its future. You need to be able to work well with others, and be creative!

So, if you're interested, apply! We'd love to have you, so start packing your suitcase, Hogwarts offers a great (/very safe/) opportunity for teachers, and is world renown! Fill out our quick [[https://goo.gl/forms/Zv7Nam7J8FMLhT0s1][application]] and then hop onto our [discord server.](([[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM]]). If you're curious has to how the classes run, join the discord server and ask for the Peanut Gallery role; you'll be able to observe and read the history of previous classes!

*** Doesn't /Model Hogwarts/ count as fanfiction, though? I would consider roleplaying of this sort a genre of fanfiction, making advertisement of /Model Hogwarts/ no different from making a post to promote /hpfanfiction.com/ or some other such website.

**** I would consider a post to promote /hpfanfiction.com/ (RIP) would also qualify because it is promoting a website (albeit a website about fanfiction).

** Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for the position of Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. You will find me a first-rate scholar and a charismatic teacher, who gets along with both students and staff alike, and who is totally not evil. Please find my resume and [[https://imgur.com/gallery/s1H9M][a recent picture]] attached. Letters of reference are available from Prof Horace Slughorn and Headmaster Armando Dippet.

Sincerely,

Theodore ("Tod") Malboro Biddle

*** IIRC there's some very specific rules on when you can read minds, and there has to be OOC agreement (I mean, how else are you even going to get the info on what they're thinking)

Avada Kedavra likewise has some really restrictive rules. I honestly don't remember how it works, but probably it takes permission from the person you are killing. Meaning they are wanting to start a new character or leave, probably. And of course, it is an unforgivable so if you're caught there are consequences, but I forget what they are.
