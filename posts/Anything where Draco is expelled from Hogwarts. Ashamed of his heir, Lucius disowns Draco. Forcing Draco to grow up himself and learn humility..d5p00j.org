**** Me too.

I have never read a Draco fanfiction. If it has him as any kind of centerpiece I usually simply do not click on them, because I got burned so hard the first three times I did.

Like, there is many fics that try to explain away that he is at best an arsehole and at worst a racist would-be murderer.

Many authors simply cannot or do not want to write an arc for him that redeems truly. Like maybe with a slight kick in his behind from others, but apart from that on his own.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** For some reason this request made me think of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully]]). Idk why, it's got next to nothing to do with draco, but I guess if you want to see the dark forces drown in everything they wanted, and dracos son being a good person, there it is.
