** As a massive Star Wars fan, I mostly like your titles. The only one I don't like is Battle of Hogwarts. It's too much of a singular event and not enough of an overarching moment. Look at STAR WARS EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES. While this may be a bit of a description of the Battle of Geonosis, it's not quite a literal title. It's more of a description of the clones mere existence on the Galaxy and the Jedi. Not sure what would be a good title for DH. I'm not a super creative man, but I'll give it some thought.

My two favorites would definitely be A New Beginning (though maybe Birth of Hope might be better?) and the clear winner is Shadow of Slytherin. Christ on a bike that's good. Second least favorite would be The Dark Lord's Secret.

*** How about Harry Potter: Episode 7: Attack on Hogwarts or Harry Potter: Episode 7: Reign of Voldemort. To be fair, I had trouble with book 7.

** Lol nice! The titles work out really well, although in Harry Potter the prequels are the good movies lol. Not that the latter ones are bad, just the first three are my favorite personally.

*** Are you implying the first three Star Wars movies aren't the best?

**** That's the meme isn't it that the prequels are bad? I mean I didn't like Jar Jar, but I didn't think the movies were terrible personally.
