** Wow this fic is amazing. You have an excellent ear for character voices, and your interpretations of original characters/ones not expanded on in the books are exciting and fleshed out. You also have a great style of writing, and it's a joy to read. I'm really liking the storyline

**** Do you have any plans? OC, Daphne?

I believe that Harry should have someone that knows about pure bloods and she can that one.

Only if you slowly build their relationships and Haphne be great. No unnecessary drama please.

Edit: Nevermind. Saw that it starts from 4th year and I doubt that you can start anything between Harry and Daphne out of the blue now that you are in 5th year

*** This is an AU, that grants the concept of familial based magics and what I think magic would look like.

My end goal for the fic is to wrap up and have a sense of completeness. Magic in my world makes sense but doesnt at the same time. Its something that can be taught by more than just showing. Magic is also more than just a wand movement. If it was there wouldnt be anything separating great wizards. My fic explores this. I also avoid alot of tropes. I hate magical cores, so i crush that in the first five chapters. I hated the generic triwizard cup, so i made it different. I hated the lord potter idea... So i twisted to be unrecognizable. I hate manipulative evil dumbledore... So i made sure my dumbledore had a clear reason for his decisions or that one would appear.

So I guess, i just wanted a good Harry Potter story that wasnt a peggy sue and was fun. I wanted a story that had magical combat actually look like magical combat and not magical gun play.

The end is mapped out. I know who dies and when and even how. Im having fun writing it. So i guess thats it really. I just wanted to have something enjoyable.

*** Ginny isnt featured at all (as of now), and Hermione and Ron are the only pairing that exist at the moment.

Harry and Ginny is my most hated pairing. I also dont think that Harry, knowing what he knows in my story, would bother dealing with a relationship.

** I've read the first few chapters; here are my first impressions. I'm cognizant of the fact that your later chapters are probably much better due to practice. I'm going to include less praise because I think you've gotten a lot of it from other people and rightfully so.

Your writing has a few noticeable obvious errors every so often. Your sentence structure feels bland at times (in my opinion) and I got an impression of a writing style that's heavily influenced by other writers. The second is neither good nor bad, simply an observation.

The plot itself hints towards a lot of tropes and common plot points. I can't tell at this point if it's executed well or poorly. I will say that in my experience, most stories with a grimoire that will elevate Harry to the level of Dumbledore and Voldemort usually make me wary. Should a teenager be able to duel the likes of Dumbledore with decades of experience? It also raises questions. How did the Potters, with access to this supposedly powerful grimoire, die to Voldemort?

Overall, it seems promising. I'll come back and edit this with my thoughts once I read more.

*** Alright, I've read a little further. A combination of grammatical errors, common tropes such as the argument with Hermione over house elves, and contrived and common plot points which stretch the imagination such as the singular spell amplifying his magic to easily rival Dumbledore's is keeping me from taking this fic too seriously.

Overall, it's a good start. Not many writers could take the time to write 124 thousand words. It just has a lot of common issues that initial writers tend to run into. You tell a lot as opposed to show, and it's clear that the worldbuilding is shaped around your desire for a powerful Harry.

It's good and shows work but the quality is not there. The main issue is the plot.

5/5 for effort

2.5/5 for quality

*** I can see that. I wont lie, I needed and honestly could still use a beta. If there are tropes and i dont doubt there are for my grimoire genre, its not my intent to hit them... This sounds terrible but ive never read a grimoire fic other than mine.

As for dueling Voldemort... My Voldemort isnt a homicidal idiot who has a ton of power. He loves to kill and torture, but he is much more than just pure evil. He is also cranked up to 200,cuz if Im cranking up Harry, you bet im gonna make Voldie a threat still.
