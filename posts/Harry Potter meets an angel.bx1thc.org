** Voldemort is fucked

10 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 11 or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD; because of these same detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. 13 You must be blameless before the LORD your God.

but so is harry and ron and every other wizard

** I don't understand it. Who/what was she? What happened to Harry? Who was the second teenager, what did he throw at Harry, who was the audience, why did Harry charge the angel, and why did he faint at the Pearly Gates?
