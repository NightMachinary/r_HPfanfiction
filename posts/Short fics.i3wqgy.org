What are the best short fics you have come across? Often times this sub requests "novel length" fixs but I usually find they take a thousand words to state what should be said in a hundred.

So, what are your favorite short fics? They don't have to be super short, it doesn't have to be a one shot, though please do share your favorite one shots. Just any fic that concisely and effectively tells its story without all the extra bloat.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

  Everyone knows that the seventh son of the seventh son has great magical abilities, that they are destined to become great.But a sixth son of a seventh son? That's nothing special. There's no guarantee of magic or heroics or special gifts. Just a little boy with lanky limbs and earnest eyes and a face splattered in generations of freckles, who grows up knowing that he's nothing but a footnote to the glory of his older siblings.Ron Weasley grows up as a shadow. Every single one of his older siblings is extraordinary, in their own way- Bill, the exceptional linguist and cursebreaker; Charlie, the dragon tamer; Percy, head boy and prefect; the twins, inventors extraordinaire. His entire life, Ron is compared to them by everyone he knows and always falls just a little short, no matter how hard he tries.Is it any surprise that Ron wants more out of life, that when he arrives at Hogwarts, bastion of magical opportunity and the chance to change his fate, that he takes it?

** I hate short one-shots. I hate one-shots of little substance when it comes to plot. I hate one-shots that are meant to elicit cheap emotions like fluff fics.

Even I can admit that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]] is good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is a great example of a short novel. Unique premise, excellent action, superb magic system, and great writing style with the sole caveat of lacking editing in some areas. I can't recommend it enough.
