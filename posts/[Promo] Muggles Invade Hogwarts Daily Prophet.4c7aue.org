** Haha that's pretty funny. Dennis is Muggleborn though, isn't he? He's writing a bit like someone who isn't.

**** Yeah, especially if I believe what Marvel and DC comics taught me about newspaper editors.

Now I'm imagining J Jonah Jameson going off at Rita Skeeter...mwahaha! He does hate bugs and spiders and stuff...and I could see his birthday being a sad, miserable affair. How on earth did that get printed in his own paper?? I assume Rita did that?

** This was fun to read, thanks for sharing! There was a tiny detail that bothered me. In the passage about Hogwarts apparating, Tokyo is mentioned as one of the locations, but the park in Japan isn't in Tokyo, it's in Osaka. I hope everyone who gets a copy enjoy reading this, they definitely need to appreciate the work you put into this!

** The paper should at least compare HeForShe to SPEW.
