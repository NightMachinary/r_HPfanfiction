Its a pansy/Harry ship that sorta redesigns the Pansy character, but it doesn't completely stretch the characters into something they are not.


** Surprisingly?

WKGQ was one of the first fic I read, and one of my all time favorites. When I re-read it, it isn't as good as I remember. But I remember it very fondly if for no other reason that it was the first time I remember seeing a believable Harry/SlytherinFemale story.

**** Pansy can be a surprisingly strong female lead, though it is hard to make it believable without Harry becoming a bit grey himself.

I've seen each of the Slytherin main females done well, though Tracy is usually boring without Daphne (think Hannah without Susan...) and Mili is...always an interesting choice.

Pansy makes a really good Tsundere for a harem setting too. I didn't even realize I was writing her that way in one of my stories. It's been done for almost 2 years and I only just realized it.

** Surprisingly, I enjoyed reading it. I generally do not read stories that contradict my preferred ship (H/Hr). I will read/ship Hermione with other people, but never Harry. This fic had even me shipping Harry/Pansy. Though the end did piss me off somewhat.

*** I've been a fan of Tim Joy's (Jeconais's) stories for awhile. Most of his work is excellent and quite polished for fanfiction, though you do have to accept that Harry's pretty much over-the-top over-powered, meaning that they're often more about style than drama with any real tension. I consider them to be the fanfiction equivalent of eating comfort food. I'm less entranced by his more recent stories, which seem to have gone downhill since /Happily Ever After/, but his earlier work is worth reading.

Some recommendations, all of which are linked from [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais's page on fanficauthors.net]]:

/Hope/ is very good, a complete, novel-length piece; the pairing is Harry/Gabrielle Delacour, set post-Hogwarts.

/Perfect Situations/ (and sequel) is quite well done for a Harry/Daphne Greengrass pairing, though it'll feel clich√©. I believe that it started the "Daphne as Slytherin Ice Queen" meme.

/This Means War/ is a bit crackish (at one point, Harry rides a dragon into outer space), but one of the quintessential Harry/Ginny tales. Also novel-length and complete.

/The Object Lessons Trilogy/ is amusing, especially given its prompt. "Hey Tim, I bet you could write a story about Harry going to get a glass of water and everyone would read it."

/Perfect Slytherins/ is one of the best Harry Potter/Addams Family crossovers you'll find.

/Best Man/ is a longish one-shot, a Harry/Fleur teaser, that's nicely done.

Incidentally, Jeconais was one of the most popular fanfiction writers back during the lull between OOtP and HBP; he originated many of the tropes that have become hackneyed by now.

*** Reading happily ever after right now.

It's borderline crack but it's entertaining.

And read hermione's plan on ff.net And that was good
