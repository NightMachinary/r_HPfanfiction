:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is probably a long shot, but I figured I'd try. There was a fanfic I read a long, long, looong time ago that had Harry attending a school other than Hogwarts. Pretty much all I remember is that he was a duke, so his friends ended up calling him Duke as a nickname. I think he had that on his sports jersey instead of Potter. I believe he played both football and quidditch in it. I'm pretty positive that he did not live with the Dursley's anymore, and was instead with a really nice foster family, where he had an attic bedroom, but that could be a different fic I'm thinking of.

I don't think it was ever finished, and I suspect that it's been deleted, but maybe this sounds familiar to someone? It keeps popping up in my head for some reason, and it's driving me crazy.
