I either forgot or have been reading too much fanfiction but I need to know where it came form. The etiquette the Fandom created when greeting/politely leaving a Goblin. A sentence that is mostly a morbid and violent inclinations.

examples; "May your blade be ever sharp and your vaults filled with gold." " May your enemies bleed out their ears and lose all the change in their pockets." "May your enemies bleed and suffer in silence alone."

I'm just curious if this is a other media custom or something the fandom made up. For some reason the back of my brain says it comes from star trek. Anyways, any comments are welcome.


** Star Trek, the Klingons had these weird ways of greeting, due to their cultural differences it sounded weird.

Like, their toast means, "May your Blood Scream!" their greetings are "What do you want?" and if they want to ask "How are you?" they say "Are you healthy?" kind of disregarding feelings.

They also have no direct equivalent to "Thank You."(Yes, Star Trek did it first.)

I also seem to recall in DS9 Martok saying something about 'may your blades be sharp', and I think the Ferengi had lots of phrases relating to money and gold.

And since many make the Goblins be like a fusion between those two cultures(lol, they absolutely /hate/ each other, truly hate.)

The Vulcans of course with the classic "Live Long and Prosper."

It may have also come from the Dothraki who also have different expressions that would sound aggressive.

Many other media have things like this, IIRC Dune had it, Stargate, even LOTR. It's just instances where one culture equivalent of a phrase/greeting doesn't carry the same feeling from our regular ones.

EDIT: Just adding, many medieval movies have stuff like that, but not as a greeting just as an idiom, stuff like "May the blood of our enemies be spilled tonight!","May our coffers fill with gold!" and "May you always find health and happiness in your path."

I always thought that it was because the Ferengi were an over the top caricature of Jewish stereotypes in space, and the Goblins are often portrayed as over the top caricatures of Jewish stereotypes in not-space, and then fanfic authors decided that there was enough overlap between the two to make Goblins Ground!Ferengi.

I have no input on the topic at hand, but I find it kinda funny this is a ~weird alien culture thing~ when that's literally what people say in Japan. "お元気ですか" → "Are you healthy?" Not too surprising, though, that fiction draws from reality!

*** I am pretty sure this was thing before Harry Crow. But I believe he does touch upon the idea in A Kiss.

** Strange greetings from another culture?

Probably originated in real life in ancient history.

** This is so funny to me because it's so true! It pops up all over the place. It feels like a very general fantasy trope, but I'm so curious.
