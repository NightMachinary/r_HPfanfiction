If I was a terrorist and had the power of the Control Curse I would zap as many innocent people as I could and get them to do my dirty work. It would mess with their conscience if they ever got out, and when Edgelord Hadrian kills them he's gonna get a bitter surprise.

But not all stories where Harry kills them are doing it to be edgy, sometimes they just genuinely think it's ok to kill them all. So in that case, can we get a grieving widow and child who hate Harry for killing their husband/father when all he did was go shopping and then get forced to do something against his will?


** In my story "Divided and Entwined", the "collateral damage" done by the people fighting Voldemort drives a number of wizards and witches into Voldemort's arms. Daphne and Tracey end up orphaned, for example.

There are also other unintended consequences - Umbridge's death, for example, derails Dumbledore's efforts to get the anti-muggleborn laws repealed.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
