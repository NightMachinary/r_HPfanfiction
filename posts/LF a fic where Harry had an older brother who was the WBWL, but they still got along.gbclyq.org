Their positions were switched. Basically Harry's brother had red hair and was raised in foster care(he kept running away though) , and Harry was still raised by the Dursleys. They meet before Harry's older brothers first year. The older brother lets the fame go to his head, but only slightly. Harry's a Slytherin, and I distinctly remember Snape being the one to tell him that he's a wizard, and calling him Wednesdays Child, because of an old poem. I also think that the brother or Harry was a slight kleptomaniac. Thanks!


** From the nursery rhyme "Monday's Child" Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace, /Wednesday's child is full of woe/, Thursday's child has far to go, Friday's child is loving and giving, Saturday's child works hard for a living, And the child that is born on the Sabbath day, Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.

Edit: my phone hates format and loves autocorrecting away commas...

** Is this it? This one looks like Harry is the one in foster care but a skim of the first two chapters makes it seem like it might fit. Linkffn(4960397)

  In 1981, the two Potter sons had their fates switched, and Nicolas Potter became a famous face. But there are those who know the truth, that the real Chosen One was the younger child. The Slytherin. Now, two brothers share a destiny. Complete.
