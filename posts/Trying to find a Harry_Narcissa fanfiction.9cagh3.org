Hello people, ive been trying to find an older fanfiction that was posted on ff.net a couple of years back and has since been deleted. From what I can remeber it had Narcissa and harry meeting at the quidditch world cup just before harry starts his fourth year. A relationship then develops. Narcissa becomes a professor at hogwarts and tutors harry. Does anybody remember this story, have any idea what this fic was called or who wrote it? Its been driving me crazy! Thanks in advance ðŸ˜ƒ

*** Is it any good? The premise sounds... interesting...

**** It's certainly /interesting./ It's Harry/Narcissa/Lily. With a little bit of Fleur, too. There's a bunch of smut, but surprisingly some plot as well.

But it's abandoned and it honestly got to a point where I just wanted Harry to ditch both Narcissa and Lily (something about 30-40 year olds fighting over a 14 yr old boy makes me roll my eyes) and just get with Fleur.
