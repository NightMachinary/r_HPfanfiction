Actually intelligent characters always fascinated me, especially in HP fanfiction even though there a few and far in between, and intelligence is often confused with diligence. What Tom Riddle archieved and how intelligent he was despite his upbringing (there is a proven link between neglect and low intelligence) is amazing. Horrible, but amazing. Though he became more simple and dumb the more he spiraled out of control/split up his soul. I would love to read a story that explores what could have been, that gives him at least a chance to fight his demons.

It always bothered me to ne end how badly Dumbledore handled his first meeting with Tom, who was obviously a deeply disturbed and traumatized child. How he treated him literally goes against everything everyone who has ever worked with (vulnerable, traumatized) children knows.

Romance is okay, but not with a mentor/parental figure and I look for something more realistic than a 16yo Tom falling for perfect!Hermione, because she is oh-so-clever and suddenly all his darkness disappears.

The main focus should be Tom or/and how the relationship to this person changes him.

** linkffn(Rectifier) Incomplete, but quite good. It's about an alternative dimension Tom Riddle researcher that has come to the canon universe. It does a good job of exploring a possible reason for him turning "good" while still keeping him in character. Although the divergence from canon is during his Hogwarts years, not childhood. The changes are a direct result of slightly different events and actions on Dumbledore's part.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.

** As someone has already mentioned, Red Right Hand is a great story with time-traveling Hermione as a parental figure. I'd like to recommend linkffn(10280298) too as an interesting take on his orphanage days and what would've happened if Tom had had an equal growing up.

** Sam Storyteller's [[https://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] has a redeemed Tom Riddle. (And it's outstanding writing.)

  Summary: In an alternate universe, one man still struggles with a moral decision made many years before.
