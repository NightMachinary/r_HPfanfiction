Can you guys recommend me any fics where Harry was born to the Marauders Era or the 2nd world war? Or any other era?

Also are there any good ones where he is reborn and remembers his past life?


** There's a really great one about his past lives, but it's a HP/LV fic. It's still good, but not everyone's cup of tea. Story: His Twenty-Eighth Life [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12597395/64]]

Here's a few about time travel.

Story: Timely Errors [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/2]] Harry is sent to his father's time by a 'time sand' mishap.
