Are there any fics where Voldemort does actually manage to get the prophecy?

Interested in knowing how it would have changed his plans post the attack in DoM.

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there.

***** It's pretty unique. The divination worldbuilding in particular is second to none.

** I mean, if you use the canon prophecy, why would it change anything? The principle that someone who could be Harry is a threat to someone who is probably him is conveyed in the part he already knows. He may have bumped up the priority of Harry's death, but I suspect he would have still focussed on Dumbledore as the more immediate threat in HBP and he made Harry public enemy No. 1 in DH anyway.

*** The part where prophecy says Harry has powers the dark lord knows not will surely bug Voldemort. For a wizard who considers himself a master of the art, who claims to have explored magic to its furthest depths? Oh, it will bug him.

***** Nope, if I'm remembering correctly he only got up to the 7th month dies bit. (The Prophecy being; person capable of taking out Tom is about to be born, specifically to parents that have defied him three times and at the end of July, Tom will identify them as an equal and they will be capable of something that Tom isn't, they are the only one who can kill Tom and he is the only one who can kill them, and neither can live their lives to the fullest while the other still breathes. Paraphrased of course.)

** smoke and mirrors (hide our destiny). No detailed reaction though and it was more because the author wondered why Voldemort couldn't just enter the DOM himself.
