** For fics focused on their romance, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861?view_adult=true][half awake and almost there]] and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24745156/chapters/59824753][mind the gap]] by Annerb, linkao3(8941561;24745156), are excellent.

For fics featuring them as a couple and in a major role, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is the best. This is however not a Muggle AU, but a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  Dating Ginny Weasley, it turned out, was not easy. Harry still had every intention of finding a way to make it work--time constraints, elections, nosy press, reluctant best friends, parents, and all. (sequel to half awake and almost there)

#+begin_quote
  It's been eight month since Ginny broke up with her cheating boyfriend and now she was invited to his sister's wedding. There were two reasons she agreed to go. To show her ex what he was missing out on because she was going to look fabulous, and to hook up. But then she met Harry. Muggle AU
