Crossover with F/SN during the fifth grail war. Harry is summoned as a servant. Knowledge of F/SN is recommended if you want to fully enjoy the fic.

Also it's indefinitely put on hold, but I like the fic enough to recommend it here.

  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.

Doctor who crossover in multiple parts. Has a post-war Harry giving ideas to young JK Rowling. But it's not a main part of a story and it's a slash fic.
