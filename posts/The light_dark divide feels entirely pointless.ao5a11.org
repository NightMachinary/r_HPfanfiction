Beyond an easy heuristic to mark the bad guys, the whole distinction feels like a oversimplification of the underlying issue. For example, using "dark magic" to slaughter a village isn't the deplorable part, the fifty counts of murder are. Using the Cruciatus isn't the bad part, torturing someone is. Using water or physical force would be just as atrocious. The same can be said for pretty much every "dark" curse.

And at the flip side, why would the use of the killing curse be considered immoral against a bunch of magical Nazis? In a war both sides use guns yet you do not condemn the gun, you condemn the attacker for his acts of war and do your best to kill them.

And the frequently mentioned argument that "dark" magic requires hate and the intent to kill, hence making it evil. But if a bunch of fascists, who already killed a few of your friends, break into your house and intend to rape your daughter and kill your spouse, who wouldn't want to see them dead? Even countries with strict gun control grant you the right to lethal self defence if appropriate.

So why do so many authors turn spell selection into a deep, almost religious divide?


** I may be totally off-base with this since I'm speaking completely anecdotally, but in my experience, back in the heyday of HP fanfiction, a lot of fics kind of scrapped any light/dark distinction and ran with the idea that magic was neither light nor dark, but it was how it was used by wizards that made the moral distinction. I reckon, partially because canon sort of codifies dark magic as magic that is powered by malevolent emotion which can be likened as "evil," and partially because the whole no bad magic thing was starting to get stale because it usually signified the fic was going to be super edgelord, fics started to come back to the idea that there can be unambiguously good/light magic, as well as unambiguously evil/dark magic. It's neither good nor bad, because I've seen both ways of magic done very well, but there's a lot of garbage as well.

*** Yeah, it's all cyclical. There was a big boom of authors rebelling against Rowling's (perceived) world and having L/D magic be solely in the intent of the person using it, then a renaissance of L/D magic with some property inherent to dark magic can corrupt you, with or without light magic.

You can almost think of it like fashion trends in microcosm, similar to how dominant Harry pairings swing around from H/G, H/Hr, to H/T and other characters as the fandom evolves.

** Im with you, though maybe I am projecting my real life opinions into the type of fiction I prefer. I always dislike it when people give an intrinsic sense of morals to objects or tools. If you want to, you can most likely go on a rampage and kill people with a normal fork or kitchen knife. There isnt any mystical attribute decided by the Universe that says forks are evil. You are. As in, whoever is sick enough to go on a killing spree.

What I appreciate in fanon though, at least from what I noticed, is that authors make "Dark" Magic into a bit of a drug, which creates addiction and alters your personality if you use it too much. Its a bit more similar to the Dark Side of Star Wars. And speaking of SW, I cant guarantee, but Im pretty sure thats where this dogmatic view originates from, for a great deal of authors.

Sidenote, but how funny and anticlimactic would have been if, during the Triwizard tournament, Harry just used the Killing Curse on every beast coming at him and one shot everything lmao.

E.g. an axe, hammer and sword are all infantry weapons, but the sword has no other practical use outside battle with other humans.

** I always think of how Dresden Files pulls off dark magic. That you have to believe that you can and should do it. That you should use your power to torture/ kill/ enslave someone. That it gets easier and easier to use the spells.

In HP it's the same thing, but more well hidden. You have to truly hate someone and want to see them suffer to be able to cast Crucio. If someone is able to cast it once, then they'll be able to do it again later, they just need to draw upon those feelings.

So I don't think the whole light dark thing is about the inherit “evilness” of the spell. It's about how the spell affects you.

** People like a natural dichotomy in things, and if there's none, they try to create it to make categorization of stuff easier. Is it hot or cold? Is it ligh or dark? Is it good or bad to eat? Is it near or far? Of course, there's subjectivity in all things, but that's what makes it interesting. Someone builds a world and delineates what's or bad within it. Now their job is to present it to you in a way it feels reasonable.

​

The problem and the awkwardness sets on when they fail to do so, in my opinion. "It's dark because I said so" just does not cut it.

​

The way I see it: generally, if you want to punch someone in the face because you don't like their opinion, you're considered a bad guy. Along these lines, if you want to use spells that are specifically designed to cause harm, and you'd be hard pressed to find any use for them - bingo, you're a bad/dark wizard.

​

My memory might not be the best one, but the Order of the Phoenix played a reactive, rather than active role in the books. They guarded stuff and people, they relocated and mapped and planned, but they never forced a confrontation that I can remember. They never pushed with the intent to harm, they just reacted to immediate threats. Although this could have been because of their small numbers, it goes wel with my analogy. They were not aggressive, their intent was not to harm, but to protect.

​

I'm kind of wandering farther from your point, but the "intentional harm" spells are dark magic, and a wizard who's volatile is a dark wizard. Everyone else falls into another category in my opinion.

I agree with your point, you can/should use them in self defense, but not everybody is cut out for immediate escalation to lethal force. And I think that's the difference between good and bad. You can't count on the intruders being nice to you and ask you for your belongings. You expect them to try to overpower you and take them by whatever force necessary. Whereas you can easily opt to incapacitate them instead of causing permanent damage (including death).

While you are justified, there's still excessive force in self defence, too, I think.

  The light/dark divide feels entirely pointless

Oh, how fortunate indeed, then, that "Light Magic" is not a canonical concept whatsoever. Magic designed to be used to harm others is called Dark Magic, but that's the extent of it.

#+begin_quote
  And at the flip side, why would the use of the killing curse be considered immoral against a bunch of magical Nazis?
#+end_quote

Because it's an /evil/ curse, theorizes fanon. It's not evil in itself to kill for the greater good, but, fanon further explains, the Killing Curse works only if you really have murderous intent, not if you have "I hate to do this but it's for the greater good" intent.

Of course, there's some debate on whether this fits canon; Professor Dumbledore, when asking Professor Snape to kill him, certainly /seems/ to be arguing that the Curse isn't actually inherently evil and can be used with a clear conscience. But the common fanonical interpretation of his statements is that the Killing Curse still requires murderous intent, but Snape was able to Occlumentically focus on murderous intent in the moment; so that the whole "is it evil to kill a dying man who asks you to do so?" argument concerns Snape's later coming to terms with what he's done, not the casting itself, which Snape could always manage either way.

#+begin_quote
  and do your best to kill them.
#+end_quote

Maybe /you/ do. I sure don't. I do my best to prevent them from killing people; if the only practical way to do that is to kill them so be it, but I'm not /aiming/ for that in the abstract, and if I can capture them non-lethally and stick them in jail that's much better.

I think the phrase you're looking for is "necessary evil". Which still has the word "evil" in the title. Lethal magic can be considered evil without that necessarily issuing a blanket-ban on it for the "good guys" under any circumstance, in much the same way that I believe that murder is inherently evil but acknowledge that since the world isn't perfect, killing people is sometimes necessary to save a greater number.

** Gun is tool. You can shoot a gun for any reason, accidentally, to kill, to maim, to threaten, cause you are scared, etc. Also you have no other choice, it's shoot or nothing.

Some spells are like that too. But some are different, they are direct product of your intention. There is no accidentally killing someone with Avada, as we know. And despite the common fanon trope, I don't think you can use Cruciatus to wake a patient out of coma, it's not a nerve stimulant. You need to want to torture the person in order for the curse work and they would just magically feel terrible pain.

Dark magic is a product of evil intentions (plus extra stuff what got labeled dark unfairly). Philosophically you can argue that evil is relative, like you can say killling the criminal from you example may not be evil. But a lot of people will disagree, hence the dark/light or grey divide.

Also with magic you can use non-lethal spells, turn someone into a chair or stun them. You have a extra choice.

Basically, in those fanfics Harry realizes how standard spells can be used to kill people, while dark curses can be used for good, therefore there is no dark magic, but "only power and those too weak to seek it".

******** Wait, I didn't? I never made a point that magic was useless in a fight. My point was that using non-lethal spells in a duel is a legit choice, even if Killing curse is extra dangerous. That there is no reason to think that all non-dark spells are easy to cancel.

In a fight Dolohov's spell or Sectusempra doesn't seem to give you much advantage over vanishing arm bones, diffindo or even disarming. It the lasting consequences that give them the dark twist, like permanent amputation. But most people wouldn't want that even for DE.

** One of the things that really kills my mood is when Dumbledore is called "Leader of the Light". It's a ridiculous expression. Also, he isn't much of a leader. He wasn't even much of a Headmaster, letting both Snape and at times the whole school bully Harry.

It reminds me of when the American president is called "Leader of the Free World". No, he isn't. He isn't even leader of half the free world. Europe has twice the population of the US.

That's not to say there aren't good fics that use the concept (if there weren't, no one would still be recc'ing them), I'm just saying, when you have something as apparently arbitrary as magic being divided into different shades like a political field (Light, Dark, and Gray), it kinda loses that arbitrary feeling. Huh. Leave it to politics to make even */magic/* sound boring.

Also makes me wonder where the other colors are, in terms of magical politics. Where's Blue? Orange? Brown. Purple!

I hope you all see my point.

** The unforgivables aren't just torturing someone or killing them or forcing them to do something. Killing someone with an AK takes the same cold-blooded intent to kill that killing someone slowly with a thousand cuts does - the mentality that goes into being able to successfully cast the spell is psychopathic and evil. Killing others is bad, but being able to end a sentient life with absolutely no regret, no guilt, no second thoughts whatsoever, that's a whole other level. Even the worry that your aim could be off and you could hit someone else would be (in my head canon) enough to make you incapable of casting the AK.

Just so we're clear, you're argument is: The torture curse is bad. But when Harry uses the torture curse to torture somebody it's okay because he also threw them into some furniture and knocked them out cold. Do I have it right?

Let's be honest, the problem is you called Harry an evil psychopath on accident and now you're trying to walk it back but it can't be done because you are trying to make an argument that is absolute and those don't exist in the real world, context always has to be considered.

No where did I say that it was ok for Harry to attempt the curse, I was only saying that he did not have the mentality required to cast it properly. Yes, he was not in control of the curse, which is precisely my point. He didn't have it in him to be in control of a crucio. What's the point of this debate?

#+end_quote

Because honestly, it kind of is. JKR is a practicing Christian, and many of the canon characters are implied to be CoE by default. Christians are taught not to hate their enemies, so a spell that is fueled by hate is seriously corrupting by that standard.

Now, this would explain it for canon and /some/ fanfic authors. (Myself included. I don't think I've made a secret of that.) I suspect fanfic authors do have a higher than average percentage of atheists and agnostics, but most of them also live in western societies where these ideas pervade the culture whether you believe or not.

I will grant, though, that in fanon, a lot of it is a matter of just taking canon and running with it...and the fact that fanfic authors probably have a higher percentage of Star Wars fans, too.

** A headcanon I have is that back in the early days of magic the intention behind the curses were more spiritual. For example Avada Kedavra was originally based off the intention to support your life with the death of an animal, or to end the suffering of a dying or crippled soul. Or Imperio, used to herd cattle to their protection and guide animals to the slaughterhouse without fear, so they may live and die in peace. The emotions to power the spells weren't malevolent in intent, and were born out of a sense of duty to nature and whatever deities they worshipped.

My theory is that over the centuries people realised that they could be twisted by other emotions, such as greed, desperation, rage. So people began to forget that there was an entirely different purpose or way of casting these spells. Then the witch burnings and the industrial revolution happened and wizards got their weird blood purity shit going. So the 'light' labeled that magic dark, got the majority in whatever governmental systems were happening and bam. You have a system that just doesn't accept there was or is more than black and white.

However, idk about Crucio. That shit's bad no matter how you look at it. Same as other magic I imagine but yeah there you go, my opinions. And yeah most magic could be used to kill, that's a given.

** I actually don't mind the division in terms of spells, though it does annoy me that a lot of readers seem to believe that if some aspect of magic was classified dark, than it's inherently bad. We live in a world where things become taboo for countless reasons. I do find people making reference to dark/light families or dark/light wizards and witches to be a deal-breaker for me, though. It's so silly, and it goes against every the books stand for--that people can behave in complex ways, and that you can choose the most terrible of paths or the path where you fight for what's right, regardless of what family you were born in.

** - Almost any spell can be used to kill, if one is creative enough.

- "Intent to Kill/Harm" as a requirement for a spell (like AK) means that if one kills someone using such a spell, one cannot claim that one did not mean to kill/harm SOMETHING - thus it auto-establishes a certain degree of intent. This is only relevant for determining guilt though.

- My take on the idea of "Dark Magic" is that there are spells that in addition to requiring some state of mind to cast, they either induce euphoria when they are cast (thus leading to a straightforward addiction to the use of such spells), or they make one feel that emotion even more strongly (to the point of having long-term changes to personality (e.g. one might become more irritable)). Thus, regular use of such spells is... not recommended, as one's judgment will become impaired over time with their use (exhibit A is TMR's transition from a handsome and charismatic young man into a raving lunatic, see for example the trajectory an opiate addict can end up on).

Multiple reasons, I imagine.

The biggest are probably:

1. Dark vs. light shows up in many, many fictional magical systems.
2. Fanon poisons the creativity well.
3. Trend-following (related to 2 above)
4. Not rereading the series (or in the case of movie-only fic writers, not reading the series at all).

** Agreed, I've written it out of my headcanon. It's nothing but bureaucracy. All magic is intent and visualization based, and for magic to be either truly Dark or Light you must want to Harm or Heal with it. That means things like levitation, transfiguration, temperature change, illusion, and even most combat magic is niether, but Grey, middle ground magic.

You don't Need to want to harm someone to hit them with a cutting curse, it's just as easy to use on a person as on a log. The Torture Curse, or the Killing Curse, or the Patronus, however, Require the INTENT to do harm, or the EMOTION of Love to use..

They are Dark or Light. Most everything else is just bureaucracy and stupid persecution based rulings...

No idea but it just strikes me when you phrase it like that that that might have an impact.

Otherwise its pure fanon right? Not sure I recall dark magic used except as a colloquial descriptor within the series, and definitely never the term Light magic. I guess people like opposites as an aesthetic choice and also as character/world shorthand. And also its a divide seen in a lot of fiction universes with a magic existence or element - although imo nowadays a little passé or old fashioned!
