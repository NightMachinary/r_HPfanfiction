The admins recently announced a change in rules regarding sexual content involving minors. [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][See here.]] Subreddits that don't comply are banned.

With regard to fanfic, the way I interpret this rule is that smut fics featuring minors are to be removed. Please report any such content with a brief explanation of how it breaks the rule. The mods obviously don't have time to read through every fic to vet it.


** Hang on- as I understand the rule, we're not to put the content here. Whether we link to an off-site example isn't a violation. They don't want the actual text or pictures here. Whether we discuss such works isn't the concern.

Net Neutrality exists because ISPs are worried about legal repercussions of not doing anything to block illegal content. This is the same thing but from the content providers to the consumers.

** So... A big No to "The Real Us", but a Yes to stuff like "Eros and Psyche"?

We're obviously gonna tread into a grey zone area here. If we start removing any fic which has Hogwarts-years sex scenes in it we may as well just close the sub right now. Obviously fics like "The Real Us" go way below any age-limit in any country, so I would assume its a clear cut case of something unacceptable. But in "Eros and Psyche" we have 17 year olds going at it, which presents a grey zone in this ruling I'm not sure of.

  this law is designed to prevent the prosecution of underage couples who engage in consensual sex when both participants are significantly close in age to each other, and one or both are below the age of consent.

  Depending on the situation, the Colorado close-in-age exemption may completely exempt qualifying close-in-age couples from the age of consent law, or merely provide a legal defense that can be used in the event of prosecution.

As far as I know, in my state, a person who is under 15 can legally consent to have sex with someone who is no more than 4 years older. Additionally, a person under 17 can legally consent to sex with a person who is no more than 10 years older.

**** So if sexual content involving minors is not the focus of the story, and does not promote pedophilia is it ok? I don't think it'd serve the plot besides relationship development. Another question is on whose age of consent are determining the rules? For example, in Lithuania, the age of consent(for sex) is 18, while in Germany it is 16.

EDIT: So apparently the age of consent in Lithuania might be 16, and Germany 14, the point/example still stands, even if my facts may be incorrect.

******** I notice that the rule says no "sexual /or suggestive/ content." So does this mean that even fics where two teenaged characters make out, no sex involved or even implied, would also be interpreted as off-limits?

I hate to say it, but I am a bit worried that they're going to crack down on us before we even contact them. I mean, come on, we're a sub devoted entirely to fanfiction about a famous book series featuring teenage characters. (On the other hand, maybe they'll make an exception for creative work: after all, there's an entire sub devoted to [[/r/BigMouth]].)

Should we all delete our old sex-themed threads just to be safe? I only ask because in recent months I made threads asking for fics where Molly caught Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione in the act (which, tbh, are pretty vanilla requests compared to /some/ of the things I see people asking for here). *EDIT:* Just to be safe, I went ahead and deleted them. If our sub gets shut down, I just want to say: hey, thanks for all the fun times and good fic recommendations. I'll still see you guys around on the main /HP/ sub.

Now, if it is legal for minors to engage in sexual conduct, that varies widely from State to state. But why would that matter?

The one post that seems to comment on it is here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7vxzrb/comment/dtx02ef]]

That seems to suggest that it isn't a blanket ban but contextual: That would bring it similar to how us law works. However, it is only a comment not policy.

This seems to be called out quite a bit in the comments but never dealt with. I suspect this is one of those 'we made a broad rule so we could use our judgement/ban things that get bad pr'

The problem is although legal stateside, a lot of this stuff is hard illegal elsewhere (Germany, Canada, Aussie). How will Reddit react on their next government request to remove content illegal in that country?

*** I get that you're being funny and it amused me but my pedantic nature won. So sorry about this.

I mean technically everyone is above the age of consent in the country that they're in in Limpieza De Sangre. Emily is sixteen when she sleeps with Martin in the only detailed sex scene in the story.

The childhood trauma Emily endures is not sexualized, or even detailed past the barest saying that it happened as bluntly as possible, so I don't think it would technically violate the rules. Same with Harry and Hermione's post-assault interactions.

If we want to get really nit-picky we can go on about how technically Martin never consents to Emily in the bathroom when she climbs onto him in the bathroom. And given Martin's injured leg it's debatable if he could effectively get away from her if he wanted to. So really, Emily rapes him.

And then, also, Martin is more than four years older than Emily. And since Emily is sixteen that's technically statutory rape in England. So Martin also rapes Emily. So they rape each other? And since they both enjoyed the encounter, I guess that means I glorified rape? So I mean, I think I'm safe on the underage guidelines. But you could report it for glorifying rape.

This is kinda fun, wonder what else I could nitpick out of it.

** Given that /all/ the teenage Harry Potter characters within canon are minors by US law due to age of consent differences between the UK and US (16 in the UK, fyi if you weren't aware), this has potential to become very complicated very quickly.

Interestingly on that point, this is also a reason some of the US fandom fascinates me. What's very normal for JKR to be writing about (in her own UK context) seems to be interpreted by some US fans as something like forbidden fruit or JKR somehow being 'naughty' by having some suggestions of teen relationships or certain activities. It really makes me wonder about the state of how such things are perceived and talked about in America!

*** I take it from your comment that you are British? Well, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jQz6jqQS0][this video]] pretty much sums up the state of sex ed (and, by extension, attitudes toward teen sex) in America.

I think this new rule has a good point and a bad point. On one hand, there's no reason to write and/or promote sex stories about prepubescent children. That's /sick, sick, sick./ But when it comes to teenagers, that's a bit different. An adult lusting after a teen is still a no-no as far as I'm concerned, but if it's two /consenting/ teens... well, there I think we should acknowledge the fact that some teenagers do in fact have responsible sex, and it's often an important step in their personal development.

Message to Reddit: there's a /ton/ of YA novels out there, like /Looking for Alaska/ and /Anatomy of a Boyfriend/, that depict sexual situations between teenagers that are, in fact, technically illegal. And yet those books have been widely read and sold millions of copies. And guess what: there were fifth-years at Hogwarts kissing, and even though JKR didn't explicitly say so, I'm sure there were sixth- and seventh-years getting even /more/ intimate. I guess none of you who work at Reddit were ever in an intimate teenaged relationship, though. Again, I don't want to be too harsh - I like your new rule to a certain extent - but I fear it might prove a tad too draconian, and it would be a shame if /our/ sub was the one that ended up on the chopping block.

*** I had a good laugh at a review I got the other day when I posted a chapter where Harry (16) is over at Tonks place and she mentions that her parents are probably having some fun downstairs at the moment (and that her parents had a healthy sex life). One of my friends has a mother who can get rather vocal so the concept of children and their friends knowing about sex and being rather casual about the whole thing is based on personal experience (and it makes sense story wise since Edward actually was around 18 during the sexual revolution and Andromeda isn't exactly a prim and proper trophy wife).

  Good author note. Good wakeup for readers to realize the juggle there, mystery, politics, romance. " adults show more restraint when their children are around" Yep. Triggers a dozen thoughts. Like reviews declaring multis don't exist in real life, anyone would be too jealous, to allow it. That THAT sex scene was impossible, no one can do that (hmmm, when I could do double or triple "that". I recall (possibly exaggeration of sex sells "sweeps week"**) TV "news magazine" shows, and talk shows, debating and claiming a "trend", of permissive or overly sexually permissive parents. The touted "trend", with parents who in defense, claimed being open minded, expected their kids WOULD have teen sex, and be at risk being secretive (in parked car, outdoors, public places risking being caught) in having sex. Better their kid be "safe", safe place with or without safe(er) sex, with one or both sets of the young coupling couples' parents, allowing "sleepovers". Guess without the no "door to your bedroom stays open during any opposite sex visiting" rule. Although maybe Andromeda would prefer the open door rule stand.

  **FYI if term defunct now. Long ago at least, advertising rate based on viewership. At least in old days, including pre-cable & satellite TV (haven't watched TV in 10 years), viewership polling (count) data (TV show & networks ratings) done during specific times (like fall "sweeps week"). SEX gets attention, so from dramas to daily local and national news shows, would fill with sex, sexual topics, sex stories, sex news, sex "scandals"...sex sex sex...

*** Exactly. There's a clear difference between writing about a character's sexual abuse as a backstory, or a sexual relationship between teenage characters, in a story, which is done in a factual and nondescript, vague manner, and writing "smut" about children, which is by definition a scene or a story written with the sole purpose of sexually arousing the writer or the readers. Child smut "stories" are sexually exploitative and encouraging sexual abuse of children, and people can't fool themselves otherwise. There's no purpose to writing it except for that. If you want to argue you're not a disgusting pedophile for writing child "smut," ask yourself why you couldn't just write a smut story with the same characters when they're already adults and out of school. Why do you HAVE to write them as children? Why do you HAVE to be so damn detailed and use flowery words? You don't. You just WANT TO, because you're sick.

My main reasoning is still that you can't breed out the magic gene (get muggles again from any magical offspring) whereas with "normal" genes, given enough generations, you can breed it out. Meaning a muggle can make a magical given wizard ancestry, but a wizard/squib can't make a muggle regardless the number of non-magical ancestors. Magicals are practically a parasitic species, relying on non-magicals to expand their gene pool without releasing offspring back into the larger pool.

**** *Species*

In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity, but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as Linnaeus thought, species were fixed, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction.
