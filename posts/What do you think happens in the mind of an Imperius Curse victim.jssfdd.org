*** Well that's where my question stems from. All fake-Moody had to do was order Crouch Sr to go at the Triwizard Tournament and act unsuspicious while supporting the case for Harry to attend. But as a judge of the first task, he acts impartial (giving Harry an 8 if I recall). But what was he doing while at home? Just sitting locked in his room and writing letters to Percy?
