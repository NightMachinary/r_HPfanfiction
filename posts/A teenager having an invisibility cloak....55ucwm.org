  If I had the chance to be invisible, I'd peek on girls. No reason why Harry Potter with an Invisibility cloak should be a saint.

** Considering the Quidditch changing rooms are unisex and shared between both girls and boys, he doesn't need his cloak to have a gander.

*** Sometimes I think Hogwarts' teachers forget that teenage boys are clever even without magic.

A slide is no problem to a few lads with some rope and something to hook it onto.

If we wanted to get fancy it wouldn't be too hard to ride a broom up there, or get a girl to take you up (there's always one oddball).

*** Flying prodigy Harry Potter has no need for stairs, he just goes through the window.

** Not quite, but in this fic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/page-68#post-26471503]]

It's stated that Iris Potter (inexplicably female Harry Potter) was very likely concieved under the Invisibility Cloak, with Shirou from Fate Stay Night doing his analytical power thingy and seeing flashes of... Well... Red hair and flushed faces, to say it genteely.

Is decent fic, for going off the rails of canon pretty quickly, though some bits are strange.

** I'd guess /the/ cloak or some other invisibility cloak that Harry uses, depending on the story, is mentioned at least once in tens of thousands of stories...
