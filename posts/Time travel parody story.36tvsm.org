I don't think this particular story exists so I'm just posting it as an idea.

A parody of a time travel fic, Harry attempts to send his soul to the past in order to fix his mistakes, etc. What he doesn't realize is that the time travel ritual/device he used actually swaps his and a younger version's souls into each others body. This story follows the younger Harry's soul in the older Harry's body.


** Hm... it's not Harry Potter, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6678938/1/The-Good-Wife][The Good Wife]] (Naruto) is basically this to a tee. If anyone is interested in the idea I think they should give it a read, I certainly liked it.

** Not quite what you're looking for, but there is one out there where Harry goes back in time, and then returns to the present. Only, Riddle (and some friends), comes back with him. I can remember the name, nor could I find it with 2 minutes of searching. I haven't read it, so I can't comment on how good it is.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
