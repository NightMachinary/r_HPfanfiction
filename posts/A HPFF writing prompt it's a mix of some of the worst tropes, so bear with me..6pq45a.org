Fanfic prompt in several parts

Part I Veela genes are recessive but when they show up on both sides, they make full veelas.  Veelas can be male or female.  The power of the veela is the allure, fire elemental power (from passion), and the transformation.  The curse of the veela is that they have a Soul Mate, and can only love that one person; they are mated to them for life, and reorient their whole world around them.

Lots of purebloods have a few veela in their family tree, because it is fashionable.  They don't produce squibs. They are beautiful, powerful, and agree with the spouse about everything. They even change gender according to the need/desire of the person who is their soulmate.

Part II Fred and George Weasley are Veela.  

One has a de-aged Tom Riddle as Soul Mate, the other has Harry Potter.

Tom Riddle can be de-aged because he got out of the Diary by killing Ginny, post-Cauldron Voldemort took potions, or something else.

Part III

Timeline:

The start has to happen after Dumbledore's death in book 6.  That way, Harry knows about Horcruxes, knows the prophecy, and Voldemort's past.  Voldemort knows all sorts of stuff from Peter Pettigrew and dream-time visits.

How does this screw up the Twins?  How does this screw up the war? How does this screw up Dumbledore's plans?  Have fun with it.  It can go really Crack-y, really melodramatic, or really interesting.


** Of course, I'm a massive pervert, so my brain decided after 'Fred' that you were going to say one Weasley twin is a Veela (because magic, pfft genetics), and the other one is his Soulmate.

** I'm just imagining one of the twins being soulmates with one specific piece of Tom's soul, namely the bit in Harry's head, and the other being soulmates with Harry, and Ginny loves Harry for being Harry and isn't involved with any magical compulsion to do so, and Harry is feeling hunted by his best friends siblings attempts to woo him.
