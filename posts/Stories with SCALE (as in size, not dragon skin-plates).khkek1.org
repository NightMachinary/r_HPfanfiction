As the title says, I'm looking for stories with scale. Stories about saving the world, ideologies clashing, or the fates of nations and/or species - just anything with an 'epic' scale. The closest I've seen is Wastelands of Time, personally, and I know there probably won't be many of these (nature of the source material, after all), but I'm hoping there's some more. :)

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

linkffn(4068153)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

Harry always knew that there was something special about him, but it's only recently that he's been able to put a definite name to it. He has magic. Add to that the discovery that a whole world of magic exists, and Harry couldn't be anymore excited. But as time passes, and the longer he spends there, he soon comes to find out that the magical world isn't anything like how he thinks it should be, that it is, in fact, in many ways the exact opposite of what a magical world should be. And since no one seems to realize how much better things could and should be, or how the magical world as it is in no way lives up to how wonderful and amazing magic is, Harry is left with only one solution to this problem. Fix the magical world himself. Make it better until it becomes fit to actually deserve the title of magical world, a place where any thing or person that has magic has a home in it.Harry is determined to see his vision of what a magical world can really be brought to life, and he's ready to do whatever he has to, to make that happen.unfinished.

****** I do recommend it :). If you want a summary, I've been working on the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheRigelBlackChronicles][TVTropes pages]], including a recap page, although expect spoilers.

The actual divergence isn't "Harry is a girl"; it's "Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war." That has resulted in a very different society, where lots more people are alive, but blood status discrimination and segregation has become normal and in some cases legally enforced. Harry grew up with both of her parents and all of the Marauders alive, and Sirius' son who's like a brother to her, she knows all about magic and is passionately devoted to Potions brewing, but only Purebloods are allowed at Hogwarts.

It really feels like a whole new storyline that just happens to weave in some elements of canon - albeit quite skillful and elegant weaving - rather than a mere modification of canon. With Riddle alive and Sirius a more-or-less respected member of society, the first and third years were always going to be very different, but even when plotlines are recognisably inspired by canon, they're also greatly altered and expanded. Harriett really isn't anything like canon Harry, but her story is well worth reading in its own right.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

This is an HPMOR spinoff but it focuses more on worldbuilding etc. than the "NERDS RULE!" ethos of HPMOR so you may like it even if you didn't like HPMOR. I don't /think/ you'll miss out on anything by not knowing HPMOR if you haven't read it, but I might be wrong.

*** Someone unfamiliar with HPMoR might be a bit confused by how Voldemort came to be in his current position. He had hundreds of Horcruxes and even he didn't know what or where they all were, so Harry stunned him, wiped all his memories, and transfigured his body into a small gemstone, which he then took to carrying around at all times in order to maintain the transfiguration.

Also, regarding the Malfoys: in the final confrontation of HPMoR, Harry beheaded all the gathered Death Eaters with transfigured razor wire..

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
