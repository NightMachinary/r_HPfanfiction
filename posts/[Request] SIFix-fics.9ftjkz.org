Looking for fix-fics, SI if possible, crossover drop-into-HP-world is fine too. Preferably with little to no bashing. I'm fine with people being flawed and making mistakes, but please little to none "Dumby evil, Weasley dumbo". And if you can, fix-fic to the max, protag trying to save-redeem-heal Bella, turn Malfoy, stuff like that.

No slash, please. Or at least no main focus\main char slash.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][Death of a Dark Lord, a True Story - by Gilderoy Lockhart]] is a really good SI fic, though admittedly it's only sort of a fix-it. 5k words. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  A past, more sensible, less frightened version of me might wonder what I was doing with a human leg, most of a human hand, thirty gallons of petrol and a crowbar.

  Luckily, all sensible people had long since left my house.

  For the prompt: 'BODY SWAP AU W GILDEROY LOCKHART AND MODERN SI GO'.

Edited (again) with a direct link because ffnbot wouldn't cooperate.

**** Yeah, I wasn't sure if the tone of the fic was what you were looking for, but I thought it had enough of what you requested (self insert who tries to fix things, with no bashing or slash) that it might pique your interest. Apparently not, so sorry.

****** It's a fix-it in that the SI informs the wizarding world about Voldemort's horcruxes before he can become powerful again, but it doesn't have everything neatly tied up at the end. I do think it captures the insanity a SI would feel after being abruptly dropped into the HP universe really well, though.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
