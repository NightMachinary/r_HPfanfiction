I know it's a few months old, and I forgot to favorite it.

Ginny breaks up with Harry so he's dragged to a conference in South America by Ron and Hermione. Well, a hurricane happens. They go to a hospital and meet a girl. Harry and the girl are separated from the rest of the trio and it turns out she's protecting muggles from disasters. I do /not/ remember the name of this fic.

  Harry'd always had screwed up luck. So when he got dumped and dragged on a forced vacation, he really shouldn't have been too surprised when a Category 5 Hurricane leveled half the country. At least he got trapped in a growling shack with the girl of his dreams. Too bad he doesn't know her name, what she looks like, and is being forced to marry Daphne Greengrass instead. HP/DG
