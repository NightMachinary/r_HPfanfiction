I think this might have been done recently, and if it was, I'll take this down.

I don't mean crackships, like if anyone's read the Dumbledore x Squid fic by thepsychotichouseelf, or the Hogwarts x Whomping Willow fic, I mean actual, weird ships.

This post was inspired by a fic about an abusive-turned-loving relationship between Lily Luna Potter and Dolores Umbridge. YUCK!

**** The two I read were pretty cracky. One was actually a mild Harry/Draco that had them horrified by the drunken revelation that Snape and Hagrid were a couple. I think it might have been called "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8207447][Wassail!]]" as that was the source of the revelation.

The other is called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/57934][Scream]], in which Snape loses a bet to Hagrid, and the forfeit is that Hagid gets to make Snape scream a certain number of times.

ETA: found them both on AO3, discovered that Harry and Draco were more intrigued than horrified, so my memory was faulty on that one. Links added for the morbidly curious.

** Hagrid/Hedwig. No, it wasn't a parody or crack fic. Yes, it was explicit. No, she wasn't an animagus.

On that note, the first fic I ever read (because the main HP subreddit mentioned it being pretty bad) was a Harry/Hermione/Hedwig pairing, with Hedwig being an animagus. Harry and Hermione both because bird animagi (owl for Harry and Phoenix for Hermione) and there were some explicit scenes involving their bird forms.

Another weird one I remember reading a long-ass time ago was Harry/his sister, who didn't actually exist. He saw her in the Mirror of Erised, and some kind of magical accident involving the Mirror and the Philosopher's Stone made her real. Like I said, it was a long time ago, so I can't remember too many details.
