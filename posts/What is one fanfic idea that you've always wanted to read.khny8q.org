I've always wanted to read a possessive Hermione Hhr that is not Brilliant but Scary or Adorable Violence.

Specifically ones where only Hermione is dark and Harry is nice. What about you guys? Anything you wish you could read, or an idea that you randomly came up with that you wish was a trope so you could continue reading fics like it?


** I've got two:

1. At the end of GoF Barty Crouch Junior doesn't get a fit of stupidity, and as a result doesn't get caught and continues masquerading as Moody.

2. Pettigrew doesn't fake his own death, but continues living in wizarding Britain as one of the war veterans. No one has any idea about him being the one who betrayed Lily and James.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I've really wanted to read a BAMF Umbridge fic. I realize this sounds ridiculous, and a lot of you are judging me, so I'll explain what I mean. In this type of AU, Umbridge is still a horrible ladder climbing bureaucrat. She doesn't care about anyone's success (unless it helps her). She's spent a lot of time and effort getting herself into a position of power with Fudge and has developed plans to become the Minister of Magic. And then Voldemort resurrects, and he's messing up all of her plans. Umbridge is NOT happy, especially when Fudge puts her in Hogwarts, which is not a good career move. Being extremely peeved at both Voldemort and Fudge, Umbridge fights back the only way she knows how: by being a cunning bureaucrat and manipulating/weaponizing the students of Hogwarts to fight on her behalf. After all, she's got to salvage something from this mess, and if she plays her cards right, she could become Minister of Magic.

Every group of friends is going around every year having adventures and making discoveries. It's the unofficial Hogwarts curriculum that makes it such a good school.

I want all the other shenanigans that could have been going on if everybody was essentially working on their own quest. Or teachers and heads working out who has each end of year debrief.

It's notable for not only being extremely realistic for the pressures sudden parenthood would put on a teenager and the blowback from the younger members of the family but for being the hands-down best handling of Harry's canon situation (both familial and the Voldemort thing) I have ever seen in any fic.

He and Albus Dumbledore have a discussion and Harry says he will kill Voldemort but in exchange Dumbledore has to quit Hogwarts after it is done and then spend "the rest of his life" helping Harry get home. Killing Voldemort will only take one or two chapters - mixed with some good old trauma with his parents. The rest will be Harry and alt-Albus traveling the world, visiting every magical education school, from the famous to the obscure, raiding every tomb with the sole purpose of getting Harry back to his home dimension.

Additionally, while he's dealing with all that, his family and friends in his current time (particularly Scorpius) are constantly trying to figure out what's wrong.

However, I think it's a very original and unique idea, and if you want to pursue it, then you should go ahead! It would be a hit, as there are very few next gen fanfics. I must confess that I didn't like Cursed Child as much, but this plotline sounds very edge of the seat!

**** Thank you for your reply!

Yes, it definitely would have a darker tone. I partially got the idea from watching a scene from Rambo where he emotionally breaks down under the weight of his PTSD from Vietnam.

I always liked the idea of the children of a story's protagonist fighting against their parents' ideals for one reason or another (it would have to be a very good reason for it to work though).

Additionally, the idea of Albus having all the memories of his friends and fighting with them for a cause that he honestly believed in while also hearing stories that paint him and them as monsters when he got back would be quite a bit of the plot. Really, it would be designed as a psychological and/or emotional thriller.

Also, I didn't have Cursed Child in mind at all when brainstorming this plot. Let's just say that I still have some strong feelings regarding that story.

** I've wanted to read a Multi-Harry fic that is a mix of Spiderverse and Ben 10 Omniverse, where there is a bunch of good and bad Harry's from various alternate realities and they fight each other.

Since such a thing doesn't exist, I'm trying to plan out an idea for this fic myself. It would feature: - Canon Harry from post-Graveyard in GOF. - Cursed Child Harry - Vampire Potter from My Immortal - Fem! Ravenclaw! Harry - 'Lord Hadrian James Blah Blah Blah' - You all know this one. - A Harry raised by fanon Sirius (a.k.a Prankster and Playboy Harry) - Hadrian Riddle, Son of Voldemort - Death Eater! WBWL! Harry - Harrymort, a.k.a Harry possessed by Voldemort. - Insane female Harry who is a master of 'technomagic'. - Harry raised by loving Dursleys, who hates magic and became a soldier.

Im summarising what they are like, but I am trying to finalise some of their personalities and backstories (mostly the bad Harry's.). But besides the 2 canon Harry's and Vampire Potter they are all meant to embody different tropes. This includes each having a different ship (Harry/Cho, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Draco etc).

In the end, if you want to read a fanfic idea and nobody is making it - try to make it yourself. It might take years and a lot of effort, but it will be worth it :)

*** I've actually written something like that. There are two fics in the series with the premise that Luna gets adopted by the Potters before the attack on Halloween. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/749139]]

If you like those you might be interested to learn that I am planning to take the premise of the last one and flesh it out into a more realistic "Luna is the GWL" story. So, uh, stay tuned.

** I always kind of wanted to have like a post 1st year story where the dursley's especially Dudley turn up on the platform 9 and 3/4 platform and see the hogwarts express come in.... With Dudley and the friends Harry has made throughout his first year meeting. I've always kind of pictured Hermione's upper middle class dentist parents, Turning their judgmental eyes on petunia and Vernon. After all that's really the only thing that ever affected the Dursleys the negative opinion of muggle people that were higher in status than them.

Just to see what happens when Dudley realizes Harry might have more friends than him...lol

** These past few days > had these idea going thru my head. Here it is: James and Lily are having a trouble making babies and Lily when desperate has a visit from a Fae Queen Vivian from Avalon and they make the following deal "I Fae Queen Vivian will help you Lily Potter to have twins, the first will be your and James child a full witch/human and the second will be the child of me Vivian and yours Lily a half-human half-fae, and in return you will watch and love both of them equally." James and Lily have a babies and then when they are born Dumbledore comes with the prophecy. Vivian hearing it makes a plan how to protect Harry, but the catch is that she can't intervene directly in the affairs of the mortal world.So she proposes to Lily two rituals that can save the twins,but with the catch that Lily will delete her memories of these two rituals after making them.And here comes Vivians plan. The first ritual is for Harry and his second mother Vivians bring a lot of artifacts and items and the ritual goes like this:

" Bones of the mighty Titans give him unbreakable bones.

Heart of the undying Phoenix give him your regeneration.

Muscles of the ancient Giants give him your mighty strength.

Organs of the divine Gods give him your limitless energy.

Skin of the nightmare Hydra give him your invincibility.

Tounge of the infinite Ouroboros give him your divine abilities.

Soul of the forgotten Spirits give him your unique soul."

On top of that she also gives him a cup from the fountain of Youth, finally knowing that the humans might use him she sacrifices a Fae and seals his powers and makes it that only when he is 6 yrs old or in danger that the seal breaks.Then she makes another ritual for the other twin, but here she makes moderate defense and gives him a Fae powers so the AK doesn't work on him. And Voldemort attacks and senses that the other twin has Fae powers attacks him, but the ritual that Vivian set up for him reflects the AK and he becomes the horcruxs and BWL. Under the guidance of Dumbledore James and Lily start to focus on the BWL and begin to ignore Harry and on their 6th birthday Harry escapes and awakens his abilities that are : Immortality,Invincibility(Not complete),Wandless Magic,The ability to ignore the Laws of Magic, Able to use magic with his imagination,Super Strength,Super Agility, Super Vitality,Super Senses,Ability to generate Mana,The ability to absorb all Magical Attacks(This grants him Complete Magical Immunity) and Absolute and perfect control of his Body and Magic.And ideally the fanfiction can be crossover DxD where Harry becomes knight of Rias and has Harem, has crossover where Harry falls into space tear and goes to Danmachi has Harem and eventually returns or has crossover with other series, because this Harry is to powerful to have challenges in the HP series or the author can make it so that Harry's world had a Great War long ago and powerful species like Elves,Fae,Gods,Titans and the like can't enter the world without some help and the seal that doesn't let them in is breaking and Harry can go to the realms of these races and is trying to fix the seal and fights Gods,Titans,Demons and the like while his twin takes care of Voldemort.It is becoming increasingly annoying these WBWK series where Harry takes care of Voldemort.Let his twin have Voldemort and let Harry have greater destiny.

** A retelling of the canon epilogue but Harry was actually possessed by Dumbledore's soul in Limbo, using the Resurrection Stone as an anchor/horcrux. Now Harry is stuck as a passenger in his own body. Basically, something that ends like...

  The scar had not pained "Harry" for nineteen years; and after all this time the tiny voice screaming inside his head was easy to ignore.

  All was well.

** I've wanted to read a HP/Xanth crossover. I'm thinking Summer after the Battle of Hogwarts, the trio and Ginny go to America for vacation, but when driving into Florida to go to DisneyWorld for a week, they end up in Xanth and need to get a question answered in order to get home. Because it's not a Xanth story unless someone needs to go on a quest to get a question answered.

** I want to read one where:

- Horcruxes aren't effective, Voldy fully dies that night at Potter's house .. if it's so effective why aren't there other dark lords, not everyone comes up with historical artifacts as the items or someone was bound to hide his/hers better than Voldy .. why are all of them even in one country? .. it's a flawed method and known as fools hope which Tom being muggle raised didn't know.
- HP is not celebrated as a BWL, Bumblebee seeing no need to create a following for Harry and making a target of him comes up with a story that Voldy tried to perform some obscure dark magic at Potter house and the resultant failure/backlash killed him & Potter parents, HP wasn't even home then but was with Sirius who is left with HP to raise.
- HP grows up relatively normally & explores the magical world .. Potter name is known but not due to him but his parents who are praised for their role in Voldy's death, he is a minor celebrity due to his link to that name ... not a big one but who tries to fill their shoes & people expecting him to act like them .. etc, somewhat same as cannot but not to extreme extent.
- HP & Sirius leaving Britain to live elsewhere away from attention, memories of Potter parents ... exploring more magical communities while doing it.

Mainly, I am bored with same HP defeating Voldy story .. throw cannon out the door, build a butterfly farm & do something more with the magic system in the books, there is a lot of potential there but lots of stories follow on similar lines.

** Oooh, so many. 1. A switcheroo between Draco and Harry, where canon!Harry becomes Slytherin and Draco goes to Gryffindor. Just a progression through the years where each grow into their role and how it affects their lives going forward. Draco basically becoming the second coming of Sirus Black, unlearning the internalized racism and losing the approval of his father for starters, whereas Harry grows to see Slytherin and the as the path to power which he can use to control his life and protect himself-leading him to make choices that negatively affect the quality of his life and chip at his sense of fair play and morality.

I have like this mental image of Harry with slicked back hair and Draco with his all wild and growing out more as the years pass.

1. Magical Petunia Evans. Theres a very good role reversal between her and Lily that deals with this, but I'm talking about one with both of the sisters being magical. The sheer effect it would have on their lives and canon, starting with their relationship with Snape to the Hogwarts sorting (because you can't tell me she'd be anything other than a Slytherin) to the effects on their dynamic as a whole because Petunia would have never had her start of bitterness...It just tickles me.

2. A SI, reincarnation, something from the POV of Ariana Dumbledore. Just, having someone that due to the different choices they would make be able to avoid the attack by muggle boys (or, just, be less traumatized by it) and thus not die in the duel between Albus and Grindelwald the the sheer knock on effects itd have on canon...

3. Crossover w the Dresden Files, primarily involving the setting of DF. Theres a few good ones out there, but rarely are there any that are compete.

4. One of those crossover "Harry Potter's father was actually someone other than James" fics (usually insert famous muggle character here) that actually explores what it means that the savior of Britain is a mudblooded bastard and how the consequences from public reaction would pile up.

Most of these come out of my doc files of something I'll probably write/finish on the fifth of never. If someone would like to give them a spin, I'd be happy to share my notes!

** Mostly if it's an idea that I want to read and haven't, it's something I've tried and failed to write. So... obviously the mileage may vary, but the "greatest hits" of my failed fanfics are:

- Harry and Ginny accidentally end up raising their own grandchildren (via a time turner related Delphini/Albus pregnancy) in an attempt to stop Delphini's children from ending up like her

  - For additional weirdness, I also added teen pregnancy!Rose via Scorpius... somehow he never figures it out and enters into a blissfully ignorant relationship with Rose (for whatever reason, I feel like dating your ex's cousin when you've got children with said ex is squicky hence it's necessary he doesn't know about the child, singular... as far as I got for how this happens was Felix Felicis shenanigans)

- Harry never goes to Hogwarts and spends the entire time at Stonewall (I've looked... usually he eventually ends up at Hogwarts or figures out he has magic on his own, which are two things I didn't want... I suppose there might be a Muggle AU in this vein)
- Dudley's daughter is a history teacher and has a kid (accidentally) with Mundungus Fletcher's son, instils her daughter Violet with a love of history, raises her in the near future where muggle technology is very advanced and then suddenly Violet's off to Hogwarts which now seems not quite so magical and, of course, has Binns... but then it turns out the problem with Binns is that he just gives really technical lectures from "less interesting" historiographical paradigms ([[https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/open-access/the-history-manifesto][see this]])
