I recently reread linkffn(Lessons With Hagrid), which was an utter delight, and was wondering if there were any other fics like that focused on Hagrid and/or Care of Magical Creatures. Original flavor and lighthearted humor greatly preferred.


** "Harmless and Easily Domesticated" is old (it was written before HBP) but good. Definitely original flavour; all the characters are perfectly in character and the magical creatures are all taken from the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The plot here is that the Ministry for Magic has forbidden Hagrid from featuring any magical creatures that are rated higher than XX... Harmless and Easily Domesticated. The story follows Harry, Ron and Hermione's lessons with Hagrid, and the complications that happen.

  Hagrid has been forbidden to teach any creature of higher classification than XX: harmless, may be domesticated. So nothing can possibly go wrong in his classes now - right? Augureys and Clabberts and Bowtruckles, oh my, not to mention Redneck Wizards.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
