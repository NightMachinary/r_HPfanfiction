:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry is teaching Daphne how to perform the patronus charm. Tonks is sent by amelia to spy on Harry (don't remember why). When she sees the ease with which he manages to teach Daphne, she reports in to Amelia the same and even she is stunned by it.

Any ideas which fic this is??


** Pretty sure that scene is from my story "I'm Still Here." Ah. Someone linked it. It stemmed from part of my irritation with the Harry Potter series as a whole.

Harry conjures a Patronus in book three. Which is supposed to be an impressive piece of magic. BUT WAIT! We can't have Harry be at all special or talented at ANYTHING! So let's just go ahead and strip all that away from him in book 5. By having all of the 5th years and 4th years manage it with a bit of teaching from him. So that leaves Harry only good at... teaching? in canon anyway. So that was my nod to that dynamic, him teaching the patronus.

*** I just reread this fic for the umpteenth time due to this reply. I finally noticed that every time someone asks Harry how he is after he's seriously injured he brushes them off and says, “I'm still here.” I feel incredibly dense now.

**** That only clicked with me the second or third time too.

But i like it, it's one of those rare times for me when incorporating the title in a dialogue actually works and adds some instead of feeling "suicide squad " level cringy.

I'll admit I'm struggling with that story. I have a very vivid image of things that happen in the next chapter, but the scene right after the end of the last chapter. (I'm relatively new to reddit so I'm not sure how do do the black out thing to prevent spoilers.) The fallout scene is *strugglebussing* and i can't figure out how certain characters will react which is ground any progress to a halt.

***** It's always good to hear that you're still working on the story! As to how to black out text, use: > ! Text ! <

Remove all spaces and you should be set! It'll end up like this. Text

*** I really like the way you explained why some people would struggle to come up with a happy memory, because they've had so few of them. Your fic is filled with great moments I've never seen in any other fics. I hope you can get past the block, because the first 13 chapters are incredible. I've read it multiple times by now.

The scene you're thinking of takes place in Chapter 12

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
