Harry's origin/backstory gets slightly altered or they add an ancillary character but the rest of the story mirrors the book..almost to the letter and the author calls it AU. Why call it AU if you're just gonna regurgitate the entire book series? I can understand starting the story the same as the original source but ffs deviate from the original source within a reasonable amount of time.. like within the first five chapters.


** Or the timetravel story where nothing is changed. You're telling me a 24 year old war veteran Harry Potter that witnessed the destruction of everything he hold dear would just let Voldemort walk around all of first year, allow Ginny to be possesed for the whole year, allow Sirius to rot in prison and somehow trips when he arrives in the graveyard so that Voldemort can come back.

*** There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Any time traveler who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head!

**** And the biggest bad guys like Malfoys were let off once again because they gave some names and everything was alright after 40% to 70% of good guys dying and only 20 bad guys in jail because we are better than them and rest should be free so they can fuck us over once more . Seriously wizards would go extinct if they just let anyone and everyone let go free because they saw the light one day before the final battle.

**** To me, that first paragraph is one of the biggest reasons that the Potterverse is so ripe for fanfiction. There's so much room for things to go better without going full-on fixfic or making things so easy that you lose any narrative tension. Unless I'm in the mood for something dark/tragic/horrific (and even then just one-shots), I can't stand reading a story where the good guys don't end up at least a bit better-off than in canon.

** AUs rehashing the timeline is an unfortunately common occurence in AU fic.

I've been writing my own MHA AU fuc, and though I'm taking pains to distance it from canon I get the feeling that at least some of the readers are hoping for it to be closer to canon. They want the Stain fight, and well they should because the Stain fight is cool. But it's just not going to happen in my story, so that's unfortunate.

(I'm going to have Kaminari bump into Stain instead, and then he calls for backup and Endeavor takes over)

When done well, canon plot points can be used to illustrate a difference in character or setting as a result of the AU. But that requires a modicum of thought, so it's beyond most authors.

** a lot of what happens to harry is inflicted on him. at least the first four books probably wouldn't change much in most au stories.

*** I disagree with this point because, while it's true of a lot of the plot is thrown at Harry (especially in the first book), a different Harry should have a different reaction which should change the story.

It's "normal" for the Philosopher Stone to be hidden at Hogwarts in 1st year, or the school to be attacked by "the Heir of Slytherin" in 2nd because Harry didn't have anything to do with it. What's annoying is when a Ravenclaw Harry, who never had anything to do with Hermione somehow ends up saving her at Halloween because "he didn't feel like celebrating Halloween". Or when a Slytherin Harry discovers Fluffy because he agreed to Malfoy' Midnight duel in the Trophies Room even when though they live in the same dorm.

I don't have any problem with a fanfic that have the same beginning (and even ending) that Canon, but the MC need to take a different path to reach it. Canon rehash are disliked on this sub because reader are promised a "totally different Harry who does fics differently", and yet the only thing that changed from Canon is the color of Harry's tie, and the name of his sidekicks.

** Most of the Sirius Black has a daughter stories are boring canon rehashes. Arabella Black, CmBlack all are canon rehashes with no change at all except for the pairings(Harry/Black's Daughter).

The only one I saw where there was any difference was Black Bond which diverges pretty significantly from canon after first year, though the fic is in need of some trimming words.

** Oh God, yes.

I see fic after fic in which something is changed, and it has a few effects... and yet the author has scene after scene play out exactly as it did in canon, down to the same exact spells in the same order in a duel, or the same lines of dialogue, word for word.

Its so frustrated. For me, it shatters all suspension of disbelief, and it makes it seem like the change is ultimately pointless. And it shows that the author was either to unimaginative or too lazy to fully explore the consequences of the change that they made to the setting.

** Oh, I thought you were gonna say that you just hate it when people make Harry /more/ abused and I was gonna say that I'm a sadist and I prefer that.

But, yeah, I agree with you. I hate it when people completely paraphrase the series with a few little add-ins.
