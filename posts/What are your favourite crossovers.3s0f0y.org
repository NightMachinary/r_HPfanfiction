So, I haven't seen one of these in a while. What are your favourite fandom mashups? What are the best examples of fusion?

And as a discussion follow on; do you have a preference for a particular style of crossover? MoD Harry running around causing chaos in other fandoms? Characters from your favourite series ending up at Hogwarts?

Also, what makes the particular crossovers you like enjoyable to you? What are the signs you take to drop a crossover fic like a pan straight off the stove-top?

Some that I personally enjoy of different styles:

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) HP/Dresden Files

linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force) HP/Star Wars

linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth) HP/Mass Effect

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) HP/Lord of the Rings


** Can't talk about good crossovers without mentioning HP/Firefly linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes)

*** This was the first crossover I read. It set the bar so high that I think it may have ruined other crossovers for me, similar to how /The Book of Mormon/ being the first musical I ever saw has spoiled me and given me unrealistically high expectations for what a musical should be.

** Linkffn(9510186) Terminal Justice is very good. Mr. Black is a great character and the Justice League all think Harry is a God/Death, and this isn't one of those annoying super Harry fics.

Linkffn(2861773) The Dying Embers is an outstanding fic that has aged very well. While having knowledge of KotOR is not needed, you will be able to follow along better. Although I am a huge KotOR fan so I was hooked, my friend had no knowledge of KotOR but was able to understand what was going on, and the writing is very good.

Linkffn(3789820) Guardian is brilliant. This fic has a very refreshing take on super Harry and is quite enjoyable.

As for uncompleted fics these two are ones I am following, they both have irregular updates but are outstanding.

Linkffn(9622073) To Train a Dragon Rider is a fantastic Eragon Crossover. Harry arrives in Alagaesia to find a dying Brom. He copies Brom's memories and replaces him for the Eragon portion of the Inheritance cycle and then it spins off from canon during Eldest.

Linkffn(11157943) I still haven't found what I'm looking for is a great Star Wars crossover in which Ahsoka is expelled from the Jedi Order and joins Harry in his travels.

--------------

To answer your question I generally don't really like people from other fandom s coming to Hogwarts, (like the multitude of bad HP/PJO crossovers) instead I prefer Harry going to another universe, especially if he is alone rather than with HP characters.

And as for what makes them good, good writing is essential. Super Harry who basically does what he wants with no consequences is boring. The real important thing to me is if the Author has a good knowledge of the crossover universe. I will crossovers like Dying Embers as the crossover elements are fantastic, Kalistar obviously knows the KotOR Lore and I find it more enjoyable because of that.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is the first fanfiction I ever read, and what got me hooked. Really interesting with a well-characterised OC, overall good writing (it gets better throughout), and it avoids being a canon rehash - especially the 2nd year plot is really original and interesting.

** linkffn(Crumpets Aren't My Style) is my go to HP/Stargate crossover.

Honestly, I find the MoD!Harry and X goes to Hogwarts to be uninteresting on the whole. Crumpets works so well because it merges the HP and SG worlds together seamlessly. I also like dimension travel where a canon-ish Harry is transported to another world.

linkffn(Harry's Trek) is an example of that type.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

** This thread has made me realize that I hate the linkbot, or I hat the way we do these threads.... I hate something. Everyone links multiple stories, which linkbot then has a massive post about, it eats up most of the screen with no room for discussion. Maybe we should all just get into the habit of linking one story, and actually talking about why we like it?

My recommendation is Crosswinds of Fate by Wayfarer2000 linkffn(9340220) . It can be a little cheesy sometimes, and falls prey to several tropes. The biggest issue with crossovers is you tend to have one series be superior to the other, I think this handles it..... not great, but pretty decently. Fate/Stay Night starts off seemingly superior, but as the story continues you start to find out that the Harry Potter bunch has more going for them then you would expect. I am also quite fond of the fear Dumbledore shows when he realizes that in the Nasuverse magic families don't just tote around blood purity, they scientifically and systematically work to guarantee their families are superior.

This is one of my favorites - I loved it so much, I read it twice! :) linkao3(940292) This one is also alright: linkffn(8350179)

I used to really like CardCaptor SakuraxHarry Potter crossovers. Good ones are really rare though, let alone complete ones. It usually goes this way "mysterious new (teenage)teachers/students at Hogwarts! Sorcerers > Wizards!" I haven't read one in years, but from my favorites list, here's an example linkffn(1596990)

For some reason, I also enjoy HPxMarvel crossovers. linkffn(8410168). The ones I've read usually have Harry as immortal MasterOfDeath. There was one fic I really liked, but can't remember the title of. The epilogue is of Harry in Stark Tower centuries later and the only ones left are the immortals & near immortals like Harry and Loki. Loki isn't !evil, just complicated.

#+begin_quote
  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

Also thanks to theGlaistig for betaing and catching everything the two of us missed\. And, of course to the\_muppet on LJ for organizing this year's Big Bang\. It's my first Big Bang and it's been tons of fun and quite the learning experience for me as a writer \(most notably, that I do really well with a deadline \- who knew?\)\.Make sure you check out the fanvid made by xcuri0sity for this story  on Tumblr
