:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been quite some time since I read this so I can't really remember the title but the little bits I remember has been stuck on my head for the past few days and I just really need to read it again. Please.

Here's what I can remember:

It's Christmas and both Harry and Draco has been deaged to 5 years old? Severus (who acted like a dick to harry) was looking after them and Harry wished that he could be with his parents in the forest? In the end he saw a light and went with it or something like that. What I can clearly remember is crying buckets of tears while reading it and I just really need a way to release my bottled up feelings right now and reading sad fics really helps with that. Thank you.


** Do you remember rating, length, keywords (for summary), and any other notable characters? What site was it on?

*** It's probably on Ao3 or fanfiction.net and Dumbledore along will all the other professors weren't on the castle ground because they were out celebrating? That's why Draco and Harry had to be left to Severus who opted not to join rhe others.
