After reading linkffn(It's Always The Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1), I've begun to wonder if there were any other good oneshots out here in the fandom that were both funny and a tad bit terrifying.

So far, I've only come across linkffn(Play up, play up, and break the game! by Bakuraptor), which is more funny than scary, but works well enough all the same. I should note that while they both have an Eldritch twist to them, that is by no means a mandatory theme that must be incorporated into the fic.

Really, I just want something funny that isn't pure fluff or /complete/ crack, and I've found that the offsetting elements of horror really accentuate the amusing stuff, so long as they're balanced well enough.

Please, no bashing, but besides that---rec as you will.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

*** Brilliant---just finished it. And can I just say, out of the few bodyswap fics I've read, this takes the cake. The idea of getting into this particular situation is funny and lighthearted by itself, but the execution of the actual story was chilling and anxiety-inducing---in the best of ways. Thanks for the rec!

**** I'm so glad you enjoyed it! It's a fic I really like but rarely have the opportunity to rec - when people ask for SI fics, this tends to not be what they want.

*** Wow. That was much more disturbing than I expected, but I'm grateful nonetheless. It does bring up the rather chilling point that some of the creatures in the Harry Potter universe have something much closer to sentience than I'd have previously suspected. Or, as in this case, plants....

** If you're okay with slash I'd definitely recommend

linkffn(The Black Bunny)

It's hilarious at some times and horrifying at others

  Harry's had it with his destined role after the Order does something he can't forgive. Now he's done with both sides of the war and wants to be left alone. But since when have his wishes ever counted for anything? LV/HP Slash & MPREG.More warnings inside.

*** Thanks for the rec! HP/LV seems like it would definitely fall into either horror or crack, if not both---I'll have to look at other fics with the pairing once I'm finished with this one...
