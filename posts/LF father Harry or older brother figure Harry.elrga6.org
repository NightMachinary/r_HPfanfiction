  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

***** With how much Adult Harry bashes Ron and how he thinks he's an "idiot that he must defeat" (real line from the second chapter), this fic honestly reads like Drarry slash but with Ron instead of Draco. No straight dude is /this/ obsessed with destroying their ex best friend (anime characters included). It doesn't help that this fic has the least/worst developed Hermione I've ever seen so she and Harry have zero chemistry.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...
