Being in Slytherin makes her readily available if you want to sort Harry into that house, which a lot of authors do for a variety of reasons.

Her family being old purebloods gives authors an easy way to talk about Pureblood culture (pagan rituals and maque balls or whatev).

I mean, I doubt Millicent would have many opportunities for practice in her own house and Hermione would have a much better idea of what Wrestling is, and besides that, getting that close to someone in a magic dueling match is rather impressive.

Anyways, Wizards do have a major durability advantage, so they should be able to tank those extreme Wrestling moves seen in staged Wrestling matches, and I imagine there could be some form of minor statistics amplification going on with their strength and speed as well.

Character growth? What a joke.

Rowling sets the stage of Ginny as a pathetic fangirl, then out of nowhere bombards us with her sudden, hitherto unseen virtues and popularity.

Another example of her telling, and not showing, and the movies don't help either.

Even when trying to make her look good (aka "girl power!!11!"), it has the opposite effect, such as when she derided Luna, looked down on Cho and Fleur because they were more attractive, and cursed someone for saying something she didn't like on the train.

Instead of coming off as a kind, independent woman who can hold her own in a fight, she looks the part of a facetious, arrogant girl that enjoys bullying and cutting words.

** 1. Daphne can hit a lot of popular tropes at once from the bare minimum of what we know of her, including star-crossed lovers, redeemed Slytherins, and pureblood culture/politics.

2. She isn't explicitly part of the Pansy (pug-faced, prejudiced, loved Draco) gang and she isn't Milicent (looks like a troll, choked Hermione), so she and Tracey Davis usually end up being the good Slytherins.

3. Her early fanon interpretations became centered around the ice queen and became popular, and people realized she could be one of the ideal love interests (mainly because of the above) for Indy!Harry which is also hugely popular.

4. Some people have a really hard time coming up with names that don't sound fake or stupid so it makes more sense to grab one from JKR.

  Astoria Greengrass, younger sister of the Greengrass family. We meet Daphne Greengrass, part of Pansy Parkinson's Slytherin posse, in Book V when Hermione takes her O.W.L.s.
#+end_quote

Then there is also this on Pottemore mentioning how Astorias family are blood-purists

#+begin_quote
  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law.

** 1. When Pottermore introduced sorting readers into houses, there was suddenly one quarter (approximately) of readers who found they are supposed to be evil, because yes, in the original books it is largely that all Slytherins are Death Eaters-in-training. So, there was outpouring of “Slytherins are not all bad”, "From the inner world of the Slytherin common room” stories.
2. Also, most readers of fanfiction are women, and there is some weird (yes, I am a guy) idea of loving a bad guy (don't do it, most likely a bad guy will just be bad and you get hurt). Also, Alan Rickman was a great actor, so he (and horrible screenplay) made him into lovable person (he is not: a teacher who is the biggest fear of his student, who has both of his parents permanently resident in the mental ward, is just horrible horrible person, and he needs REAL and THOROUGH conversion, before I am willing to touch him).
3. Also, most readers of fanfiction are teenagers (or very young adults) and natural sympathy of such people is to contradict established rules (e.g., M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled, the third stage of mental and spiritual development). Having as good ones all those who are bad in canon and bashing those who are good is very natural state of such readers.
4. And yes, Daphne Greengrass is lovely blank sheet of paper. Why such sheet of paper is written always the same is strange (e.g., I have mentioned couple of times linkffn(3912184;4236594) as alternative non-nobility non-Ice Queen, actually very much non-Ice Queen ;), alternative character of her).

*** Actually I think JKR had a change of heart regarding Snape sometime when she wrote OotP (2003). She may have planned his twist in the beginning, but as the movies were made (2001), she must have changed her mind. It provides a clear demarcation point for most of Snape's asshole personality. Pre OotP he's a bastard who's spying for Dumbledore, post OotP he's a layered character with a troubled past and redemption arc.

** She's a blank slate Slytherin female character without creating an OC. Characters like Pansy and Millicent Bulstrode have negative connotations about them from canon (Pansy is too mean and Millicent is described as a female Crabbe / Goyle). That leaves characters like Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. Admittedly Daphne's name just sounds better to me plus you can work with some basic assumptions such as her being a pureblood as Greengrass appears in the sacred twenty eight and her sister marries Draco. Her family was also never mentioned as Death Eaters so there's potential for “good” or “neutral” Slytherins.
