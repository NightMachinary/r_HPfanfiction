So, to kick things off, discussion is for, well, discussion. It's for talking about things. Maybe you have a question, or you have some thoughts about tropes. It's very open ended.

Request and What's that fic? This is the one most people mix up. Request posts are for finding fics that fit a certain idea. Maybe you want a harry/luna fic or maybe you want good dumbledore. What's that fic is for finding a specific fic. You read a fic, but don't remember its name and really want to reread it.

Self-promotion is pretty straight-forward. You wrote a fic and want to recommend it.

Review is also pretty simple. You read a fic and want to say what you thought about it.

Prompt is for ideas for fics. You thought of a really cool fanfic idea and want other people to make a fic with that idea.

Recommendation is also one people sometimes mix up. It's not for asking for recommendations, it's for recommending a fic to others.

Wiki is for trivia. If you want to know whether something is canon or not, this is the flair.

Audiobook is also pretty straight forward. It's for audiobooks. Maybe you've made an audiobook or maybe you want to know if a specific fic has an audiobook.

Meta is for posts about the subreddit, such as this post.

Misc is for everything else.


** There's often overlap between Prompt and Request. After all, with so many stories out there, it isn't all that surprising if someone had the same idea... And writing a short story in response to a Request would be unconventional but normally welcomed.

*** "Prompt/Request" has been a thing for a while, but it's not in the official flair selection. Still, if you search by it, you'll find a lot of those.

** Thanks for your work.

Could you add "meta" to complete the list?

Took me a good while to understand what meta meant when I was new on reddit.

** Why is it that when I try to filter on "What's that fic?" I ALWAYS get a message that there aren't any?

*** It could be that reddit search, being hot garbage, doesn't know how to parse the ' in the flair.

**** Nah, it's worse than that. It doesn't work when clicking on it in the "Filter by flair" box that's built-in! So it's not even trying to parse something I wrote.

***** I believe the two are functionally identical. Clicking the box just forms a shortcut to the specialized search prompt.

** Thanks for this! I was pretty confused when I first joined this subreddit and a list like this would've helped a lot

** We also have a helpful link on our sidebar in old reddit found above the "Search for posts by flair!" section. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/flair][Click here to see the wiki page.]]

I'll make sure this link is added to new reddit's sidebar as well :)
