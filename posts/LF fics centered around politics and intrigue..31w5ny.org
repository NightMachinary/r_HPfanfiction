Doesn't have to be dark, grim, gritty, or serious. If it is then that's awesome but something along the lines of Growing up Black. Or that fic where harry is transported back in time with a young Bellatrix and her family. I guess I'm attracted to black family politicking. But it can be other families or parties. Thanks

** A Marauders Plan: Instead of fleeing the country, Sirius sticks around to clear his name and adopt Harry. Very intrigue-y and politicial-y.

**** He's a little Super!Harry, but since the stakes increase proportionately, it's forgivable.

In fact, the Prophecy is interpreted that "marked as an equal" means that they are equals in power (hence Voldemort's helplessness when defeated while Harry is a baby- he marked Harry as his equal, so became essentially equal in power to him)

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor (link to first book)]] series has tons of politicking, but may be more than you're bargaining for...

HP/DM slash, really long (a complete 7-year, 7-book Hogwarts story), you either love it or hate it. The learning curve is the first book or two. You should read more about it on the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][author's homepage]].

Disclaiming aside, the pureblood politics really are the best I've ever read.

*** I've never read slash. So I don't know what to expect. I feel pressure to read it so I can prove I'm not a homophobe. That seems like a wrong reason. But I love politics so I think I will read it.

**** This fanfic is probably my favourite Harry Potter fanfic ever. I've read it three times (which is not an easy feat, considering the sum of it is vastly more than Rowling wrote) and it's pretty great. I am a gay man so YMMV, but I don't think the slash content should be a reason not to enjoy it.

It's highly AU but seems to be exactly what you're looking for. The sheer number of words alone devoted to negotiations and politicking should more than make up for any disinterest you have in the slash. (For what it's worth I don't think that the slash content is any 'worse' than heterosexual content in non-slash stories of a similar rating that I've read.)

***** You are right. I think I probably will enjoy something like this. The slash part is just interesting cause I've never read but doesn't mean I won't enjoy the fic. Looking forward to it. Thanks

**** Some people like it, some people don't. It's not a reflection on how 'homophobic' one is. This sub had an [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/30vf3b/does_this_bother_anyone_else/][interesting discussion]] about this recently, though.

Anyway, the slash doesn't come through until I think the 4th or 5th books. Plenty of politicking before then to decide if you like the series.

*** I finally finished this series. And I have to say I loved it. Thank you so much for this recommendation. I not only enjoyed the politics part of it but also the interactions and relationships between characters. Absolutely loved it. The slash didn't even matter. It's in my top 5 favorite fics now. Also first time someone takes an in depth interest in dealing with Harrys abuse. Sooooo good.

**** Yay! I'm so glad you liked it. I really don't like a lot of romance, het or slash, so I end up skipping most of those parts. I loved that this fic had so much going on in it, and there was substance besides the romance plot.

***** Oh yes me too. I loved that in this fic harry was someone beyond the normal prophecy. He was vates. That was a really cool and interesting concept. I hadn't read anything like it before so it was quite original. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nce again can't thank you enough for recommending it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6402668/1/House-of-Shards][House of Shards]] by Lord Basileus definitely qualifies. 17k words, abandoned. It's essentially a loose /House of Cards/ fusion.
