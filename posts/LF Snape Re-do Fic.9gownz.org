I'm looking for a Peggy Sue story I read a couple of years ago. Here is what I remember:

. Snape formed a large friend group, which included James, Sirius, Lily, Regulus and some OCs.

.One of the OCs was an Irish girl who talked a lot and the other a Slytherin girl who was secretly Muggleborn.

. At one point, Snape met his grandfather, the last member of the Prince family.

. The DADA teacher was secretly a Death Eater

. In the story's climax, Snape was offered to become a Death Eater by the teacher and accepted. When he was taken to meet Voldemort, he at first tried to talk about their similar background as halfbloods. After the meeting, he revealed he hated the DEs and escaped by flying. He then decided to abandon Hogwarts and fight Voldemort alone, without putting his friends at risk.

. During the escape, the Slytherin OC was killed. When the news came to Hogwarts, everyone discovered she was Muggleborn, causing Regulus to abandon his family and the DEs.

. The story ended with Lily deciding to search for Snape.

Does anyone know this fic? Sorry for the long post.


** linkffn(Second Chance, a new choice by moonbird). This story had a lot of promise, until the author sort of gave up on the plot elements and summarized a bunch of stuff when it was getting good to skip to the ending. I guess that's better than leaving it unfinished!

ALSO if you are ever searching for another Snape/Lily fic you can't find (or just want more to read), the [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] user *Snily3838* has a TON of favorites that are Snape/Lily including a bunch of time travel fics. It's how I found this one, since I couldn't remember the name.

  Severus was dying in the shrieking shack, and he did indeed die. However, forces out of his control rendered him the ability to re-choose. going back and choose differently.
