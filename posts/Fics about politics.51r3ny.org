I've been looking for more fanfictions with political themes - from the Wizarding World, of course - but couldn't find many. Do you guys know any particularly good ones? With any character. Thank you!

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

** While this is one of the most AU stories I have ever read, Strange and Invisible history (linkffn(6723584)) certainly fits the bill. We get a glimpse of a very old-fashioned wizarding world, where political allies are everything. I'm reminded of a few things, one of them being Hitler and the Third Reich. Once they align with another country (don't want to spoiler anything!), I am reminded of like the Romanovs in the late 19th century. I don't know why, but that's just the first thing I think of.

This story is 99 chapters long, and there is a sequel to it called Influence of Souls, which is also 99 chapters. However, this story is not complete. Please bear this in mind! I have not read the sequel yet, but I plan on reading it after my vacation.

I will be happy to answer any questions you (or anyone else) may have regarding this fic.

Edit: opened the fic and in the second paragraph it says I was right, spanking, etc.

**** Oh sorry I didn't see this message until today. I think the author is a little trigger-happy with the CP warning. What the author is referencing is Hermione is like 11-12 years old and being spanked by her parents. It's not written sexually or anything at all, just normal spanking, but Hermione is absolutely mortified at being spanked at that age.

Much later in the story, there are references to two characters having sex who are aged like 14-16. They are married and only have sex after they are married. It is not explicit, just mentioned before and after the fact. They have sex to ensure their marriage is consummated and they cannot be forced apart. This is a big part of the 'politics' of the story, where children have arranged marriages to secure two families together for political reasons. It is very clear in the story that they marry much younger than originally intended for certain reasons. Once you start reading it, you will understand. I just don't want to spoil anything for you! =)

If you have any more questions, I will be super happy to answer them!

He learns that not everything is as simple as it seems and decides that he will do everything he can to create choices for everyone. Mild Dumbledore-bashing. No pairing Rated T to be safe.

  “This will lead to another Time of Burning, mark my words; because the reactionary Muggles who figure out that they're being targeted or hindered in any way by magic will think to solve the problem by eliminating magical beings rather than attempting to secure magical allies themselves. This will in turn only tempt elements of our own society who wish nothing more than bloody conquest and a return to a darker age into action. When you take away the ability and rights of any people to self-govern, you leave them only with violence and hate to air their grievances."
