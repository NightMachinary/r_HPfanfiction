:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi y'all, I've been DESPERATE for months about finding this fic. I hope y'all can help.

It is an arranged marriage fic, and roughly 5-7 chapters. The rating is probably explicit as one of the main details I remember is draco pulling down hermione's dress while kissing (pretty sure angry/hate sex style) and there is explicit sexual content

Each chapter snapshots a history of hermione and draco's marriage, with one chapter including the sexual scene mentioned above and that Draco had someone (Theo?) Stand in for him at the wedding. Hermione also has a great relationship with Narcissa.


** I don't recognize this, but you might want to ask on [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] as someone on there might be more likely to know.
