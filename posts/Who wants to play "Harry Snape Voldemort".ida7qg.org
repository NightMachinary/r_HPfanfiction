Harry kills Voldemort, Voldemort kills Snape, and Snape takes points from Harry.

Or maybe the other way around: Harry sasses Snape, Snape doublecrosses Voldemort, and Voldemort kills Harry's friends.

Stone +smashes the wand+ brings the wand's victims back to life, the wand summons the cloak, and the cloak hides the stone.

****** Once I post it I'll come back and let you know! It starts a few years after Deathly Hallows as the ministry rebuilds itself. I always thought a lot of Ravenclaws would be involved in politics, so many of my characters are from that house and have flashbacks to the war/Hogwarts from their perspective. I'm thinking of adding this either to a memory they have or as a sort of childish way to get a piece of legislation through to show they're adults but still not very mature.

Also, thank you!

**** So the wand would be the index finger extended upwards, the stone would be a fist, and the cloak would be a flat hand? Or maybe the stone would be a circle with thumb and index, and the cloak would be a V-sign to signify that it's invisible. You could recreate the symbol with the second option.

1. During one of their "thrice defied him" incidents, James and Voldemort realise their feelings for each other. James leaves Lily and marries Voldemort (with James as the bride). Snape brews a potion that allows James to become pregnant by Voldemort, and, soon after, James gives birth to the little Harry Snape Voldemort.
2. During one of their fights, James and Snape realise their feelings for each other. Snape brews a potion that allows him to become pregnant by James. But thanks to his pregnancy, Snape isn't around to hear Trelawney's prophecy. And, shortly after the little Harry Snape Potter is born, tragedy strikes: James and Snape are murdered by a jealous Lily. Unaware of the prophecy, Voldemort decides to adopt Harry, changing his last name from "Potter" to "Voldemort".
