So, I was wondering - are there any well written fics that include Voldemort having a child himself (or just raising one)? I know there is a fairly popular fic that I read a long time ago where Harry is taken to Voldemort by Peter and raised as his son, so I'm looking for something similiar. I think it would be fun to read a story where Voldemort's kid goes to Hogwarts alongside Harry, etc. It's doesn't have to be too great, just not a lot of grammar mistakes and typos and a decent lenght will make me satisfied.


** I remember this being pleasant but I haven't read it in a long time, it also updates frequently so I'm a bit behind.

The general gist is Voldemort isn't insane like in canon and raises Harry.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
