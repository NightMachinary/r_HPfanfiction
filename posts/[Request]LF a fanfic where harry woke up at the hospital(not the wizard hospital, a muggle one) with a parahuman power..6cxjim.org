I remember reading a similar fic in questionable questing a year or so ago. I can't remember it's name so if anybody knows the one I'm talking about please remind me. Hermonie was a tinker too if I remember right.


** To clarify, you're looking for a Worm crossover quest? I don't think I've seen one with the scene you mentioned, but I only occasionally browse SB and I've never used questionably questing.
