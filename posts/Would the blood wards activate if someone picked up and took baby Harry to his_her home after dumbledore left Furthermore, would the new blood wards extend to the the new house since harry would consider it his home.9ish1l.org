** There are quite a few fics where, dumbledore's monitoring devices start chiming or simply explode when someone picks up baby harry. Granted these are mainly dumbledore bashing fics (which i don't particularly like). I was thinking about this and this led me to ask myself the above question.

What would happen?What do you guys think?
