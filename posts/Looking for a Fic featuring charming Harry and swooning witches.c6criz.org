After countless depressing angsty, dark, and drama filled stories that I've subjected myself through and then finding out that those amazing stories are abandoned. I need a nice */completed/*, lighthearted story to fill the hole in my soul.

​

I'm looking for a more confident and charming Harry that's got all the girls pining for him. He's got James' panty dropping skills and Lily's looks. Bonus points if he's talented/prodigious at magic and/or quidditch. Living parents or wrong BWL are both fine if needed.

​

An example would be Harry Potter and the Veela. (Now that I think of it, even more bonus points if he has a younger sibling. It's really endearing in the story)

​

The story can have *any* theme as long as it has the above perimeters to a certain extent. It can have any pairings (no slash), harem, lemon, smut, or whatever as long as it's well written. Tbh I prefer mature sexual themes to sappiness.


** Of Quidditch Pants and Persuasion by It's Just Not Flowing linkffn(4068063) fits this.

It's a oneshot but this is probably one of the funniest things I've read.

  Full title: The One Where The Entire Gryffindor Common Room Lusts After Harry Wearing Quidditch Pants and Hermione is Persuasive. That's rather self-explanatory, I think. Really, it's just best to move on. Equally pointless second chapter now added.

** linkffn(7017751)

Harry's a 6th year prodigy, well liked by all teachers and a professional quidditch player.This is not a WBWL story. This ticks all your boxes

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
