I remember that she was another werewolf and went to hogwarts like him as kids up till teens i remember she had to leave possibly do to a fight between them as wolves or a mating idk been a long time. Would love if anyone has other recommends with Remus and another werewolf going to hogwarts at the same time.


** Actually any werewolf love story would be interesting.

This is my favorite fic. She's not a werewolf, but she is an animagus that takes the form of a wolf
