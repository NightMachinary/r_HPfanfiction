Hi everyone. Earlier today I realized that in years of reading HP fanfic, I (surprisingly) haven't read very many Harry/Luna stories that aren't crackfics.

Send me your favorites, preferably lengthy ones if possible. Thanks!


** Not long, unfortunately, but this is my favorite: linkffn(contemplating clouds)

It doesn't use her being a seer as a reason for her eccentricity though, she is actually a lot more down to earth when she's a seer than when she's not.

*** I agree, this is the only fanfic I've ever enjoyed with Harry having a harem in it. The AU it builds to allow it is really quite amazing, and it's nothing like canon at all. If the author changed up some of the names and settings, replaced quidditch with some other sport and took it off of ffn, they could probably sell it as an original book series without infringing on the Harry Potter trademark.

** You somehow remind Myself of me a bit ago, i was interested in actually intelligent harry fics, and if harry was with luna before the sorting would it possibly put harry in ravenclaw and give him a thirst for knowledge? I didn't know but i tried. Apparently almost none of the fics actually make harry a smart person, sadly

Then i just asked for smart harry fics and found that a lot of Haphne fics actually make harry pretty smart. Not too smart but smarter than canon and so i am rn reading 4 different Haphne fics and beta reading one other fic (not Haphne)

**** Yes i do have a recommendation

It is ”the methods of rationality” i am reading it right now

Harry is incredibly smart but does not have the power of an eidetic memory but is still very nice

Although i do have one fic in which harry is absolutely god like and that is called ”core threads”

TMOR (aka the methods of rationality) is over a million words if i remember correctly and has its own subreddit [[/r/TMOR][r/TMOR]]

and ”core threads” is an unrealistically op harry in the magical power sense rather than political as everything interesting happens in first year and it ends in the start of second year

Oh and harry has like 2 million souls in his body

Which are magical cores with about twice the amount of magic of an average 7th year

Oh and he can literally shift into another reality
