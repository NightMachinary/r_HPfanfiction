I thought this would be fun to do, maybe not necessarily as the focus of a story, but certainly for a scene/chapter it would be cool to see. A wizard/witch just got their magical portrait finished and they're just interacting with it. There's all kinds of ways you could take it, funny, sad, happy, etc. My idea(which I may use in one of my fics) was for the portrait and the wizard to hate each other and just tear into one another in a really funny scene, but I'm interested to see how other people take it and where they go with it.


** For reasons unknown to any Hagrid had been gifted a magical portrait of himself one year.

"Well now, aren't you a handsome fella. Look right proper you do let me they you what. Them furs look real good they do."

The portrait bashfully looked off to the side as he was praised.

"/You're a handsome fella yourself as well there Rubeus. That's a mighty manly beard you got there./"

Hagrid bashfully looked off to the side as he was praised.

"Why thank you, um don't rightly know what to call ya do I? Well that's a really thinker that is let me tell you."

"Nah easy enough just call me Hagrid, I'm sure everyone else will. No sense in making a bother of it."

Hagrid the person nodded his head and that made right sense it did.

"That makes right sense it does."

Hagrid the portrait nodded along.

"/Always nice to be able to talk to someone sensible it is./"

"Always nice indeed."

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

5 hours later

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Nice proper chat this is, can't remember the last time I had a decent talk I can't remember at all."

"/You're a good listener you are, good at saying what needs saying you are. Best conversation I remember ever having./"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Of the many legends surrounding Hogwarts the old groundskeepers hut is the one most know still today.

A ghost can be seen of a giant of a man still talking to his portrait with no one even sure what they are actually talking about.

The goblins have a standing bet that has a pool up to 7 digits to the winner. They haven't payed out yet in 3 centuries.

*** That's just fanon, I like when I see it in fanfics, but people usually give portraits too much power, in canon when portraits are made they only know one or two things about the person they were painted of. Headmasters keep their portraits hidden when they're painted so they can talk to the portrait and teach it a bunch of things then it's put out after they die.
