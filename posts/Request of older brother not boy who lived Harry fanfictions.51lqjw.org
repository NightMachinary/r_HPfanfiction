  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

#+begin_quote
  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...
