A few years later, while Death Eaters run the school and burn everything muggle, she sneaks into her hidden genetics laboratory in the dungeons and experiments on the DNA and blood of magic and nonmagical plants and animals to uncover the mysteries of inheritable magic and curses...


** Well, I'd wonder why she's trying to do this herself, instead of working with a muggle, or a muggleborn.
