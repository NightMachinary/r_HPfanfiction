I am working on a series of fanfiction stories from different perspectives of people living in the wizarding world and am wondering if anyone has any short stories they would want to see?

So far I have a wizard PI story and a junior quidditch league, bad news bears, type story that I am kicking around ideas for


** The little things would be cool! That does sound like a great opportunity to explore the small things that don't add up to a big story. A home-witch canning and gardening. Shopping in Honeydukes. Going for a yearly check up at the family Healer. Working in cauldron bottom quality control. Negotiating the possibilities of sanctioned flying carpets.

*** Oooh, like all this wand-care stuff -- polishing, cleaning. Wand check-ups at Ollivanders.

**** Ooh, that's a good one!

Or applying for Schedule 3 potions ingredients. The office is always so busy and they only have one person working it. The wait is dreadful. Did you hear So-and-so got denied because their paperwork was filed wrong? I heard someone else was bribing the clerk with Honeydukes. And then they closed an hour early while I was still waiting! I should file a complaint. I still haven't gotten approval for pimlump pods for my Kneazle acne potion. It's not like /I'm/ going to dry them and sprinkle it into my afternoon tea; I've never been a fan of psychedelics. Kids these days. Blah blah blah.

***** Or stuff that's ridiculously magical that the characters casually drop in conversation -- My little snookums had her first case of accidental magic today! I'm so terribly proud of her, though this elephant trunk attached to my shoulder is quite inconvenient. My husband keeps trying to get me to go to Mungo's to get rid of it, but the prices they charge these days are outrageous! It's not that noticeable is it?

** Wizard space exploration "science fiction"-type books would be fun. Like, having them go to space with old-timey Victorian diving outfits and in special souped-up cars, kind of like The First Men in the Moon.

** If you're looking for something more specific I'd love a retelling of Harry Potter through the eyes of Poppy, or McGonagall.

*** Hmm, trying to stray away from full fledged characters but maybe the Matron of an old magical school before Hogwarts became mandatory?

Edit: I think I read a Harry Potter through McGonagall's eyes story, let me see if I can find it for you!

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** I'd love to see more about Healers, mediwitches, things like that. Exploring health and illness, magical treatment, education, something that we don't really get to see in the books. We see snips of how Pomfrey runs her hospital wing, but what about magical emergencies at Mungo's?

** Basically a backstory to Alexandra Quick - Inverarity does so much worldbuilding anyway that it'd be relatively easy. That series is the one I place on a fucking altar, it's so good. There should be fanfics of this fanfic.
