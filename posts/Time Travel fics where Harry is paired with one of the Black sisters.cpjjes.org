*** Wind Shear kinda didn't reach it's full potential.

He starts teaching DADA to help kids defend themselves and kinda prepare them for a Voldemort filled world. It looked like it was heading to a grand battle with Dumbledore/Blacks/Potter against Voldemort but then it anticlimactically ended with Harry/Bellatrix in a cave.

Or maybe I'm wrong, I /did/ read this half asleep at 3 am. Either way it was still enjoyable.

**** It did feel a bit like the author was wrapping it up just to wrap it up. I've had that same experience, where you slap an ending on something because you feel yourself losing interest and don't want to actually abandon it.

It's still a good story, despite that, and worth the number of times it's recommended around here.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

#+begin_quote
  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.

  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No time paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
