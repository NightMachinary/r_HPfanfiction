I'm curious to know what are things you think are overdone and you wish the fanfic community would just move past? What are things that you see often that don't add up or make sense? How do you think certain aspects of the HP world could be better utilized in fanfics?

For me personally, I wish authors would base Ron's character off book Ron not movie Ron because I think he's a really good character that often gets pushed to the side. (Yes, this is in part because of the Ron Weasley appreciation post yesterday).

Also I wish more people wrote Hinny because while I love all the different Harry pairings, I would love to see a version of this canon relationship blossom with actual development and not the shoe drop JKR gave us thinking she made it obvious Harry and Ginny would end up together.

Last thing for me, I think a lot of authors don't fully realize just how difficult life would be post-war. Not just survivors guilt but with the PTSD of the main characters being literal children fighting for their lives. I've read too many fics where the war gets swept under the rug and everyone goes back to their old selves and the only thing they take away from the war is their celebrity status.


** Some thoughts, not in order of importance:

I'd love to see people using named OCs as actual OCs. It feels like every Blaise, Susan and Daphne in the fandom are the exact same character. This goes double for Daphne. There are literal /thousands/ of ice queen fics, extremely similar down to the same lines.

One thing that I find myself missing is self-consistant mindsets. As in often times a fic has a Harry that has a set of morals that he pushes heavily, but then he randomly starts breaking it himself, not as a depiction of hypocrisy, but as something that the author doesn't even seem to notice. From fics that say "we're not discriminating against muggleborns, /but.../" , to Harry throwing a massive tantrum over bullying only to sic Fred and George on someone in the next chapter.

It feels like this one is getting better in the past few years, but depth for secondary characters/antagonists is still oftentimes lacking. This "Harry always good, Voldemort/Dumbledore/whoever Harry hates always bad" mindset skips out on a lot of potential, and results in bashing. Bad people do good things sometimes, and good people do bad things sometimes, too. Acknowledging it is something that fics seriously lack, i.e. all the cases of indie!Harry being outright malicious to people he doesn't like, breaking laws or literally becoming the ultra-authoritarian government that he says he's fighting.

Another thing I'd love to see less of is random bullshit happening just so Harry can be a hero. Like something that adds no value to the story, no story progression, just random scenes where a dude does something, Harry flexes his Mary Sue Powers(tm) and it's never spoken about again. If you have to constantly say that your character is a good guy, chances are he isn't. Which isn't even a bad thing, people just hate admitting it for some reason.

Tying into that, I'd love to see more fics where at least the author, if not Harry himself, acknowledges that Harry isn't a good person. A /lot/ of indie!Harry fics would suddenly become considerably better if they acknowledged that using your inherited wealth to more or less install yourself as a dictator isn't a good or noble thing to do.

Stepping away from the negatives, I'd love to see more fics with light-dark cooperation. Be it some external threat arising, forcing Dumbledore and Voldemort to get along, or something post-war, the two factions learning to understand each other and co-exist.

Another thing I'd love to see more of is Harry /not/ being the overpowered leader guy that he always is. Just an above-average kid climbing through the ranks, be it on the Order or the Death Eaters. Because seriously, no matter how much of a prodigy he is, you can only read so much of a fifteen year old suddenly creating a whole new faction and leading it decently.

One more thing that I rarely see is the characters being depicted as human beings, with their own flaws and vices. Not to mention /teenagers/. And little things can go so far here. Just minor, normal teenage things like having Harry be awkward at the Yule Ball, or Harry and Ron sneaking past Molly to have some beers by the nearby creek can easily make your characters feel that much more /real/.

And one last thing I'd love to see completely removed, or at least heavily reduced, is forced relationships. I'm not talking about marriage contracts (although those are also annoying to read), but rather a relationship that has no background nor purpose, that feels forced into the story. Way too many fics just randomly introduce a girl like 3/4ths of the way through (mostly Daphne, I've noticed) and have Harry suddenly fall in love at a frightening speed, only for it to serve /no purpose whatsoever/, or worse, to move on to completely take over the plot.

*** You bring up a LOT of good points!

One of the main things I don't like about a lot of Harry fics is how far the authors go to glorify everything he is and does. It becomes all about the titles and the power he holds and they try to make him seem like some wildly powerful sixteen year old who also happens to know exactly what he wants to do with all that power despite being a child. So suddenly, he had really Good Judgement, Knowledge of Everything, and is Skilled enough to always be three steps ahead of Dumbledore while being a student and still attending classes at Dumbledores school. I feel like it takes him down a very Tom Riddle-y path without having him do any of the things Tom Riddle did (like actually extensively study everything he could and put hard work into achieving those skills). And like you said we just have to accept that Harry is a good guy because it is said he's a good guy. I don't know I just don't like the fics where Harry has more titles and powers than he has years in his life and he knows what to do with it and is seemingly always in control. I agree that I wish they would show teenagers be actual teenagers. Not fully fledged adults with politician minds in the bodies of teenagers.

**** The whole trope you described, to me, just generally screams "self-insert". Which is a bit disturbing because that would imply the people writing it actually /believe/ that their Harry is good, and that his methods are good. Like, morally good, not effectively good.

I feel like titles have their place, but pretty universally end up being overstacked and severely misused. I don't even know how many fics I've read had Harry saying that he believes the muggleborn are equal to the older families, while sitting on his metaphorical throne that he inherited and constantly bringing up stuff that pretty much confirms that they are, in fact, /not/ equal. Such as the way overused trope of having a grimoire that takes your arm off if you're not a Potter. The good ol' "We love your kind, as long as you know your place."

Which, again, is a completely fine mindset for a fic and a theme that'd be interesting to read as long as it wasn't equating muggleborns to real life minorities as some authors tend to do. As long as the author acknowledges that it's not a view that a good guy would hold.

**** Yeah. And even if they do the whole ‘summer training montage' trope, it just still doesn't seem like he's actually /worked/ for it. It's a cheap way to pretend he worked hard for it without actually showing character growth.

Like, what did he give up to gain these powers? Does his dabbling in powerful Dark magic mean his impulse control is shot to pieces? While he was using a time turner to fit in all these extra study hours, did he fuck up time and now has to fix it?

One of the best examples of someone doing an Overpowered!Harry right is Antithesis. Every step he takes and every new magic he learns, he suffers for it. It really exemplifies the idea of “if it were easy, then everyone would've done it”.

*** I agree. In canon, Snape was complaining how Harry is arrogant and mediocre. Readers can decide that for themselves. However, the fact is that Harry wasn't really a powerful prodigy, besides him producing a patronus in his third year.

That was proven once again in chapter 28 of the Half-blood Prince when Harry called Snape a coward and tried to hit him with Cruciatus and Sectumsempra, he never showed any powerful magic compared to Snape.

It would be really interesting to get a better Harry Potter character, because it is either a powerful Mary Sue or it is an arrogant but easily manipulated brat incapable of critical thinking.

My 10-year-old niece told me after finishing the Half-Blood Prince that she still thought Snape was obviously on the side of Light. So I really couldn't understand how no one else in the book did until after his death.

**** Honestly, reading HBP when it came out I thought plot armor was the only reason Harry didn't die right there. It was what got him through the past couple of years anyway.

Also, I'd say the Mary Sue ones are even more arrogant. If you removed plot armor, I'd go as far as saying canon Harry would survive longer, purely because he's pretty good at running and hiding.

**** Agree that Harry's far overpowered in fics, but Snape is also acknowledged as a highly skilled and competent wizard. Harry's still only 16, with a bad education in Defense, makes sense he doesn't stand a chance against Snape- but not because he's a bad wizard. And we know Hermione's intelligent and good at magic, which Snape either utterly ignores or insults. So him calling Harry "mediocre," doesn't really mean much

Definitely agree that it's exhausting how often canon seems to assume the reader/wizarding world is stupid. I read the books around age 8, and never believed Harry was right about Snape

Otherwise he just would have gone kidnapped Harry when he was outside Hogwarts in HBP with Tonks, taken him straight to Voldemort, raised the alarm and acted innocent.

** 1) Honestly, I'm absolutely done with reading Slytherin Harry. Nearly all of them are exactly the same. And as much as I'd love a /real/ Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff Harry, literally none exist. All Ravenclaw Harrys act like Slytherin Harrys (in some stories the Hat will even try to put him into Slytherin only for Harry to convince it into Ravenclaw) and Hufflepuff Harrys are the same as Gryffindor Harrys.

And in regards to the Houses, whenever Harry goes to the Goblins (which another nauseating occurence) he's /always/ descended from godric or salazar. Never Rowena or Helga. Honestly, these two houses/families never get any love.

2) There need not be /any/ more creature Harry fics if they're all going to devolve into crappy romance. Especially fucking vampires, goddamn! I mean write whatever you want, it's your right to do so. But, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! All of them? Seriously?!?!

3) This is kinda related to the last one but writers can write an interesting and developed love interest/romance without it taking over the story. /Please/ try to watch for your plot losing its original premise in favor of romance.

4) Diagon Alley was fun the first time readers went through that section. Unless something plot relevant has changed about that sequence, it never needs to be redone.

5) Neville is not Ron 2.0 and will not suddenly become some suave, sexy player when he gets a new wand.

** I'd like to see people taking more risks when it comes to plots. At this point, I can read the premise of most fics and make a fairly accurate guess as to how it will go and I'm getting tired of it. More post Hogwarts adventures with their own self-contained storylines. More significant AUs where the Horcruxes don't exist, and Voldemort's return is by some other original mechanism. Oh, and more crossovers that don't merely cannibalise the events and characters of one fandom in order to make the other look cool.

I'd also like to see more effort being expended on more novel-style stories in the 50-150k word range. Tightly written, without tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of words of needless side threads. With a bit of luck these would stand a better chance of reaching completion than the planned 7 year epics.

And I'd like to see less blind shipping. I'd rather people focus on the story and characters first, and if a romance fits then sure, go to town. Stories that are built wholly on ships are often one note and incredibly samey for a given ship. Hopefully a greater focus on plot and character development will force the romance to stand on its own merit rather than simply expecting to be given a pass because it tags the right two people to draw in the hungry masses.

It just always sounds so fake and disingenuous. Even nicknaming Draco 'Dray.' I don't know why but it just always sounds so forced and OOC.

Along the same lines (though I do this too, for the dramatic factor in tense scenes and whatnot) is having one character address a character by their name, when they are having a conversation with just the two of them. Like:

"Harry, you have to do what's right for you!" she said.

Harry responded, "But I just don't know, Hermione."

"Sometimes, Harry, you just have to take a risk," she concluded.

** The things that I would like to see more:

1)Magic being magic not a science that needs maths and things like that to create spells. Is not that I have a problem with a “scientific”approach is more that I find is overdone and takes away the magic that I felt when reading the original series. I like when fanfiction takes a more philosophical or abstract approach to magic.

2) Kids acting their age. I started reading fanfiction when I was 12-13 at the time I loved the dark, Indy Harry that acted so cool( that was what I thought at the time) and he already knew everything about everything because he read a book before school. This eleven year old already had a political agenda and was outsmarting everyone. He just happens to read that Sirius Black was in prison and went to find the records of the trail (as any kid would).If he was a slytherin the house had politics and he made power moves and things like that and all the eleven year old kids were also part of this power plays. Now that I'm older this just seems absurd to me and I can't take it seriously. I mean if you want a story with adults then write a story where the characters are adults.

1. Departure from canon. When I first started reading fanfiction I liked canon rehash because I liked to see for example how a Ravenclaw Harry would face the troll, the chamber or Sirius escaping. As I read more and more canon rehash it started to be boring as it was the same thing over and over. So I would love to see more fanfiction that explore different adventures that the ones we see in the books.

2. Exploring magical communities outside Britain is just something that I haven't seen much and I really like when is done well. I love when there are different countries in the magical world than in the muggle world. I would love to see more fanfiction outside Britain. Maybe Harry decides to travel the world after Voldemort's defeat, maybe we follow Dumbledore when he was young traveling out of Hogwarts.

3. Flawed characters that make mistakes and learn.

4. Character that we don't know very well being explore in an original way. With this I mean trying to stay away or at least twist the fanon tropes for them.

5. Competent ministry of magic, competent death eaters and competent order. Is just something that I like to see.

What I don't want to ever read again

1. Mini lords.
2. Globins solve everything
3. Bashing. You don't need to trash a character in order for them to be in odds with your protagonist they can just don't get along because they have clashing personalities or different goals.
4. Lazy Ron is holding Harry back this is just... I mean they are just normal kids that don't like to do homework all day. If you want to make a more studious Harry that's great but saying that he was always so intelligent but Ron holds him back is just stupid.
5. Muggles are the best wizards suck. Is just like bashing but with the whole wizard society.
6. House elves will die if they are set free. I find that is overused and a lazy way of facing the topic.
7. Voldy, moldyshorts, dumbles, old goat
8. Goblins just want wizards to say hi to them... no is not that easy and if it is then is pretty boring.
9. Adult/child romance. I don't care if you have adult/child relationships in your fanfiction as long as you show how this is problematic. For example a middle/high school student /teacher relationship is not good. So I dislike when authors try to sell it as something normal and romantic. Is just not something I like. That being said I would like to read a story where we see how this is problematic and the harm that is causing the child. If for example you are writing about character that doesn't care if she/he is molesting children okay but don't tell me that this person is normal and just love the kid and the kid is just also so happy about this and it is so romantic.

If doing a crack fic ignore all of the above.

** 1.  Good SPAG, flow and characterization. Doesn't take 200k+ words to get through year 1 (PS was under 80k) for example, and the characters have to be reasonably characterized.

2.  No bashing.

3.  No MarySue!Hermione (see my complaints with Fanon!Hermione [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jvue3g/hermione_is_not_allowed_to_be_flawed_in_most_hp/gcnbryu/][here]]. Taure's Victoria Potter has the best Hermione I've seen so far.

4.  Fics where Hermione isn't 100% perfect and her actions have real consequences. None of that canon weaksauce shit.

5.  No Muggle OR Wizard wank. A compare/contrast between the two and the things they provide to each other would be great. Authors like to project themselves on one side or the other and it's really cringy and obvious when they do.

6.  Good magic system with consistency.

7.  Fem!Harry is always nice to see.

8.  Incorporate some lesser-used characters. I've seen plenty Hermione/Neville/Draco/the twins subplots and redemption arcs, it's time for something different. Maybe Ron, the Creeveys, Percy, Montague, and canon OCs (à la Daphne Greengrass).

9.  Fics where Ron is given the credit he deserves, whether he's the central character or not. Fics where he steps up are a special favourite.

10. Minimal canon rehash.

11. Character-driven vs plot driven. Plot is still important but I like seeing charcters learn and grow up too.

12. Competent protagonist. Enough said.

13. I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi and/or x-over fic.

14. Is complete.

** The one thing I always ask every aspiring fanfiction author is "what's your angle?". If you're going to write a fic, then what makes it unique? If it's inspired by a other fic then what makes it different? Why should people read your fic instead of another fic with the same idea?

Every time I've written a fic, it's been inspired by a /lack/ of fics filling that niche. I wrote Scrambled Sorting because there was a lack of fics where lots of students were sorted differently and that then explored how that alternate universe would play out. I wrote Departure from the Diary because there was a lack of fics where the diary recognised Harry as a fellow horcrux and altered its plans. I wrote Unseen Perspective because there was a lack of fem!Voldemort fics where she wasn't shipped with anyone.

Don't try to write new versions of stories that haven't been written before. Write new stuff.

** I am BEGGING for authors to:

1. Please use other female characters other than Hermione. She is in absolutely every pairing. you can't read about any of the male characters in a romance without the only options being slash or Hermione. Particularly would love to see Marietta, Romilda, Padma, parvati, Angelina, Alicia, Pansy, Tonks...oh and Blaise as a main love interest not just a friend!

Also would be really nice if:

1. People should act their age. If they are 11 they should act 11. If needed do sone research on child and adolescent development.

2. Do research. This is just part of being a writer and it's what good authors do. If you are going to write about bigotry, oppression, ptsd, war torn societies, abuse, mental health/illness, chronic illness, disability, trauma, assault, recovery, etc. please do some research.

3. Please have a solid understanding of anatomy if you are going to write smut. Also the idea that a 16 year old boy is magically a sex god with 11 inches is very unrealistic. Or honestly even that they would know the exact needs of a new partner without any level of communication is pretty unlikely. And if you are going to write in BDSM dynamics (in stories with ADULTS) it's helpful in writing better scenes to do some research on that as well. Like being a dom doesn't inherently include sadism for example. Sex doesn't even have to include these dynamics. Also this is more in slash but top is not interchangeable with dom and bottom is not interchangeable with sub.

4. I wish there wasn't so much Ron bashing and that ppl wrote him like he was in the books.

5. I know fanfic is just for fun but if you are putting in the work to write a well developed story it doesn't hurt to visiting the writing subreddit and read up on building tension in plots, writing original characters, etc.

Every pairing even if there's another girl involved. A couple weeks ago when Luna was the discussion, I realized why there was so little HP/LL: the majority of those fics are Lunar Harmony and most aren't trying to read about polyarmorous teens giving verbal smackdowns to adults.

** Really, i only recommend two things -

1. Don't follow the Stations of Canon. Every one of your readers knows the plots of HP books 1-7. If your story rehashes any of those storylines, think harder.
2. Don't base your story off of tropes that everyone else has already done. By that, I mean don't write WBWL, manipulative-Dumbledore, 'goblinfriend!Harry', etc etc. There are already a million bad stories using those plots, don't add another turd to the shit-pile.

Beyond that, have fun. Fanfiction is a great way to exercise your creativity and work on your writing.

** I hate it when a fic has excessive telling and not enough showing. I know this is age old writing advice which often misleads people but I still find it very hard to immerse myself in a story with this problem. Example linkffn(The Archaeologist). It's “this happened for a few months” then “that happened for a few weeks” and a bunch of exposition thrown in. I want to see Harry excavate the site. I want to see her suffer. I want to see the months spent on it. I want to see the her writing her book and thinking of Filius and Hermione. It felt like a summary of a great fic. And lot of fics read like this as well. I don't want the summary, I want the story.

** I'd love to see more unique takes on time travel fix-it fics and common tropes. I'm currently writing my own version where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin. (And yes, I did just copy and paste that description.)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/lp4vkx/just_posted_the_new_chapter_for_my_fic_hbi_hr_at/][This]] post I made has me going in-depth on how I plan to handle the various overdone tropes I've decided to write into my fic.

I know that I lot of people hate Lordship fics and Slytherin Politics, but I honestly love reading those cliches! I've decided to do a new take on it where the Lords and Ladies aren't ridiculously overpowered, but they do have additional perks to being a part of wizarding "royalty" except the term is only used for the old families that are a part of the Wizengamot. I'm also featuring PTSD in the fic a lot, too, even though it's been three years since the war. PTSD doesn't just go away.

Better Slytherin!Harry fics, too, especially if it ties in with Harry going back in time. Everyone makes Ron this petty little kid who despises Harry because he's in Slytherin, which is ridiculous! Harry is more prejudiced against Slytherins in the books than Ron is! Literally, all Ron said was that he couldn't imagine being in Slytherin because of his family's reactions.

No bashing, too. Or if you're going to bash, at least do it logically without making up a ton of shit. The only bashing in my fic is based on canon things. Like Molly Weasley taking over Sirius's house and throwing expensive shit away (he didn't care, but /still/), Mundungus Fletcher being a thief and no one caring, and Albus Dumbledore leaving Harry with abusive relatives.

No complete retelling of the books, either, if you're doing time travel. In my fic, Harry will be ignoring a lot of the events that got him in trouble or looked at in the books. He'll stop Hermione from getting attacked by the troll, he'll tell Dumbledore about Hagrid's dragon, and he won't be going to Lockhart's disastrous duelling club.

*** What is it with snape fans and thinking lily should apologize for not wanting to associate with a bigoted wizard nazi that want people like her dead.

Let's assume Dumbledore's personality didnt undergo too much change between the marauders' Era and present Era. The reason he tried to redeem malfoy and not snape was simple. Malfoy showed panic, hesitancy etc once he became a death eater. There's no indication that snape did. He didn't regret becoming a death eater until lily was targeted specifically (not just as enemy combatant).

Snape fans like to assume that teenage snape reluctantly joined voldemort because he had no other choice or some bullshit. There's no canon evidence to support that.

Snape is obviously a smart dude. If he knew that Lily didn't approve of his death eater ambitions he would do his best to hide it from her. The fact that lily still figured out he can't wait to join voldemort with his future death eater buddies showed how obvious his actions were.

And seriously telling a woman that she should apologize for cutting off a toxic scum from her life is misogyny. It's all too common among snape fans. I'm tired of repeating it.
