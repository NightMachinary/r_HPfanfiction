I've chosen [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]] for this month. There was a lot of enthusiasm for it in the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/246sn6/resistance_amazing_hhr_fanfic_amazing_fic_in/][other thread]] and I wanted something that was complete this time.

I'm not going to start up a second official book club for HBS, but there seems to be a lot of interest in it and I encourage y'all to start an ongoing one for it.

And since the theme is AU, I also recommend people check out the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] if they haven't yet. It's my current favorite, a very unique rework of the Wizarding World. The second book is in progress and updates every Saturday.


** I just finished the chapter and I really enjoyed the set up. However, the author's writing style really just rubbed me the wrong way.

Outside of dialogue, almost every sentence felt like some kind of lumbering monolith made from the corpses of smaller sentences, held together only with glue sticks and commas. Sentences over twenty words were incredibly common, almost the norm, and I don't think I saw a single sentence of over five words that didn't have a comma in it.

All in all, the structure made me read it in a sort of breathy, hurried tone, like a kid with asthma trying to tell you something /very/ important after finishing a marathon. The author also never seems to use a single word when they had the option of using two, or three. The pacing felt a bit dragged out towards the end of the first chapter.

Scanning the second chapter, it seems to have improved a bit.

Outside of writing style, the author managed to capture the post-apocalyptic feel well, and I really got an impression of a grimy, gritty world. There were a lot of good hooks here, and I definitely want to keep reading.

So, first impressions:

Good opening, plot wise, but bloated.

Anyone else have the same issues?

*** Reading the first two sentences I had the exact same issue.

You really nailed it when you said how it makes you read in a rushed, breathless tone.

However, the plot seems quite interesting and it's been a while since I've read a good post-apocalyptic anything so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one.

*** This is actually something that I like about the Firebird Trilogy so far. Harry doesn't all of a sudden kick ass after a summer of angst. He is getting stronger, but its happening slowly. Character building. Or something like that. :-)

** The writing style might turn some people off stylistically. Just technically speaking, the description is more likely to confuse than to color the background. I wouldn't say it's hard to follow, but there's a lot to keep track of when a typical sentence goes something like this: This happened, while she's doing this, and he's doing this, but after they did this, all while this was happening.

Colorful but confusing.

There are some other nitpicks I have with the story. It tends to be very PK. While my preferred ship is H/Hr, I'm not a fan of most H/Hr tropes. Still, if you can accept the romance is probably the major category and action/adventure/drama as the subcategory, then this is a very good story.

**** Portkey. It's a fanfic site dedicated to the HHr ship. A lot of their stories fall under certain tropes since a fic must follow certain rules on the site (like it has to end in H/Hr). It's not as well maintained as it was before, but they have a lot of stories.

**** This might be from my time reading PK stories primarily, but here's some examples:

- H/Hr will be the main pairing, but R/L and D/G will be the inevitable subpairings should they be involved in the plot somehow
- Hermione spends all of her time fretting and worrying over Harry, going extremely out of her way to identify any potential problems he might have in the future and preparing for them
- This one isn't as prevalent, but Weasley-bashing will occur. Usually Ron is an emotionally abusive jerk or Ginny is a conniving harlot
- Hermione is the only one who calms down Harry when he goes into all CAPS rage
- Harry distances himself from Hermione, going so far as to date others in order to make sure she's not close to him so Voldemort won't harm her
- Harry will visit Hermione's parents and they will love him. Cue handsy time in either bedroom whilst in the house

There are others if I think about it, but those are the main ones that go to the top of my head

***** Wow, I've never or rarely seen most of these, kinda glad I mostly stick to FFN and AO3. The last is the most common that I've seen, followed by the Weasley-bashing. I usually drop a fic if there's a ridiculous amount of bashing going on, especially if the author has a grudge against Ginny or Molly.

******** Ugh, ITWATN. Where to even start? Chapter 1 has the Hermione rape thing, which only seems to happen to give Harry an excuse to messily kill Ron, and even leaving aside the bad taste there's the plot hole in that he's apparently a "shit wizard" but somehow manages to overpower her twice. And the whole thing seems to have no real repercussions and Hermione is effectively a supporting character in what should be her own story. Ron might as well have crashed Harry's broomstick for all the issue is explored. In any other fic (okay, almost any other) this would be by far the worst thing, but here it has competition. The entire premise is built around punishing Ron for something he's not done yet and is unlikely (given the changes in the timeline) ever to do, and they also feed Percy to Fluffy because why not. And kick the Weasleys out of the Burrow so they can knock it down and build a McMansion. And then there's what happens to Ron, which is just sick.

Harry Crow was just overblown and bad, I dropped it around like chapter 40 or something, I think. In This World and the Next was /disturbing/.

***** H/Hr is not a pairing I frequent because of the reasons you listed, and these:

- Characters are reduced to caricatures of themselves, and have all the extra dimensions to them removed. Snape is either an evil idiot or is made of genius and awesome, Sirius is either a retarded thug or best-dad-ever^{tm} and so on.

- Harry and Hermione were always destined to be together. Always. Any other option was because of evil^{tm}

- Hermione's parents are named Dan and Emma. /cringe/

- Evil is much easier to defeat once Harry and Hermione are together. Dramatic tension? Pfft, we have romance for that.

I'm sure there are a trillion more, but quite frankly, I stopped reading H/Hr stories because of these (and in general, there is a higher percentage of 14 year old girls writing that pairing than any other, with Harry/Draco coming a close second).
