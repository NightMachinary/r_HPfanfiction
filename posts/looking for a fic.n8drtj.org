:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hi üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i'm looking for a certain fic. it was a tom/harry (i think) and it started during one of the summer holidays. harry started to get letters from ‚Äòhis nemesis/enemy' who wanted to bury the hatchet. he started to get along with the writer and when he asked lupin they initially thought it might be malfoy but didn't exclude the possibility of it being voldemort. but it was way to ridiculous. and then sometime during the school year the writer wanted to meet up. and send harry a letter with a book recommendation about warding. a specific ward that makes it impossfor those inside to lie and to capsule harm to one another. voldemort set up the ward and harry asked bill weasley to check if it was properly set up and so that he has a back up knowing where he is if sth bad happened. and he went to a meeting and it turned out to be tom. and that all i remember really. i think i've read this fic about 2/3 years ago but it might me even longer. it might be deleted or changed but i would love to get any type of info.
