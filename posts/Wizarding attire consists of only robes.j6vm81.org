** Obviously the ties, and most people's perception of the uniforms in general, come from the movies.

However, the cover art (particularly the American versions) and a lot of the chapter art show Harry and a few other characters wearing muggle clothes underneath or instead of their robes. You can argue about how canon those illustrations are, but I'm pretty sure I've heard the Rowling approved them, at least.

I don't have digital copies of the books for easy searching, but I would bet that even if there aren't any clear references in the text to anyone wearing anything underneath their robes, there probably also isn't any clear evidence that it doesn't happen.

Remember, they're in Scotland during the winter, in a (probably) drafty castle heated only by fires. Warming charms are not canon. They are definitely wearing more layers under those robes.

*** As for wearing stuff under robes, I really love Lucius's leather armor-ish shirt his sleeveless robes in the film. It made him look so otherworldly and warrior like.

** Well, it is true that Hogwarts students only wear plain black work robes as their uniform, but wizards like Fudge and Slughorn are described as wearing trousers. It also not only (pull-over) robes, but there would also be gowns, (over) robes, capes and cloaks.

** Crouch senior wore a business suit. Fudge wore a bowler instead of a pointed witch's hat. So there's evidence that the "traditional robes" wasn't the only thing that they wore. That one wizard during the world cup actually wore a dress cause he liked a breeze on the undercarriage, and he thought he was fitting in with the muggles.

So there's plenty of evidence that they wore whatever they wanted on a regular basis. For more formal situations they probably stuck to the more traditional robes, though.

I'd suggest that there is actually a great diversity of clothing that they wear. Especially with magic available, there is no doubt in my mind that some of them go nuts with the fashion. Look at what some of the haute couture people come up with, and they don't have magic to play with like the wizarding world.

** For a purely European style, the wikipedia pages for [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1600%E2%80%931650_in_Western_European_fashion][early]] and [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1650%E2%80%931700_in_Western_European_fashion][late]] 17th century fashion are probably the best general resources. In particular, [[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fran%C3%A7ois_Desportes_001.jpg][this self-portrait]], [[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Margarita_Teresa_of_Spain_Mourningdress.jpg][this mourning dress]], [[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anthony_van_Dyck_090.jpg][this gown worn by Isabella Brandt]], and [[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Philip_IV_of_Spain_-_Vel%C3%A1zquez_1644.jpg][this gown worn by Philip IV]] show attire which could be influences. I like to imagine Ron's extremely frilly robe is something like [[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Isabella_Rubens.jpg][this]], which would indeed be the height of fashion in 1600.

(note: these are links to wikimedia indices, not direct links to files. if you use a reddit app it might think otherwise based on the url)

In general, underclothing would be some sort of layering (probably a chemise if I remember right) over the torso and essentially tights over the legs. This is all upper-class fashion, of course, based on the idea of a ‘court wizard' being a real thing at the time.

if we extrapolate out to the modern day, robes over modern clothing isn't a huge reach, although based on the general conservatism I would expect something more traditional to be more common, sometimes with anachronistic individual elements like Fudge's hat.

** It always seemed so weird to me that they do not wear anything under robes. Like, with women I can imagine it because it's just a dress, but I can't see a guy wearing a dress and nothing else underneath it. No way. I guess I'll take the "traditional" silver tie over nothing but underpants, pale hairy legs, and black socks. The image is just so ridiculous I can't take it seriously, especially when it's someone like Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort who wears it.

So, instead, I visualise wizards wearing trousers and the robe in my head is more like a cloak or something like that.

** I've always hated how wizards only wear dress robes to formal events. I think you could do so much with gowns and magic together. Look at what we've done with the Met Gala the past few years.

** I reread the series recently, and I spent some time paying attention to the robe references because someone in discord was trying to get to the bottom of it. For the most part it is vague, but I felt like there was enough references to robes that they were in fact, an over-garment, but there's enough types of robes that people do whatever Because Magic.

** so as someone who studied fashion and art history I have thought a lot about this. Because I don't have the energy to fully talk about my theories, the fact is that you have several cultures existent in our present time that still regularly use robes as one of their basic foundations for clothing style, and as England has ‘borrowed' significantly from these cultures because of colonisation I think its believable to look at how Arabic nations and Indian textile traditions have been modernised and adapted for the modern world. The western hippie trend also took kaftans and made them into more dress-like and less modest styles too.

but as others have said, there are some really interesting clues in the books that tell a very interesting story about how this culture that has been split off into an entirely seperate culture since Arthurian times; but intermingles with the muggle world know limited ways have developed their own costume and dress

I'm currently writing a big scene in one of my stories that talks about this, as it's a really fun thing to trunk about.

It is definitely one of the reasons I find the movies completely frustrating though. The fantastic beasts movies do slightly better, but I never finished the second one so...

but one of the most frustrating things for me, like I just...why is Grimmauld place, the home of xenophobic and change-resistant Black family fitted with gaslights? (The answer is they're creepy, that's the only thing I can think of for their inclusion)

** I would say only the most traditionalist ones such as malfoys and other death eaters would wear robes only and even then there would be more than jusy simple pullover robes. Other wizards and witches would most likely wear more modern clothing or at least modernised forms of their traditional clothes.
