Hi,

I've run out of topics to write HP fanfics about. Any requests? I'd write them all! (hopefully). You can request ships, life from another character's point of view, drabbles, oone shots, long fics, time-travel, AUs, anything! Please comment your requests down below!


** Harry and co. never really had all those life threatening adventures. Instead they are a reclusive and shy bunch who occupy their free time at Hogwarts playing a tabletop rpg campaign. I think this would have potential for subverting many tropes in humorous ways. For instance, Harry took a flaw for his character, ‚ÄúNeglected Orphan‚Äù so that he could take the ‚ÄúChosen One‚Äù feat. 11 year olds getting past the teachers defenses guarding the Philosopher's Stone? Harry and co. were surprised themselves, they hadn't known it was possible to roll so many natural 20s.

** There are a lot of fics where Harry is filthy rich and the lord of like nine different houses but that is just limiting it. I have never seen one to the ultimate extreme. A piss take that I thought about righting that does just this.

--------------

Lord of Just About Everywhere

The Magicus' are an ancient family dating back to the beginning of time. six thousand years ago they were cursed to forever have only one son and the family almost came to its knees if not for the cunning plan of the heir. He swore to bring back power by having the one son wed the heiress of other houses and fuse them into the Magicus' line. They changed their name thrice to keep building their power in secret, first after the accidental creation of Lycanthropy, secondly after Merlin Emrys wed the princess of Camelot and the kingdom passed to the Ministry of Magic, the name shifted to Peverell around two thousand years ago. A third time almost a thousand years ago the name changed to Potter when the Peverell name rose to so much fame over the construction of three objects between grandfather, father and son. A thousand years later with the marriage of James Potter and Lily Evans, first magical daughter of the squibed line of Flamell. The famous immortals in fact being the cousin who was appointed proxy until the line resurfaced. With the marriage the Magicus' line had gained almost every lord or kingship over every country in the magical world and a decent amount of mundane ones two.

Harry Potter was born with a destiny six thousand years in the making. To be the lord of just about everywhere when he came of age. Of course this came early upon winning the tri wizard tournament and permanently being placed in the books as an adult.

--------------

You can do what you want with ships, give him a wife for all the hundreds of houses cause why not, cure the curse and produce an heir for every line with a different wife. Forever stay a bachelor that lives in a castle full of veela, a single wife and son to be the next lord of just about everywhere.

** Harmony story set in modern days. They could be sorted in different houses; Harry in Slytherin and Hermione in Ravenclaw.

No canon golden trio. No Weasley bashing but they should be completely irrelevant to the plot; they don't have to be involved in everything. No alliance or friendship with the Death-Eater Youth and "moderate" Pure-Blood bigots. Harry wouldn't start randomly befriending students from different houses; including the famous Twins.

No fanon abused, meek and OP Harry.

Harry and Hermione's friendship could start during 3rd or 4th year when they "meet" and spend more time in the library. Their secret friendship and/or romance would eventually comes public when Harry shows at the Yule Ball with Hermione as his date. No prior relationship/dating for them with different characters before they become a couple. They would be each other's first and last romantic partner. They would experience everything between themselves.

You could make the Horcrux in Harry's scar acts more as magical boost and made it interact with him like in "my friend Tom". Stick to canon when it comes to destroy it.

Harry could become a ward of Hogwarts after Voldemort attacked his family. Thus, he could be raised and train by Dumbledore.

Let Dumbledore deal with Prime Voldemort into an epic duel. Meanwhile, Harry would face off with a resurrected version of young Tom Riddle after he failed to stop him in the Chamber of Secrets. The final duel would be with an antagonist he could magically match; Prime Voldemort is out of reach. Make use lethal offensive spells. A duel that ends with a priori incantatem (Expalliarmus vs Avada Kedavra) would be boring.

Fawkes could easily become Harry's familiar if he was raised by Dumbledore.

I don't know about Quidditch. It would be a change if he didn't play it.

No Lordship and super friend goblins trope.

** How about a criminal styled fanfic.

So you can ahve your main character, preferably Harry or Ron. Have them be poor, struggling to provide.

And do a Breaking Bad on them, have a youngster give them a way into the magical underworld and spring it from there.

2) have Harry do street magic kind of like Now You See me.

3) a normal fic, no bullshit just Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Ginny and Luna and do a Friends styled fic that last through Hogwarts.

** So I had an idea and maybe I'll write it myself someday but right now I'm still focusing on my current fic so you are welcome to write it. It's basically an 8th year fic. After the war, Draco has returned to Hogwarts for an eight year. He visits the 3 broomsticks often (he's apologized to Mdme Rosmerta) and he is mostly sitting alone, because who wants to sit with a former Death Eater. (Sometimes he sits with Marcus Flint who works in Hogsmeade.) Anyway. He watches and soon realizes that the former Gryffindor Quidditch team meets in the 3 broomsticks once a week. One day when he isn't paying attention, George Weasley just sits down on his table. George was dragged to the meeting by Ron and he just wants to escape all the people who are treating him like he could break if they only mention something that reminds him of Fred/the pitying glances etc. This becomes a regular occurence. Draco and George don't talk much at first but after some time they talk about their former Quidditch captains (Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint) who fight every time they meet in the pub. After deciding that it can only be sexual tension, Draco and George decide to get their former captains into a relationship. An unlikely friendship develops.

** How about a story with Ginny and Bellatrix talking about tom riddle. Both of these women were affected by him. I find Bellatrix to be the dark reflection of Ginny. The only reason Ginny didn't become a death eater is that Tom tried to kill her in year two; if he wanted to he could have made her into another Bellatrix.

As for a plot it could be set during the Horcrux hunt. Voldemort could remember Ginny and order Bellatrix to turn Ginny to the Death Eaters.

You could also relate Ginny's feelings for Harry to being similar to that of Bellatrix's feelings towards Voldemort. They're both fighting a war for the men they love.

You also can point out the fact that both Ginny and Bellatrix are just doing what's expected of them from their families. Bella is a death Eater cause she's a Black; Ginny is with the order cause of her family. Bella was forced into a loveless marriage because of her family and you can have Bella say that Ginny was manipulated into being love with Harry by her family.

You could even do a dark end with Ginny turning.
