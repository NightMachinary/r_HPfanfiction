I'm finding it increasingly difficult to find powerful and independant harry fics where it diverges off from Canon anytime after 2nd year. I try to avoid him being adopted by snape and dislike hinny and harmione fics. Any suggestions?

***** I've gotten so used to seeing the same plot points in HP fanfiction that I find myself reading 100k words per day easy. Not because I've gotten "better" or "faster" at reading, simply because I can skim over so much of it without missing anything.

I find myself making the same mistake as you sometimes and wonder if the two aren't somehow related. Like I'm skimming over the same requests over and over because my brain tells me it's not important and then I end up missing tiny differences which would render my normal recommendations useless.

** I'd say linkffn(For Love of Magic) is close, Harry is a bit too evil to be 'truly gray'.

The rest is all there though:

Harry starts above average but improves himself constantly and ends very powerful.

Harry is entirely independent to the point of basically being a faction unto himself.

He isn't adopted by nor does he like snape.

He doesn't get with or even like Ginny or Hermoine.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** linkffn(11446957) A Cadmean Victory. Harry is overly angsty at first, but imo the fic gets better once he and Fleur finally get together.

linkao3(863648) Sarcasm and Slytherin. Probably won't like it if you hate WBWL fics and associated tropes (bashing of James/Dumbledore), but it does have a truly grey Harry Potter, as in neutral between Dumbledore and (a non pureblood-supremacist) Voldemort.

Even that's a stretch, to be honest. I'm not going to say that atheism is new, or anything, but it certainly didn't become quite so normal until much later than the early 90s.

I was raised Christian, so perhaps this is a bit of confirmation theory in action, but I don't recall ever hearing anyone talk about atheism in the 90s.

******* It's not as if anyone talks about Atheism here in Western Europe - it's just that we don't give a damn about Religion, apart from a tiny minority.

Here are some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Attendance][statistics]].

#+begin_quote
  "Society in the United Kingdom is markedly more secular than it was in the past and the number of churchgoers fell over the second half of the 20th century.[64] The Ipsos MORI poll in 2003 reported that 18% were "a practising member of an organised religion".[59] The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Some 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year.[24][65] The Tearfund Survey also found that two-thirds of UK adults (66%) or 32.2 million people had no connection with the Church at present (nor with another religion). These people were evenly divided between those who have been in the past but have since left (16 million) and those who have never been in their lives (16.2 million)."
#+end_quote

It's not a recent development, [[http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html][according to this site:]]

#+begin_quote
  Religion in Britain has suffered an immense general decline since the 1950s. Between 1979 and 2005, half of all Christians stopped going to church on a Sunday. Four in five britons want religion to be private, not public, and have no place in politics5. All indicators show a continued secularisation of British society in line with other European countries such as France.

**** Everytime I see this fic I also see it get a lot of pushback for it. There was a lot of anti-religion in the early chapters. There was a lot of ubder age sex in the early chapters. Student/teacher, student/student, the author held nothing in reserve. If you missed these incredibly obvious flags, you have only yourself to blame. Harry is an absolute cunt in this story and makes no efforts to change that behavior. He lets Voldemort run free because he has research to do. He brushes off Dumbledore because he doesn't respect him. He lets Sirious die in a egyption tomb because it was an easy way out. He uses a blood curse on a Mosque to fascilitate anti muslim sentiment in europe, to stop immigration-friendly policies from being implemented. He goes to a live TV interview and claims to be able to accomplish all the miracles that Jesus did.

I think that people took it entirely too seriously, especially for what it is. Worse, people got invested in it and felt betrayed when they realised the lack of depth, and distinct anti-religious tones weren't just there to spice up the story and make Harry 'original'.

It's not any sort of commentary, or great work of art. It's a semi-self insert powerwank, with quality grammar and a consistent update schedule. The dude who writes it is a self-confessed shutin who claims to not be in contact with regular people, by choice.

If you treat the story as anything else, you will be dissapointed. Very dissapointed. Despite all these very obvious faults, it is well written, well thought out, and absolutely hilarious. Everytime the Harry spouts off about the stupidity of religion, and by extension the people who practice it, I laugh. It's hilarious.

At one point, Harry puts a curse on a Mosque in order to drive out Muslim immigrants in Europe. He uses his own blood to do it. The sheer gall of writing this situation displays just how hilariously hateful Harry is. In my opinion, it's on the level of my immortal, but with actual grammar.

If anyone bothered, the Author made a sequel where this same Harry goes to the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Harry procedes to beat the crap out of the new Gods, and study the heck out of the Old Gods. There is no respect, just arrogance and the power to back it up.

Granted, the under age sex was also just as over the top, but that's to be expected, it's not like the author held back on that part either.
