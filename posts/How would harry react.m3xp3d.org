So we get a lot of crossover fics in fanfiction. Let's ponder harry potter, who has fought voldemort, getting himself thrown into the last harry dresden books.

Harry lands in chicago during the Ethniu seige. He sees white court vampires, he sees the winter knight (harry dresden) in action, he sees mab, queen of the winter court of fairies in battle with the formor, he sees the world's last actual titan walking the earth and sees her destroying the city with the eye of balor. How does harry react when all he's ever gone up against was some dementors and a dark wizard?

How would harry react seeing a fallen angel like diedre in action? Or marva of the black court?

I don't plan on writing a fic like this, but these things are fun to think about lol


** I think there'd be a fair amount of stunned silence on both sides.

HP magic is in many ways much more powerful that Dresden magic. Transfiguration can create and destroy matter, something which breaks the Dresden rules of magic, and even changing the form of something in the Dresden universe is incredibly complex magic. A lot of the more conceptual charms like the Fidelius are just not possible in the physics-based, mechanistic magic of the Dresden universe. And of course, Harry Potter can cast magic continuously for hours on end without breaking a sweat, whereas Dresden casts 3 spells and he's already talking about how tired he is.

On the flip side, the range of Dresden magic is far greater than HP magic, and the ability to cast magic on people half-way around the world through a sympathetic link is not something we see in HP magic. And on top of that, you have the beings like Mab, whose power can affect the whole Earth e.g. through affecting the seasons.

In many ways, it's a matter of breadth vs depth.

The power of Dresdenverse magic is very broad - that is, it has a large scale, able to affect things over large areas and long distances. But it must fight against the natural forces of the universe to do so, and is a constant strain on the caster.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter wizards are only really able to affect their immediate surroundings (with some notable exceptions). But within their immediate surroundings, an HP wizard has greater depth of power than a Dresdenverse being. A competent HP wizard is basically a very localised omnipotent god. HP magic does not struggle against the natural laws of the universe, but completely breaks those rules. It's basically a set of cheat codes. The constraints on magic are those dictated by magical law, not natural law.

When it comes to wizard vs. wizard action, HP magic operates on the "the problem is, the other side has magic too" principle, i.e. that the real problem for wizards is not overcoming natural forces, but overcoming opposing magic. Wizard on wizard conflict within the HP system is the question of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. But I'm not sure that Dresden magic counts as "opposing magic" for this purpose, because Dresden magic is ultimately just energy, working within the same system of natural law as physics. It's neither an unstoppable force nor an immovable object, because Dresden magic cannot break the laws of the universe like HP magic can. So my view is that HP magic would be able to "cheat code" Dresden magic in the same way it cheat codes physics.

I briefly entertained the idea of an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10781800/4/False-Starts][HP/Dresden crossover]] that was Voldemort-centric. I had Mab encounter Voldemort and be immediately fascinated with him, because to her perception his HP magic seemed like the power of the White God, only on a smaller scale - the power of creation itself, able to make something from nothing.

*** Also, while I love both universes very much, I gotta admit I really like how magic works in dresden verse a lot more. Dresden verse magic behaves in a way my scientific mind believes it would if magic /was real/

*** Oh I do not disagree with any of your points. My post was more asking about how he would mentally respond lol.

Like wtf would go through Harry's head watching Ethniu destroy an entire city with the eye of balor, especially if he actually knew who Ethniu was/is.

Or what would go through his mind seeing how the denarians transform their hosts, with diedre being the example

**** Well, the thing with Harry's character, canonically speaking, is that he's not too impressed with grand titles, long histories, etc. He's a rather practical person whose focus is on moral action.

So I suspect he would take a rather "Sam Vimes" approach of "I don't care how old you are, ma'am, property damage is against the law so I'm going to have to arrest you. What's that? You're a god? Well, I don't know about that, ma'am, but to my knowledge there's no exception in the law for gods, so I'm afraid you're going to have to come with me."

It's also fun to imagine how a more prejudiced HP wizard might approach the situation. Someone like Umbridge only more magically powerful.

"Ethniu, is it? Well, as a being of near-human intelligence, you will be subject to the Regulation on..."

I think probably the best character for /fascination/ with the situation would be Hermione. She's probably the character who would be most intellectually engaged with the idea of ancient gods, angels and demons, wanting to find out more about their history, nature, etc.

***** See I think in some ways you are right, but I also feel in some ways your making the characters seem too nonchalant about it. Like in my mind, I think any of the HP verse characters would shit a brick seeing the eye of balor go off from a 15ft tall literally skin-with-bronze "giant" as it destroys entire city blocks in one go.

I guess while I can see the characters responding how you said they would, I feel like those would be more crack fic responses than realistic responses

I don't think this is really that different from a giant trashing an entire town in HBP, with an effect equivalent to a powerful hurricane. To which Fudge's response was:

#+begin_quote
  “The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can't find the giant --- it's been a disaster.”
#+end_quote

Nor is it really all that different to Pettigrew blowing up a street, which again elicited a somewhat routine Ministry response of "show up and cover up".

The HP world is pretty innately wacky, with its Theme Hospital-esque magical injuries and casual, officious approach to mass destruction.

***** I also think if one where to write a hp/dresden crossover, harry would have to go to dresden verse, because I don't think dresden would do well in hp verse. I say this because you would have to make whoever crossed over be beholden to that universes laws of magic. If you didn't, both chars would be OP in the others respective universe. Dresden would me a fucking god in hp verse with his insane range of magic, and harry would be flat out rediculous in dresden verse being able to just cast endlessly as well as just flat out being able to avada anyone he wanted if he wanted

I actually think hermione would be the best to cross over in that regard. She's very intelligent and would be able to adapt to the new laws that are beholden to magic, and she would eat up all the new ways to apply magic much faster than harry due to her rabid thirst for knowledge. Plus I can't lie, it would be cute as hell to see her all giddy when she gets to learn something new every 10 seconds. And seeing her come face to face with fallen angles, fairies and gods such as odin would be a treat to see if written well

Edit: also, hermiones personality would mesh in some ways a lot more with dresden than harry, as dresden is quite academically inclined compared to harry

No, your post made sense. The only thing that doesn't make sense is that people read things like Awaken Sleeper, and Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain, and actually enjoy them without a doubt tickling at the back of their minds. I suspect that they have not actually read the Dresden Files.

*** Actually, no. HP magic is not more "powerful" than DF magic. The magic of HPverse is improbable and impossible, and contains limitations which make no sense. DF magic is powerful, but bound and constrained by rules. And middle-to-upper crust of HP wizards could not do the more complex things at all.

Apparition during a fight? Pshaw. Apparition was only used to run away, and by experienced Aurors no less. And that's why Death Eaters used Anti-Apparition wards.

Fiendfyre? It does not depend upon the power of the caster and is controlled by something that we do not know. Basically, it is a plot-device. It consumes all magical objects and is sentient, but we do not know about its limitations. Any high-power Wizard in Dresdenverse could replicate it with effort.

We have seen Transfiguration work on only magically summoned /energies./ It will not work on the fire which is normally used by Wardens, as it is only slightly different than normal fire. Transfiguration does not work upon, say the forces of gravity, and will never work upon a blob of liquid fire summoned directly at the position where your head should be (I'm looking at you, Hannah Ascher).

We do not know about how the Hidden Halls of Edinburgh are hidden. It might have a mechanism similar to that of the Fidelius charm. And, creating a Ward to ward off hundreds of Red Court Vampires and Outsiders (which are literally Lovecraftian horrors) at just a moment's notice, is a feat which Dumbledore, Voldemort, or Grindelwald, even with the help of the Deathstick can scarcely hope to replicate.

Any person who caused the Krakatoa explosion, or the Tunguska event, I'm going to consider to be more powerful than a person who couldn't even take over a school of teenagers, even with all of Magical Britain's resources at hand.

** Honestly, I'm not sure whether the Battle Grounds would be the best place to have Potter drop into the Dresden-verse.

There's a lot of interesting ideas, though--the Knights of the Cross for example. Michael would be disgusted with Fudge.

And I'd pay through the nose to see Mad-Eye Moody interact with the Blackstaff.

** What'd happen if Harry "I won't stun a person cos then he might die" Potter got dropped in the middle of that shitshow? He'd likely get absolutely wrecked very, very quickly. It's just a bad spot to throw him into, honestly. Maybe if he was around in that world a bit more and time to adapt to it, etc, he'd manage to do something.

The two versees don't really interact well, either. You can't have them existing side-by-side, which means you'll need to grab HP and throw him into DF, or vice versa. Then the difference in magic systems might be fun, but since there are so few actual DF stories with... you know, a story, it might be better to just write that. xD

While I agree with your main body, this quote I just can't agree with. I have read all 16 or 17 dresden books, multiple times, each one absolutely has a story. The mistake your making is that dresden files as a while is one giant story. While potter books have more individual story identity, dresden files are all smaller story arcs that all tie into one giant story arc. Every single book in dresden files so far is leading to the BAT (big armageddon trilogy), where as potter stories are more individualistic. Another thing to point out is the dresden books feed off the previous book in the series a lot more than the potter books do. The potter books, as a whole have minimal impact on the next book on the series, where as the dresden files books are extremely dependant on the events of previous books. When you look at it this way, you see that dresden files is really a singular story split thus far into 17 volumes with 6 more on the way if we include the BAT.
