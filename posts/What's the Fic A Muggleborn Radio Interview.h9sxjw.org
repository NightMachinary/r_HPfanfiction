:END:
There was a very good, and very powerful, fanfiction that was based on a real-life radio interview series.

There were six or seven Muggleborns and it followed all seven years plus of Hogwarts.

Does anyone recognize this?


** Something like linkao3(5147618).

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

** That sounds sort of like linkffn(4798208), except it's not all 7 years, they just talk about the war.

  Ten years after the defeat of Voldemort, Lee Jordan asks what life was like during the Death-Eaters' reign for the Muggleborn son of a prominent Tory family, and what he learned as a member of the commission which investigated how they came to power.
