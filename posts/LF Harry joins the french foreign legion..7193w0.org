Title. Can be another army or military group. Bonus if Hermione or any Weasley find him.


** This one shot from Rorshach's Blot's Odd Ideas covers it. Just wish there were more of it. Chapter 99 "March or Die" is the title. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/99/Odd-Ideas]])

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): There are some religious undertones in a couple chapters, but considering canon characters were saying "God" more than than "Merlin" in the Books, I no longer think this is really an issue. Overall speaking, this is a very good story that meets your requirements.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.
