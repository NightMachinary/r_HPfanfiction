:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello for the last few days I have been searching for a fic I read a while ago. In it James did some sort of ritual on Harry before Voldemort fall that gave Harry the certain dragonic powers. He is immune to cold, has extremely strong physical skin, and can cast minor wand less magic.

When he first meets hagrid on the tiny island it's not actually in the hut with the dursleys but aways away where he is awoken from sleeping under a rowboat. He tells hagrid how he swam there but is somehow immune to cold. He demonstrates different types of wand less magic to hagrid like "cut" and "break"

When they are in London Harry gets hot peppers to put on the cake hagrid brought him. He refuses to get any sort of a wand with a dragon based core because it feels like holding a corpse.

When he went to the pet shop he found some sort of pixie or fairy thing being harrased by others because it was actually some sort of other breed that was royalty to the other? Something like that. I sort of remember that he could here it speaking because of his draconic powers? I think the creature was under some sort of disguise but had forgotten how to reverse it. Not super sure there.

I'm pretty sure that at some point hagrid warns Dumbledore that he best control Snape because Harry had some three chance system before he hurts them or something like that.

I'm pretty sure all of that was from the same fic. Thanks to anyone who might know what fic this is.


** Yup. All of it is from the same fic.

  James and Sirius decide just trusting Dumbledore has its own flaws, so they decide to give Harry an edge up on the matter. The Hogwarts motto has never been more accurate. Parings to be determined. Rating may go up

*** Eh, felt like a OC with Harry's name, and the shade of Manipulative!Dumbledore was wince-worthy, but that was goddamn hilarious overall.

**** Harry is definitely wildly OOC, but it is at least justified in the story. And as a comedy story that is actually funny, I give it a pretty big pass to do what it wants to canon.

**** Manipulative!Dumbledore ...

Where? I'm actually confused and curious, Sounded like canon Dumbledore but more funny and more realistic.

***** Manipulative!Dumbledore is a trope all in its own. Thing is, a truly manipulative Dumbledore would be a well-written chess-master that would give no signs whatsoever.

There would be no "uncovering his evil deeds", no confrontations and the like: at best, his actions in an overarching narrative would be so subtly alluded to that it would take a group of readers dissecting the story itself to piece things together and theorize.

That would be a truly manipulative chessmaster.

Instead, we have him acting like Dick Dastardly with Snape as his Muttley.

Yeah.
