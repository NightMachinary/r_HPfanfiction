:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I hope this is allowed and someone can help. I'm currently reading Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie (I'm on chapter 64 and needed to take a break to read something lighter) and I'm really enjoying it. I'd been putting it off because I'd heard despite going back, she can't change anything and I don't usually like that kind of time travel fic.

That reminded me another time travel fic that I vaguely remember reading. I don't remember much of it except the final chapter (possibly a prologue) where an older Hermione meets Harry (who's at Hogwarts) and everyone again after saving James and Lily. She and someone (possibly Dumbledore or Remus) have a conversation about her younger self and how she'll have to go back at some point to make sure this timeline stays the same.

I'm sorry this is super vague. I've gone through my favourited stories on ff.net and I have a couple that fit the bill but it was a multi chapter story and there are a couple to read through (I read in order of word count from smallest to largest). I figured if this rang any bells for someone, it could help narrow my search.

If anything it could be some come recs.

Thank you in advance!

This is true. Right when Dumbledore made her take that vow, I dropped the fic. What's the point of time travel into the relatively "recent" past when you can't change anything?

*** Why, it's so Hermione can be banged by Sirius/James/Remus/Tom/Lucius/Severus or whoever else the author wishes they could fuck with less squeak about the age factor.
