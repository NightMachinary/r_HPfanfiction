***** I checked on ff2ebook and there is a copy on their server if anyone wants to download it in ebook formats. +Not entirely sure it's updated to the newest version though.+ It's got the same word count so it's good. [[http://ff2ebook.com/download.php?source=ffnet&id=12311183&filetype=mobi][Mobi]] and [[http://ff2ebook.com/download.php?source=ffnet&id=12311183&filetype=epub][ePub]]
