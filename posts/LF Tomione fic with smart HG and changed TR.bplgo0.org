Well-written long fic that started with Hermione making a plan and going back in time. She meets Tom who is in school, and is gathering his Death Eaters. He realizes she is a time traveler and she gives him suggestions that shape a different future. They both are very cunning and she makes short and long term plans that he is impressed by. They are coupled and have a break up, and couple again. He is appalled at what he becomes in the future, and wants to be smarter about overthrowing the wizarding world. In the end she rules by his side as Muggleborn.


** Isn't this Persephone?\\

  Better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path. Better still to be the consort of Hades than a part of his collection of souls. Ten years after Voldemort has won the war, Hermione reaches a breaking point and shreds the flow of time to change her future. If she can't change the world, she will change her place in it. - Extremely dark Tomione/Volmione. Warnings inside.

#+begin_quote
  An attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands Hermione in 1944. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
