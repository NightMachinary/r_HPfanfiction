:END:
Hey all,

I'm looking for an old fic where Harry gets thrown into an alternate world where his parents survived. Everything is not as it seems though. Lily is having an affair with Narcissa and James is sleeping with someone from work. It treats the whole thing fairly adultly it was never completed and I think it was filed under Harry and Tracey, but I can't seem to find it.


** Sounds like Wand Of Uru by Joe Hundredaire. He tends to rage quit it ever so often, only to bring the story back under a different writer's name.

Here is the latest version: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13090859/1/Wand-of-Uru]]

It starts out as a Disaffected Harry story, then a dimensional transfer Harry story, and then it gets weird.
