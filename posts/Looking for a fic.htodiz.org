:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking for this fic I read quite a long time ago. Harry takes a different set of courses that includes a practical magic course taught by Madam Hooch, an enchanting course taught by Dumbledore and i believe he even takes some healer courses with Pomfrey. I remember that he helps either Crabbe or Goyle, or maybe both, in the enchanting class for a project. He ends up enchanting tombstones to block the killing curse and stores them in a PEZ like dispenser. Thats really all I remember from it.
