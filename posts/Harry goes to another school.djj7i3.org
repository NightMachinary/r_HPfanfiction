Could I have a fic where he thinks Hogwarts isn't up to standards so he goes to Durmstrang or Beauxbatons or even a non canon creature school? Slash/non slash doesn't matter. Thank you


** "Another chance at life" by Miranda Flairgold probably fits

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.
