He doesn't necessarily HAVE to be the focus of the fic, but just one where he isn't either useless, secondChances!dumbledore or plain old GreaterGood!Dumbledore. One where the Order is actually useful and he engages the war personaly, and with Harry's help, if possible. As long it isn't slash, i don't mind anything else. Also, Harry has to be somewhat of an ally to Dumbledore.


** The issue with Dumbledore is that he is unwilling to use his powers. He could have personally exterminated the Death Eaters in 1981 but he chose not to because... Of reasons.

Many Deaths during Voldemort's second life could have been completely avoided if anyone with a Dark Mark would have been summary executed. Dumbledore was sure that Voldemort would return and that Azkaban was not safe. He knew that they would become a problem again, but those outstanding examples of humanity deserve a second chance +at rape, murder and terrorism+

No one would have believed the Imperius excuse if the Great Albus Dumbledore publicly called bullshit on that.

**** It's also worthwhile to point out that discovering multiple death eaters within the Ministry of Magic would cause the people to become increasingly paranoid and would also decrease their morales since if even the government couldn't find out that there were spies in their very own institution, then what chance do they have?

** In many of my stories, he's a competent and very powerful wizard who would rather kill the guilty than risk the innocent, even though he dislikes killing people - he'd rather shoulder that burden himself than let others suffer. And he generally gets to show why he's the only wizard Voldemort ever feared - and does want the best for Harry. Even though he's not perfect.

He's a central character in "Patron", "Uncle Quentin's Spy", "Divided and Entwined" and "The Dark Lord Never Died".

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** Interesting, i've heard a lot about "The Dark Lord Never Died" but haven't felt the "urge" to read it. I'd say that with the suggestion from the author him/herself, it would give me the incentive to do so. Thanks for the suggestions, I'll add them to my to-read list.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.

** Kind of like how a key item to grant immortality, the item most desired by a Dark Lord who banned himself 'Flight from Death' and made Hrcruxes to ensure it, is used to lure the very said Dark Lord in the first year the most important soldier was back in the most important domain of Dumbledore?

I would fear a wizard who would gladly raise a 'Sacrificial Lamb', as Snape pointed out, and sic that lamb at Darkest Lord, without training him in the hopes that lamb would die, it had to.

Specially if that wizard had the strongest wamd, death's cloak. Not to mention the political power along with fame.

Behind the scene Dumbledore kind of thing is available in books.
