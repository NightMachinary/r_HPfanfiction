I know I am probably too late to reply but I really love this story so I thought I would add my two cents. If you are solely looking for time travel fiction in the HP fandom they are quite easy to find and I am sure there are numerous sites with countless recs. I doubt thought you will come across one written in the same manner. So for these recommendations I am singling out aspects I liked in this fan fiction, and that I have found done well in other fan fictions.

World In Pieces by lomonaaeren. AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE. One of the things I very much liked about Timely Errors was the fact that harry was to some extent isolated, he was away from his friends and hiding a secret and emotionally compromised from seeing he family again. This caused him to become stressed and there to be an underlying bitterness in some of his interactions but he persevered throughout. In World In Pieces Harry is even more isolated and cannot completely trust his family and friends counterparts especially when he discovers he is not the first Harry Potter to be brought to this world. In this story harry is very much focused on survival with the end goal of getting Home above all else.

C'est La Vie by cywscross\\
The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there. WIP Harry in Timely Errors is charismatic, Powerful and not afraid to stand up to bullies but is also troubled by his past experiences with Voldemort that is very much evident in C'est La Vie.

Face Death in the Hope by LullabyKnell Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”

“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.WIP Finally I have a suggestion with time travel, Harry Potter saves Regulus form death in the inferi cave and hopes to track down his family while avoiding Dumbledore. the awkward relationship between the marauders and Harry is present as is Harry's PTSD. if you decide to read this look forward to some funny character reactions to Harry's information.

Rebuilt By Terrific Lunacy [AU!] After society as we know it collapsed, humanity struggled for survival. Slowly a new society begins to establish. Groups led by lords battle for territory. Young Harry Potter has no interest in joining local politics, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, can Harry remain neutral? (LV/HP, post-apocalyptic, Inventor!Harry) WIP If you don't mind slash this story does the devil may care attitude Harry has in Timely Errors very well.

Odd Ideas By Rorschach's Blot Odd little one shots that may or may not be turned into their own stories. A lot of these are very funny but it has the HP characters in every flavour of situation including time travel.

The Sniper By DobbyElfLord OneShot: Harry is expelled after the hearing in Courtroom 10. His wand snapped, an angry Harry choses his own path forward. First person story focusing on Harry's effort to find his own place. and The Sniper II: Babylonian Nights By DobbyElfLord Sequel to Sniper; Five years after killing Voldemort, Harry is a SAS lieutenant assigned to the invasion of Iraq. When the Muggle war wakes something best left forgotten, Harry is pulled back into the Wizarding world. Can't they clean up their own mess? Something great about Timely Errors was that it had great fight scenes with hand to hand combat playing a part, in The Sniper different fighting methods are combined and Harry is not paying by the Wizarding worlds rules.

Unsealed by esama After fifty years, the trial records of a special prisoner are unsealed and the details and motives of the most well known magical murder are revealed. complete. If you like the clever time travel dynamic this story has quite a good one.

I hope these have been useful.
