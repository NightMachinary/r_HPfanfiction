Long title, but basically that. I'm reading a fic right now that has Neko and Kitsune creature inheritance, both of which are so awkwardly out of place in the hpverse that they almost always get a snot out of me. I'm only still reading this fic because the rest of it is so well written.

So I'm just wondering, what are some troupes/cliches that always seem awkward to you? They are "can be a deal breaker, but not always" sorta thing.


** [Harry is moderately polite with the goblins at Gringotts]

[Every Goblin physically recoils, staring in awe at the young child who was so gracious as to say 'please' and 'thank you.' One by one, they all bow down before him, tears of affection brimming in their eyes. Harry is taken directly to the Head Goblin who swears fealty to the fucking eleven year old boy in the coming wizarding war.]

"Oh, by the way Harry --- lemme get a drop of your blood. Damn son, you're actually the heir to five noble families. Here's a dope sword that we have. You can have it because reasons."

"YEA, VERILY. MANY THANKS BLOODCLAW. MAY YOUR ENEMIES SOMETHING AND YOUR GOLD WHATEVER."

"Haha. Yes, Harry Potter. I think we goblins can expect many great things from you. I can also tell that one day you'll probably be, like, totally super duper handsome and have a HUGE penis."

I have seen INCREDIBLE stories that have godawful Diagon Alley scenes. At this point I preemptively choose to skim them because I know they'll more than likely give me a migraine. I don't know WHAT it is, but there's something about that goddamned bank that brings out the 14 y/o DeviantArt poster in every writer, ever.

*** "Oh golly gee mister! I can't believe you gave me this ancient, incredibly powerful staff that was once wielded by Merlin himself!" Harry cheered, staring in awe at the gnarled, yet imposing branch of alder and birch, a spinning cerulean gemstone floating absently above twisted roots at the peak of the weapon.

"Ain't shit Harry, don't you worry yourself," Skullfuck replied, calmly puffing away on a finely rolled bit of Longbottom leaf. "It's the least I can do. I mean, you /did/ say 'please' and 'thank you' earlier. That's never happened in the history of Goblin-kind."

"Shame that," Harry replied.

****** *Lebensborn*

Lebensborn e.V. (literally: "Fount of Life") was an SS-initiated, state-supported, registered association in Nazi Germany with the goal of raising the birth rate of "Aryan" children of persons classified as "racially pure and healthy" based on Nazi racial hygiene and health ideology. Lebensborn provided welfare to its mostly unmarried mothers, encouraged anonymous births by unmarried women at their maternity homes, and mediated adoption of these children by likewise "racially pure and healthy" parents, particularly SS members and their families. The Cross of Honour of the German Mother was given to the women who bore the most Aryan children. Abortion was legalised by the Nazis for disabled children.

** Ron is not my favourite character and a lot of fics I read don't actually involve him but when writers devolve him into some dumbass dude with no capacity for sensitivity or emotional common sense, it doesn't mix well with me.

Like I think some people take "emotional range of a tea spoon" a little too literal, especially for older Ron. Like yeah, he may not instantly click on but when a situation is explained or has been going on for some time, surely he will catch on. And he can have something insightful to say! I've not met a single friend in my life who's not had some half decent advice to give at some point. Like give him some redemption when he finally turns around.

This can also apply to oblivious Harry I would imagine but I've personally yet to come across that, not been reading HP fanfic for too long.

** Sometimes, when people write the fics and go take the Potter-Black route. Or sometimes (even in good fics) the Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin one.

Seriously, people, do you fuckers have no idea how inheritances and succession work? If Sirius wills Harry his entire estate, that doesn't make Harry a P-B, he just gets the entire estate (liquid assets and otherwise). He doesn't get a fucking hyphenated name. Hepzibah Smith is of the line of Hufflepuff, but she doesn't have a damn hyphenated name.

If these writers are going the whole Lordship route, they don't understand that a Lord is usually a lord of a holding. For example, a count of a county, or a duke of a duchy. So, a Lord Black would be a duke or count of a holding. And if Harry was to get everything from Lord Black (like conquest or whatever the hell ff writers write) he'd get the holdings, not the name. Harry would be lord of Blackmoor (which seems to be the holding most commonly used as far as I can tell) as Lord Potter. Not as fucking Lord Potter-Black-Merlin-LeFay of whatever. The name is next to worthless.

Then there's the Light, Grey and Dark faction shit which is more or less a neon sign that the author has no idea about politics at all.

** I wouldn't say I roll my eyes. I don't think less of anyone for taste.

But I'm not fond of rivals/enemies to lovers. I don't think I would hate it so much if it wasn't so dominant in nearly every fandom. It's almost always the top ship. In HP's case, it's usually Harry/Draco, but I've seen some Hermione pairings that fit the bill.

I don't fault anyone for enjoying it, but I also don't see why it's more compelling than friends-to-lovers. I wish there was more variety.

So, I'll read those fics, but only if they're very well-written or scratch a particular itch in terms of content.

Also, I skip soulmate fics because I have trouble feeling invested in fated romance. I prefer a more organic, purposeful approach.
