And what is your record?

I have ten open at the moment, and that is my record. [[http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llz8u9aZXK1qabn2bo1_500.gif][Pathetic, I know]].


** None. I use an Excel sheet to keep track of all stories I've read, and those I plan to read in the future. I sort it by high, medium, and low priority. According to the sheet, I still have 102 fics to read, and I've been reading nonstop for years until very recently.

** Six, which isn't a lot by any means (if I'm not careful it could easy be as many as 20) but still too damn much (I hate clutter). I'll have downloaded/saved those fics by the end of the day so that should clear it up. Honestly, Google Chrome's "pin tab" feature is both a blessing and a curse.

I also have four tabs open for different fic rec pages. It's bugging me but I don't want to close any of them right now.

** I usually have at most one open. If it's something that's going on my reading list, I've got a bookmark folder for that. If it's getting downloaded, I've got a folder for that. One thing at a time!

I'm also usually mobile, so that's probably a big part of it.

** Two. First is C2 at ffnet that I'm prowling for new reads, second is fic that's waiting to be put in Calibre.

I used to keep fics pinned/grouped in browser before judging them download-worthy, now I simply download any fic with description that even remotely arouses my interest.

Using Calibre library to keep track of what I've read/judged as waste of time was fine for a while, but then it grew too big and took forever to load up. I've settled on deleting whole fanfic library after every 500 fics.
