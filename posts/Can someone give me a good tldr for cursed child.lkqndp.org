I've heard enough bad things about it that I really don't want to read it and I can't easily read theatre scripts. At the same time, I know I'll be encountering more fanfics set in that time period and I want to be able to read them and know what's going on.


** Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy use a special Time Turner to go back decades, trying to make the war turn out better (saving Cedric) but instead they create a succession of really bleak outcomes (eg Cedric becomes a Death Eater and Voldemort wins), which turn out to have been orchestrated by Voldemort's secret daughter Delphi. Eventually they capture Delphi and restore the original timeline with their parents' help.

***** Or, at least, it doesn't /need/ to be canon if you don't want it to be. After all, JKR didn't even write it.

I'm willing to believe that the theatrical production is well done, great special effects, etc. I don't think I would be able to ignore the plot in order to enjoy it, though; that's not how my brain works.

****** I didn't read the script, instead I waited the three years for the production to come to my country. The quality of the stage production is amazing, so amazing in fact that I didn't start to realise all the faults with it until a few weeks later. Would I ever read the script? No. Would I ever see the play again? Maybe. Do I regret seeing it the first time? Not at all.

******** Honestly how sad is it that the production is the thing people praise about the cursed child? I mean everyone loves A very Potter musical for example, no matter that you have to watch it in low quality on YouTube. A good production should be like a bonus or a tool to make a good story even better, and not something to make a play with an awful story kind of watchable. If you write a script and it would be unwatchable with a low budget production then you should rewrite your script not throw a lot of money at it and hope people will look past it because „oh but it looks pretty“.

********* Hmm. Yes and no. There /are/ cases where things are all about the performance rather than the story. Consider "Cats", which has only a small and not very impressive plot, but spectacular choreography. That works.

HP8 can't afford to do the same, though, I think. Partly because it's the successor to a series where the plot does matter, and a weak plot makes it not mesh with the existing work. Partly because the plot isn't just weak, it makes several people wildly out of character in ways that are insulting to them (eg claiming that Cedric would join Voldemort because he got embarrassed).

Perhaps I need to think of CC a bit like Fantastic Beasts, as a story that can be decent so long as you don't assume it's associated with Harry Potter. Harder to do in this case, though, with the Halloween 1981 subplot.

** There is already a pretty decent summary in this thread, but if anyone wanted a longer one with more details or something-

(Warning: Bit longer)

1.Albus Potter is sorted into Slytherin and befriends Scorpius Malfoy (Slytherin). As the years pass, he feels more and more isolated from the rest of his classmates, as he behaves nothing like Harry and is a bit anti-social (He was shit at flying, for example). Harry is also a dick to him, even telling him "I wish you weren't my son," at one point.

2.Cedric's father, Amos, wanted Harry to go back in time and save Cedric, as Harry (Head Auror) had recently acquired a time turner in an auror raid. Harry refused, but Albus had overheard this and decided to save Cedric with Scorpius' help by stealing the time turner. They were accompanied by /'Cedric's cousin'/, Delphi. During this time, Harry's scar begins to hurt.

3.They go back in time to Harry's 4th year, and try to sabotage the tournament, but fail. This caused Ron to somehow marry Parvati Patil instead of Hermione. Realising that they messed up, They go back and humiliate Cedric during the 2nd Task, the consequences of which are- Cedric becoming a death eater, Dolores Umbridge becoming the headmistress, Harry dying during the Battle, Neville dying and Voldy winning the war. Albus does not exisit, so Scorpius, who is somehow very popular, has to try and fix the timeline.

Scorpius escapes and fixes the timeline with the help of (a very OOC) Snape, and Ron and Hermione, who are on the run. They reach their own timeline, and attempt to destroy the time turner, but Delphi stops them, kidnaps them, and brings them to October 31, 1981. The trio + Draco and Ginny look for their kids, realising that 1.Delphi is Voldy's daughter 2.She kidnapped Scorpius and Albus 3.There was a prophecy that would allow Voldemort to come back.

4.Albus writes a message on a blanket, which the trio (who are in the future) see. They travel back in time with /Draco's/ time turner (which he had been hiding all along). Harry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, subdues her, and fixes the timeline.

..................................................

Extra information:

1.James Sirius Potter is a Gryffindor, who inherited the cloak from Harry. Lily Luna (Gryffindor, I think) got some fairy wings or something. Albus got Harry's old blanket (the one he had worn the night his parents died).

2.Scorpius likes Rose Granger-Weasley. They don't get together.

3.Delphi is called 'The Augurey' in the 2nd timeline.

1. The three (Scorpius, Albus, Delphi) steal the time turner from Hermione's (Minister of Magic) office by polyjucing themselves as the trio. When the school year starts, the two of them escape the Hogwarts Express by climbing onto the top, and are confronted with a demonic version of the trolley lady. It is somewhat at this point that the trio realise that Albus is missing.

*** OK just a couple questions because I am very confused and feel like I just read a really bad Fanfiction.

On #3 (first paragraph) they go back in time twice? The first time to sabotage the tournament, return to their time; the second time to humiliate Cedric, return to their time; at which point only Scorpius returns because Albus doesn't exist anymore?

#3 second paragraph is where I really got lost. What does Scorpius escape from? His popularity? I'm assuming the Snape, Ron, and Hermione that are on the run are from the new future where Harry died? When you say They reach their own timeline, who do you mean? Also how does it go from Scorpius with the previous 3 to the trio plus Draco and Ginny if Harry is supposed to be dead?

I don't understand #4 at all lmao.

**** Sorry- I just reread my post and I can see how It's confusing.

#3 First paragraph-

Albus and Scorpius go back in time to make sure that Cedric doesn't die in the third task. In order to do this, they decide to make Cedric fail the 2nd task so that he'll get eliminated and stop competing. They disguise themselves as Dumstrang students and attempt to get Cedric to fail. Their plan/idea doesn't work. When they return to their time, they realise that somehow, due to their actions, Ron doesn't marry Hermione, but rather get's married to Parvati. They realise that they have obviously f-ed up the timeline, as Rose and Hugo (Ron and Hermione's kids) don't exist because Ron and Hermione never got together.

Realising that they messed up, they go back to fix the timeline once again. This time, they do some different things to get Cedric eliminated from the 2nd task. (Remember: They don't want Cedric to get humiliated- they just want him to get eliminated.) Their idea/plan works this time, and they go back to their time thinking that they've fixed everything. They haven't fixed anything, though.

Cedric, after getting eliminated, gets furious and becomes a death-eater. This changes the whole timeline for the worse.

The results of Cedric turning dark are- 1.Umbridge takes over hogwarts, Neville dies, Harry dies, and Voldemort wins the war. When Scorpius-Albus return to their time, Scorpius can't find Albus anywhere. This is because Harry died during the Battle. No Harry = No Albus.

#3 Second Paragraph-

When I say 'Scorpius escapes', I mean that he escapes from the shitty timeline where Voldemort won. He doesn't want to live in a world like that, without his best-friend. He finds Snape at Hogwarts and gets his help. Snape is not on the run. He's at Hogwarts, for some reason. Ron and Hermione, on the other hand, are on the run.

When I mean 'their own timeline' I mean the timeline where they were originally from- the timeline where Harry never died and is a head auror, where Rose and Hugo are alive.

There are 2 parts of CC that go on during the same time- One part is Albus-Scorpius' time travel adventure, while the other part is Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco looking for Albus and Scorpius.

#+begin_quote
  Also how does it go from Scorpius with the previous 3 to the trio plus Draco and Ginny if Harry is supposed to be dead?
#+end_quote

Harry is only dead in one timeline- in Albus and Scorpius' original timeline, Harry is alive and looking for his son.

#4 In the Extra Information, I mentioned that Harry gives Albus Harry's old blanket as a present or something. This blanket is the one Harry was wrapped in when he was left at the Dursleys. Albus, predictably, throws it away. When Albus-Scorpius find out that Delphi is actually evil, she kidnaps them and brings them to 31 October 1980 (The day Harry was orphaned) because she wanted to speak to Voldemort. The two of them (Scorpius-Albus) realise what Delphi is trying to do, and want to send The trio + Ginny, Draco a message about where they are. Albus remembers the blanket Harry gifted him, steals it from Lily and James who are alive and living in Godric's Hollow and write the date (31 Oct 1980) on it so that The trio know where to find them.

The trio, meanwhile, find that Delphi is evil and has kidnapped Scorpius and Albus. They also find out that she's time travelled to somewhere. Harry somehow finds the blanket in Albus' room, and sees the date. The trio attempt to go back in time, but have no time turner to do it. Miraculously, Draco has a time turner. They use it to go to October 31 and find Delphi, Scorpius and Albus.

I had mentioned earlier that Delphi wanted to talk to Voldemort. The trio decide to trap Delphi by pretending to be Voldemort, which Harry does. They subdue her. The End.

** Harry is a petulant man-child, and Ron is diminished to a feeble form of comic relief. The Ministry of Magic has terrible security, even twenty-two years after the Golden Trio's Gringotts heist. JKR attempts to justify Cedric Diggory's death and - for some reason - her choices of Yule Ball dates. The readers are treated to the classic “butterfly effect” lesson about time travel in the least creative way possible. Also, Voldemort had a secret daughter with Bellatrix, and Albus is crushing on her. Eventually, after all of the effort they've exerted into attempting to change the present by meddling with the past, Albus and Scorpius set things back the way they were. Harry finally accepts that his kid is a Slytherin, which was what he promised to do in the epilogue of /Deathly Hallows/. The only good things about it were the trolley lady and Hermione being Minister of Magic.
