In about 24 hours, I'm going to embark on a journey to almost literally the other side of the world, with approximately 32 hours of sitting in airports and on planes, plus a whole load of train trips in the weeks after that. Travel is exciting and all, buuuut not the actually travelling part.

I'm looking for any good podfic (that is, audio recordings of fic) that anyone can recommend. I'm not fussy with pairings or ratings or themes or anything - worst case, I just don't enjoy it and skip to the next. I've listened to a few in the past, but I can't for the life of me remember most of them, and it was when I was mostly into Sherlock or Merlin. Thought I'd branch out and try Harry Potter!

Please help me save my sanity! <3

This is the archive with their episodes. It's not a single story but they read one shots or go through an entire story in several episodes. Makes it rather hard to find things, but everything they do read is really well written. I don't know if you can download anything though :(

** [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/audiofics/episodes.html][Audiofictions]] is the only fanfiction podcast I know of, though I haven't personally listened to any, so I can't vouch for quality.

Edit: [[http://www.aaronmelzak.com/psychic_serpent/][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]] looks pretty good.
