** In Miranda Flairgold's A Second Chance at Life, Harry attends a school in Canada. But don't get too excited, because even though it is a good story, (1) there is very little discussion about Canada and (2) part 3 of the trilogy is abandoned, so the story is incomplete. linkffn(2488754)

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
