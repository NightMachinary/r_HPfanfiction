Any good new fics crop up in the past few months? I'm not picky about what I read so long as the writing is strong!


** This updates weekly and has a couple of tropes, but I intend to subvert them with time. It will end up being over a million words eventually. linkffn(13507192)

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

It is a SI, which I would normally avoid.

This seems to be the rare exception. Had me actually laughing in sections. The Slytherin "trial" especially.
