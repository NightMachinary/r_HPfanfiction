*** I like the headcanon that the cloak of invisibility is severely underrated. I can't remember the exact story, but there was a fic where Dumbledore told Harry after he failed to get past the age line that the cloak could walk through any wards as though they didn't exist.

The cloak's power is pretty inconsistent in canon, but I prefer to think that it's far more than invisibility. You're borderline nonexistent inside the cloak and can only be detected by someone walking into you - and possibly not even then.

***** Yes and No. The word "ward" is not used. But the concept of a continuous area of effect spell that protects a selected area definitely exists. Muggle repellant spells that Hermione used in the 7th book and age lines in the 4th are the first that come to mind.

Just because the word isn't used doesn't mean the concept isn't in use. For example, if there's a spell called Blyper Snoot that causes a sphere of fire to launch towards the target, then that's a fireball spell even if the word "fireball" isn't used.

****** Fair enough. I definitely think the age line qualifies, I'm not so sure about repelling charms fitting the ideas a lot of people ascribe to fanon wards, which are almost like force fields from star trek in a lot of cases.

I personally wonder about the cloak and dementors. In Hogsmeade in the 7th book, dementors can sense Ron, Hermione and Harry under the cloak, but later in the Forbidden Forest Harry passes very near them and they don't seem to sense him. I think it's likely that the cloak didn't completely cover the three of them the way it is able to cover one person entirely. I know Dumbledore says in book 3 that the dementors won't be fooled by invisibility cloaks, but I wonder if he tested that specific cloak, the deathly hallow, or if it's just known that regular cloaks from demiguise fur won't fool them.

** The Halls of Nurmengard were the same for Gellert, it had been almost five decades since he was put here by his `friend`, and since then all days blurred together, he only knew the years due to Albus' yearly visits, always there with his platitudes and books.

Yet, he was the only living person he had seen, no one else came to visit, the guards stayed on the lower levels, and the elves never showed themselves, it was lonely, and almost maddening.

But today things would change, once Gellert had dreamt of the man with the pale wand who would come for him, but last week, something shifted, changed, transformed and the future was uncertain, for he had dreamt of a boy with a pale cloak who would come for him instead.

It had been a few days into the summer when he heard it, the slight shift of the wind, and of fate itself.

Gellert looked to the bars of his cell, and saw the shimmer through their gaps, and then out of thin air, a head appeared, small arms pulled a silvery /pale/ hood down and Grindelwald saw his future.

"Hello, Mr. Grindelwald"

It was a child, judging by the height, bright green eyes looked at him with a mixture of hesitation, fear and...empathy?

Gellert decided to not think on matters of sanity and talked to the floating head.

"Hello." his voice came out raspy from the lack of use, he cleared his throat and took a sip of tepid water, before looking at the child.

"Er, I am Harry Potter,hum, sir, I...want your help?"

Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, "defeater" of that fool Voldemort, and lauded as hero of the sheep, yet the boy was thin and his eyes were definetely not the ones from a child hero, at least not one who never fought.

"Well, Mr. Potter, it seems we both don't need too much introduction," at the boys surprise, Gellert chuckled, the sound was unpleasant, "why, even here in my...current dwelling, I've heard of you, and your victory."

The slight scoff of the boy confirmed his suspicions, what foolishness had been done with this boy that he would come to /him/ for help?

When the boy hesitated to speak, Gellert did it for him.

"And what help could one such as you, need from someone such as me?" he gestured to himself and his surroundings, the implications obvious.

"I need you to teach me,sir"

Gellert's eyebrow rose, what an interesting day.

"Teach you?"

"Yes, sir, to fight, to use magic," a look of despair come over the boy's eyes as he gulped "to survive," but defiance soon /burned/ throught it "to win."

Gellert laughed and the boy almost flinched, "I don't understand, Mr. Potter, why would you want to learn from me? Aren't you considered a great hero? Don't you go to Hogwarts? Why not ask Albus Dumbledore?"

The boy scoffed again, though some guilt bled through, but he shook his head and answered "That hasn't helped me, it never did, actually, and Professor Dumbledore..."

The boy shook his head again, in frustration this time, Gellert remembered seeing that same thing in Newt Scamander's eyes all those years ago.

"Oh, do tell me about it?"

It should have been a taunt, but apparently the boy needed someone to talk to because he spilled it all, from the beginning, he spoke about his parent's deaths, about how Albus left him with his prejudiced Muggle relatives, he skimmed over that time, but Gellert had seen his fair share of abused and rebellious children to get the gist of it, he then spoke of his 'adventures' during his First Year at Hogwarts, how he had to go back to his relatives and then to debacle of this last year, his second one, finishing with his fight with a Basilisk and how he had to face his mortality at twelve.

Harry took a deep shuddering breath as he finished, and looked at the reedy man behind bars, in shabby clothes and surrounded by dusty books and old parchment, if not for the man's eyes, Harry wouldn't believe this was Gellert Grindelwald, one of the most powerful wizards of the century, but the man's eyes held a similar quality to Professor Dumbledore's and he was the next best thing.

Gellert pondered while the boy finished his tale, he made quite a few deductions 'Testing the kid Albus? But you either went overboard or lost control of it, shabby, my old friend.'

"I see, Harry Potter, not a common life, I would dare say not an easy one too, no, definetely not." here he grinned, noticing the boy pursing his lips, "tell me then, why do you want to learn these things? Why learn how to fight?"

There was no hesitation as the boy spoke and in his green eyes Gellert saw determination, and potential, potential he had only seen many, many decades ago, in blue eyes.

"I want to control my life, I am tired of always...always being useless, of always depending on others to help me, and then they don't and...and...this last year one of my best friends almost died and then the other's little sister almost died too, along with me, and no one helped, not a teacher, not Professor Dumbledore, only Fawkes, the phoenix, and I think he went there by himself."

The boy breathed out, and Gellert saw the outline of his cloak for a moment, "So, that's why I want your help, so I can defend myself, and the people I care about, I know this is not the last time I will fight Voldemort, and I want to be more prepared the next time" he fixed Gellert`s eyes with his and the aprehension was clear, even if covered by sheer reckless determination.

Grindelwald smiled, his yellowed teeth and time marked face made for a scary visage, "This is all well and good, my freund, but the crux of the matter is, /why/ would I help you?"

Here Harry faltered slightly, took a deep breath, and whispered "Because I can set you free."

His answering laugh echoed throught the hallways, and it got raspier and scratchier the more it went, before Grindelwald was coughing, "Haha, young one, you are fun, but you can't set me free, these bars..." he trailed off as the child opened the cloak a little and pulled a large fang out of it, and Gellert's eyes widened a fraction.

"Of course. Basilisk venon, it can destroy even the most potent of magics."

Harry nodded, before pulling out a scroll and opening it in front of the bars.

"I will need guaratees too...sir"

Gellert quickly read through the paper while frowning, before chuckling, "Ha, a Wizard's Vow, and written out too, it has been a long time since I saw one of these." his smile turned mischievous "You do know there can be loopholes, don't you, Mr. Potter?"

Here Harry /looked/ at Gellert, and the old man saw it in his eyes, the fear, concern, despair, and the determination, anger and courage all rolling, boiling, fighting for dominance.

"I know, sir, and frankly, I don't care."

"Well, then, Harry, my friend, you better call that house elf of yours and ask him to bring a few things, we shall have our first lesson, Principles of Alchemy and...deception."

That summer, Gellert Grindelwald's "demise" while in prision was noted around the world, but in Britain it was widely overshadowed by Sirius Black's escape.

Among all those events, it took a month for Dumbledore to notice Harry wasn't at Privet Drive, and by then, the wards were broken and he was already in France, on an old summer house bought by his grandparents, 'for safety', after all, Privet Drive was a muggle home and Sirius Black a Wizard, better to leave the country until classes began.

As for Gellert, he had thought of finding a way to get away from the boy and begin again, but the world was changed, he had no more allies, and he wasn't one who could change the currents of the world anymore.

But Harry Potter? Oh, Harry Potter could do that, and Gellert would be there to guide him, no longer wanting to blow the winds of change, but now to guide them a little and see where the world went.

The Potte's weren't the only family he probably wiped out, just the "last" one he did in his first reign and all. It was also why I avoided using Potter as an example in my little example of an Evil Overlord being aware of the Hero tropes.

The many houses thing, I fully agree on. Even in these modern times you hear about rich people with many houses, and they still have to deal with travel time between houses, while wizards could just pop on over in a few seconds or minutes depending on how the fanon world limits magic, so it is very reasonable for them to have serval homes as well though I've never directly thought of it from a declining clan angle.

Mentor/Student, the Mentor is more of a guide to the Student still teaching him but being more hands-off, I would say that would be like Obi-Wan and Anakin after the latter was knighted.

I would see Harry being really dependent at the beginning, taking Gellert's word as law on some stuff, but Gellert teaching him how to think for himself and make his own decisions, so he gradually becomes more of a mentor as Harry matures and comes into himself.

But accepting the point, yes, if he could stealth is way into a super prison for wizards, he probably just needs a little initiative and information to change his "Class" from Rogue/Thief to Assassin.

I've read a few fics like this recently. I'll take a look and see if I can find links.

Edit: Okay so the fic I was thinking about is Defense Professor Wohl linkffin(13225966) and its sequal(s?).

I also found The Pretender linkffn(13128779). Hermione enlists Grindlewald to solve the Harry/horcrux problem after Dumbledore's death. Leaens dark magic from him. GG/HG endgame which was kind of weird but turned out okay.

Similar is Same Apartment Roommate's Gone linkao3(16372529) except Grindlewald possesses Lockhart in order to get close to Dumbledore/escape boredom. More introspective, focuses heavily on the GG/AD relationship.

I'll keep looking because I feel like there's another fic I'm forgetting. I definitely second the rec for Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying, as well. I'm a huge crackfic fan and would definitely rec it as my favorite GG fic!

  Krum's jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, ‘Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore -- and rightly, seeing how he vos finished.

  The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: in a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. *DH*
#+end_quote

Europe (not exactly the whole world) united against Grindelwald because he was only powerful enough to fight a war in Europe. He couldn't beat Dumbledore with the elder wand.

Conversely, Voldemort fights in Britain which Grindewald couldn't even have a heavy presence in because of Dumbledore's efforts.

Hell, this doesn't even get into the other reasons. Such as, when have you ever heard of a country interfering with other countries without other reasons (like a hatred of communism or oil)? Rwanda is a depressing, if apt, analogy. Grindelwald directly attacked many countries in Europe. Voldemort chose the harder path of messing with the country with Dumbledore in it.

#+begin_quote
  “Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. *HBP*
#+end_quote

Dumbledore, who fought and won against Grindelwald, calls Voldemort the most dangerous dark wizard of all time.

Meanwhile, Voldemort fought Dumbledore to a near-draw in OoTP while Dumbledore used the elder wand.

To sum up:

1. Grindelwald loses to Dumbledore with the elder wand
2. Voldemort essentially draws with Dumbledore who has the elder wand (and still needs Fawkes)
3. Therefore, Voldemort is more skilled than Grindelwald

​

Also, Voldemort is considered the greatest dark wizard of all time by everyone in HP.

LV had a guerilla organization of rich dilettantes backing him, and fought primarily through subterfuge (imperius, betrayal, spies, etc.). Grindelwald conquered most of Europe.

Dumbledore and Grindelwald fought in their prime. LV took on an infant (then teenager) and lost, and meanwhile fought an elderly man.

***** Not exactly fair. Yes, Voldy managed to draw with Dumbledore while the latter was using Fawkes and the Elder Wand, but he also lost to Harry while having the wand to a simple disarming hex. Personally I think either having Horcruxi actually helped his magical abilities instead of hindering it as we like to think or having Horcruxi destroyed damaged his magical powers (not necessarily his magic, maybe his reaction time or racional thinking abilities, or even giving him some physical aftereffects), maybe even both.

Alternatively in a real fight being the strongest or the best in a martial art isn't always a sure-find way of winning, there are many factors that could change the result. For example, Voldy is an excellent duelist, but Grindelwald teachs Harry how to turn his blood in acid from afar, or how to make all his followers in inferi/werewolves/whatever while Voldemort is sleeping, or how to use their connection to strike at him by mind or soul; Hell, if we accept a more DBZ approach he could even teach him a curse that destroys the whole town Voldemort is in with him there.

I personally don't like the whole ‘take a gun to a magic duel' approach because I feel it is used as an excuse for muggle-wank and to keep the whole ‘Buttt wizzardsss are stupy-stipu- Dumb' stereotype and I am petty sure that in all the time guns have existed at least someone would have thought of making a shield to protect themselves from bullets. But it could reasonably be used with some kind of magic that is not very explored for some reason or other, like it's done with rituals at linkffn(The archeologist).

****** He lost to Harry because of Harry's shared blood, Harry's mother's blood protection remnants, Harry's renewed blood protections, the fact that Harry used to host Voldemort's soul fragment, and because Harry was the master of the elder wand. That's why Voldemort lost. A truer indication of Voldemort's skill is the fact that Voldemort fought Kingsley, Minerva, and Slughorn with a mismatched wand while the three of them were protected by Harry's sacrifice and /still won./

I concur that Horcruxes do not canonically hinder Voldemort's magic or mind which we know from Dumbledore.

I agree mugglewank is idiotic. A simple protego is sufficient to defend against firearms, nevertheless charms such as the Imperturbable charm.

Voldemort and Grindelwald both delved deeply into Dark magic. The difference is that Voldemort delved more, had more natural skill, and hasn't spent the last few decades rotting away in prison to a shell of the man he was.

******* About the mismatched wand I really am not sure how much it really hinders Voldemort. Yeah, we see that when Harry used one that wasn't loyal to him it backfired, but to be fair he was an average/above average seventeen years old using another wand for the first time, because of his successful use of Lucius wand we can understand that Voldemort had at least some experience in this and mismatched or not it is still the Elder Wand.

This plus the fact that we don't really get a conclusive answer on how and how much the wand improves the users normal casting (besides being able to fix other wands) means that we don't actually know for sure how much if at all using a mismatched Elder Wand weakened Voldemort -Really hoping Fantastic beasts will eventually touch on the Elder Wand's powers and explain this a little better. Maybe he was still above his standard skill-level when he fought those three, just not so much as he would be with the wand's allegiance. And the blood protection is frankly so inconstant in it's effects that I'm not even going to try discussing about them, if we went by the same rules as at the first time they were used anyone who received a mortal attack under the protection should not only survive, but the attacker should be instantly vaporized.

Though I do concede that Harry's victory was mostly due to the Elder Wand's allegiance, it just seems like it shouldn't be enough. I mean, Voldemort is shown as a very powerful wizard having been able to use magic at will even before he went to Hogwarts, a malfunctioning wand being his downfall because it preferred his adversary seems like a poor ending for him. Not saying that Harry should become Super for no good reason and killing him in some unrealistically epic duel, but maybe some trap or poisoning to weaken him before the fight, or caging him someplace he couldn't escape and letting him die from dehydration, the duel rote should never have worked with all the times cannon talked about how powerful Voldemort was.

And my point isn't that Grindelwald was better than Voldemort in every way, it's that as a former Dark Lord who fought all over the world and was shown as being prone to liking to experiment with magic he may very well be skilled in some field Voldemort didn't have the chance/time to explore and may know someway of defeating him without direct confrontation or some magic that either gives Harry a power-up big enough to gap the difference in their powers. It really doesn't matter how good you are in a fight if your enemy manages to detonate a nuke under your bed while you sleep, and while not exactly the same Harry's scarhorcrux connection could potentially be used to send an attack, would even made sense if Grindelwald did it but not Dumbledore if it was some kind of risk experiment. Plus no one, no matter how grifted, could potentially manage to learn about everything in all fields, there is always someone who is going to know about some kind of magic that Voldemort doesn't even without being better than him at everything.

**** This has more to do with their method of achieving World Dominance rather than magical prowess. Notice how it is stated in Deathly Hallows that even Gellert Grindelwald didn't make any attempt to take over Britain because he knew Dumbledore as the only wizard who could rival him. The way I see it is that he started his war by conquering as many countries as possible, France, America, Germany, Bulgaria, Russia, etc (possibly every European country barring Britain, and other continents like America and Africa), and kept Britain for the very last - so he'd fight Dumbledore at the height of his powers. Rather than start his war by fighting his toughest challenge and getting destroyed before even getting started, he decided to get as many easy wins as possible. Britain was the final frontier for Gellert Grindelwald.

Voldemort, on the other hand, started /his/ war by conquering Britain and it slowed down /his/ plans of World Dominance. He faced heavy resistance by Dumbledore who easily overpowered him, and wasted his time locking horns with him.

To sum up:

1. Dumbledore beats Grindewald who was using the elder wand because Dumbledore is more skilled
2. Dumbledore, using the elder wand, draws with Voldemort and relies on Fawkes and animated statues to do so
3. Therefore, Voldemort is more skilled than Grindelwald

Someone with the natural skill and youthful energy like Harry could definitely benefit from the powerful magics that Grindelwald certainly knows. Whether or not that would make Harry equal to or even superior to Voldemort is unlikely, but it would certainly put him at a higher level than just using Stupify and Expelliarmus all the time.

  They say, still, that no wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He Who Must Not Be Named.

This doesn't quite sound like what you described. And there were witnesses, before you quote Skeeter. Though I'm sure Dumbledore did conjure a white hankerchief of sorts at some point in their teen years.

  ‘You are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.

  ‘Oh, not death,' said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry's questioning look. ‘Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skilful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: you would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.

  ‘I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until, finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.

  ‘Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.'
#+end_quote

Given that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were using lethal force as teenagers, I don't think either had an issue with killing each other. After all, it's not exactly fighting for the greater good if you're not willing to kill the greatest obstacle to the greater good.

Grindelwald did want to hurt Dumbledore. He just wasn't good enough, even with the wand.

In another comment, I provide further evidence that Grindelwald would never have been a challenge to Voldemort, nevertheless a Grindelwald-trained Harry. After all, the best wizards learn and expand the boundaries of magic. Grindelwald - kicked out for Dark magic experiments. Dumbledore - heavily published and multiple research awards. Voldemort - dark rituals, unaided flight, first use of multiple horcruxes.

Training doesn't make natural instinct and intelligence suddenly appear, and intelligence is a huge factor in magical skill. The truth is that Harry, no matter the amount of training, could never have matched Voldemort. And you don't specify an AU where Harry is much more naturally skilled in your prompt.

****** I said that Harry could never have matched Voldemort with magic, not that he wasn't Voldemort's equal. In a way, Harry was greater than Voldemort. Harry was a far better person.

He defeated him with his mother's sacrifice that he got renewed, shared blood, a horcrux fragment, and mastery over the wand that Voldemort was using. Hell, in the end Voldemort technically dies because his own spell. If Voldemort had realized that the elder wand was not his, he probably could have still threatened Harry heavily. He beat Minerva, Slughorn, and Kingsley using a wand he didn't control while his opponents were protected by Harry's renewed blood protection.

What Grindelwald, Voldemort, and Dumbledore have in common are incredible intelligence, a natural instinct for magic, and the drive to use it. In school, Grindelwald is conducting experiments with dark magic. Dumbledore is publishing papers. Voldemort is attaining immortality and unleashing a basilisk. /In school/. They all reach a command of magic that is far more than just learning. They push the boundaries of magic, in school.

Harry is an above-average student of magic. He's pretty good at magic. He's not even at the level of his parents. James and Sirius casually scored Es and Os while barely studying. They were described by their teachers as exceptional. Harry is called "reasonably talented" by Dumbledore. Harry and Ron who do actually study, with the encouragement of someone who studies even more, pull As, Es and Os. Hell, . Those aren't the words used to describe someone who's so gifted at magic that he does things NEWT examiners have never seen.

And of course, there are the extra-universe explanations. Harry Potter is a story about a normal kid defeating a great evil. Harry isn't the next Dumbledore, or the next Grindelwald. He's not even a Snape or Sirius. He's a normal kid who beats Voldemort because of love, his family, and his friends.

  There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.

  /‘Look out!'/ Harry yelled.

  But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake struck --

  Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement -- the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass.
#+end_quote

Yeah, really on the ropes. Nothing like needing a bird to save your ass when you're using the elder wand. Hell, even in the rest of the duel Voldemort doesn't have any issue defending against Dumbledore.

1. Voldemort apparates away from the statues.
2. Voldemort conjures a shield to defend against Dumbledore's forceful spell.
3. Voldemort transfigures a fire whip into a snake
4. Voldemort throws off the water by possessing Harry

Conversely, Dumbledore relies on the statues which he had time to animate before the duel started and Fawkes. Without them, he would have had a tougher time finding the time to attack.

#+begin_quote
  your greatest weakness ---” Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip.
#+end_quote

Without the statue, he wouldn't have been able to conjure the length of fire.

It's honestly a pretty even duel. Dumbledore isn't playing with Voldemort. If Fawkes wasn't there and Dumbledore didn't have the statues, he would have had a much tougher time. Keep in mind, Dumbledore had the animations, Fawkes, and the elder wand behind him.

Other evidence is the clear respect Dumbledore has of Voldemort's abilities throughout the books. If Dumbledore hadn't dueled to the max of his abilities and didn't have Fawkes, Voldemort would have killed Dumbledore.
