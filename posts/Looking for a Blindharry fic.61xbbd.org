I believe Harry is blinded early in the story. He gets a Blind monk teacher who helps him. He also develops a PhoenixSight ability to see through the Phoenix's eyes. It was pretty long. Any help appreciated.


** Is it HarryxHermione?

** Still looking if anyone has thoughts. I've been looking for weeks. It seems it's just gone. I vividly remember him stumbling through the castle with fawkes help. His mentor teaches him to use a stick. I feel like he was part of some secret society of blind warlocks too.

*** What? Blindness does not have any monks or phoenixes to talk about. Harry has some kind of magic-sight, no phoenix-sight.
