:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it ages ago (maybe on AO3 or [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]?) but I think there was some sort of life debt or spell between hermione and snape because she saves him and as a consequence, the spell has to be "reinforced" every week or month or something by them having sex? i remember one part where they have a fight and hermione is late and severus almost dies? any help is greatly appreciated!! it's been driving me nuts trying to find it


** Possibly Tyger Tyger from Bloodcult of Freud? Can't seem to actually find the fic though.
