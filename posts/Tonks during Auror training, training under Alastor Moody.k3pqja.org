** I think I've read something like it in this one but it's not all focused on Tonks, there are a few chapters that follow her training in detail. I can't remember if it was on Innocent or another fic though...

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
