Looking for fanfics about post-battle Magical Britain rebuilding (Hogwarts, Ministry, economy, etc.) Preferably not romance-centric and with actual magic involved still. There's too many fanfics that completely leave out the magic aspect if they do a post-Hogwarts fic.


** - stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] starting with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian), but there is not that much new magic, true.

- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]] ... one of few where Harry leaves Hogwarts prematurely and he has actually something to learn in the Auror training. Actually, quite a lot and quite a lot of new magic as well.

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.
