** I think it's really easy for authors to offer a spot to get any major trigger warnings/character deaths etc, if you choose to view them.

Y'all, cut OP some slack. The world is literally in flames, a lot of us have had actual deaths IRL or are worried about loved ones. Sometimes you just want escapism. You can have emotions about fanfic, it's okay.

*** Thank you!! I just wanted to escape lol and this hit me in a very triggering way. I had to physically get myself out of that state. I understand that it was an extreme reaction and that it probably indicates I get too attached to characters. But it still hit me in a bad way. Thank you, kind human!

** Bro I hit myself with a major character death without a warning while I was writing my fic. I was just sitting there like holy shit a big character just died six chapters in, I really thought he was going to play a bigger role, but oh well. I honestly have to be in a depressive mood to write emotional death scenes, if I'm in a good mood it somehow comes out like comedy no matter how sad it's supposed to be. But then I end up getting emotional at the death because I'm already in a sad mood, so it's :(

** We need to have a spoiler-esque trigger warning system for stories, so that you can opt-in to them.

Personally, I feel like having tags such as "Major Character Death" for the story itself is fine, but if it's for the chapter it can sometimes give away what I'm about to read and I don't like that.

Simultaneously, however, it's entirely valid to need those warnings. People go through struggles and emotional trauma that I'm wholly unprepared to understand or be capable of empathizing with, and if they need those warnings then they should be given the chance to have them.

It's honestly shocking to me that AO3, at least, hasn't implemented a "click to reveal" spoiler section in the top ANs that allow authors to do this, given how forward and progressive they usually are about keeping their features up-to-date.

** I'm sorry, what?

Are authors supposed to warn you up-front that characters can actually die in a story? Isn't that like, the default state of the world?`

People are pretty fragile, their lives easily extinguished by an arrow or a stone.

I recommend working on developing some thicker skin and getting out of whatever comfort zone you've been stuck in, if it keeps you away from stories with this level of conflict.

My favourite moment from the book I'm currently reading, was when my favourite character was shown to use a natural disaster to try and kill the protagonist, making him suddenly the biggest coward in the setting. Stories reveal our investment in them when they are able to hurt us.

It is a good pain

*** I know what you mean. And this kind of alerted me to the fact that I might be attaching to fictional characters too much, and so I'm gonna take a fanfic break for a bit. But when I'm investing time in an 800k+ story that says it's going to revolve around this character, a comfort character for me, I want it to pay off in some way, and it was also done in a very triggering way. I don't want to roast the author on their account, they clearly liked what they were doing, but it was harmful to me. The different thing with your example is that the protagonist didn't actually die. I'm all for stories messing with the readers. But this was just done in a brutal and triggering way (not just ‘triggering', but actually triggering for me with no warnings at all)

So, a character was marked as important to the story and then killed off in, and I'm just guessing here, a pretty fucked up and too drawn out manner?

I want to rant about tone changes and how not all authors are sadistic towards towards their characters, but I don't think you need any of that right now. It sounds like you didn't know what you were getting in to and the Author's notes just compounded the feeling of being betrayed or directly punished for liking a character.

That's messed up and I'm sorry that happened.

*** AO3 requires writers to either use the “Major Character Death” tag or use the “Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings” tag if there's a major character death. Those are the rules. I don't like spoilers myself, so I generally use “Choose Not to Use Warnings.” If the story was on AO3, had a major character death, and wasn't tagged with either of those tags, then it was in violation of their rules.

I did not know that. I'm guessing there's not a lot of enforcement on those kinds of things, since it sounds /a bit/ hard to police all the tags on AO3.

I'm definitely the weirdo in this conversation, though. I don't really read the tags at all. It's up to the summary to get me interested in a story.
