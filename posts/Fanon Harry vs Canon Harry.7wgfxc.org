** There isn't really /a/ fanon Harry, is there? If there's anything to characterize the portrayal of Harry in fanfiction, I'd say it's that there are as many different conceptions of his character as there are fanfiction authors, essentially.

** Too many people forgot how sassy and vindictive canon Harry can get.

He is generally too passive, and sometimes gets dumbed down so JKR can jam her plot through. A good example is putting that Locket on.

But considering the pressure he was under, he has performed indeed admirably. Now imagine yourself in a similar situation, how would you have fared?

*** Run away. Good luck to Voldemort finding me in a random farmhouse outside of Redstone, Montana or at Pine Creek, Northern Territory. And before someone points out Hagrid tracking Harry, he knew where Harry lived and had help from Dumbledore.

**** Not a bad solution, but you need help.

If I were in his situation after Year 4, I would try to get Hermione and Sirius to run with me. I would go to a country that was not friendly with British Ministry of Magic and do a full exposure.

***** Do magical countries even follow muggle borders? Why would a Wizard in Strasbourg care about the treaty of Versailles or a witch in Poland that her country got removed from the map again? Would the US even have a centralised magical government? Rowling made one up, but why should there be a magical United States and not, lets say French Louisiana, Spanish Florida and so on? Can you really imagine someone like Lucius Malfoy or a native American shaman saying that they are part of a muggle nation instead of what they had before?

Underage Harry would definitely need help, but taking Hermione along the way would probably improve your odds either way, even as an adult.

*** Opposite for me. Harry went through 11 years (ten before Hogwarts and then another added together from various summer holidays and the hunt) of malnutrition, if not outright starvation. He ought to be the shortest of his year because living through that hell with leave you a head shorter at least. The Dursleys had him at 500 calories a day more than once during a crucial period of his development. So why does everyone make him bloody six feet or even taller? And the random growth spurts mentioned over the summer hols make even less sense. Where is that substance coming from?

**** [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8005092][This article]] indicates that childhood malnourishment can be reversed and full height potential achieved with proper nourishment during puberty. Harry went into Hogwarts well before puberty started and was pretty well nourished through it, so I feel that any damage done by the Dursleys would have definitely been mitigated.

[[https://www.bu.edu/today/2014/consequences-of-malnutrition-may-be-reversible-later-in-childhood/][This article]] focuses more on an earlier age intervention (8-years-old) and cognitive development, but notes this toward the end:

#+begin_quote
  “Height is a manifestation of both nutrition and sickness over time,” Dearden says, explaining that genetic differences in height generally do not materialize until puberty. The study shows that “the window of opportunity for intervention may not be as limited as it appeared,” in terms of a child's age.
#+end_quote

Since Harry didn't seem to be cognitively disabled by undernutrition, I feel that it's reasonable that he could recover enough to be reasonably tall. Also, in the seventh book, it's noted that he's as tall as James who was described as tall. When I think of someone as "tall", I think at least 6ft. I'm 5'7" myself and don't consider less than 5'10" as tall.

**** book 6:

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.

  ‘You're like Ron,' she sighed, looking him up and down. ‘Both of you look as though you've had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron's grown four inches since I last bought him school robes.
#+end_quote

Later, Hermione reinforces the idea:

#+begin_quote
  '...And now they're calling you the “Chosen One” -- well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?'

  Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.

  ‘And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway ...'

  ‘You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,' said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.

  ‘And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer, either,' Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.

  ‘I'm tall,' said Ron inconsequentially.

***** Let's make it simple. According to a quick google search, the average height of an 11 year old is 143.5 cm. Now, Harry was malnutritioned until age 11, so it is reasonable to assume that he was shorter than that (and that is confirmed in either PS or CoS). When we put Harry at 135cm and then look 10 years in the future, he'd still be shorter even if he grew as much as the average guy.

** Well, in my head grown up Harry is a complete fuck up that can not deal with what happened in his younger years at all and is very damaging to his children. Young Harry is an abused, neglected child that is neither pretty nor powerful and pretty much lacks talent.

I think canon Harry does not fit his upbringing and I do not like it if the main character is powerful.

Therefore I am not a fan of canon Harry, but like powerful, rich fanon Harry even less, I highly prefer the superweird, ugly, underdog Harry that some writers dare to write about.

If you want to see abuse, look at Mike Tyson who had to watch his mother get fucked for money and was beaten by the neighborhood bullies for most of his childhood.
