Looking for some long Remus/Tonks stories. Preferably AU or slightly AU.

*** I've read A Little More Time and loved it, but will check out the other stories.

Humansplaining is a favourite of mine so I'm glad to tell the author that I love their work cause it's a great story and wouldn't mind getting more R/T from you.

  Complete! Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** Shifts and shades by fernwithy. Now they would count as AU because they don't fit with the new pottermore info. You can also try fics by shimotsuki11. They aren't AU, but she characterizes Remus very well, which almost never happens in any other Remus Tonks fic. Maybe that's why I don't like this paring.
