** There are two that come to my mind immediately.

First is a former book club fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19]] which is between a widower-Harry and Muggle OC. Twenty chapters, just updated in January.

Second is the Harry/Daphne romance [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][Days to Come by chris400ad]]. Harry is an Auror on suspension, Daphne is an unspeakable. Takes place after a kinda nasty break-up between Harry and Ginny.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.
