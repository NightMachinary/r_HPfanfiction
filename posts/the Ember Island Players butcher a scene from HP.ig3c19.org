Just started getting into ATLA crossovers and I'd like to see one in the style of the Ember Island Players episode, complete with a random fan giving the actual Harry Potter some grief over his inaccurate scar while he's sulking during show, and Ron Weasley being like "I am way funnier than that" and giving the actor who plays him some new lines, and... yeah if you've seen it I think you get the idea. Pretty please?


** They are similar if you look at MBTI.

Both Zuko and Harry are the angst drivers of the story. Both ISFP

Hermione is ESTJ while Katara is ESFJ... The bossiness is there though one is more compelled to feeling decisions and the other to rational ones.

Ron is a bit more different than Sokka. Sokka is more rational and forward thinking. The humor is there, but Sokka's ENTP is more similar to the twins.

** I could have sworn there was a popular cursed child fic about this.
