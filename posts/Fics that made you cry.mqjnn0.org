  “You can't just burst into my home, Sirius.” Remus's voice quavers, even though he's trying so hard to keep it even. Sirius can see he's exhausted, his face pale and his eyes bright atop heavy, tired bruises. He wonders how long it's been since he properly slept. Not last night, he won't have, but maybe not the night before either, or the night before that. “Would you have let me in?”Remus's silence speaks volumes. Sirius spreads his hands as if in victory.

** More of a happy cry than a sad one but there was a Harry/Narcissa fic where Harry has to go back in time to retrieve the cure for a disease that is devastating the ww that was destroyed in his 5th year from the DoM. They end up falling in love and having a kid but Narcissa has to marry lucius and have draco etc. She has to live through cannon basically. At some point after Dracos birth he goes back and sees narcissa and draco and the fic gets all sappy. Narcissa still loves him, draco grew up seeing him as a father and was mad because he saw young Harry as an obstacle between him and a full happy family, he reciprocates the familial feelings with draco, his and Narcissas baby was in a time stasis situation and they go back to where they left off happy ending the end. It's not a very long fic and it has pretty decent writing. I forgot the name but it's not a forgettable fic so it shouldn't be much trouble to find for those interested.

  *Complete*“I don't love you anymore,” exaggerates Draco with an irrationally confident look on his face. His voice struggles with cracks and raw emotion. “I wish I could say that's the truth, but you know I'm not good at lying to you.”J.K Rowling owns everything. The plot is mine.

  The last thing Harry expects after the war is to get an owl from Draco Malfoy, who has been hospitalized after being publicly attacked. But keeping an open mind and an open heart leads Harry down a path he never thought possible. And he gets the chance to share memories with the people who had been most important. HP/DM
