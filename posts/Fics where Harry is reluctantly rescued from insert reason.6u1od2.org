You know. Harry is rescued from the dursleys by someone he hates He is locked up somewhere for his own safety and resents who ever is doing it too him. Harry is hidden away in the countryside bored out of his mind.

that sort of stuff

I like angst, hatred, bashing, and prefer to have some sort of pairing, but I'm not fussy.

  COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
