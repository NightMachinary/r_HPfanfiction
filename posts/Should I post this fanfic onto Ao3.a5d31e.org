** It's not something I would want to read, but you should go ahead and post it anyway.

If it's something you want to post, you should post it. If it's a personal project and you don't want to post it then don't.

If you post wanting other people's attention and want them to like it, instead of posting simply because you want to, you'll quickly find your personal escape project has become a personal nightmare. The deadlines weigh down on you, the project becomes draining, your escape method becomes a burden.

If you post because you want to, and people like it great. If you post because you want the acclaim and you don't get that, you'll be disheartened.

Write the stories you want to write, and if people like it or don't it won't matter.

*** I'm just...I don't really care about the acclaim, I just want to share it, but I'm not sure on the Harry Potter fandom itself. I had posted in one other fandom, and that's South Park. Those stories were fun to do. But it mekes sense, I mean posting something cements it as something you need to update or it becomes a burden to update after a while, I've went through it before and forgot about that until now.

Maybe I'll wait until it's entirely done before sharing it.

**** Speaking from my experience I waited 5 years before posting my fic. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I agonized over every chapter and word for 5 years (while still probably only getting about 40% complete) before I decided to just go ahead and post it.

After almost a year I finally just posted chapter 9. But I do the story for me, not for the others.

But the reason I say don't worry about other people is because I posted a link to it on Reddit about my story, just to drum up interest and got shit on for my main character. Don't understand why people don't follow the don't like don't read/interact rule anymore. And that really made it hard to want to write, which probably contributed to a large gap between chapters.

***** Fun fact I had this written out up to the fifth book already, at one point. Then my computer crashed and I totally lost everything. I learned my lesson, and now I have cloud storage and a hard disk backup. ANYWAY, I actually did this because I was done with my South Park stories and I was at a loss to do anything, and I really HATE re-doing something I already have done from the bare bones and up, but I convinced myself that perhaps it would be different.

So I wrote everything again, and it turned out better than my first go-around, which really amazes me to no end. So yeah, I'm pretty stoked about it. But I'm agreeing with some people, I'm going to wait before posting it.

** I'm sure someone would enjoy your work. Post it if you want to, but don't decide based on others' opinions of your ideas. I'm not familiar with the review climate of AO3, however, if you go ahead with this, be prepared to receive harsh criticism (I'm not saying your story warrants this, I just don't want you to be discouraged if you happen to attract such reviews).

If you want to share the story with others, and you feel you can brush off an unfavorable (or absent) reaction, you should go for it! More OC is always a fine thing.

*** I used to be succeptable to harsh critisism in my past, but I've grown a thicker skin since that time long ago. I have other works (in a different fandom) and I just seem to attract those who like OCs and enjoy something different, which is a fair few. I don't really mind it, but I was just wondering if the idea just sounds....not entirely stupid. I've spent years looking at OP Harry fics and all this stuff and then I was just one day like "What if there's an OP family but it's really not what people expect" and it branched out from there. I've had this in my head for at least three years, and I'm re-writing it now.

**** It's hard to properly judge without knowing the details, but I think it's fine if you deliver on what you've promised (subverting expectations, difficulties regarding their unusual power and a relatively sensible explanation for the same).

There are some parts I'm not keen on---the Snape lost love bit (just 'cause I'm not fond of him) and the weak plot device forcing your family to move continents. It feels flimsy to have any capable witch, let alone a powered-up OC, forced into such a drastic change because of 'runes', so I hope there's something more to that aspect.

Couple other things: 'Dark Lord' is an exercise in vanity unique to Voldemort---it's not like Star Wars where every dark wizard gives themselves the same melodramatic title, so I hope your OC bad guy isn't referred to like that. Also, it would be ideal if your villain didn't steamroll Voldemort entirely, making Dumbledore and the rest look incompetent for not having him done in sooner.

These are just my over-critical thoughts on things, so take or leave what you like. Let me know when you've begun to post it, I'm interested in checking it out.

***** Nah, The 'Dark Lord' guy isn't actually referred to that, and he doesn't really refer himself as that, no one knows what to call him so they fall on the title. It's not actually what you think, anyway, but if I go into detail for that it's spoiling it entirely. Meanwhile for powered-up OCs go, they're not really all that powerful, sure they can preform spells that others can't at their age but they also have limits. Using too much of their power with strong emotional outburst causes their magic to threaten harm to their bodies and too much would kill them. That sorta thing.

Into detail, the story makes more sense, but thanks for the critisism, it helps me. You'd be glad to know I do some research into things before acting on them, to hopefully not go too weird.

*** About anything is cliche now a days, and there's a reason people do cliches, because people like them. Though I never really intended for it to be that way, but oh well. It's all meant for fun.
