  The figure she had spoken to inclined his bald head. His skin glowing like pale scales, his eyes an unsettling crimson, only two slits where any other face would have had a nose. "Report!" he demanded in a low voice. Immediately, one of the supervisors spoke up. "We are almost done with the runework. Your skills in arithmancy are nothing less than marvellous! We will prepare the Source and the Sacrifice in about ten minutes." "Good. Ensure our success and I shall reward you for it greatly."

I hate to be that guy, but let's start with the golden rule of dialogue: new speaker, new paragraph. See [[https://eznguide.neocities.org/][Ezn's guide]] for details. (Sorry for the ponies; once someone makes a Pottter-themed guide to writing fanfic that's comparably good, I'll link that instead.)

(I'm given to understand that fanfiction.net sometimes eats formatting. If this is what happened, please clean it up posthaste.)

Failing to adhere to rules like the golden rule of dialogue makes your fic more difficult to read, largely because this makes it harder to follow who said what. Because it's difficult to follow what's happening, I expect most people (e.g. the discerning denizens of hpfanfiction) will simply give up.

Seriously. Screw cutesy themes. It covers pretty much every grammar concept any novice writer should need. PDFs are available of the whole thing all over the place. Ctrl + F is your best friend.

***** There are actually better forms of it, formatting wise. But I linked the first one that didn't just instantly pop up a PDF. If you google 'The Elements of Style' there's thousands of links to it.

Both, mostly. A lot of times when there's something....thematic...like that the person writing it was more interested in the theme than the content. I skimmed Ezn's guide that zzzyxas posted and it does have some good information in it. It also has errors in it, lots of run-ons, and a rambling excessive tone.

Some might find this cute and informative but well presented bad information is still bad information. It also takes what feels like 2-3 pages to describe what Strunk and White do in a few sentences. Which, if you're looking for an explanation of something, it's better have it readily available and concise.

That isn't to say it'a a perfect book, mind you. There's things in it I disagree with. There's things in it that are rather anachronistic. And some of the language is rather dated.

One of the biggest issues with it, and any grammar text really, is that people tend to treat them as gospel. And no grammar text is gospel. There are points when a writer is going to ignore conventional grammar to suit a purpose.

Most youthful or inexperienced writers will hear someone they look up to say something like, "yeah I know it's wrong. I ignored that rule." and will take that to mean that grammar is optional. And will take it as permission to ignore basic grammar. The difference being, of course, their idol understood the 'grammar rule' that they ignored and did so intentionally, while the novice just doesn't know or care. I've said before in other posts: You don't get to ignore grammar until you can prove you understand grammar.

The Elements of Style is a very good text for getting that basic understanding and foundation for grammar. And it's a phenomenal reference source to have nearby whenever a question comes up.
