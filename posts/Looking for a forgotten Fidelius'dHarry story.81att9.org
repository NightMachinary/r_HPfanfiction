Hey guys! New on this subreddit, but I've been reading HP fics for years. So lately, there's this fic I've been meaning to find but I can't remember it's name or find it. It seemed really unique a concept so that's why I'm trying to find it again. The only major details I can remember is that Harry decided to cast a Fidelius on himself, with some muggle (who later dies in a car crash) as the secret keeper. This ended up erasing all memories of him from everyone's mind. Even information about him stored in books and whatnot was erased, if I remember correctly. Voldemort, Dumbledore and co. end up knowing there is some sort of chosen one around who once defeated Voldemort, but absolutely no clue who it was, since all memories and evidence of Harry's existence was expunged. Anyone know the fic I'm talking about?

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** I love fics that explore the fidelius charm, as much as I hate ones where they make it way too easy.

It has 'fidelity' in the name.

How can you trust someone you pick up off the street?

How can you trust someone if that person is kept inside a secondary fidelius, especially if you yourself are the keeper of that secret?

**** I always felt that the level of protection implied by the fidelius charm needs to have some commensurate sacrifice. There should be a chance of the secret leaking. Hence you would "trust" in the secret keeper to not leak it.

Makes no sense to pick someone who has no contact with the wizarding world, or a random hermit living in the mountains who no one remembers. Or someone who is oathbound to not reveal your secrets. That completely disregards the point of the charm if you just try to 'rig' the results, and in my headcanon I would imagine the charm would just fail....or not succeed in the first place.

***** I have the exact same head-canon. Fidelius relies upon trusting your secret keeper to keep your secret.

When Pettigrew broke that trust the charm collapsed and everyone was able to see and visit Potter cottage.

***** I've just heard other authors not allowing other wards within the Fidelius because they interfere, with each other.

Bill being his own secret keeper of shell cottage kind of throws a wrench in not being able to be your own or stay for long periods of time in a place that you are a secret keeper for.

****** Unless those wards are for some internal effects on the house, property or it's inhabitants, it's not much of a sacrifice to be honest.

******* I mean, I dunno about that. Isnt that anti-eavesdropping charm a kind of ward? I remember reading this one thing where its not that hard to /cast/, but the secret actively /wants/ to be told willy-nilly.
