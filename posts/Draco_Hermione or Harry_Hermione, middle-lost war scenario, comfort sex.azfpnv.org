I would like to have a Fic that have them together in the middle of the War or a scenario that has a lost war or some sort of Lost world, so everything is lost and destroyed. The both of them seek shelter or travel through the World and try to find something but they are alone. It doesn have to be this apocalyptic, but can also be Draco escape with Hermione from Voldemort or whatever.

â€‹

Well, over time and with permanent stress and danger he might getting caught in find her attractive and might fall for her. She however doesnt do that, since she cant be sure to trust or love him in their current state. It would need a whole while, untill she opens atleast a bit and she asks him to sleep with her for comforting purpose. To make her forget in what situation they are.

â€‹

Hm, i think that this can also be happen with Harry, with the difference that she of course trust him and that she might have asked him, but hesitates because of their Partners (if it follows the canon way), but close contact and other intimate scenes is building the tension and the need for release and comfort. It doesnt have to be during the Horcrux hunt, but can be a event that happens when they are older.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

** Have you read Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria? It's Dramione but it has a Hermione escaping her captors and seeking shelter with Malfoy.

I'm not sure whether it's available anywhere still, I think the author turned it into a standalone original novel.

**** It made sense in Goblet of Fire because of the way that they were acting towards each other
