  Draco is a high-end prostitute who hides his identity. Harry unknowingly hires him. And then there is porn, questions about identity, domestic bliss, more porn, and truth as seen through a web of lies. (And then more porn. Seriously, if you don't want sex scene after sex scene you probably shouldn't read this. And please read the warnings.)

  Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living.

  Potter has fame and fortune and posh clothes and all he wants is a simple life. Draco has a flat and a cat and a steady job and all he wants is a complicated life. Which makes you think this story has something exciting like body-swapping, but it doesn't. Instead it has Indian takeaway and a blue jumper and people wanting a whole lot of what they can't have, discovering themselves as they discover each other.

*** Second these suggestions, all great writers. I would also add (from AO3) Frayach, bixgirl1, and aja (for some older, wonderfully written stories).

** Maya wrote some excellent ones, she took them all down but released a pdf you can still find floating around. Drop Dead Gorgeous, specifically, has Harry and Draco as auror partners, and is my favorite of the pairing.

linkao3(4901634) is short and hilarious, Harry takes a photography class to improve his dick-pic game.
