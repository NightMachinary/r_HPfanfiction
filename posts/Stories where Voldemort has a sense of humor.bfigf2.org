** I'm confused, you don't find the tortured screams of mudbloods to be humorous....?

Maybe you're the one without a sense of humor, because Mr. Riddle is a regular comedian!

*** I dunno if we're looking at it like that I see it more of his way of expressing himself, his own art form that he's a master at.

  1.3 million words

Either the writing is super trash, or this person has absolutely nothing else going on in their lives.... Holy shit!

**** I think very few people would still be writing poorly after a million words written; I got through all of it and enjoyed it from the beginning, so I suspect these weren't their first million words.

***** Yeah, you'd think that'd be the case, wouldn't you?

But I've seen people with several million words of fanfiction written that are still as terrible at 5 million words as they were at 5 thousand.

I forget the name, but I remember finding a guy that had written over a dozen million words over a several years and it was all just awful... I was completely flabbergasted. Go figure.

******* Yeah, I think so!

That was one of them, anyway. Another one was writing primarily gay or slash stuff - I can't remember exactly, only that it wasn't hetero from the tags - with even more words than megamatt, with just as awful writing across the board

**** You could probably condense it without losing much of the sense, but still a very good story. I'm still mad it seemed to be abandonned at around half of the last book.

**** Considering it's over a period of 7 years (- however much was prewritten) that's not too ridiculous

***** That's an average of 4,000 words (almost 9 pages) every week of every month of every year, for 7 years. That's still pretty ridiculous, especially for fanfiction

****** Well above average for sure, but certainly manageable within a normal enough life. On some crunch days you can write out that many words in one session!
