Did Remus Lupin actually use any wolf-like terminology in reference to Harry one Books? I see it constantly in fan fiction but it's hard to separate fact from myth at times.


** No. The fandom completely brutalised Remus and Sirius's personalities and always make them do corny stuff like this.

Exactly. In canon, neither of them /do/ corny. In fact, they both seem to have a bit of a hard edge, though Remus hides it unless he needs it (Flight of 7 Potters kill the enemies thing, Shrieking Shack) and Sirius doesn't flaunt it or hide it.

**** It's especially prevalent in wolfstar fan stuff. They make Sirius really camp and bitchy (which, wtf, bit homophobic??) and Remus just horribly drippy and twee (and don't forget the insecurity about his facial scars which are never mentioned in the books!) Wolfstar shippers are worse than Dramione shippers, there, I said it.

It's driving me up the wall because I'm trying to do research for a Remus Lupin fic and all I find on reddit is lots of Lupin bashing and all I find on tumblr is wolfstar cheese.

****** I just find Remus a hard character to write, even though I love him, so I've been looking for in depth insights into his character that smarter people than me have created, or little headcanons (that actually seem plausible), or fan art that doesn't have big scars across his face (harder than you'd think). The Pottermore writings have been really helpful and I've been writing out his dialogue from POA to gain a good sense of the way he speaks, but I still don't feel like I know him very well, which has slowed down my planning a lot. want to do the fic for NaNoWriMo so I'm running out of time!

******* Well, I don't know how much it'll help and I'm not particularly eloquent, but I've always assumed he spent the first several years after Oct. 31, 1981 rather drunk, being a self-loathing werewolf who lost literally all of his actual friends in basically a three day period.

Frankly, his sense of self-worth (more accurately, lack of) pretty much explains everything we see him do. Why does he never track down Harry like some other witches and wizards (Diggle) do? Because he thinks he isn't worthy enough to go see him. It's why Harry was the one who had to first reach out to Remus for Remus to actually say anything about Lily and James. Heck, during Snape's worst memory he obviously wants to speak up about what James/Sirius are doing to Snape, but doesn't want to do anything to risk the only friendships he thinks he will ever have. The whole thing with Tonks? Lack of self-worth.

******** I think that's the crucial part of his personality that so many people miss, especially in Marauder-era fics and wolfstar stuff. He's constantly torn between wanting happiness and deliberately punishing himself.

********* The funny thing is he is completely correct in the general idea when it comes to being careful about both his lycanthropy and letting people know, but he pushes it beyond what is necessary (probably because of his self-loathing/lack of self-worth). People don't treat werewolves well, and werewolves are dangerous, even beyond the full moon (what Greyback does to Bill, for example). But not all people are going to treat werewolves poorly, and outside the full moon their danger is mostly by choice/action, not mere existence.

********** I think this is something I'm going to explore further in my fic, which will not be about his school days but about his time in the Order until Oct. 1981 (it will be the first of a 3 part series). Remus is right that Harry only sees him around people from the Order, so I want to show that for Remus all this self-hatred and immediate assumption that people are going to treat him like shit must have come from somewhere. I think it's reasonable to assume that his first couple of years out of school he was fairly optimistic about the future - his fear of rejection at school proved to be false to a wild degree, his friends went to extraordinary lengths to accept him. I imagine then, he had allowed himself to hope that others might also accept him, that maybe his father had been overly paranoid trying to keep him hidden away, that though he may never marry or have children, he might be able to hold down a job or at the very least continue having these brilliant friends support him through his transformations. Perhaps this was when Wolfsbane was invented too. The future must have looked, perhaps not bright, but steadily improving. But then, as the war continued and he tried to stand on his own two feet, he was faced with prejudice and discrimination at every turn, he has a series of jobs that eventually turn into unemployment when he can't get good references, Wolfsbane was expensive to buy and difficult/dangerous to make, and then in one fell swoop he loses his entire support network. With Lily, James, Peter and Sirius gone, not only has he lost his closest friends, but there's no need for the Order of the Phoenix anymore. It's disanded, and the only constant thing close to work he's had is over. Because of all this, he ends up pushing his careful management of his condition to the extreme we see later.

*********** So, what you're saying is, I'm going to read this fic you're working on?

It's also a possibility that he faced some discrimination from other people in the Order as well. No person, let alone group, is perfect. Even in a conflict of bigotry vs acceptance.

*************** In all fairness to Snape, I don't know if he was prejudiced against werewolves as a whole, or just still angry about what happened all those years ago when he was nearly eaten by Remus.

Either way, it's not right, but the latter at least gives him some justification.

**************** The reason Sirius was able to lead Snape there was because Snape already suspected Remus was a werewolf, and wanted to prove it - Lily tells him quite sharply that she knows his theory. But yes, I imagine a good portion of it is tied up in his dislike of Remus by association with Sirius and James.

***** I agree completely with this as well. There was a really good write up about Remus in this one subreddit I found called HPrankdown which basically ranks all the HP characters while giving them thorough analyses. I absolutely loved the one for Remus. If you want to check it out, here's the link: [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4fb9ri/remus_lupin/?ref=search_posts]]

  Prompt: What about Lupin? Lupin, who lost everything the night James and Lily died, who forgave Sirius, who died in battle?--When they told him the news about Lily and James, Lupin finished the mission he was on before he went to Godric's Hollow. He stood in front of the Potters' ruined home and fell apart in the cold streets. He picked the pieces up, slowly, over years and years.In the first half hour, he remembered how to breathe. He picked up his composure sometime the next week. He patched together nights of sleep. Sometimes the stitching couldn't hold; sometimes he couldn't pull himself out of bed in the morning.Remus kept picking himself up and patching himself together. Today, he walked by a beautiful woman with long red hair and when she laughed he didn't flinch with sorrow. Today, he made a joke, the kind James would have collapsed at and Sirius would have smirked at. Remus patched himself together, scars and sorrows, kindnesses and chocolate. We are the ways we rebuild ourselves.(a brief, rambling character study of Remus Lupin)
