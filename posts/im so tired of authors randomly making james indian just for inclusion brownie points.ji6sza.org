most of the times its literally just white people doing this for no reason but to make harry biracial or whatever, or they just want to be seen as progressive.

as a brown girl myself: please dont, its unnecessary and weird and i can clearly tell that you've taken all your information from Wikipedia.

that being said...why is it always indian? are they seen as the most exotic? now i genuinely want to know if there is a pakistani james potter floating out there in the fanfiction void LOL

*** It seems to be a big deal on Ao3, though I never saw it at all on ff.net. Im working through the top rated fics on Ao3 right now and atleast 30% of stories have harry as indian. No explanation or AU reason, just characters mentioning "his brown skin" and nothing else changing because of it. Sometimes a throwaway line is used to mention his family actually being from india and then its forgotten.

Did read one fic where bloodlines were intergral to the plot and his ancestors were from India.

He puts his thumb in his ear and his pinkie next to his mouth and mutters for a few moments. ‚ÄúMy apologies. I had to take that call. American technology is so advanced I have a cellphone implanted in my hand. There's a microphone in my pinkie, a speaker in my thumb and I can make calls by wiggling my fingers.‚Äù

Play resumes. A few holes later the Japanese man sprints into a clump of bushes beside the green. The others wait for a moment and then decide to investigate.

*** I fully agree with that. They never would have taught him a thing.

I've written a series where Harry is Indian and, though there are several other tropes that are major players in the series and definitely aren't for everyone, it is an important feature and connection to the Potters. That the Potters held on to that part of their history is something that makes them the Potters, so Harry spends a fair amount of the story learning about his culture. It's a bit slow developing, but it starts when he's 11 and I've only gotten to midway through third year, and he still has to learn about the Wizarding world, too, so I'm giving myself an out, there.

As someone who is white, I spend a fairly hefty amount of time for that fic doing research. I include the information I found and why I had Harry do/wear a certain thing in my notes and always include the disclaimer that if I got something wrong, I'd appreciate it being pointed out to me so I can correct it. I, personally, have no link to Indian culture and no one in my life who does, either, so I'm trying to be as accurate and polite about it as possible. I want it to be a part of his story and eventually a part of Harry, but I don't want it to be something that overwhelms the story in a distracting way.

Sorry for the self plug, but: the series is From the Dungeons beginning with From the Cupboard on AO3. My disclaimers are: this is a Slytherin!Harry fic including politics, Harry as the Lord of, like, six houses (mostly for comedy and ridiculousness), and Harry as Headmaster (see above).

** Why Indian? Idk. Why Daphne Greengrass? I think it probably developed like any trope: someone wrote an Indian James Potter at some point, people read it and liked the idea, so they used it themselves, and it spread within a subsection of the fandom, so the idea of an Indian James Potter becomes widespread and unsurprising if incorporated.

While POC James isn't /literally/ always Indian, he practically is. I've seen a whole one fic with a black James Potter. That's part of why I think it's a trope/headcanon that people see used and use themselves, rather than authors just including a POC character to "be seen as progressive." I think we'd see a lot more diversity if that was the case.

I'm a firm believer that tropes in general aren't inherently bad or uncreative. I'm also a firm believer that there shouldn't need to be a /reason/ for a character to be a certain ethnicity, or for an author to make a change to canon. But whether a character's ethnicity being changed (or just not assumed to be white; is James's race explicitly stated in the text of the books?) being a /trope/ is a good or bad thing...I don't feel qualified to answer.

As for the shit research? At least in the case of white US authors, I'm not surprised, considering our typical level of education about and interest in literally anyone besides white people in America. That sucks. I'm sorry.

This is such a fine line to walk, IMO. I'm white but a woman and LGBTQ, and I never want to read about anti-gay rhetoric, bigotry, or violence. I also never want to read about sexual violence against women (or men, but I relate to that far less, for obvious reasons). I /know/ that these things exist in the real world, to a frightening degree. I don't want to read about them or watch them happen on tv in my spare time, I just don't - especially in fic, where these things often aren't written with the most care.

So I can 1000% understand other people not wanting to include racial violence in their fics, esp when all signs point to very little or no racism in the wizarding world in canon. There is a good argument that this is erasure of an important part of being a nonwhite or non cishet person, though.

***** The thing is, it feels like erasure to have characters (especially POC muggleborn characters) be dealing with bigotry in the wizarding world and not bring in their experiences outside the wizatding world. It doesn't have to be violence, but like -- do we really think a black Hermione would have been unaware of bigotry and slurs, etc until she came to Hogwarts. If you want to write a POC character and have a plot that interacts with these themes, you have to do the work. Not just let the characterization be skin deep.

***** I do understand that you want to be free of all those worries when you go to your hobby and relax to read fanfiction. And really, to be more nuanced, it's a case-on-case basis.

There's fanfiction with no bigotry and everything is perfect (at least on that part), and I'm fine with it. I

There's other fanfictions where it doesn't feel right. The story and the characterization didn't fit in a world with 0 bigotry. Especially when author use characters to make some needed points. But how a character would be so (rightfully) angry about racism in a world where racism doesn't exist ?

Unfortunately, I encounter more of the second kind than the first. And this is why as a whole, I don't like the genre/trope or whatever you want to call it. Of course there's gems. Bigotery-free fanfictions that avoid to have their characters influenced by being victims of racism. And some with bigotry that impact the characters.

** Boy, I sure do love when race and gender are brought up on this sub!

In my experience I've seen it stemming from the headcanon (prior to Pottermore releasing etc.) that 'Potter' could be an Anglicisation of 'Patar', as well as the fact that British Indians are one of the largest minority ethnic groups in the UK. Iirc it also cropped up in some stories as an explanation for why the Dursleys were /actually/ embarrassed by and ashamed of Harry and why there were no pictures of him in the house/why Petunia was ashamed of Lily, for marrying 'outside of normality but also /outside her race/.

Since the headcanon first came up, this spurred a lot of fanart, and since then JKR (before her latest turn to extremity), who was still broadly popular with fans, openly came out in favor of colorblind casting with the casting of a black actress as Hermione in the Cursed Child play, and as such her kids being biracial.

That along with the fact there's no concrete evidence in the books of Harry being a white child; along with people in general liking to imagine diversity into books where it's not there, especially in the fanfiction community (this was literally one of the key purposes and appeals of fanfiction back in the day, when published fiction was limited in what could be shown by gatekeeping publishers), led to the creation of a lot more stories and fanworks (art, poems etc.) in which that was Harry's background.

As with many things in fanfiction and fanon in general, when something becomes popular it cascades out to inspire a lot of supporting works. This is just one way that one person, or a group of people's headcanons went, and others were inspired by it. I don't really agree with you, OP, that authors are going out of their way to artificially insert a brown character into their works that they are doing for free, for their own entertainment and the entertainment of others, in order to do some virtue signalling or whatever. I can see where you might be reading that in, because it is done in a lot of media where there's profit involved etc., but I can't personally see the benefit here for authors and so I think it's more likely to be innocent, or to come from authors who have joined the fandom through a path in which they thought that portrayal was the default.

*** 100% agree with you, and your understanding of fanon history aligns with what I've heard and seen from tumblr communities etc as well.

To add, I think it also caught on more in the fan art domain because there, it IS a conscious choice to decide what colour and tone to paint someone's skin. And I appreciate that artists, when confronted with that choice in literally every work they produce, do take a step back and think hold on, why is the usual range of skin tones so limited? Was this ever stated in Canon, or has everyone just been assuming? The ‚Äúdefault‚Äù colour being a white-presenting skin tone is harmful in itself, and it's good people who most directly interact with that have also been critical of such assumptions.

It's understandable of course that we're having a different discussion now about whether it's okay to port over those lines of questioning to fanfic, and whether doing so dilutes the intention behind fan artists making Harry not-white because it may be less an active subversive choice and more an instance of tokenism or virtue signalling.

That's a weird one.

Firstly, in my personal experience, the Anglicisation of Indian names just isn't a Thing.

Secondly, the Anglicisation of immigrant names is, in my experience, probably better called the Americanisation of names.

Thirdly, it was very difficult to find evidence counter to my anecdotes. It doesn't seem commonplace.Don't get me wrong... it's out there but it doesn't seem common.

Fourthly, you'd think it'd come up in a series about a character obsessed with his father, with relatives (and relative adjacent characters, i.e. Marge) that appear to take every opportunity to belittle Harry's parents /and/ where some of the very, very few pupils Harry deigns to notice are (of) Indian (extraction) that Harry's background is mixed. Also, I'd personally go as far as to argue that canon is at pains to point out skin colours and other markers of difference.

If "Patar" is really how this began, it's strange. But, then again, I must admit I thought this was basically a fanart exclusive trope whereas apparently it's common in fanfiction too.

Similarly, Romanisation (the conversion of words from non Latin to Latin scripts) /isn't/ the same as Anglicisation.

**** So, I think this may partly be a difference between editions causing our different views. The books I originally read actively didn't point out race, whereas the US editions took pains to specify that e.g. Angelina and Dean were Black children. (I actually headcanoned Angelina otherwise as a kid!)

Similarly on Anglicisation vs Americanisation - the American settlers were the same group of colonisers with the same approach. Anglicizing things in other languages or assigning new names was endemic in the British empire - and likewise for other empires, to own and standardize. Some examples of Indian names specifically on wiki: [[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_surnames_from_India]]. Anglicization would include bringing nonstandard spellings down to one single standard. For a prominent and well-known example...the characters from the Bible. 'Mary' and 'Joseph' weren't running around on the other side of the planet from Europe 2k years ago; those are revisionings of their names to suit an English-language audience.

Fair point about Marge, but my intention was to explain the history, rather than to passionately advocate for it. In my view the entire appeal of fanfiction is that there is no 'one truth', and everything's up for interpretation. Maybe Marge was herself dating a POC and so had a single exception in her prejudice box. Maybe the Dursleys had an Indian or South Asian relative and Vernon didn't know, or knew and was ashamed, which manifested in him as prejudice and not in Marge. Etc. Once we get into hypotheticals which are up for explanation either way, you really can go all out with where you take how it's explained, without necessarily contradicting canon where it itself hasn't specified.

Which kinda brings me to the main thrust that as others have mentioned in the thread, the driving force behind fanfiction for a lot of authors is 'filling in the blanks', or exploring 'what if'. For an increasing number of people, that what if is questioning /why/ so many characters in so much of what we consume are not-white, or not-majority, /only/ when it's directly relevant to the story, or as a token character. And the entry point is 'what if' that wasn't the case - because it has no need to be. And especially in fandoms like this where there's not much new canon info coming - and where the creator is in hot water - I think as a fresh approach that has a lot of appeal.

Are you serious?

The Anglicisation of immigrant names is a massive trope (with surprisingly limited evidence) of immigration to the United States. The association is very real... in a way that isn't for immigration to the UK... even if the factual basis is murkier.

If you want to look at an Anglicisation of "Patar" becoming "Potter" as a likely origin of the Indian James Hypothesis, it'd be useful if it could be established that this kind of Anglicisation (i.e. for Indian names of Indian immigrants to the UK) was common. It isn't. It barely even appears to be rare. The wider concept (Anglicising immigrant names for British immigrants) similarly doesn't appear to be common. There's even limited evidence of the Anglicisation of Indian names for people (cf places) under Company Rule and the Raj. Hence:

#+begin_quote

[[https://engrave.in/blog/naming-matters-indian-surnames-starting-with-b-and-their-meanings/][On this computer you also find this.]] Notice how none of these are about /immigration/?

Now... what happens when you try to see where the idea of Anglicising immigrant names comes up? Well, firstly, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation_of_names#Immigration_to_English-speaking_countries][you get Wikipedia.]] What do we notice? Bach and a reference to the UK... before the article immediately talks about the US. And it's only Bach and that US context which have citations. The rest of the links that come up here are, again, mostly centred in the US (and Canada, interestingly enough). I'd also argue there's a bias towards first names which is a completely different story (just ask our friend Bach).

You're too lazy to do any work yourself, that's the only problem here.

** I doubt anyone is getting inclusion brownie points for making any character in Harry Potter a different race considering the amount of hate I always see in the comments of a POC!Harry or POC!Hermione fic. I know of one writer that explicitly makes Hermione black and the writer is black themselves, I believe that this is the case for most writers that give the characters a non-white background to be honest. Just a wish to support their own communities in the little way they can. I've seen Harry being black, indian, pakistani, bengali and chinese so indian is definitely not the default background.

I would love to see some more care around writing of course, but to dismiss real brown writers with stereotyping is dangerous considering they're most likely drawing from lived experience. I am a terrible writer so I am still waiting for someone to write a fic centered around Beauxbatons that doesn't have just blonde white girls as their students (considering my background is from one of the plethora of countries that France has colonized). I would love to see a shift away from eurocentricism anyway and have other forms of magic be the focus in a story. Even how colonialism played a role in international wizarding relations. Or how the divide of dark magic and light magic is cultural and maybe how certain forms of magic are more prized in other places. Even about other genealogical abilities, like parseltongue in Britain.

This!! Inverarity did an incredible job with his Alexandra Quick series in creating a believable American society of wizards. He included a history of Native American wizards as well, and several ethnic communities known to live in America in the muggle world.

I really feel that this is something the original Harry Potter lacks.\\
Setting a fic in a different country or exploring international relationships would be a great opportunity to explore new and layered topics.

There are a few ethnically black, Chinese and Indian purebloods in Britain during Harry Potters time, but nothing is explained about their heritage at all.

Is it the same as the muggle world? Is it different in that it never got colonised? What are the magical creatures like there? I'd picture it as one of them being an explorer and meeting the other, having adventures and falling in love.

** Some people think that the colorful lights James makes for Harry that we see from the window from Voldemort's perspective in Deathly Hallows could be celebrating Diwali (the Diwali date in 1981 is October 27, it's feasible) and there's an idea that maybe Parseltongue is a family trait based off the snake charmer stereotype. I know the stereotype is untrue and often offensive but it's still a stereotype that a lot of people buy into. Also, India was imperialized by Britain and it wouldn't be unreasonable for an Indian family to have moved to Britain during that time.

I don't buy into it, but that's some of the biggest reasons behind James specifically being Indian.

I do like to imagine that Harry is biracial for a few reasons, but not necessarily Indian, but also I am white so I write Harry as white because I don't want to disrespect a culture that is not my own, intentional or not, so I play on the safe side and don't touch what isn't mine.

And the Parseltongue thing could work, even though that would also involve Slytherins and possibly Voldemort himself also being embedded in Indian culture hmmm.....

Can't speak for other people, but as an Asian (though not specifically South Asian) person myself, I would welcome people to write about my culture or include characters from my culture even if the author does not have personal experience, as long as it's done respectfully and with research. There are always alternatives such as mirroring your own uncertainty through how a white character interacts and stumbles around how to not say the wrong thing to a POC character, or looking for beta readers who can better represent that community and make sure you're being accurate and non-offensive. There's just too much of a fight for representation to say writers can only write about their own cultures, otherwise we'd get far far less representation in books and fictional worlds while we're still fighting for our dues IRL.

** I have a version of James in my head who is partially Chinese. I had fun imagining Fleamont and Euphemia (maiden name, Euphemia Lau) bumming around Singapore in the 30s, so I ran with it. I'm not so attached to the idea that I can't write him any other way - I can and have written him differently - but I enjoy playing with it.

The British Empire was so big, for so long...they had half the world at one point, and it's fun imagining what wizards might have done in it or how they interacted with it. Whether that's a wizarding enclave in Hong Kong or Singapore, or Anglo-Indian Ministry attach√© shenanigans in the Raj government before independence/partition, or a witness to the Balfour thing in the Middle East...

That's fun. It makes the world feel a bit bigger, and I like that.

**** I originally settled on Euphemia being born in Singapore (Fleamont is solidly English stock, the Potters have been in England *forever*) because the two of them are about the right age for the Second World War. They were on the older side when James was born in the late 50s/early 60s, so imagining twenty years before works out. The fall of Singapore in 1942 marked a sudden, abrupt collapse of what had, until then, seemed like an unassailable British fortress in the East. Rock solid, until it suddenly wasn't.

I know wizards generally ignore whatever the Muggles are up to, but I'm not sure even wizards are insular enough to ignore a *literal invading army*!

How would the British ministry have coped with the collapse of British presence there in general, a hurried evacuation which they'd somehow have to get any resident British wizards into without letting on they were wizards (a white dude left behind in Singapore would not have a good time after that, wizard or no) or all the rest of it?

That's *fascinating*. So I imagined someone there to see it.

Singapore has always been a melting pot.

When it all went to hell and the British government (including the magical department thereof) noped out, some of those connections likely proved useful.

My James can swear fluently in Hokkien. The rest of his language skills are nowhere near as good, but he can throw glorious insults in the certain and happy knowledge that no one understands him when he does it and it drives whoever he's swearing at batshit crazy.

It's also why he (and therefore Harry) would have what Jo described as ‚Äújet black‚Äù hair - true black hair is pretty rare in Anglos, so James's hair got his father's mess but his mother's colour.

Which is to say... there were periods where different polities were in ascendancy, with fluctuating sizes and various predecessor states before the East India Company took over (and was then relieved of command after the Mutiny and thus began the Raj).

But the simple answer is... yes, that is correct. Partition and Independence happened in the 1940s.

I don't mind it too much as a bit of backstory, and it gives a bit of spin on James that's somewhat novel, but when it starts getting into the wikipedia knowledge of India it gets irritating. I feel like I've seen one or two Pakistani-Fem!Harry, where she wore a headscarf, but I found those annoying, TBH, because you know there's no way in hell the Dursley's are going to tolerate someone wearing a headscarf under their roof, and it felt like the authors were inserting this heritage without thinking about how it would actually work in the setting.

All in all, I still find it less grating than when fics go whole-horse tokenism and make *everyone* some kind of minority.

Like that, if you are going to write about a person from another race, then won't it be nice to actually speak to people who are a part of that race or maybe do proper research on them -whether it be for a fan fiction or an essay-?

In fact, when my country was invaded by the British, they forced the Indian soldiers to use Enfield rifles, whose cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat which cause an uproar in the Hindu and Muslim communities since cow is sacred and pig is dirty. This was also the immediate cause for the revolt of 1857. So, yes, a Hindu Harry eating beef is insulting and you cannot convince me otherwise.

My assumption is that this is much less a matter of forced inclusivity (which I agree is bad), but more of a general fanon thing that some adopt. Maybe there was once a really popular fic that had this, and others adopted it into their own headcanon, ultimately affecting things they write? Of course, it's entirely possible that the /original/ source material for this idea did it for the purpose of forced inclusivity, but I highly doubt others that took after it did the same.

I think a better approach to this is to, instead of complaining about it on Reddit (which is unlikely to have much of an effect), add comments on the fics themselves explaining your issues with the portrayal. I don't think authors mean anything bad with it, they're just lacking in knowledge.

In the Harry Potter series, the fact that Harry is canonically white is not intrinsic to his character.

As for why Indian, it's several things. One is that people with Indian (and the parts of Asia in the vicinity of India) ancestry are a visible minority in the UK, with an estimated little over 4% of the population. To put that in perspective for those the USA, the percentage of Black people in the US is estimated be around 13%, which is about three times larger than 4%.

Another is that many authors like to bring more diversity to their stories. There's nothing wrong with this as long as, as I said before, they don't try to claim that a character in canon is indubitably a specific race without clear textual evidence. Someone interpreting a character in a different way is totally fine, and believe me, Harry Potter fandom would be much more stuffy without the wonderful deluge of headcanons that people like to share.

The inhumane conditions of 19th century Britain were almost universal unless you were rich. And given that England had overseas possessions for centuries, is certainly possible for his family to have been in Britain for generations.

What's a little confusing about this whole thing is that the shacklebolts are considered part of the 28, meaning that they have been around for longer than the SoS or Britains overseas possessions, so my best guess would be that his family originally came from the Moorish lands and ended up in England through Aquitaine.

#+end_quote

Shoehorning: "to force to be included or admitted"

No force required here, move along.

"Random schoolyard insults" are seldom random, actually. Whether those children are magical or otherwise, schoolyard insults are intended to be offensive, and are usually reference to aspects of another person's appearance, especially if it's something out of the norm.

Hair styles and textures of Afro-Caribbean people are often singled out for ridicule by some white Brits, for disparaging remarks, fetishisation, or just as a "difference".

It's very clear to anyone who ever went to a multi-racial school (in the UK) that Pansy is mocking Angelina's hair, which is almost certainly styled in a way that suits her hair, but gives the appearance of distinct cords (e.g. braids, corn rows, dreadlocks), which Pansy so derisively calls "worms".

I have explained this as clearly as it is possible to, and any further argument that there is no racial element to Pansy's insults is clearly an argument made in bad faith to try and dismiss casual racism, or its existence in the UK. Therefore, I will not engage any further with this.

Edited to add: a sadly necessary "some", to avoid further ridiculousness.

But there is the argument that we actually don't know hardly anything about the makeup of wizarding Britain, the international links, movement of wizards around the world, magical Britain's links to colonialism and the British empire etc., because JKR never details it.

It's thus an assumption that just because the majority of muggle Britain in the 1980s and 90s was white, that the wizarding Britain would be the same.

For a community of people where teleportation is routine and commonplace, and where explicitly the only social divides come from blood quality, rather than skin color, it's not too out of the ordinary that a lot of migration between countries may have taken place. The fact that Pureblood wizards openly look down on muggles, to me only supports the idea that wizards would be unlikely to be racist.

For another example, the Weasleys have no issue with Fred (and then George) dating a black woman, although they show other prejudices through the series.

This is commonplace in their society (e.g. 'muggle studies' being seen as a joke subject, muggle inferiority and 'wackiness' assumed, although muggle/born magicals/ are accepted as fine and not troubling by magnanimous Purebloods like themselves) and reflected in how they have no issue with assault of muggles (Dudley's tongue, memory charms) if done for what they see as 'justified' reasons rather than just for wizard entertainment.

The Weasleys also canonically have a Squib cousin who they don't talk about and who we never see invited to family events or referenced. Additionally, one could make the argument that the Weasleys are prejudiced against all Slytherins, based on some bad experiences the family has had with certain Slytherins.

I broadly agree with some of the comments here that fics having Harry to be Indian feel tokenistic rather than a genuine in-depth attempt at representation. But there is an argument to be made about normalisation of non-white skin colours that suggest it could be good to mention Harry having darker skin in passing even if not as a main plot point (it would be awful if the only time Harry is presumed to be not-white is for plot services, people's ethnicities are not just a convenient plot device). But this discussion should not be premised on whether the cast and characters have traditionally been white, because then the norm of ‚Äúof course someone is white unless explicitly stated otherwise just ends up exoticising non-white skin tones more.

Just as it is reasonable that fanon sometimes plays with characters' sexualities. These are traits not explicitly stated in the novels, and yet can be deeply personal and important to a character's motivation (even if just in a fic rather than in canon as a whole).

The parent comment was about the plausibility of a non-white British main character. My point is that just because this character was traditionally portrayed by white actors does not mean it can be assumed.

Btw thanks for pointing to the 2011 census stats! It's true that it's not a huge population of Indians and South Asians in the UK, percentage wise. The New Statesman does a deeper dive that suggests the population tends to be geographically concentrated, which probably explains why I'm over-estimating based on coming from a more ethnically diverse city in the UK.

** I /think/ making Harry Indian was based on an off-hand comment by J.K. Rowling, where she said something along the lines of "Harry's background was mostly meant as a blank slate, you can give him Indian heritage if that's what you identify with as a reader". Can't find the quote anymore, though, so I'm not entirely sure.

This would have obviously been before Pottermore and associated lore-dumps fleshed things out a lot (sometimes unnecessarily or poorly so - hello wizards shitting on the floor and Vanishing the evidence).

I'm indian too and I can't tell you how much I would've loved to have international books with Indian protagonists growing up, but shoehorning my entire culture into a place and character it doesn't belong for the ‚Äúwoke points‚Äù is cringeworthy. To clarify - I don't have any issues with the character being portrayed by a Desi actor on stage for example - thats just who is best for the role and that's great. But that doesn't make the character indian. That's also how I feel about black Hermione, but I'm not sure if that should be something I can be outraged about because it's not my culture being co-opted and I don't know the nuances. But cmon.

Black Hermione and House Elf rights is actually what I'd usually consider an example of poor writing, because it shows very heavy-handed Americanisms and a lack of research. Historically, Britain hasn't had a huge amount of racism against blacks, especially not the kind that US faces. I'm not saying that there isn't any, there certainly has been a hatred against Afro-Carribeans in particular since the 1950s, but that shared connection to slavery is much weaker. To justify Hermione's empathy with House Elves as a result of being black seems very tenuous, I think her just being a naturally moral person is much better writing.

***** I don't want to dismiss your experience and perspective on British POC cultures, especially because I'm not necessarily the expert here and I've just spent a short few years in London (which I admit is more diverse and multicultural than the rest of the UK). So I'm happy to agree to disagree here, and don't mean to be combative üòÖ

However, from my experience with black and biracial friends (and maybe this is a skewed sample size here lol), I have seen a lot of concern and community mobilisation against racism in the UK, and specifically a lot of revival of Black history (including Black History Month which was a big thing in Uni). There's tons of community solidarity and affirmative action with regards to the BME/BAME communities (Black and Minority Ethnicities, and Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnicities respectively).

I defo agree with you it can be lazy writing to have Hermione's primary motivation behind the House Elves issue to come from her racial background. 100%! People can be such complex and moral beings, and I'd far prefer an exploration into Hermione's own character and morals, rather than just generalise on the basis of colour. That said, I do think IRL that minority communities can /sometimes/ be more primed to notice or read into such situations, and perhaps it might provide context for why Hermione even as a young child so quickly jumps to the conclusion that this is really terrible oppression regardless of what the Elves themselves say. I just wish authors would use this to add to the richness of her background and perspective, rather than use lazy generalisations to simplify and dilute her character.

Good discussion though, sorry this got too long! I'm having a lot of fun dissecting this up and down the thread haha.

It would be one thing if Harry were described as a stereotypical indian despite living in england all his life, but the fact that you're offended by stories that just... change that single fact is concerning.

Like, humanity aren't just all white people with a few underprivileged minorities present in the background. It might seem like that in american and european media, but that's not actually what populations are like, in britain especially, on account of the former british empire.

Then have them meet with one visiting a post over there or something. I'm not saying it's the best way to do it but that it's a plausible reason for them having that sort of name.

** I have definitely seen fics where James is Pakistani. I've seen fics where he was Iranian as well. Personally, I enjoy fics where James, and therefore Harry, are POC, but only if the author actually includes struggles that POC face. Otherwise it's just ‚Äúfor inclusion brownie points‚Äù like you said.

** Why do characters need a reason to be a certain race? It's fanfiction. It doesn't have to be canon, and people can do whatever they want with the characters, that's the beauty. If people want to see the characters as a certain race, that's their vision.

*** "Yes, it's nice to be 'progressive' and 'inclusive'. Good on them. But it's annoying when it becomes forced and spills over into sensationalism -- which often leads to what people eventually call Social Justice Warriors (SJW).

There's also a fine line between being genuinely inclusive/progressive and just doing it for 'brownie points' as you said, or using different ethnicities, etc. as token characters to attract attention.

Some people might even accuse others of using progressivism and inclusivity to shield the work from criticism (this extends beyond fanfiction), as it may allow the defenders to hurl slurs like 'racist', 'sexist', 'misogynist', etc. at the critic."

** Some of it is definitely the large presence of brown Asians in the UK, along with a very loose understanding of British colonialism lol. I don't necessarily mind it, I did a whole improv explanation on why Ferdinand Kingsley was my fancast for a post-war movie. I /would/ think it was a little weird if they dropped in that Harry was a little bit Chinese and then continuing on with their story so I get your trepidation. I would also hasten to say that it's not cool to say it's just for brownie points. Most fanfiction is self-insert, after all, so it's likely brown/part-brown authors/artists folding it in after basically giving the go-ahead after black Hermione.

That being said, I think I've only ever seen it in fanart and I haven't come across Pakistani Harry yet lol.

** I haven't come across it in fanfic only art. But I do remember this headcanon getting big on Tumblr. Indian was just because Britain happens to have a large Indian population. Idk if the person who made that headcanon was Indian or not. But tbh apart from maybe when he's with the Durselys it changes 0% of the story if James was Indian for the fancomics ive seen. So I mean its fine by me. I'd be more frustrated if I saw them include Indian stereotypes to be like look I did a Indian character guys ( am also indian)

** Or you could just not read it. There are 825k HP fanfics on fanfiction.com alone, I don't believe there are more than 1000 where James Potter is Indian. Why complain about fanfics that can easily be ignored? If some people want to be more included let them be.

I don't care about Indian James one way or another, but I find it silly to complain about the existence of such a niche trope.

**** Honestly, I don't feel like I'm being a jerk. Asking for writers to stop making James Indian is the same thing as asking writers to stop making Harry gay or female in my eyes. It doesn't really affect the plot so there are little things to criticize beyond that it isn't or can't be cannon.

***** To take your example and frame it as OP is criticizing - it's not a bad thing to make Harry gay, but it WOULD be bad to make the gay characterization of Harry wear a mesh shirt everywhere, talk with a lisp, make limp-wristed gestures, and act out a bunch of gay stereotypes.
