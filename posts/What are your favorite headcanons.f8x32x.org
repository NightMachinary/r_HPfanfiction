** Scrimgeour Obliviated himself when Voldemort confronted him. Voldemort in DH was able to get the whereabouts of the Elder Wand by using the Cruciatus and Legilimancy on Grindelwald. Scrimgeour likely knew he was a target for Voldemort so he wiped his own memories so that he couldn't give up any intelligence/break under torture. Because if Voldemort can get information from Grindelwald, then he can from Scrimgeour as well by using torture

** - The curse on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position at Hogwarts that was imposed by Voldemort is based on the insult of his being denied the position. It makes all those teaching Defence at the school to face their worst fears in order to prove that they are a better candidate than Tom Riddle was.

- Dumbledore was in error about how Tom Riddle arranged to kill his muggle family: in order to work around the Trace, he Imperiused Morfin Gaunt to go up to the manor and kill the muggles. By using the Imperius in the Gaunt's shack, nothing was reported to the Ministry, and Morfin's act of doing the murders was evident in his memories, even if he couldn't say why he decided to do so. After returning to the Shack, Morfin's memory of Tom's visit was erased.

- Wands are designed to translate a form of Latin into a way of enacting spells at the 'assembly language' level. They are semi-sentient and able to translate new spells based upon the library of known spells and the regimentation of Latin meanings.

  ‘Though if his school marks don't pick up,' said Mr Malfoy, more coldly still, ‘that may indeed be all he is fit for.'

  ‘It's not my fault,' retorted Draco. ‘The teachers all have favourites, that Hermione Granger --'

  ‘I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,' snapped Mr Malfoy.
#+end_quote

Second behind Hermione who managed to get 112% in an exam is not marks that need picking up. Yes, Lucius Malfoy would still make that second comment about Hermione beating him in every exam, but that doesn't account for the first comment. Also 'the teachers /all/ have favourites' implies that there are other students who are the teacher's favourites as well as Hermione. Lucius cuts him off before he can mention any others.

There is also this from slightly earlier in the scene.

#+begin_quote
  ‘What's the good of that if I'm not in the house team?' said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. ‘Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead ...'

  Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.

  ‘... everyone thinks he's so /smart/, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick --'
#+end_quote

In his litany of complaints right after Harry getting to play Quidditch, Draco says that people think Harry is /smart/. Which is a weird thing for a kid who hates Harry to say immediately following 'he's not good at Quidditch, he's just famous'. Why would Draco Malfoy complain that people think Harry is smart unless there's a reason for that? Could that reason be, in fact, that Harry also beat Draco in overall marks?

I disagree with this, and would argue that Neville was bad at magic due to a combination of poor self-confidence (a by-product of his upbringing by a very overbearing grandmother and extended family), and using a wand that was completely wrong for him. I'd even go so far as to argue that his mother's wand would've been a better, though still suboptimal, choice than his father's was.

******* My theory. We know that Charlie like CoMaC, works in dragon reserve, quidditch player and prefect. So, most likely he was pretty outgoing and care free guy. Ron is also carefree guy, qudditch player and prefect. So their personalities matched.

Other hand, I don't think Augusta tried push magic out of Frank actively. She most likely spoiled him. We know she likes her son and held him at a high regard that she wanted to make Neville a clone of his father.

Neville was most likely traumatised by torture of his parents or by seeing them in hospital and hearing about their condition. And Augusta Longbotton didn't help him in anyway with her overbearing and continued criticism if he didn't matched her expectations. Look how Neville told that he thought he was a squib until his uncle dropped him put of window? So no personality match there.
