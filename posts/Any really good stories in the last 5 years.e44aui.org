Haven't been reading fanfiction lately, and been out of the loop.

Looking for pretty much any well written stories that's been out in the last 5 years.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, or incest, but other then that, pretty much okay with any pairing. Het/Slash/Femslash.

Would rather Harry not be superpowered or too smart. A little bit more smarter or powerful is fine, but not enough to the point where it breaks my belief.

Either completed or regularly updated is fine.

No Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's please, those get very tiring.

Would also rather not have Dark side is actually good, but if it's done in a somewhat believable way that's fine.

Any other kind of story idea is fine.

I know I have a wide range to chose from, from this, but I was curious what some of you really enjoyed in the last 5 years.


** Maybe 'Blackpool' by the Divine Comedian. It's Marauder's era, though, and doesn't have Harry as its main character. It's a believable and dark take on the Black family and reads like a mystery (t-rated) horror story with excellent writing and a dry sense of humour.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Linkffn(11910994)

Hermione/Ron. Ron and Harry get more intense training than usual but nothing completely unrealistic. Voldemort is dark and evil, the Ministry is not dark but goes evil too, Hermione gets into a bad situation and becomes a fugitive from the law. Dumbledore tries to steer the Ministry on a better course while organizing the order. Seamus Finnigan has 'contacts' in Ireland supplying semtex, and that's how you get the title image of Hermione walking away from a massive explosion full of ex Death Eaters.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870119/1/][Narcissa's Chance]] - Thrust back in time Harry wants to destroy Voldemort. Narcissa Black wants a better life than marriage to Lucius. Time Traveling Harry Potter goodness. HP/NM HP/BL unrequited HP/MM

[[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/A_Time_To_Reflect/index/][A Time To Reflect]] - To prevent a Dark Lord from destroying everything, The Almighty sends Harry back in time - not telling him that he was the one she was saving them from in the first place.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12660172/1/][A Life Twice Lived]] - Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters. Fem!Draco

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/][Stepping Back]] - Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7390178/1/][Multiverse]] - Every once in a while, good crack can brighten your day. If you aren't familiar with this one, I'll elucidate. The multiverse is real, as are the gods. In one particular universe, one of the gods sneezed. This resulted in something being horribly missed, and one Manipulative Old Bastard took advantage. Result? Multiversal Armageddon. Rather than fix it themselves, they con a poor schmuck - Uh... Hero... to remedy the problem by going through a multitude of alternate universes to correct the problem enough to start a propagation wave that will counter the problem.

Said schmuck is one of the many Harry James Potters.

They initially denied his request for the only other survivor of his Second Blood War, up until one of his solutions was to have a nuclear missile smack Hogwarts. They didn't care that it was the middle of summer. *At any rate, they reluctantly agreed to have* *Luna Lovegood* *be his Moral Compass.*

The universe was never the same.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]] - A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** I don't really care for Manipulative Dumbledore, those tend to get old, though it often depends on how it's done. So I probably won't check out Multiverse, do any of the others have Manipulative Dumbledore in them?

Thank you for the recs as well.

**** Multiverse is very different to other manipulative Dumbledore fics - nothing is really meant to be serious in it. Obviously you can still skip over it if you want, but I hate manipulative Dumbledore, but I still find that particular one to be hilarious.

** Six Pomegranate Seeds linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds]]) and its ongoing sequel Bouquet of Asphodels linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13267404/1/Bouquet-of-Asphodels]]) are two of my favorites.

Something goes wrong during the Battle of Hogwarts. Quasi-reincarnation fic with good reasons to avoid canon divergence. Instead of a complete canon rehash though we get a different perspective on the series by virtue of the POV not being focused on the core cast. The sequel is completely post series and written in very short chapters that are working to tell a very political story.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

  Hermione Granger wears Cathal Rosier like a flayed skin, unsure which one of them is the puppet. But there is still work to be done and revenge sings a siren call to the survivors of both sides of the Second Wizarding War. If Hermione cannot have her day in court then she will have her season in Hell. *sequel to Six Pomegranate Seeds*
