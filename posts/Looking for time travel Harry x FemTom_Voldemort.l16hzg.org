I've stumbled upon 1Valor1 and ACI100's stories like this, found myself in love while wanting more.


** I'm in the same boat. ACI100 Christmas story was amazing. Sadly I can't provide more stories.

On ffn the filters are trash and on Ao3 I haven't found anything worth mentioning.

Hopefully someone else can help us.

** I read one of ACI100's stories and did not like it at all. Is 1Valor1 better than ACI100?
