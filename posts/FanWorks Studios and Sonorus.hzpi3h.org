Hi, everyone,

I've decided to rebrand FanWorks Studios as the Sacrifices Arc Audiobook Project as that's all I'm doing at the moment. I'm also looking to revive the Sonorus Podcast (a podcast that I believe analyzed the Sacrifices Arc) as a companion show to this, so if anyone could put me in contact with the people who previously ran it, that would be greatly appreciated.

I will be re-recording and re-uploading Chapters 1 and 2 of /Saving Connor/ and deleting /Cauterize/.

Anyone who's interested in joining this project in an editing capacity - it's a big ordeal, and I'll need some help - can comment below.
