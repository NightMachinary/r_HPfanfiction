Looking for a fic where Severus Snape is actually James Potter, in disguise. He has all of Snape's memories. They forced James to do it. They eventually take the spells off, I believe. I am uncertain if Harry is told.

Any help is appreciated ~.

Edit: I apologize for the typo in the title. I didn't realize it until just now. My phone changed it. :/ I sometimes hate autocorrect.

*** I keep it on because it is sometimes useful when I type fast. It's just annoying when it insists that I'm meaning an entirely different word when I mean the word I typed.
