What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4772789/1/][Six Years, Six Applicants]]* by /Sarah1281/? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/][The Crown of Mètis]]* by /Megii of Mysteri OusStranger/. It's a short Voldemort-centered retelling of how he got the Diadem of Ravenclaw.

Hope you enjoy!

** It wasn't my favorite story, a silly take on the flaws from Snape's point of view. Well a Snape that wants to be DADA teacher, really badly. Instead of trying to get rid of himself with the curse.

The story has a few Meta moments where Dumbledore calls Snape out on only complaining when he applied for the position. I liked the concept, but the execution could have been more fluid.

I did really enjoy the idea that Dumbledore is neither extremely incompetent nor all that manipulative. But just having to deal with what comes, and refusing to let Severus leave, and just being kind of lazy.

A more mortal version of him in a fiction is always appreciated.

An interesting bit that wasn't really brought up, is the Snape could have been trying to save Remus' life by revealing he was a werewolf. But that kind of reasoning is less funny.

In the end I smiled enough times while reading to make it worth it. Thanks for sharing

** I thought it was lighthearted and funny, but not ridiculous. I have read it two times and I liked it.

** It's a classic Sarah1281 fic. Ooc, but in a humorous way. It's not my favorite of hers by far, but I enjoyed it.

** Honestly I think its OOC. Snape really only applied for the position as a cover story for Voldemort. I don't think he would be too upset if he was turned down. His true passion has always been potions and I don't see him wanting to leave his brewing. I also don't see Albus casually disregarding Snape like that, their canon relationship was far from disrespectful.

*** I seem to recall that Snape really wanted the DADA position and didn't apply for it just to maintain his cover as a spy.

(But gah... I'd have to reread the original books to back this up... Reading fanfiction can make things confusing.)

Anyway, it's only in fanfiction where the Mastery in Potions idea was invented. My impression of Snape from the books was that Potions was something he was extremely good at but his true passion was the Dark Arts.

*** Well, there's also the popular interpretation that Snape wanted to be the Defence Professor so the curse would get him. The idea being that it was Dumbledore who forced him to stay at Hogwarts, and he'd rather live in quiet obscurity, with the Curse being a way to ensure he'd be out of Hogwarts by the end of the year.

** It's not funny enough for me to take it as a crack fic, and thereby excusing the horrible way that the characters aren't coming off as themselves. It's not serious enough for me to read it as a straight up fic in itself. Instead, it seems to be a meditation on the plot holes that the author saw in the original series, and I can honestly say that slogging through chapter one was bad enough, but chapter two took the cake.

"Why haven't you gotten around to removing that curse yer?"

I was rolling my eyes so hard by that point and noped out of the rest of it.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
