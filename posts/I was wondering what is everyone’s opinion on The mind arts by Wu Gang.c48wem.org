Linkffn(The Mind Arts) Personally I love it! I wish there were more fics like this out there and if anyone know any then I'm open to suggestions. It's one of the only fics if read more than once, and I just wish it was finished.


** It's a bit jarring to read that sort of Harry, but I liked it. The fact the author managed to get rid of Hermione without bashing her is, I think, a positive thing.

Dumbledore is setting Harry up as a successor of sorts. Grindelwald plays a nice role. Malachite is a bit cliche though.

*** Yes, I also feel that the super enhanced Death Eater was a bit too unrealistic as well

**** I think the timing of it was a bit off, rather than the act itself. Voldemort enhancing a death eater for a suicide mission seems like classic Voldemort.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
