Hi I was reading a really neat Neville-in-GoT fic called Lion of the Vale and mid read it became 'Unavailable'?\\

I know that it's not finished, but I'd really like to at least read the rest.


** How many chapters did it have? WaybackMachine has a snapshot that was made on Oct 31, 2018. So anything posted after that is not available. But maybe that was all that was ever posted, because at that date there had not been an update since May 2018. Anyway, here you go:

*** It had 10 chapter. Thanks though! This more than doubles the reading I have left of the story. ;)

Edit: Nooo! Bummer, the WaybackMachine only screenshot the first chapter, none of the others. ;(

**** Ah damn, so sorry to get your hopes up. I checked the first chapter and the last chapter. Both were available so I just assumed the rest was snapshot too.
