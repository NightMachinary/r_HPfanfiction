Is there a reasonable possibility that Arthur could fall in love with another woman that showed him greater sympathy and interest in his Muggle passion? Like, some woman that worked with him at the Ministry, or with an actual Muggle woman who knew about the magical community?


** i would read a fic about arthur having a secret second family that are all muggles.

** I really really like linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee) and its sequels. So much so, that I have even written my own try on it (when the last of the series got stuck in one place for a long time) linkao3(18770464).
