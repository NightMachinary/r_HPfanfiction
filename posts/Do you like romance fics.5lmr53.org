** Hello to you!

I first started reading fanfiction in order to read romance stories of characters that I would prefer together. However, as I'm sure you're aware, romance is incredibly difficult to write convincingly whilst maintaining character, so as a result there are fewer purely romantic stories to be recommended as they often devolve into fluffy OOC-ness. If you're a Harmony shipper, you want to see Harry/Hermione, not a caricature of Harry and Hermione saying things that their canon characters wouldn't dream of saying to one another.

To answer your questions, I want from romance fiction what I want from all fiction; I want to be convinced. I want to be taken a hold of by the story you're telling. In order for this to happen, there has to be an intrinsic logic to the story you craft, but at the heart of it all I want to be able to believe what your characters are doing and saying. You can have your characters do whatever you want as long as you can make me believe they would do it.

Just out of curiosity, is there anything you have that we could read?

*** Thank you for this. It pretty much sums up my thoughts on all fandoms... "CONVINCE ME!" I usually don't say that I am a particular 'shipper' becauase I find that I will read anything, ship anything, so long as it is written well and convincingly.

Unfortunately, this finds me in many an awkward situations where I fall in love with some pairings thanks to fanfiction only to find out that only one or two authors actually write them.

** Romance is usually used as a subplot in action/adventure stories. Therefore when it becomes the main plot line, it's easy to understand why some people would find the story less engaging. But the problem with a lot of romance fics is that writers don't make the adjustment. They don't add subplots to the story, so you're left reading about the two characters who appear to live in a vacuum. They rarely have interactions or lives outsides of themselves. And when they do, it's always related to their relationship somehow.

Subplots don't have to be incredibly intricate. They could be simple things like a job or family or other friends. As long as they tie into the story somehow through character development or the main plot, having these subplots will make the story more realistic and engaging. Also, it helps to give you a needed break from the romance which can get a bit nauseating when it's all you read about for 20 straight chapters.

** I do, but only those that don't focus on marriage/engagement, big romantic gestures (jewellery/ring buying), soul-bonds, pregnancy and over-protective fathers... which eliminates a lot in fanfiction (I blame the young age of the mostly female authors).

I have nothing against marriage personally, but I don't understand what it is with some people presenting it as the ultimate expression of love. Especially considering the ever increasing amount of divorces in the real world. If your characters decide to get married just because they are heads over heels (or worse someone got pregnant) I'll just think they're foolish. Oh and 'magical marriages' aren't a solution, they make it so much worse: Being compelled to stay together or to be in love by magic is the most un-romantic thing ever.

Romance is really important and many people forget in their disdain for it that many of the big successes world-wide in storytelling include some kind of heartfelt romance. It's just difficult to do right (and considering the poor baseline of romance in the source material of Harry Potter it's not surprising that most HP romance fanfics frankly just suck)

** Hey! Romance fics are totally the type of thing I like to read, as opposed to the plot-heavy betrayal-conspiracy-timetravel-ancient-magical-core stuff I often see haha. However, I do enjoy longer fics rather than one shots. Here are things I like to see in fics more centered around romance.

- Humor - this is a big one. Just plain fluff can be boring (to me) but including stuff like Ron cracking jokes, Ginny being sarcastic, whatever it may be, makes it much more entertaining.
- Some semblance of a plot - like if it's just X and Y hanging out in their house in a one shot, it's whatever and I'll probably just close the tab. And I do see a lot of these, not just in HP.
- Characters act like themselves - as others have mentioned, this makes it worth reading.

One thing that /can/ be done well but I feel like it's often just made frustrating is when the plot revolves around communication issues. Not like stories like this can never be written, but I am always a little more wary when the plot can be resolved by "just tell them", and there is nothing big (like magical oaths, mental disorders, blackmail, or whatever) getting in the way.

** I like romance, but I hate fluff.

That's why I'm generally not interested in reading about bumbling teenagers looking at each other for 6 months before making a move (which is not romance btw, just author wish fulfillment).

I like adult characters (or adult acting teenagers, although admitelly it's somewhat inorganic) doing adult things; that means if someone wants someone, they approach them, try to attract their interest and generally take steps to get what they want. And if it fails, they move on - at least they tried.

What I don't enjoy is useless fluff, like untold pages listing the potential couple's feelings, their inadequacies, their friends' reaction, the greater social circle reaction and so on. All that stuff can be covered in a few pages, but in romance fics it usually consumes half the story.

Lastly, I know a lot of authors have this idea that if things get sexual, the pairing isn't "pure" or whatever, which is extremely laughable in the real world. You can't have romance without sex.

*** Having kids as a teenager isn't impossible or even uncommon. A story can make this work so long as it is done right. There should be consequences other than a few catty remarks in the hall. Future plans should be changed, relationships should also change. None of the "the Weasleys took care of the baby while the parents went off and did whatever they wanted." While I can easily see friends and family /helping/ that is not the same as "doing all the work while mommy and daddy go continue to do whatever they like."

A baby shouldn't be used as a deus ex machina to both cause and resolve drama. Two characters who are at each other's throats shouldn't put all that aside and become loving parents for the sake of the baby. If they're still in school Dumbledore (or whatever school official you pick) should not rewrite all of the rules to give the couple their own private room and a house elf to watch the baby during classes. The new parents would probably have to leave Hogwarts and pursue the remainder of their studies privately at home. Maybe future careers will be changed, because bills need to get paid and now they can't afford the time Auror training takes. And professional quidditch requires too much time away from home. So if it's a Harry pairing maybe he uses the remaining money from his vault to open a small business instead. Or goes to learn a trade skill.

A baby could actually be an interesting plot point, so long as it wasn't done as a fix-all plot contrivance.

** I like romance stories, I usually avoid stories that are pure romance in fanfiction (Aside from Grow Young With Me, which someone else has already linked.) Why? It is a very rare fanfic author who "gets" how to write romance.

Two bland characters who are now dating and stare happily into each other's eyes saying "I love you more." "No, I love /you/ more." is boring. Soul mates are boring. Settling down right away and popping out babies is boring. Having the relationship mirror Molly and Arthur Weasley (naggy wife, "yes dear" husband) is boring.

If I am going to read a romance I want for it to have spice. I want there to be obstacles that are /not/ trite plot conveniences (an example would be the main conflict between characters should not be childish and irrational jealousy between Ginny and Luna because Luna ate lunch that once with Harry). I want the characters to be attracted to each other for reasons that are /not/ completely based on appearance. Too often you have the guy in the relationship will wax poetic about how beautiful the girl is, and barely ever mentions another positive trait in depth. Is she funny? How so? Smart? Show, don't tell. Caring? Give subtle examples.

I really, really dislike the "Smart girl, dumb guy" dynamic. Like the only way you can make a "good" female character is to have her be smarter than the male partner. And she must make him aware of this at every opportunity by micro-managing every aspect of his life. And when she feels he's done something stupid, she "smacks him upside the head." Admit it, if Ron smacked Hermione upside the head the fandom would be in an uproar, but it's hilarious when Lily does it to James? I want to see two people who are equals, and treated as such.

This is another reason I like the Harry/Draco pairing. So long as it's not one of the bad ones where the author designates one of them as the "girl" in the relationship, you have two characters with personalities that are similar yet different enough that it makes them interesting. And they're /equals/ in the relationship because neither will take shit from the other.

When I read a romance story, I want to feel the love between the characters. Don't tell me that they are in love and leave it at that. Love is more than "I like this person and we never have any significant relationship issues." Love is full of arguments, fights, insults and apologies. Love having jokes that only the two of you find funny. Love is adoring a person's faults as much as you do their positive traits. A romantic relationship should make you feel giddy, annoyed, and a little bit scared sometimes. Love is seeing that your partner has a hilarious birthmark in the shape of a donkey arm wrestling a sasquatch, and telling them you wouldn't change a thing about it. Love is both good and bad, and I want to see all of that.

#+begin_quote
  Do you like romance fics?
#+end_quote

In this fandom? Not particularly, and for a number of reasons.

Most romances tend to take place during Harry's Hogwarts years or just after them. It's hard for me to believe in a romance for the ages when the characters are still getting detentions from Snape.

The over-abundance of younger characters is probably because 1) fleshing out an AU or out-of-Hogwarts fic is more time-consuming to write, and 2) the /Harry Potter/ universe has a continual influx of younger fans ...which also means a lot of inexperienced writers. Writers who do not know how to hit the beats of the genre in all the right places.

#+begin_quote
  what does a romance fic have to include for you to read it
#+end_quote

- Non-canon or rare pairings, probably. Just a personal preference.
- Older characters (as explained above). Mid-twenties and over is ideal.
- Keeping things as in-character as possible, (unless it's an AU -- then I'm more forgiving). Whitewashing flaws makes for boring characters. Snape is ugly, cruel, emotionally damaged and volatile; Malfoy is a spoiled, +Nazi youth+ blood supremacist; Harry bottles his softer emotions and jumps to conclusions without thinking twice; Hermione can be bold to the point of irritating everyone around her since she doesn't know when to quit sometimes, and she's better at reading books than she is people; etc., etc.
- Zero infantilization of characters. This is one of my big problems with m/m fics in this fandom. A lot of it comes from yaoi-trash stereotypes, but similar stuff does crop up in f/m (and, more rarely, f/f). It's creepy and off-putting and I refuse to read it.
- No romanticized abuse. There's enough of that shit in pro romance novels.
- But no extreme fluff either. Those fics are usually no-stakes borefests.
- A writer who knows what they are doing with the genre.

If it sounds like I'm a demanding asshole when it comes to romance, I am. Rightfully so. Romance novels are my day job.

#+begin_quote
  and what do you look for in a Gen (or other genre) story?
#+end_quote

What I like to read -- /ideally/ -- are stories with:

In-character characters who are in their twenties or, at least, characters who sound and think at a level corresponding to their ages (no eleven-year-old talks like that, even if he does find out he was born "Lord" Potter); a writer who knows the convention of the genre in which they are writing; little to no rehashing (please, god, no detailed Diagon Alley shopping trips in first year); some semblance of originality; characters with understandable (but not necessarily likable) needs, wants, motivations, flaws, and virtues.

That all said, I can and do read outside those parameters, both for romance and other genres.

Mostly by accident. Sometimes to see if I still don't like certain pairings.

My favourite romance manga is [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=31270]].

It doesn't have to have an overarching plot for me, slice of life is my favourite, fluff is also fine. Just remember that if you choose fluff, keep it below 50k because there's only so much you can do. If you're going for a huge plot, then longer fics are okay.

I like it along with another genre, but the other one must not be a downer like angst or hurt/comfort. Humour is a must, especially if the overall tone of your story is darker than usual.

** At the best of times I'm iffy on FF romances...they tend to be all the same. I will also never read a short romance without it being recommended the hell out of to me, such as comptemplating clouds. If I go for a romance I want it to be long, so to show character developement. I want it to be realistic, as fights do occasionally happen. I even prefer them to have dated other people before, explicit or implicit is fine.

Most FF romance is a short thing of two characters enter a room, they declared how they always loved each other (50-50 bash of the other big ships for the characters), and then a date/lemon/etc.

/edit/ Also gotta add, any time there is a big misunderstanding that has me shouting "Just fucking talk to each other" pisses me off something furious. Movies love this one.

** I read almost exclusively romance fics (and Harry/Ginny at that) primarily because its the one part of the original series I felt we didn't get enough of. Or more accurately, it was a part of the series that Rowling chose not to focus on for legitimate reasons but I like to explore. I'm a big Hinny shipper so I like to read stories that build up their pairing better than the books and/or focus on their relationship ups and downs after the war as that is a legitimately interesting topic to cover.

I'm a bit schizophrenic with the types of stories I like because they often conflict with my preferred headcanon of how the couple are after the war. While in my head, I prefer the two to live a comfortable life together where they don't ever break up or suffer during their relationship, I actually like stories that have these plotlines.

I don't like fluff or stories where they fall hopelessly in love in a short period of time and are just the perfect couple. That might be nice, but not realistic and not remotely interesting in a story.

I like the idea that the pair are soul mates but not soul bonded. I like that no matter what, they can't help but be drawn to each other and for better or worse, they simply belong together. I like that obstacles will be thrown in their way and they might lose each other in that, but ultimately come back into each others lives and finally realize they are just meant to be.

I don't like that almost every time I read a fic where Ginny or Harry dates someone else, they can't have them get together without turning the significant other into a villain. Honestly, I'm ok with either of them making a tough and perhaps a bit cruel decision to abandon their current significant other to be with each other.

I'm fine with sex in the story but it isn't required either way. I don't like reading about either Harry or Ginny actually being intimate with another character. Since we all read the series from Harry's POV, it weirdly feels like I'm watching an ex-girlfriend hook up with a new boyfriend whenever an author includes a Ginny/Other sex scene. I might get flak for this, but I don't like reading a story where it is referenced that Ginny had sex or got very far with Michael or Dean. I know, in real life, there might be a good chance it happened, but I like to imagine Ginny only did that stuff with Harry. Conversely, I just can't buy it when stories have Harry and Ginny get back together in their mid twenties but both or either are virgins.

That's my ramblings on the subject.

What I like are stories where the romance is a valuable part of the bigger story, meaning I don't mind, or even like the fact that it contains a few romance filler chapters.

- I'm incredibly annoyed by the trope of the asexual, awkward, clueless Harry. Harry is a teenager with a fully functioning hormonal system and dick, not the hottest eunuch Hogwarts has ever seen.

- Teenagers having a clue about sex. Honestly, I'd prefer my romance without sex scenes, but if they have to be in there I just keep rolling my eyes when they sound like a production of Brazzers with wands.

- The reason why they can't be together is some trumped up bash-fic reason. The Weasley love-potioneering, or Dumbledore being manipulative, jadda jadda... We know the protagonists are completely in the right, we only see them yell at everybody else who doesn't agree with them 100% and any and all things they do to the "evil Weasles and Dumbledork" are completely fine, even if they amount to murder, rape and permanent disfiguration... because they're the bad guys standing between tru wuv. /Wuagh.../

Three things I love:

- Something in the story makes me root for the protagonist(s). It may be their characters or the challenges they have to overcome to be together and these challenges have true substance. That may be a very intimate Harry and Hermione story where they work on their, arguably, stunted social skills. That may be a Harry and Tonks fic where Harry must deal with filling the void Remus left. That may be a Harry and Bellatrix fic as they meet in Azkaban and have to deal with each others impacts on their past. Anything, as long as the story makes me root for them.

- The protagonists don't fit together flawlessly. People have mistakes, bad traits - imperfections. To learn of a stain in a human's soul and still finding them beautiful within and without makes for a very relatable relationship.

- Thats a very subjective thing, but I also love pairings that truly surprise the people of Hogwarts. There are decidedly too little Harry/Luna fics out there, and the lack of good Harry/Tonks is a crime.

** If you look at the surveys they take in this sub, you'll see that this is actually a male-majority forum, which is unusual among fanfiction forums. So I would imagine that romance is a less popular genre here than across the fandom as a whole.

*** That's why I wanted an opinion here. In ffn my stories are not overly popular but they receive a few reviews and my stats are *good*, but mostly for female writers.

I've always thought that a good romance story must appeal to any gender, so I try to look for other opinions.

** Yes I write romance and I like to read it, but in HP fanfiction I'm very hard to please. I only like adult characters, I want a solid plot aside from the romance and I want to really feel the sexual tension. I don't find much that suits me.

**** I think it's inevitable given that most fanfiction readers and writers are very young and they understandably want to read and write about characters they can identify with. It does leave a bit of a vacuum though.

I sometimes wonder if there aren't many older readers and writers because there isn't much for them to read in the first place, so it becomes self-fulfilling.

** I am pretty much strictly a romance reader and 99.9% of what I read are non-canon pairings. I say that because an author needs to write those two characters who have zero romantic history in canon (say, Harry and Draco) to come from often opposite ends of the spectrum and fall in love.

So that said, the most important thing for me in a romance story is *believable relationship growth* while keeping people in character as much as possible within the plot. Some OOCness is expected as long as it's something that the reader can see the character doing if canon situations were different.

Also, any pairing works as long as /the writing backs it up/!

Now why/how the two opposites want to get together really isn't all that important because I've basically seen the whole gamut of reasons (potion gone wrong, marriage law, trapped together, truth-or-dare games, unexpected bond, one side already is smitten and opportunity presents itself, working in close proximity, etc.). What's important is showing the changing of attitude from what we see in canon to the attitude at the end of the fanfic.

So for Harry and Draco, for example. Based on their history in canon, they SHOULD NOT be in love with each other after a couple of days, regardless of what brings them together in the story in the first place. The author should show the steps forward and steps back that they would go through to make a relationship work between them within the confines of the fic's premise/plot points and not just take plot shortcuts without really fleshing out the reasons they would get together in the first place.

An action plot for me is not a priority because if the author does the story right, the relationship/character development can really carry a story on its own. Some side plot is good to give characters other things to focus on and sex between the characters when they finally get together is a MUST. The reader likely has been waiting for this for most of the story so write something satisfying (for lack of a better word, lol) for them to read.

** My biggest reasons for dropping a fic thar revolve around romance is when it gas poor pacing.

Very often fics will rush the relationship and it'll magically just happen, which is meh for an action story and really frustrating and unsatisfying for a romance.

Worse, in my opinion, is when a relationship has the groundwork laid out and prepped for the audience but the author will hem and haw because the couple getting together is the end of the story.

There is a fine line for romance to work when it is the main plot of the story and very few manage to get that right. When the romance is a side plot to bigger action, it's not a major deal, but when it is the primary thrust of the atory, it is much more important.
