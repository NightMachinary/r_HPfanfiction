I have a fic in the works set in an AU where yeargroups are much larger . The fic follows the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs in Harry's year from first year as they go through all the bigotry,wonder and romance that comes with attending Hogwarts as well as infighting in the dormitories . I've been considering " The Middle Two Tables " in reference to their placement in the Great Hall but was wondering if any of you can think of a better alternative.


** The Middle Tables would also work well; I think I like that better than the middle 2 tables. we already know there are 4 tables, therefore there are only 2 that can be in the middle .

*** Logic aside, I like The Middle Two Tables. I find it flows nicer and sounds nicer. Up to OP tho

** That sounds like a pretty good title. Honestly, without actually having read your story I doubt anyone will be able to come up wth a better title than you could since I couldn't possibly know any of the defining characteristics of your story.

** I think it would be great if you name it - 'The Middle Two' or 'The Middle Ones', the way I see it, it leaves place for interpretation. Who are the two? The middle of what? When you add 'tables' it's a give away...
