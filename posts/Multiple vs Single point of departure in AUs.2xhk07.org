** I prefer large scale AU's where the events prior to the main part of the story (Harry's Hogwarts years) are different enough that it allows for a lot of flexibility in the storytelling. The amount of points of departure doesn't really matter to me it's how they points snowball into something different.

** I think I might prefer multiple, or at least a single divergence /very/ early. The problem is that most of the books feature the main characters responding to events outside their control, so even if you do something that changes the characters' personalities or even use different characters, you tend to get the same events happening in every story. For instance, even if Harry is sorted Slytherin: Voldemort's still going to make an attempt at the Philosopher's stone, the chamber of secrets is still going to be opened, Voldemort is still going to return at the end of GoF, the horcruxes are still going to be hidden in the same places, etc. I feel that most stories need multiple changes or at least one massive change to make it exciting and fresh, not just a rehash.

*** While I prefer single point divergence, I think a lot of authors miss what makes single point intriguing. SPD has a minute change turn into a large one over time, illuminating the authors opinion of cannon and the reasons behind events and characters. The problem is twofold. First, you are correct in noting how external the key plot elements are to Harry and his story. Second is authors don't really grasp how small changes in Harry's personality will change his day-to-day life over time. Why would a different character react the same way to the same events and people? The pattern of life is chaotic, in the sense that small changes in initial conditions change the behavior of the system immensely, but in a lot of fanfic, small changes do not lead to anything but a "better" (GarryStu) main character. Same cast. Same plot points. Combined, these two forces create cannon re-hashes over and over.

**** The other problem is that some authors seem to assume readers want to re-read the first 4 books or however long it takes to get to major changes, so you have to sift through a bunch of the same stuff to get to the subtle changes to various characters and plot-lines.

** I prefer AU's that are actual AU's like the Firebird Trilogy.

** I like For Want Of A Nail fics a fair bit, but I suppose that multiple points aren't bad either, so long as they're just written well.
