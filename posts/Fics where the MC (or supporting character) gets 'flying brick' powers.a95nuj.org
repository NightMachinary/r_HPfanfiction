'Flying brick' = super strength, super speed, (nigh-)invulnerability, and flight

I would love any well-written, non-slash fanfics, where the MC (or supporting characters) has these powers. As in, they are OP as fuck against most magic.

Bonus: their invulnerability is enough for the Unforgivables to 'bounce' off of them.

Lessons with Hagrid has a Harry with flying brick powers but not the way you want to.

** Linkffn(Invincible by katgryn518) it's a HP/DC Crossover. Harry has the flying brick powerset along with "what doesn't instantly kill you you will become immune to".

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
