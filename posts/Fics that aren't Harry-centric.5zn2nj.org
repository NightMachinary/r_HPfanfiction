** I love fics that don't revolve around Harry and Hermione. I feel like they're over-represented to the point that they're now a parody of themselves. They're also incredibly unsympathetic protagonists, whether in canon or fanon.

It's also fun to see people's deeper analysis on underrepresented characters, like say, Susan Bones or Ginny Weasley.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

** I barely read stories with Harry as a main character. Nothing against him, but there are 7 years of canon with him. Because of that I think I see him as a young boy, like a companion I grew up with. Same with Hermione and Ron.

Then again, I rarely read stories in the canon time unless it's an unexplored side story.

** I'm late to the party here, but I think that the best fanfiction is non-Harry-centric.

Think of the great examples of 'fanfiction' in literature (The Aeneid, Wicked, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Sphereland etc.): they are almost /invariably/ written from the perspective of someone outside the main five-man band.

Minor characters and villains have more story left to tell, and can add a new perspective. I dislike time travel, but Draco-centric stories are much more interesting than Harry-centric ones -- Malfoy knows less, has more to gain and provides a radically different perspective.

Similarly: would linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair) have been as poignant if it featured Harry photographing Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville etc? No of course not: it's stronger for telling the stories of minor characters and how they were hurt in their own way. The 'climax' works by surprising the reader with familiarity -- Draco Malfoy was a victim of the war too.

As a rec, linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) does all the above and is (imo) one of the best fics in the fandom for it.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I'm all for alternate protagonists, but I get annoyed with some of them for talking smack about Harry and the others. It's fine that other people's lives don't revolve around the trio, but I don't need for them to be denigrated to understand why we're focusing on someone else.

** I'm going to go ahead and assert that Hogwarts-era canon!Harry isn't a very interesting protagonist, unless the very setting is very deliberately and obviously built around him --- as canon is, starting with Trelawney's Prophecy and Volemort's choice of him over Neville. He is a bit of a cypher when it comes to motivation, and what heroism he displays --- which shouldn't be understated --- is very small-picture: he might give his all to going after injustice and evil that he can address immediately, but for anything that requires a long-term effort without a clear endpoint, he is rather reactive.

Note that this doesn't make him a bad person, just not an interesting protagonist: a Laertes, not a Hamlet. It's telling that the most popular Harry-centric fics do at least one of the following:

1. Rewrite his personality and talents from scratch.
2. Give him a huge unearned power-up, special ability, or special training usually leading to 1.
3. Wait until he is an adult and then send him back in time, where he can be written as a policeman.

Examples available upon request (and time permitting).

Other characters from that generation (Hermione, Weasley Twins, Luna?, Ron?) have a bit more drive and more complex and distinct personalities, so, I usually go for either non-Harry lead or where Harry is only one of several equally important protagonists.

That's why Harry is not even among my top 3 characters in the Series. This guy basically won on the back of 'typical lucky Hollywood hero' trope. The way he treated his most loyal friend (Hermione) also bugs me.

** For me the most important aspect of a story is its quality, I can read anything if the author manages to sell the plot. In general I would say I prefer stories /without/ Harry, or at least that's what my favourites list seems to suggest. I certainly started reading Harry Potter fanfiction with the intent of not reading about Harry Potter, we have seven books of him after all and I was more interested in what other people were thinking and doing as Harry went about defeating Voldemort.

Personally I think stories written from Harry's perspective are often of a lower quality than those written from another character's perspective. Most authors change Harry drastically to fit their own picture of a hero (or what /they/ wanted Harry to be), Harry is suddenly significantly more powerful, more popular, more intelligent and ultimately more boring. Harry in canon is surprisingly snarky (a character trait often ignored) and although people can be critical of his 'saving-people thing' I personally find it endearing, I certainly don't want to read about a Harry that is more often than not-angsty, overpowered and pessimistic.
