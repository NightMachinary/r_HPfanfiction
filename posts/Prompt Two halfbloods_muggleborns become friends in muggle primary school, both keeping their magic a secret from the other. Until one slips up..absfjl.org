** So, linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) is a long, long fic, where Sirius escapes early and adopts Harry. I'm pretty sure that Harry goes to primary school with Hermione and they keep the secret from each other for a while.

Small part of a big story, but it's there.

**** Isn't it Hermione and Blaise Zabini, not Theo Nott? Pretty sure there's a whole subplot around Blaise being a halfblood and trying to hide it while in Slytherin. Or am I thinking of another fic?

**** Yup. I'm always apologetic when I recommend it simply because it's so long! The Gryffindor!Draco in particular is one of my favorite subplots in all of fanfiction . . . But even if there are 50,000 words dedicated to it, that's not even 5% of the total!

Absolutely bananas that the author is working through it all.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
