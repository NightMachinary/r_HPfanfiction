So, I'm working on a story, and part of it is that the American wizarding society and the British wizarding society don't get along all that well because the British wizards forced the American wizards out of Muggle politics. Basically, every President from Washington to Wilson was a wizard, and the schism between Taft and Roosevelt was that the British had convinced Taft to start forcing wizards out of the Republican party and to start creating an underground wizarding political system like Britain's. Theodore Roosevelt wasn't opposed to this because of anti Muggle sentiment (Pure Blood fanaticism never grew in the US the way it did in Britain in part because Benjamin Franklin and half the Founding Fathers were Muggles, and also because Washington was Half Blood and Hamilton, and Lincoln were both Muggleborn, while Burr and Benedict Arnold were Pure Blood) but because he felt that it was only practical for the leader of the United States to be a wizard so he could know the needs of the wizards and the Muggles, and thereby keep the whole country cohesive instead of the divided system the British had. The British and Taft however, were mainly concerned about the Statute of Secrecy, and managed to force wizards out of American politics after Pure Blood Suppremist Wilson's two terms. Wizards never quite regained their footing in American politics afterwards, and while they did get one more wizard President, that President was JFK. Many American wizards believe that the British had him killed, furthering the dislike.

What do you think?


** As always when you're talking about the Americas in this timeperiod: what happened to the mages among the 50-odd million people living there before colonization? I mean, sure, it might have been down to like five or ten million at that point with disease and genocide, but when the US gained independence, it had a population under three million.

How?

A political party that doesn't know about mages wouldn't opt to elect only mages. That couldn't be part of their selection criteria.

Presidential candidates are chosen from among people who have distinguished themselves to the public, typically through political service. Are mages using magic with wild abandon to rise through the ranks? Perhaps they're Confunding party leadership? If so, we would expect people to rise based on their ability to use mind-altering charms only, and not their ability to perform well in political office. In short, a strong tendency for incompetent presidents.

If it's party leadership legitimately believing that the nation is better off with a wizard at the helm -- why?

Or is it more of an old boy's club, how is it so reliable as to have a run of 28 presidents in a row?

Three or even five would make sense. You make your opportunities with magic and make the most of them with your own abilities.

*** The Native wizards were forced back, same as they would have been when Europe colonized Africa and South East Asia and everywhere else.

As for the President thing, you're right, that's unrealistic and I'm an idiot, I'm so sorry for my stupidity. I assume that sentence is why everyone hates this post. We'll just say that a good many of them were and that Britain forced American wizards out of Muggle politics altogether. Once again, I'm sorry for my stupidity.

**** It's not stupidity as an idea in progress. You need /something/ to explain why so many presidents were wizards. (Switching from "all of them" to "a lot of them" doesn't change that.) It could be a sustained conspiracy of wizards -- but then we would expect relative consistency in policy. It could be several different conspiracies of wizards. Perhaps there is a magical ability that's more or less hypnosis, swaying people to support you if they just hear you speak -- so mages have a huge advantage in politics. Maybe there's a strong educational advantage.

It /is/ unrealistic if it's unexplained. If you explain it, you'll likely come up with elements that allow for more conflicts and more interesting conflict in your story.

A passive aggressive "fuck you" when someone points out a place where your story needs work won't improve your work or endear people to you.

***** I didn't mean from 100% to 75%, sorry, poor word choice. Let's just say 45%, including some of the duds like Polk and Buchanan.

I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive, I'm so sorry I came off that way. I was just angry at myself for coming up with an idea without realizing how stupid it was, and for liking the idea as it was and not registering the flaws. I didn't mean to be a bitch, I'm sorry!

But yeah, keep at it, and you can come up with something decent at a minimum. And better the next time, until it's excellent.

** Y'know, I'm not big into politics at all. However, this is something I'd read. I like how you've put in the distinct differences in American vs English culture. In England, there's a great deal of attention and fawning paid to the aristocracy and the royal family. In the USA, it's not so much about your blood, but your wealth and upbringing. Also, I think it would be interesting to see if there's an interplay between the magics used by the European invaders, the Native Americans, and the Africans who were forcibly brought in. All three cultures would have differing attitudes and abilities when it came to magic, and all three would sort of give tension to the different wizarding societies.

Again, it would be back to the race vs caste issue that you have in the USA vs England. In the USA, racist ideals have been an integral part of how the country was formed. In England, one's birth lineage is intimately woven into the fabric of the country's culture. Both have their good and shitty parts, but both also have their own versions of those tensions between differing viewpoints.

This can be a highly interesting series to read, and I sincerely hope that you write it!
