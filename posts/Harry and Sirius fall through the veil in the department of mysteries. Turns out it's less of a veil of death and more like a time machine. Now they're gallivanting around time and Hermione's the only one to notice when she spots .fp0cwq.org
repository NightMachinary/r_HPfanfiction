#+TITLE: Harry and Sirius fall through the veil in the department of mysteries. Turns out it's less of a veil of death and more like a time machine. Now they're gallivanting around time and Hermione's the only one to notice when she spots an odd bit of pottery in the ancient greek exhibit at a museum.

** Hermione uses magic to trace her family tree: after passing Dagworth-Granger and going back many millennia, a name pops up on her list: Harry James Potter or Sirius Orion Black.

One of them is her direct, many, many greats ancestor.

****** Eh kinda. It's like those old IM chat rooms from the early 2000s. It's more convenient and less frustrating than skype. Google it, see if you like it then fallow the link in the reddits 'about' section. There's usually a few people on at any given time to talk about fics or writing in general.

******** Please do, I love Time Travel fics and this one sounds realy good.

If your in to Time Travel Harry's Reborn fics then I suggest reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5959572/1/Time-To-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time To *Put* *Your* Galleons *Where* *Your* *Mouth* Is!]] in all honesty I have no idea why it is called that, it is not a crack fic and has nothing to do with betting but it is realy good.

********* Putting your money (ie. galleons) where your mouth is is an idiom that basically means to do what you say (usually what you've been boasting) you're going to do. It's like telling those people who complain about something to go out and change it. If they do so, they're putting their money where their mouth is, ie. to allocate their resources to the same place their words are going.

And I have read that one - it's brilliant. Loved the sibling dynamic and the mild sideplot with Daphne Greengrass. Great fun.
