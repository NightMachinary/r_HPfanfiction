** Ron, Dumbledore, Ginny, Molly. Arguably in that order.

*** I'd probably switch Dumbledore and Ron around, but yes.

** Dumbledore and Ron probably. I don't mind it occasionally, but I prefer it when characters are humbled or learn from their mistakes in less overt and bash-y ways.

** Ron. He's made out to be this bumbling idiot with no use. And sometimes, the author's hate for Ron is represented through either Harry or Hermione, which makes it basically a self insert. I was recently reading a fic dealing with runes (runes are, for some reason, an obsession of mine), and in the first chapter Harry calls Ron 'Ronald' in a cold manner. This shook me so hard I Ctrl-W'ed the fuck out of that fic.

** There really isn't one HP fandom but several, and they all have different bashing patterns. For example:

**Harmonian:** Ron > Dumbledore > Ginny≈Molly > Hermione > Harry

**Dramionist:** Ron > Harry ≈ Dumbledore

*** Yeah pairings play a huge part in it.

What better way to hook up with someone new than to trash all your friends.

No way of backing out of your new tryst if you burn all your bridges first.
