*** Ok so I saw this when you first posted it but I only just now finished reading it and it's /amazing/. It might not have been what OP was looking for, but thank you for recommending it!

**** No problem! This was recommended to me on this sub and I was hesitant to start it but it really was a delightful hole to get sucked into and will remain one of my favourite fics. I'm glad that I could share the experience (:

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
