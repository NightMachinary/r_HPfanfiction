So a consistent trend that I've noticed and hated for a long time with HP fanfics is this whole Werewolves are completely harmless innocent people who just want to be treated like everyone else beyond one day of the week that they could control if only the evil Ministry would give them Wolfsbane for free. Can anyone recommend some fics where its acknowledged that they're all bloodthirsty apex predators and while some are simply better at controlling it than others ala Remus every single one of them are subject to their predator instincts at all times.

** In The Prince of Slytherin series - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 series link]] linkFFN(11191235)

Lycanthropy has a mental side. While werewolves may not physically be monsters all the time, they are definitely monstrous all the time.

A quote from part 2 that I think encapsulates this really well is ‚ÄùA werewolf who hunts and kills on the night of the full moon will eat his prey as any wild animal would. When Eustace Tully and his gang killed, they did so by the light of day. And when they /ate their victims,/ they sat at dinner tables and used /knives and forks!/". I'm spoilering it because it /is/ a quote from part 2, but I wouldn't consider it a spoiler.

Edit: added a missing quotation mark

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
