I'm sorry I just have to laugh out loud for a moment at this review to my fic. Literally just laugh at this troll who has no favorites, no follows, and no written work of his own. TO me whether you label your story as AU or not (which mine is labeled AU) fanfiction is literally what ever you want to make it so like... chill dude and keep your rude ass opinions to yourself

Edit: to clarify I'm not like depressed or sad about this comment I'm frustrated because the fic is perfectly labeled on not following cannon AND it's a crossover so if you want a cannon following fic why do people feel the need to read clearly labeled non cannon fic and comment the above?

Thank you for attending my rant.


** Guy in my comments was /adamant/ I change the pairing to Haphne, despite the fact she has not appeared or even been mentioned at all.

Sometime, you have to laugh at the absurdity

*** I'd deadass add Daphne to the story if I got a lot of those. A Daphne equivalent to indie!Fic Ron.

*** People do that in many fandoms, yeah.

I mean, I like Daphne, but insisting someone change the pairings? Gah.

You see it mostly, honestly, with Hermione in Harry Potter or Ochako in My Hero Academia. Their shippers seem to be the most strident in their demands.

Got to a point with one author where they put in the Ao3 tags something like "Uraraka Ochako Does Not Exist". People still insisted. :)

*** When I was active as a fanfic author, I had so many people try to dictate to me what I should write in my fanfiction.

"I like the idea of this story with x pairing, but can you write Hermione/Harry instead with this story?"

I mean, why not write your own fic if you want to see that instead of a Ginny/Harry?

** I laughed at a lot of reviews that were given to my fanfic when I had them posted. There was one time I wrote a fic in the Harry Potter fandom where I was exploring an AU of what happened if Sirius Black had a child before he went to Azkaban. A lot of people knew the idea of the story and they loved it, especially the way I had it set up- but there were a lot of other people that absolutely hated it.

I think that I had one review that absolutely blasted me because they thought that my fanfic attacked their OTP of Remus/Sirius. When I had a livejournal account, I blasted this review and even showed the screenshot of it so that people could see it.

Now that I am writing my own books, I have people hating on me for what is going on in my own original stuff. You can't win as a writer, lol.

** I've never understood people complaining on a fic because it ships x instead of y. Like... why even read the fic if you're against the ship?

I once read a fic that seemed to be heading towards some sort of weird love triangle that would ultimately be resolved by making everyone happy (one person had a double in the fic). I was somewhat intrigued, mostly because I like one of the ships involved. Then the fic seemed to turn around and beat people over the head with why the ship wouldn't work out, etc. I was disappointed, but it's not really my place to complain on an author for their taste in ships. I just stopped reading it.

** Honestly I don't think highly of people like you either who feel like they need to defend their work by publicly shaming their haters. You write for yourself (and some people will enjoy your work and others will hate it) and haters are going to hate.

***** I don't get it?.... I'm not sad or upset I'm just frustrated when something is clearly labeled an alternative universe and hello this is fanfiction that cannon should be followed to the T that's just not what it's about to me
