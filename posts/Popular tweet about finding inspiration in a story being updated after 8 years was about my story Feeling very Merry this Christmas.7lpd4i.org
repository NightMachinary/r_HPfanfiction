#+begin_quote
  During her 7th year at Hogwarts Hermione is thrown back 20 years in time by a device that activates only on a solstice. As she waits for December 21, 1977, Hermione must walk a fine line of existing in the past without influencing it, despite everything and everyone she loved (and comes to love) who will be affected by the events she knows will come to pass. When she returns, will Remus forgive her? Will Sirius?

******* Thank you! I am biased but I LOVE this story. I actually wrote a meta about all the things people do in time travel fics, and I tried to write mine in a way that didn't reflect the things I find so cringey in the bad examples of the genre, heh. Linkao3(13035342) if you're interested in that. I love that Ao3 allows meta!

#+begin_quote
  If you like certain pairings, you've seen them--the stories where despite (or perhaps in spite of) the author's best intentions, the story is painfully clich√© and overdone. But how does one master the art of the cringefic? What are the beats necessary to achieve the masterpiece in the genre of time traveling Harry Potter fic?Wonder no more, dear readers.
