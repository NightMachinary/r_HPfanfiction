** To be fair (only for a second --- then I'll start being unfair), 'harem' has come to have a different meaning specifically in the fanfiction community, from the meaning you'd find in a dictionary.

Now, getting to the unfair part of this comment --- no, because anyone that rude, crass, and unappreciative of the time and effort you as a writer put in to creating free content deserves the least amount of visibility you can give him --- ie, none. If we had the power to do so, I'd advise deleting the comment. Since we don't, just ignore it.

*** Even following the anime Connotation A Trek to the Stars is not Harem. He will be with two women as a long term relationship. Harem anime require three or more. You COULD stretch that it's four if you count Alexis and Juno who he has a one-nighter with but since both will only occasionally show up in the story and never interact with Harry substantially again I'd argue against it.

**** Didn't get to the relationship part of A Trek to the Stars (I never watched ST, so I fell out of the story at times), but my definition of 'Harem' for fanfiction is: 'Any relationship of more than two people where only one person in the relationship has the executive power (or the power to designate another to use this power on their behalf) to decide who will and won't be in the relationship.'

I'm going to guess that's not the case with your characters.

***** That's understandable. And yeah, not the Relationship style, even if Harry is Emperor. In fact, it'll be his paramour who introduces the third person to their pairing after the two work together for some time.

****** Hmm... an interesting thought. Presumably, if his paramour started bringing in lots of other people, then the two of them together might constitute a head for a harem. I might have to rethink my definition.

******* She'll introduce one. She's a vulcan who is pansexual and uses her knowledge of Harry's previous polyamorous relationship to decide to bring in a third. I am interested in seeing your updated definition when you decide upon it.

******** Okay, here's what I've got.

Fanfiction Harem (noun): A relationship of more than two people, which constitutes two distinct classes of individual --- the first having the executive power to decide who will and won't be in the relationship, and the second who may or may not have the choice to leave, but who categorically do not have the choice over whether others join.

********** Ah, but can the third veto a fourth? If not, then all it would mean is that both Harry and T'ryl are heads (or just Harry) while the third would count as a... mmm not sure what word to call them... tails? Sure, let's go with that... while the third would count as a tail, and the relationship would therefore, count as a harem by that definition.

************ The problem with calling them subs is, first, the assumption that everyone is either dominant or submissive, and second, that a dom couldn't be a tail, or that a sub couldn't be a head. I suspect they could.

Concubine on the other hand is too narrow. The definition of harem above could apply to all kinds of relationships --- everything from casual dating to hardcore polygamy.

Eh, I'll keep working on it.

************ Maybe not necessarily a harem, but it's a relationship of more than 2 people with power differences. Would be nice if you could give a heads up on that, I personally wouldn't be interested in (imo) unbalanced relationship dynamics. I think the reviewer was definitely rude, but I don't think it hurts to put a CW on.
