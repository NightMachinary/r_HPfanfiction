  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

** I know you asked for Drarry, but check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3. I cannot recommend this fic enough. It is one of those works that make you want to stop reading anything (fanfics and most published paperbacks) for a while bc nothing is quite as good.

Fate is about a 40+ year old Harry who is married to Ginny. Harry is magical powerful, but he is still "just Harry". He works as a carpenter while Ron is an Auror and Hermione is a public prosecutor. James, Al and Rose have graduated, but Lily and Hugo are still at Hogwarts. One day in spring Ginny gets murdered and Harry, the Weasleys and their friends need to find and catch Ginny's killer.

To anybody else, Ginny and Harry are happy together, but it soon becomes clear that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

It is a great who-dun-it with lots of plot twists and plenty of funny lines, but I especially love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

500k+ and finished. Slash. linkao3(4267422)

__________

But if you must have Harry/Draco, I would recommend you check out A Thousand Beautiful Things and the sequel Delicate Sound of Thunder by Duinn Fionn aka geoviki on skyehawke or ao3.

****** I need to check this out as soon as I finish the fics that are in my "to read" list. I've been meaning to read more Harry/Ginny anyway.

But if you love extra long stuff, "Saving Connor" and sequels as well as the "Like none other" series should be right up your alley and keep you busy for a while.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.
