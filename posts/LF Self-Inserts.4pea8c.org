I've just finished reading linkffn(The Curse of Truth) and I'd really enjoy some OC-SI. I love them in Naruto so maybe I'll love them here too.

I know they tend to be bad-ish or terrible (the aforementioned had a very creepy character...) but maybe you know some that don't such so much. Thanks!

***** I actually quit after that scene with the tea, sorry. Bringing religion into a fic is a lot like talking about your favorite band or showing off the latest iGadget; it doesn't belong in a Harry Potter story and instantly shatters any immersion in the world.

An impostor who is trying to masquerade as a Brit refusing /tea/ just added an extra layer of WTF to it, especially since they refuse it on moral grounds after [[/spoiler][murdering a child]].

** linkao3(faith and the devil), linkffn(In Bad Faith; 4437308). These are the only decent HP SIs I can think of. As a general rule, the Naruto fandom has much better SIs than the Harry Potter fandom. There are a few reasons for this that I can think of. Naruto has more stations of canon, so there is more to write. Canon Naruto has a more interesting combat system than canon Harry Potter (not getting into their fanons). Naruto is much harder to solve with foreknowledge than Harry Potter. Assuming the SI doesn't land in an AU, he can pretty much solve Harry Potter by telling Dumbledore the details about Voldemort's Horcruxes before he manages to revive himself. With Naruto, the main obstacle is the Akatsuki, which is a group made up of badasses who are already alive by the time the story starts. Even if you know all of their weaknesses, they are still going to be somewhat difficult to defeat, because they are badasses. To be fair, Voldemort is also a badass, but he's pretty much dead before the story starts.

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.
