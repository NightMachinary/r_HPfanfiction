** I'm on mobile so I'm having a bit of a hard time linking to it, but on ficwad there's a fic called Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by a dude called Vanir. It's abandoned, but if you want a story with Norse mythology and/or a harem of monster girls, this is the fic for you. And it's smutty.

** "Magic and Monsters" by Wolf3391 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10965243/1/Magic-and-Monsters]] After dealing with the issues in Britain our favorite wizard leaves to escape it all. On advice from a friend he signs up to the cultural exchange program and now has to deal with lots of girls now after his heart. HarryxHarem

Harry PotterXDaily Life With a Monster Girl. Cheating in that it's a crossover and follows the general theme of the latter show, but it does have a lamia, centaur and harpy, among other cast, gunning for Harry.
