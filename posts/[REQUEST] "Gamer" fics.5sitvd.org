** The best one I've seen is linkffn(9708318). It got me intrigued on the premise of RPGs, and so that's part of why I'm hooked on Elder Scrolls now.

The story itself does have some errors in spelling and grammar that could have been fixed by a competent beta. That being said, there are so few gamer style stories that one can't be too picky, lest there be no stories at all meeting the selection criteria.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.
