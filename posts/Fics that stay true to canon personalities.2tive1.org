** Heh. Can't help you there - my mental images of what characters should be like have long since been warped by fanfiction.

*** Oh, you too? Yeah, I'm starting to wonder how anybody can NOT have their mental images of the characters warped...

*** This is why I felt Ron was an idiot even though in cannon he had nearly identical OWLs with Harry. Either they're both idiots or neither one is. I prefer to say neither is, no matter what fanfiction likes to say.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] does this, with the caveat that it's taking Harry at the end of CoS, introducing a significant divergence, and seeing how Harry and his friends develop from there. It has a lot of Original Flavor, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] does an excellent job at nailing canon personalities, though Harry himself is heavily influenced by Dumbledore's memories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard]] is a one-shot, but it just absolutely nails Original Flavor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] centers on an 11-year old Teddy Lupin and his friends, but Harry is a supporting character. The style and tone of this one nails canon so well that I believe if you gave the 7 Harry Potter books to someone who'd never heard of the series, plus Hogwarts Houses Divided, they wouldn't bat an eye when they got to "Book 8."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only][In Blood Only]] is a severitus but probably the only one that features an in character Harry and Snape. It's the only fic that makes the severitus plot believable in canon.

** Can't help but promote my own story here.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10946431/1/The-Elder-Wand-s-Call]] I made a point of trying to avoid making anyone OOC. You may disagree but either way if you read it please review. Other than this....off the top of my head it's hard to think of stories where the characters follow their cannon personalities. This is mostly due to me reading mostly !darkHarry/Harem/TimeTravel fics, which may not be the best examples.\\
One other I can think of is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3675262/1/Stupid]]
