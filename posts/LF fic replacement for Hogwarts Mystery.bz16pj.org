I'm looking for a good story based off the Hogwarts Mystery app game. I realized that my personality is too addictive to play the actual game. Is there any good ones?


** Ooh, no one ever asks for these! This one by Jill is amazing. Year 4 was just completed:

Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob. With everyone thinking she's cursed too and the foul Merula Snyde willing to make her life at Hogwarts a living hell, can she survive school, find the Cursed Vaults and find out what happened to her brother? With some magic and the help of loving friends, everything is possible.
