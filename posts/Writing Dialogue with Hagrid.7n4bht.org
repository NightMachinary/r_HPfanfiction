I can't be the only person that struggles mightily with trying to write any dialogue for Hagrid. I used to just avoid him as a character, which is a shame because he might be one of the characters that is the least explored in the canon, but I'd like to start using him more and I just wondered if it triggers any of you when Hagrid is written without his speech quirks? If so, what are your tips on how to write him (dialogue mainly) effectively.

No, not for any character. Fleur, Hagrid, basically everyone is fine - as long as their 'tone' fits. (Hagrid speeking normally is fine, him using words like 'equilibrium' probably isn't)

****** But.... Robbie Coltrane is doing a Gloucestershire accent in the films. Not a Scottish one.

You can hear his real accent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8uXdThjmNU][here]] is Scottish, but is quite different to the one he is doing in the films.

******** I'm British....

And I happen to know both accents fairly well - my fiance's family is from the West Country, and my Mum's family is Scottish. I promise you, Robbie Coltrane is doing a West Country accent, not his usual Scots accent. Though Robbie's real accent is actually rather soft, Scottish accents are more gluttural, vowels are shorter - dog turns into dug, for example. The West Country accent also changes the pronunciation of some vowels, especially 'i', and tends to lengthen them. Think about how Hagrid says 'Ron' in the films. He draws out the o so that it almost sounds like an a. A Scot would deepen the o.

There are some similarities in the accent because they both originate from the Celts/Native Britons, but there are clear differences. If you listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j737oPgPE3s][this]] video you can pick up on sounds that Robbie Coltrane uses.
