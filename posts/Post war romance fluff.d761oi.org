** Linkffn(Grow Young With Me), if you haven't already read it. It's canon compliant up to about ten years before the epilogue, so there's past Harry/Ginny, but it's decidedly not a thing by the time the story starts.

*** I see everyone requesting this fanfic, everyone says it's great but I don't really get it. I think I read about 2-3 chapters of the fanfic. Can you tell me what is so great about it?

***** Harry seems like such a loving father who also mourns in an absolutely believable way here.

**** I think the reason it's so beloved and widely recommended is just that it's executed incredibly well; there isn't too much about the story itself that's particularly groundbreaking. For instance, I can't think of a single story where Harry's conversations with his various family members feel more natural than this one.

****** I definitely wouldn't say that, no. It does plenty of stuff I haven't seen in other postwar fics, just not stuff that I haven't seen in other fics, period.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  After the war, what's left is picking up the pieces. Harry continues the only way he knows how and takes solace in reading stories on the internet, not suspecting it would take his life in a whole new direction... Post-Hogwarts AU.
