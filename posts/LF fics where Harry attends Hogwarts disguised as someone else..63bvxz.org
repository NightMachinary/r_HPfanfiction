Never been good with fic names and I don't want to bother searching for the right ones today so bear with me here. Please no Pureblooded Pretends. Not really a fan of that series. I already read holly's spiral trail and Hyde Hero. That oneshot where Harry pretends to be Clark and the aurors reenact 21 jump street. That one by the guy with dobby in his profile pic. Wrote that double lord black dimension travel thing. That unspellably named fic where Harry is raised by Black Widow. That oneshot where Harry is half of Hogwarts at once. Darksloo or something wrote that in a collection I think? Also read a plethora of wrong boy who lived fics with this so pls no more of those. Already read Black Princess series. Not the biggest fan of that though I did like the whole light vs dark cold war thing so if you've got fics with that going on I'd love to read those no matter what genre they're in unless it's furry erotica or pedo crap because that stuff is fucking weird and I'm not into it.

Lol. That's probably the best Harry in disguise series out there.

*** I couldn't really stand the main villain in that one to be honest. A lot of the stuff he did made little to no sense. The villain third year was a much better in my opinion. Actual sense of danger and all that. Really annoyed that it seems to be back to the sows. Also hated the whole underking nonsense. That kinda stuff just annoys me.

Edit: and the mech scorpion villain was great too. Liked that part. Didn't like the deus ex super magic or whatever though.

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny

** linkffn(4062601).

I recommended this to someone yesterday [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/62yua6/request_fics_where_harry_is_more_studiouspowerful/dfq35mz/][here]].

It is a complete 450-500k word trilogy. The first book takes place mostly outside Hogwarts. The second book has Harry and Sirius disguised as two random people (Sirius teaches DADA). Harry reveals himself at the end of the second book though. So, it kind of has what you're asking for.

Hey, [[https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/59066735/three-stooges-hey-i-resemble-that-remark.jpg][I resemble that remark!]]

This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but with a twist of sorts it does and may be up your ally. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][*The Power of the Press*]] linkffn(8831374) has Harry noping out on the wizarding world at the beginning of Goblet of Fire, before interacting with the wizarding world through a new identity that he constructed with the help of Sirius and Remus. Most of the wizarding world remains laregely ignorant of this, and it's quite the fun read.

** Linkao3(malfoy flavor by vorabiza). Please overlook the atrocious title. Severitus, Harry attends Hogwarts in disguise as Snape's newly discovered son (claiming that "Harry Potter" is in training elsewhere). Harry/Draco slash. Some seriously good undercover work by Harry - he even attends a few Death Eater meetings.

** linkffn(11862560)

Summer after fourth year accidental magic causes Harry to turn into a girl. He attends Hogwarts pretending to be a long lost Black cousin. Im only like 10 chapters in so im not sure how long he keeps it a secret but im mostly digging it so far. Sometimes the author does a little too much in his head exposition of how weird everything is now that hes a girl but its not too hard to skim those parts and at chapter 10/11 ish Harry seems to come to terms with it so i think/hope thatll lessen now.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
