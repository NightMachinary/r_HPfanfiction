** Any that Harry proves himself worthy before hand?

Probably a good indicator of a better than average story. Like Hermione gets good grades and wants to take all classes- she gets trusted with a time turner. Harry first shows he is willing to apply himself (not just hitting books but hands on etc.) so that Dumbledore isn't just a level up/unlock high power spells or teaching him basic stuff he could be learning himself.

**** Yes, this, basically.

I can also see Dumbledore facilitating someone's advancement in a relationship analogous to that of a high-profile research professor and a good graduate student: for every hour of face-time, the student spends tens of hours researching and practicing independently, with the meetings --- perhaps an hour or two a week --- being a combination of providing advice and guidance on what to do next and a master class to fix any subtle flaws in the student's practical technique (with the student being expected to have worked out any unsubtle flaws before the meeting).

#+end_quote

That's a good question... I don't think that there's anyone in Harry's generation who is worthy of being personally taught magic by Dumbledore, especially given all the other ways Dumbledore could use his time, and how many others, including Hogwarts Professors, are available. Specifically, barring an HPMOR-grade overhaul of Harry's personality and natural talents, personally tutoring Harry in magic is simply not going to be worth Dumbledore's time. (In canon, Hermione might be a slightly better candidate, in that you could tell the canon one "Go research area of magic /X/, try to apply it to /Y/, and we'll meet next week and we will discuss it in more depth and work on your technique," and have her actually do it and keep up. However, even for her, there are others in the setting who could help her in that, long before she needs Dumbledore.)

So, funnily enough, in order to give Harry a "Dumbledore Tutelage" power-up, you have to first give him general talent and/or research and study skills and/or motivational power-ups.

**** Giving Harry tutelage would probably spur him into working harder as he would have someone he looks up, taking time out to help him. Harry would feel cared for the first time and I imagine that would make him try harder. In PoA he works hard to learn the Patronus showing what he can do when worked with one on one and backed by fear, imagine how hard he would work when his driving force wasn't fear but his 'greatest strength' love.

***** That's a separate discussion, I think. My post was specifically about Harry "proving himself worthy", and whether anyone in his generation is really worth Dumbledore's personal time to tutor in magic.

But, to answer your post, consider that you are not just asking Dumbledore to use his precious time, forgoing important work that has profound effects on lives and education hundreds of others, to personally tutor Harry. You are saying that he needs to do that just to /motivate/ Harry; motivate him over and above the motivation of discovering the amazing, (literally) awesome magical world, where he /is/ admired and cared for by Hagrid and many others, and where he is told "You can do all this!" (or, more precisely, "Yer' a wizard, Harry."), handed a wand, and every opportunity to learn.

Hermione, the Weasley Twins, Marauders, and Snape took those opportunities and ran with them. If Harry requires nothing less than Dumbledore's personal attention to be properly motivated --- well, then maybe Snape was right in his disdain for Hogwarts's newest celebrity.

For that matter, I don't buy that Harry would particularly appreciate such attention. He worked with Remus because he had an immediate magical need that he had to solve, and Harry's time isn't infinite either. Being singled out for special attention means less Quiddich, less Exploding Snap, less hanging out with friends --- all the things he loves and misses the most while cooped up at the Dursleys'. Being singled out for Dumbledore's tutelage would also create a status barrier of sorts between him and his friends, even fostering resentment and envy on both sides, not to mention from others, like, say, whoever is doing NEWTs in Transfiguration.

Lastly, I am not convinced that it would be particularly beneficial to Harry. Even when he works on things intensively, he doesn't learn that much faster than the majority of his cohort, and sometimes slower. The Patronus --- his signature spell --- while an impressive feat at that age, is shown to be something that students only a year older than he was at the time can learn without too much trouble. On the other side, recall his struggles with the Summoning Charm in GoF.
