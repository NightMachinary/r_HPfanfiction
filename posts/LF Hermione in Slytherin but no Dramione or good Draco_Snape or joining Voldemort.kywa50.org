Slytherin is still a mix of pureblood purists, bullies, idiots and people keeping their heads down.

Snape is still a mostly no-good person who is also a total ass to everyone.

Voldemort is still a crazy megalomaniac.

But, Hermione is placed in Slytherin by the hat and has to use her smarts to survive and thrive in a place where the first years might just shun her, but a seventh year might try to threaten or curse her or get her into an "accident".

I am requesting stories where Hermione has to go at learning magic totally alone in a hostile environment and rise to the challenge. I don't want stories with Draco in leather pants, or that Hermione discovers her pureblood heritage and develops a dislike for muggles (why do people write these?).

Bonus points for creative use of magic and technology.

People who read "A wand for Skitter" (recommended) know what I'm looking for, just made harder by using Hermione, who is 11 years old and has no combat training from a death world.

Pairings don't matter as long as they don't distract from the plot.


** linkffn(The Mudblood)

Not exactly. It's a bit different, but it has the core concept I think. It's an OC fic, though.

edit: sigh. unfortunately not the fic I was looking for.

  He felt nauseous. An inescapable dread weighed him. He'd be dead by noon, by Potter's hand or Weasley's. It was a toss-up. At least he hoped he would. That would be the easiest way out of the Dark Lord's mission. And he certainly didn't want to live after what he had done to her. Dramione. Hogwarts: HBP. Canon. Warnings: dub-con

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  “It's okay little birdie,” she lies, “you'll fly again.” And Hermione wishes her words were true, wishes so very hard- and then everything goes fuzzy, yellow darting away. It doesn't make any sense, but she doesn't doubt it. She sleeps with a smile, knowing somehow she helped the bird. This is the first time Hermione remembers doing magic.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

**** Yes, I love this one! It's been updated recently too. When I first read the summary I was worried that it would be a Mary Sue super-powerful Hermione fic but it's actually Hermione bullshitting her way through Slytherin by making up the term ‘New Blood' and pretending that she's different from other Muggleborns because Magic has gifted her power directly.
