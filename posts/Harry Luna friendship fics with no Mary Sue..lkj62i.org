I want fics where Harry and Luna are friends but she isn't some secretly all-powerful all knowing person. I especially love when where Harry is a bit of an older brother/mentor like figure for her.


** It will eventually be a Harry/Luna romance, but for now, their relationship is similar to what you're describing. Luna's no superhero, she's not a seer, and she's not some sex-pot. She's just a lonely little girl who can't understand why people make fun of her.

Just a warning - the same way that Luna is not a Mary Sue in this story, Harry is also not a crusading superhero who immediately recognizes what she's going through and curses every student in Ravenclaw before giving a long-winded speech about how bullying is wrong :D

  Petunia's love for astrology rubbed off on her nephew. So when Harry Potter met Sybill Trelawney, a real-life seer who could tell the future, it was only natural that he'd be drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Follow the coming of age journey of a young boy, a child of Prophecy, as he divines the secrets of fortune, friendship, fame, and just might find love along the way.

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

  Listening to Luna usually yielded results. It might not be the results he usually wanted or expected, but results all the same. Though falling into another world when all he had wanted was to find out what Malfoy was up to was beyond even Harry's wildest dreams.
