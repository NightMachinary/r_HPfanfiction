I can't tell you the number of fics I've ran across that are great but get ruined because for some reason Neville is Harry's best friend/ god brother, gets to be 6'6 and full of muscle, as or loser powerful than Harry, and has the bravery of Gryffindor. Or when he just pushes himself into the friend group unnaturally.


** To be fair, though, I can sort of understand where the power boost comes from. Even canon does it:

#+begin_quote
  In fact, Neville barely spoke during the DA meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm -- a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker -- only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.
#+end_quote

--HPOotP, ch 25.

The problem comes in when authors overplay it and make Neville suddenly become Adonis, some kind of Indy!Harry, and all that jazz, especially after getting a new wand. (NB: the above quoted paragraph was still when Neville had his father's wand.)

I wouldn't go quite that far. With Crabbe and Goyle it's implied that they're incompetant wizards because they're well, stupid; while with Neville his problems come first and foremost because of the frankly abusive way his extended family raised him, which left him a jittering, nervous wreck. With the worst offender being his grandmother Augusta, who seemed to go out of her way to try and force Neville into becoming essentially a clone of his father, even going so fas as forcing Neville to use his father's wand (which he is clearly incompatible with), instead of getting him his own one.

I'm not saying he is Harry's equal like a lot of fanfics portray him, and I actually /do/ agree that he gets the Gary Stu treatment quite a lot (similar to how Hermione gets the Mary Sue version), but besides Harry and Hermione, all the DA are portrayed as average - hell, don't the Creevey bros cast corporeal patroni?

*** Below average wizard. Neville's greatest moments were swinging a sword, and leading a protest from within school. Neither of these show case that he's great at magic. His best field is magical botany which doesn't involve wand waving.

All of Ron's advantages? Ron was loyal to a fault. He stood up with a broken leg to defend his best friend against a mass murderer. When the whole school turned on Harry, he was with him in second year. Ron was kind, concerned and went out of his way to help Harry on numerous occasions. He flew a car across the country to rescue his friend just because he was worried about him as he didn't reply to his letters.

Neville wasn't a part of Harry's life until his Fifth year, and even then his entrance into Harry's life was influenced by the opinion his Grandmother had helped him form.

Books 1-4, Neville just got Harry in trouble, never showed up nor did he stand up for Harry in anyway. What Neville did do was display that he couldn't fly, get himself caught by McGonagall, get embarassed by Hermione, then disappears until he manages to let in a mass murderer into his dormitory by not reporting that he lost his sheet with passwords that help access a restricted area, and then disappeared again, without helping anyone.

Book 5 - he joined a study group to help improve his grades. That's what the DA was. He only really started getting involved after the lady who turned his parents into vegetables escaped. The instances of loyalty he exhibits were in the DoM and Book 6, where incidentally Ron was present as well.

Hell, if you want to blame anyone for the deaths of students at the Battle of Hogwarts, blame Neville. He's the one who was leading the arguments for the DA to be involved in the fight against death eaters.

Now you might say character growth and all that for Neville. Great. Why are you taking away the same aspect from Ron then?

Ron displayed completely human tendencies. Everyone gets jealous at some point. Making it seem like the end of the world is very hypocritical of people. Betrayal? How did he betray Harry? Horcrux hunt? Unlike the other two, he had something to lose during that war aside from his life and while he was with them and doing nothing, his family was getting harmed. Hermione's family was safe. Harry's family was beyond their help. He also had a mind control device messing with his head at that time. It wasn't betrayal. He cracked under the pressure and walked out. When he tried to come back as soon as he could, he couldn't find them.

So when you say Neville has all the good traits but none of the bad, I have to respectfully disagree.

It's funny how they criticise Ron for being narrow-minded and resolute in his hatred towards things he doesn't agree with, when they act in the exact same manner as the "Ron" they have in their minds.

Most likely Ron bashers hate Ron because he is a personification of the qualities they possess and wish they didn't.

****** Just as with Hermione, Ron triggers a lot of issues among some fans. He's poor, and a significant number of people are classist and think the poor are lazy and worth less than the rich. He's a teenager who "betrays" Harry, and for many teenagers, that's worse than trying to kill Harry and murdering people - because they have experiences with that kind of conflict, but not with murder. He's a normal guy, not a bad boy or noble. And, of course, he's the side-kick who dared to win the love of Hermione without being perfect/Harry (or Draco), and that cannot be tolerated among some fans. Again, they have no experience with war, but they know how it feels to "lose" a love.

So, no matter what Ron actually did for Harry in the books, they won't change their mind since they only see the trigger to their own issues.

You see similar things with Hermione, who triggers some people just for being a smart girl who doesn't bow to Harry or "knows her place".

Book 1- literally reduces her to tears with his insults towards her.

Book 2-5/6- insults her thirst for knowledge. Every. Single. Book. All the time. Constantly using her to help with his homework while insulting her diligence in homework and studying

Book 4- yule ball dates. Ron tried to use her as a LAST resort, then gets PISSY with her because she said she's already going with someone. Treats her like ass over it.

Book 6- ron got pissed off at hermione, and chose to date lavender. This isn't so bad right? Normally no, but he took many opportunities to rub him dating lavender in hermiones face. This was spiteful and disgusting.

******** Book 1: he was fucking eleven years old. Honestly how many eleven year olds do you know that wouldn't get pisses off in Ron's place during the wingardium Leviosa Scene. Hermione was behaving like some superior know it all and getting into his business without even knowing him. She was also eleven years old and didn't have many friends before Hogwarts so she didn't really know better but why would that matter to Ron in that moment? He also didn't mean for her to hear what he said and that makes a great difference. He didn't go out of his way to insult her, he was just venting to his friend. And he was ELEVEN.

Book 2-5/6: He doesn't „insult her thirst for knowledge“, he teases her sometimes - like a lot of friends do. He also stands up for her, when literally anyone else says something like that. And Hermione doesn't take offence to the things Ron says, so why do you think you should in her place? Just because you don't understand their friendship dynamic doesn't mean there's something wrong with it.

By the way, Ron also tells Hermione how much he values her knowledge often. And while we're talking about insulting friends, I should mention that pretty much every time Hermione argues with Ron and has to realise he‘s actually right, she gets snippy or insults him personally or simply dismisses everything he says.

They're both not perfect, but they grow over time. You know, as people tend to do.

Book 4: Nobody says that Ron acted great. But he was fourteen. He didn't ask Hermione at first because he simply saw her as his best friend. And seeing her with Krum made him jealous and he acted shitty because he was a kid and didn't know better and had just for the first time ever considered that he maybe likes Hermione as more than a friend.

Yes, he acted like a prat. But it wasn't the worst thing in the world. It's not like he ruined her evening or something, Hermione enjoyed herself with Krum and She and Ron only really fought back in the common room after everything was over anyway and they made up the next day. Again, no idea why you feel like you have to be more angry about the whole situation than Hermione was.

Book 6: First of all, he didn't rub it in her face, where did you get that from? Just because he was snogging her in public? Like about 90% of teenage couples do?

By the way, Hermione was acting way worse in that situation. She literally ATTACKED Ron with a flock of birds picking at his arms. That's assault and way worse than anything Ron ever did. Nevermind that she refused to speak to him at all, even though he was doing nothing but...dating someone else. It's not like he betrayed her or even turned her down. She never told him she had feelings for him, why should Ron assume she would have a problem with him dating someone else?

So the conclusion is, Ron was a normal teenager with faults. As was Hermione. So why are you so determined to ignore what other characters did wrong and focus on their strengths but then turn around and don't do the same for Ron and instead exaggerate his flaws?

How did he vilify him? What did he do? He didn't talk to him and walked away. That's not vilifying. It's a disagreement and they didn't speak to each other. He wasn't going around wearing a badge. He just didn't believe or support Harry. Incidentally, that's something Neville did as well, wasn't it?

Also, Harry wasn't in mortal danger until the first task, and also, solo task. Even if he stayed he couldn't have done anything.

While Harry was in a tent, camping. No one could have found him at that moment, something Ron found out when he tried to return as soon as he could. Not exactly mortal danger. Atleast not anymore than ron was in at that moment. Also you're conveniently forgetting the mind control device that was influencing him? And the fact that his family was being hunted down and was constantly getting hurt. Something the other two in the tent could not relate to.

He believed that he was wasting time sitting in a tent doing nothing, which they all were doing at that point, while his family was getting hurt.

That isn't mean-spirited or jealous.

Also you seem to be interested in Ron's failings, yet you refuse to acknowledge Neville's or Hermione's.

******** How did he vilify him - by doing the exact same thing the rest of the school did, call him a liar and not believe he didn' willingly enter the TWT. You act like the other students were burning him in effigy. Ron acted just like everyone else. Maybe not as bad as Malfoy, but the other 99% for sure.

I don't recall Neville ever calling Harry a liar in GoF. Neville didn't get much screentime.

None of your reasons are excuses for walking out in DH. Harry was public enemy no. 1, Hr no.2. They had no option to walk away and go live a nice normal life like Ron could. His family was pureblood, they were fine. His brother/father worked in the Ministry, two more owned a store in Diagon, and their home was known to DEs - so OBVIOUSLY they weren't being hunted, stop making stuff up. If anyone wanted to kill them, they'd be dead. They all wore the locket equally, yet only Ron abandoned the cause. That shows, by your own point, that he is objectively just not as good as the other two.

So there. All your arguments rebutted, no fanon needed. We aren't talking about Hr, who def has her own issues (loyalty isn't one of them tho), or Harry (who I fucking HATE in canon - you think i dislike Ron? Find one of my rants about canon!Harry). We were talking about Ron as a friend, which he was an objectively shitty one when the going got tough.

********** Uhhhh I'm not anymore "blind with hatred" than you are blinded by love. I responded to each of your points and your reply was "Nuh-uh!" You look at everything Ron does as charitably as possible. And I know LV was a garbage antagonist, but come on. The Weasleys were harrassed, not in any real danger. Ginny was threatened the most, simply by virtue of being tortured along w the other students. If the DEs wanted the rest dead, they wouldn't have survived, simple as that. The Burrow never had to be put under Fidelius, after all. They just hung out.

Little fight? Ya that isn't a 'little' fight. And you are attempting to look past the point that he abandoned him in the first place. The fact that he was truelly able to believe that harry would put himself into the tournament, and lie to him about it, speaks volumes to how little he knew his 'best friend'. I would never want to be friends with someone that I have to wonder if they are going to remain loyal when shit hits the fan. I'd rather be alone than have to deal with that shit.

  bad manners
#+end_quote

Canon Hermione had worse manners. Book 4. The way she ate. Also how she treated fellow human beings, namely Skeeter.

Book 5. She had people sign a contract without giving them the terms. That's fraud and punishable. Also shows a very bad upbringing. It's not sneaky. It's a crime. Also blackmails a person.

Book 6. Attacks her bestfriend because he dates someone other than her?

If anything, her manners are worse. Why aren't you replacing her with Neville? Is it because she's a girl?

#+begin_quote
  actual pureblood customs (if the fic uses those).
#+end_quote

Doesn't exist in canon, so Neville doesn't bring shit.

Also Weasley is a part of the sacred 28 just like Longbottom. Why won't they know customs? Because they are poor? Or because they aren't blood purists?

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.
