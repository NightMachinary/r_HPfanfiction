Inspired by petunia snaps, but wanting something with a little more substance. Bonus if anything John wick style exists!

If Anything, I'd love to read fics that follow canon up until the books at least, but keen for everything :)

Thank you in advance!


** I don't know if this is what you want, but just the other day I read this Petunia-centric fic that was awesome! She has no magic, but she is still powerful! It's called Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
