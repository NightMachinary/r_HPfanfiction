  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

I also very much enjoyed The Mad Mad Reviewer's (long) one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7284194/9/The-Terrible-Ideas-Bin][Monsterous]]. Its not really a complete story, unfortunately. But I recommend it none the less.

And not really a creature!Harry, but Harry /thinks/ he's an elf: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] (Complete) and its Sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8509020/1/The-Handbook-of-Elf-Psychology][The Handbook of Elf Psychology]] (WIP). By evansentranced.

*** I really loved Serpens Armarum by Evandar.

Serpens Armarum By: Evandar FanNoWriMo! Harry has an unusual reaction to Basilisk venom...one that will shake the Wizarding World to its very core. AU MagicalCreatureHarry, ManipulativeDumbledore, preslash COMPLETE Rated: Fiction T - English - Supernatural - Harry P. - Chapters: 26 - Words: 77,086 - Reviews: 2,166 - Favs: 5,314 - Follows: 2,057 - Updated: Jul 22, 2009 - Published: Jul 10, 2008 - Status: Complete - id: 4385420

So its a Basilisk!Harry, and slash with an OC (OC is really well done so no worries there, and author calls it pre-slash because although they have feelings for one another, they're not physical about it.). The story is well written and paced, I think you'd enjoy it.

There's a sequel too, but which isn't finished.

**** Yeah, I'm disappointed about that. It was even taken over and then abandoned which is worse almost. But the first one is a good substantial read for a while.
