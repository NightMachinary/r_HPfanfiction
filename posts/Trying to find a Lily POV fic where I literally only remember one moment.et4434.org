:END:
I'm pretty sure it takes place post-Hogwarts and it's James/Lily. I just remember one moment where Lily is at Hogsmeade and she sees Sirius coming out of Three Broomsticks or some pub with a group of random people (mostly a group of girls I think?) and and he invites her to go with them somewhere, presumably to stay out all night. I believe Lily says no, but she thinks to herself about either what a mystery he is/how he's in his own world or how charismatic he is. I just remember this moment because it was such a different characterization of Sirius than what we usually see. Like, he was still the fun, party animal type, but more self-confident rather than arrogant or douche-y. Just someone who did his own thing without being a try-hard rebel type or seeming like he was trying to compensate for something. I know this is literally nothing to go off of, but I can't remember anything else right now except that it was really well-written.
