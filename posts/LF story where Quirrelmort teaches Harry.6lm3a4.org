I remember a specific fic where first Quirrel and then Sirius teach Harry dark magic. I think it was a Fleur pairing. But any other stories where Quirrel or any other form of Voldie takes Harry under his wing would be nice too. None of that Horcrux directly downloading a lifetime of spells into Harry's head cliche, please.


** Everyone has already read it, but Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived has Quirrellmort giving private lessons to Harry in his first year. He even influences Harry enough to get him to apply for a transfer to Durmstrang.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts by Seprith Li Castia; Old Blood by Oil on Canvas; Parselbrat by Leikiz; Sins of the Father by Sparticustodian) Old Blood is the best of these, though it a pretty extensive AU and Quirrell`s female. Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by Zennith6) is also pretty amazing, though this one is just straight Tom Riddle.

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

  the best characterization of LV
#+end_quote

/precisely because/ Quirrelmort is nothing like canon. Quirrelmort does not characterize Lord Voldemort at /all./ He's essentially completely OC.

To accurately characterize a character, they don't need to be "yet another pastiche of canon" - you can add life and substance to the character however you want. But it would be disingenuous to say that "character A is a great characterization of character B", when, for all intents and purposes, A is different from B in virtually every aspect.
