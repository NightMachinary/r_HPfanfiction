What would be the affect of the events of Orwell's novel on the Wizarding World?


** “Holly at Hogwarts -- Return to Neverland by Forest_of_Holly” linkao3(1143960). It is part of larger series and it is certainly worthy to read the whole thing, but even this part is worthy (and I think it is reasonably self-sustaining, so it could be read on its own). Voldemort's Britain feels really like “1984” with dementors, and it is very well written. I am a month short of fifty old bloke, I haven't cried fully for thirty years or so, but when reading the scene in the train, I was really choking.

** I think the War and subsequent revolutions would be more difficult to navigate for the Wizarding world than the ensuing INGSOC dictatorship.

If you headcanon that magical wards and various other defenses can withstand Muggle missiles, and even nukes, then I don't see all that much changing. But if you are on the side of the argument that they don't, then the Wizarding world could potentially take a really heavy blow.

Despite that, if they manage to push through the violence and endure, I think Oceania would be an unimaginable miracle for Wizards. Think how that country operates, internal and international travel is pretty much zero, Muggle birth rates and population is declining, industry barely exists, technology is in absolute freefall (except for few areas that aid INGSOC), the population is mentally programmed into doublethink (and would never entertain the idea of Magic).

I think Wizards would quickly rally around and ward the hell out of large swaths of land and thus create actual states and even towns purely for themselves. And I think they would also immediately remove every Muggleborn child from the clutches of the Party and have it raised by Wizards.

​

Tbh, I think they would really thrive in a state like Oceania.
