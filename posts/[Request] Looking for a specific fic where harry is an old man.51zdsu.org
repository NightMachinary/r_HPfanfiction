I'm looking for a fic that I read a whiiile ago. I don't remember too much of it, but I vaguely recall Harry Potter as an old man (dumbledore-esque). It might have been a time travel/alternate dimension fic, I'm not too sure. It also might have been discontinued. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks.

Edit: I checked out: The Master of Death, by rgm0005, 30 Minutes That Changed Everything, by Radaslab, and Harry Potter and the Time of Retirement by 0rigami

They are not the one that I am looking for, unfortunately. Hmm. As ahem.. corny as it sounds, I remember Harry with the twinkle in his eyes (green/emerald). He really was dumbledore-esque. I don't think the fic exceed 200k (at least last I read it). But thank you all for your help. I'll definitely read the other fics more thoroughly, Thanks!


** Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) is the only one that comes to mind. Are you sure you don't remember anything else?

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Retirement) is a fic where incredibly old widower Harry ends up travelling back into his 11 year old self against his will, and pretty much apathetically goes through Hogwarts.

  When you still have a desire to change your future, time travel may be attractive. But would an old Harry really be interested in reliving his school years, with all those annoying school kids, classes and dark lords? Probably not - but sometimes you don't have a choice. No Slash - no clich√® (beside time travel itself) - maybe no romance at all.
