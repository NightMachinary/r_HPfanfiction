** Chapter 9 of Weres Harry has Harry preemptively countering his entry into the Triwizard Tournament by using a ward to swap his name for Draco Malfoy's. And he manages to stick 5 more champions into the Tournament too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/9/Weres-Harry]]

Dumbledore gets him back by making him an organiser for the whole thing, though.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

George is a Hogwart's Champion here and there is no fourth champion.

*** Fair warning to anyone reading this series, it's a Quest and the plot is dictated by vote. [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/6311-Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains-%28HP-FSN-CYOA%29][Here]] is the thread for the latest story.

I personally loathe this style of writing. The series started out pretty entertaining but the characters kept doing really stupid things I hated. Once I realized it was because the author had no plan and was running a Choose Your Own Adventure story, I stopped reading it.

***** It has no clear or defined narrative. It's literally a series of random decisions made by a group other than the author. I don't enjoy it, and I don't respect it.

To each his own, but a disclaimer from the author saying "Not only do I have no idea what I am doing or where the story is going, but I'm letting those things be decided at random by internet strangers! I SWEAR IT'S GOOD BECAUSE REASONS!" because I did not enjoy finding that out well after the fact.

Eh, IMO it was pretty obvious from the first two chapters. Also, I know for sure that author has a plan. Or plans rather. A lot of stuff was foreshadowed long before appearing. Illuminati, World Cup events, new Templar - Assassin war, Lockhart's plans. Readers vote for Shinji's actions, but while they affect a lot of things (see: Diary decision butterflies), other parties have their plans too and follow with them.
