So I'm currently looking for stories where Tom Riddle takes a different path - be it after waking up as a child after dying at the hands of Harry Potter, him refusing to create horcruxes, actually not being T.R. but Harry Potter in the body of Riddle, etc.

The title says 'redemption', but what I actually mean is more of a 'doesn't go around murdering everyone and becoming the villain'.

Maybe he did learn something from seeing how idiotic all the purebloods around him behaved, maybe he saw an example in Harry how one could accept his tragic background instead of refusing it, maybe he came to the conclusion that becoming the elected leader of the country isn't too much of a problem if people like Fudge manage to do it.

Genre can be pretty much anything - so, any suggestions?

** Oh man, there's a story that I really liked but can't remember the name of. Basically, Harry goes back in time via help from Aberforth who was an Unspeakable using an ultra-timeturner. His mission was to kill Tom, but he instead adopts Tom and raises him. WW2/Grindelwald action ensues. Great story, and there was an unfinished sequel as well.

I'll see if I can find the story.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.

  In a house in Godric's Hollow, three boys toss their magic around and a little girl dies... unless.

  #+begin_example
      \[Originally posted to my livejournal\.\]
  #+end_example

  So, there was a prompt at the Could Have Beens AU Comment Ficathon (which is great fun, you guys should check it out) that read as follows: "Dumbledore/Grindelwald; Ariana doesn't die, Dumbledore sticks with Grindelwald." And what I intended to do was...look at it and then look away, honestly. What I'm actually doing is more or less a re-envisioning of the entire HP canon, set in the Marauder era, that works around this concept and what such a change might have wrought. This is the first part, and if things go according to plan, there will be two more. Like Harry Potter, this is a war story; unlike Harry Potter, it is very up-front about that fact. I'm going to call this one a choose-not-to-warn experience, because there are things I am dealing with within for the sole reason that the books set them up and didn't deal with them; please proceed with due caution.

In Moratorium, Harry (who is a girl in this case) doesn't destroy the Diary but rather binds the soul to herself. You can compare it to having a Fallen Angel from Dresden Files. This Diary Tom is redeemed but the other Voldemort is not.

Also, Tsume Yuki has a few stories like what you're asking for; The Angels Envied Every Kiss, Sound of Death Knell, and Knock 'Em Dead for example. Although in Death Knell, Harry is Dark so perhaps Tom's not as redeemed as you're looking for.

And yes, all of these have fem!Harry who is born female.
