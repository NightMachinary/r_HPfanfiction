I don't know if this exists, and the thought just occurred to me now. This is such an unlikely scenario that I want to see if it exists. :)


** I'm pretty sure I've come across some on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], however I'd be interested in knowing how this pairing came about since it's so far from anything canon.

*** All I can think of is someone wanted HMS Pretty Ugly and had to think of a way to create the ship name.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fleur%20Delacour*s*Severus%20Snape/works]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/105332][Hunter and Game]] is pretty well written, despite some silly narrative choices for the sake of drama, and the fucked up age difference/power differential (fleur is 17 and it's during GoF). the premise is both of them being spies for the order
