No matter how much I search the fandom, it's very difficult to find decent H/L fics. If you think about it, the pairing makes much more sense than Harry/Ginny, or even my personal weakness Harry/Hermione. In canon, and this is in the books as well as the movies, Harry and Luna have several, very touching moments (or at least moments that could be interpreted as such) that could have led to something more.


** 1. Luna is the most difficult character to write persuasively in whole HP canon, IMHO. All those jokes about ‚Äúit would be like having a friend‚Äù? The sad part of that is that we actually almost never see Luna behaving like a friend. She is so closed and isolated from her surroundings, that in whole book we never really learn much about her true personality, about her dreams and fears, she really never shares anything personal about herself much.

2. I know that ‚ÄúThe Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel‚Äù linkao3(14078862) is Huna, and that it is probably the most famous one, but I always wonder how much she is true to her book model. And the answer is ‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù, exactly because her book model is so vague and sheltered. And to be honest, I have hard time to believe these two together. Hinny and Harmony probably took already all oxygen for any other pair with Harry: he is either a sporty fighter, doing well with Ginny (see [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]]), or he is slightly more brainiac and Muggle-oriented and then he works well in Harmony. Who would be Harry well working with Luna? I don't know, and mostly because I don't know enough about Luna.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** I write quite a lot of H/Luna. They are the best pairing, but i agree that people have a hard time with her character.

** I have a pile of notes for a timebendy Luna-focused story in which she dates Harry in one timeline but she's super hard to write. To get the feel right, she needs to simultaneously be wise beyond her years and believe in lots of stupid things, a normal teenager and an otherworldly fairy. This is only doable in canon because she's actually a very minor character who just does one thing at a time, but for her to carry a story you need to actually wrestle with these things.

** Luna is very hard to write well in romance from what I've read

Either she acts like a child, super genius Seer or is a nymphomaniac (this seems to happen a lot in Lunarry and Lunar Harmony from what I've seen and heard over the years)

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
