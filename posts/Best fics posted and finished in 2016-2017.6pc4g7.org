#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** I may as well be hired as the marketer for this fic, but linkffn(Order of Mercy) is an amazing story focused on Percy, Bill, Fleur, Audrey, Oliver, etc. during the 7th year. It is a rollercoaster of emotions and close calls and even if you know how much of the story ends it still is a gripping ride. Really couldn't believe how attached I got to this fic. Someone's already recommended The Changeling and Divided and Entwined, both of which were very good as well.

  There are still people stuck in the past two years after the Final Battle. For some, the pain and grief is obvious, for others the struggles are hidden well, but make no mistake - everyone lost something. Without war looming the future is a promise, a prize to enjoy, but some people need to learn how to move on from what cannot be changed.
