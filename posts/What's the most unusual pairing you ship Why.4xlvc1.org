** I've been on the lookout for a Krum/Hermione 'ship where their relationship lasts past GoF, with the important proviso that the characters have to have to actually have their canon personalities of that period. (I understand that we don't get too much dialogue from Krum, but at least try to get Hermione --- particularly her flaws and rough edges --- right, dammit!)

I haven't really found anything I could recommend.

That said, I agree on the substance of it: just writing HP/HG + RW/HG as a stable arrangement where everybody is informed and consents, one already has to transgress several gender norms, and also including HP/RW in it, that transgresses yet another.

It takes a total retcon of her character, from a vengeful, strong and prideful woman to date someone whose own family and friends played a hand in killing her own family members and friends.

Do you reaaly think that Draco is unable to change the tiniest bit, because it's not shown in canon? No matter what happens to him?

If I write the story of a Draco, that rebels against his father, for exemple, like most teenagers do, and I have him behave like in canon, I'm pretty sure that I'm betraying the character. Yet you're telling me that I'm not.

When you write Fanfiction (and you're not making AU), you start at a point, with some characters from canon, and then those characters are going to grow differently than canon, because you have your own plot. And your characters don't live the same thing that they do in canon.

And beliefs do change in kids when they age (I should know about it, as I went from Christian when I was 13 to Atheist at 16, and I've personnaly known people that became racists or fascists in those same ages).

When Draco first boards the Hogwarts express, it's likely that he has never even met a muggleborn.

I'm not saying it's an easy ship, and I'm not saying that it's usually well done, but I am saying that it's a potentially interresting ship with a lot of conflict to fuel the story.

Draco is a little more than a pureblood fanatic in canon, just as Ginny is a little more than Ron's little sister.

It would be extremely difficult to do that well, yes. Far more difficult than Draco/Ginny.

You could however write the story of Hermione Granger that doesn't trusts the adults and authorities anymore and goes to war against the ministry of magic without betraying the character. Although following the authorities is one of the defining traits of Hermione.

Even Bellatrix/Harry or Bellatrix/Hermione, but not Draco/ginny? Why?

**** Yes, people do get confused by thinking Draco as Tom Felton, who almost ended up playing Harry or Ron.

On the other hand, the purpose of fanfics is to experiment. If authors can come up with all kinds of different Harrys, changing Draco to someone sympathetic or Ginny to some pureblood bimbo can also be done. That being said, I DON'T LIKE those fics and I will generally not read them.

**** I just searched for the pairing on ffn and sorted by favorites, and noticed that the shorter ones are better. There's only 36 results, and most are under 5 chapter romances.

linkffn(4416850)

this one was decent

linkffn(11154085)

This one is basically the story I want, but the writing is not that great, and Luna's voice is lost.

The first two results are both long and complete, but the hurt/comfort/romance tags make me a bit leery. Not to mention one of the stories has an allcaps warning for angst.

I liked Harry/Bellatrix in Delende Est but usually don't like that ship in other stories.

I know its very cringy, but it was written well in a fic I remember reading a long time ago (don't remember what it was), but it was Harry/Lily (as in his mother not his daughter). Harry got trapped in the past so that they were the same age, and it totally went all Back to the Future. Lily fell for him instead of James. Idk, it was written well enough that I liked it.

I ship a lot of other pairing as well but they're not that unusual (e.g. Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Tonnks, etc...)

*Equal and Opposite* was good but sort of dark. fem!Harry from another universe leaves him and Harry sort of loses it. He becomes obsessed with getting her back and pretty much becomes a Dark Lord himself.

*Self Reflection* is a newer WIP. I was really liking it, yet it hasn't been updated since May and I have a feeling its been abandonned, but I can always hope.

That and Harry/ any of the Gryffindor Chaser Trio have to be the most unusual, although you would think that that pairing would be a bit more prominent. (Though I suppose it could be stifled due to George/Angelina and Fred/Alicia)

All I will really say for the stories and why I enjoyed them myself is the author showed that the couple knows that what they're doing isn't acceptable because of the times they live in and because of who they are, but the hang ups that come with being who they are has caused them to turn to each other for love.

** Snape/Draco is my OTP. I like morally ambiguous/conflict characters.

I know there isn't a lot of conflict between them -- and that's probably why there are so few fics with this pairing, as opposed to say, Harry/Snape -- but I've always been intrigued by their characters and feel like it would be pretty damn easy to write a good story of these two getting together, even with conflict.

Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of great stories, it's almost all PWP, and the plottier fics tend to have some kind of established relationship between the two. I'd really like to see a great story of how they got together, like you see with the bigger pairings.

** I love to read about Harry/OC pairing; specially if the girl is either a self-insert or a muggle. Unfortunately there are not many well written finished stories like that.

*** What are the Harry/Oc stories that involve a self insert? I've always enjoyed SI's, but I find that there aren't too many longer ones when it comes too Harry Potter.

**** Unfortunately I can't recommend you any, because I don't have a habit of saving the ff I read. But I have come across a couple of stories where the writer wakes up at Hogwarts as a completely new Original Character... I prefer SI with OCs, instead of the writer take over another character...

** I don't really like anything that breaks canon. But I suppose my OTP (if I have such a thing) is my OFC/Sirius. And obviously I am the only person who likes it, because I invented it. So that makes it unusual. But it doesn't break canon anyway.

**** Yes, but not my oc.

ETA: OCs are not one character and I don't regard them as such. So my otp is Sirius/Julia.
