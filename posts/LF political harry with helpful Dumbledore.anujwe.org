Most political harry stories I see pit him against Dumbledore, either because harry is dark or because Dumbledore is manipulative. I'm wondering if anyone can reccomend any political stories where Dumbledore sides with harry.


** I mean, Harry doesn't really get extremely political until the very end (and really it'd be more accurate to say post-fic) but Dumbledore certainly doesn't oppose him or his views in A Black Comedy, though he does perhaps raise an eyebrow or feel a desire to act as the scolding parent at times in reaction to Harry's behavior, which in the Wizengamot tended to straddle the line between cheeky and impudent, while always being as audacious as possible.

** The issue I see here is that you're giving a nuclear arsenal a nuclear arsenal for help. Harry has the benefit of enormous amounts of public approval while Dumbledore seems to have the old wise and powerful wizard thing going for him.

Harry would definitely have plenty of support as long as he doesn't do something stupid to ruin it. It's very much a large amount of potential that doesn't take too much work to tap into completely.

Dumbledore seems to have a mediocre public opinion if the way he was dismissed after saying Voldemort has returned is anything to go by. The populace seems to have turned on him in an instant showing he was at least not held as a beacon of stability. If someone walked by and told me that a homeless man went insane, then I would be too surprised. If someone told me one of my former high school teachers went insane, then I'd be fairly skeptical given I knew fairly well how stable they were. The fact that they turned on him seems to me that Dumbledore falls into more of the former category.

The two combined would definitely be a force to be reckoned with to the point of dropping the US military on a tribe of people who just invented fire. There isn't much anyone could do outside of allegations about an /inappropriate relationship/ that actually could be effective. Weirdly enough, humans seem prone to accepting less likely things as true on the basis that nobody would like about something like that.

*** I got the impression that Dumbledore was very well respected, but the wizarding world really eat up propaganda.

Look how easily they turn on Harry in CoS, GoF and OotP, then how they mostly just go along with Voldemort's regime.

Somehow the, often utterly incompetent, ministry is able manipulate the whole country with ease.

**** The propaganda was definitely a factor, but it's the fact that the people didn't just shrug it off as typical clickbait. That it wasn't outside the realm of what the population would expect from him.

*** Dumbledore was his own greatest enemy during GoF/OotP. He cultivated a public image as an eccentric and that came to bite him on the ass when Fudge and Co. decided to smear him.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
