So I actually got the idea for this from an actually Well-written 'Dream/Coma' style theory on The WMG page for Harry Potter...

Some examples of how it goes include

-Harry's parents were killed in a car crash, and the other driver was named Tom Riddle

-The Dursley's were actually nice (albiet somewhat strict) people

-The Troll was actually just a mean dog in the neighborhood

-Dumbledore was the well liked principal of the school, who died from a heart attack while he was arguing with one of the teachers (Snape)


** another twist could be that its just the 7 years that Petunia and Vernon had to take care of harry as James and Lilly weren't killed in the crash, but sent into a coma themselves. the end of the story is harry going back to live with his parents again (they are probably still rather wealthy in this story imo) possibly still make them wizards but of a different type, heh
