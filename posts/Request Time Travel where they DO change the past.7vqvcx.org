I just read a fic where after a bunch of build up (like hundreds of pages) the main character isn't able to go back in time and change the past to save someone. And yes, we all have to accept death bla bla bla, some stuff is impossible bla bla, but I'm just so BORED of that trope. I want to read a fic where someone manages to change the past. I want to see someone look into the face of impossibility and go 'No thanks'.

Other impossibilities defied would be great too. Bringing someone's soul back after being kissed by a dementor. Fish hooking Sirius out of the veil (I thought for years it was a portal instead). A squib getting magic, etc.


** I probably know which fic you are talking about. I absolutely hate that kind of plot.

Fortunately, there are enough good fics that don't give a damn about â€˜time lines':

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Your request is a little bit confusing for me. I'm not exactly sure what you are currently looking for. Do you want timetravel stories which alter the original timeline? Because that's what your title suggests, but the description talks about something else.

  I have read many time travel fanfics, and I have always found them unrealistic. This is the story of what Harry Potter would really do if he traveled back in time. Accidental time travel, back in time to 11-year-old body, one-shot. No pairing.
