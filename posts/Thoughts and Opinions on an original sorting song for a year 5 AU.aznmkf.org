So, I've been working on a year five story for a while now (but I'm a slow-as-hell writer and have just the third iteration of the prologue written most of the way and about up to chapter 6 or 7 plotted out) and want to include an original sorting song, as I feel that the Hat giving the students a warning would be a good way to set the tone for a major story arc.

Anyways, my version hijacks a few lines from the original OotP song but is mostly my own work. I'll drop the complete text of the song below (it is about the same length as the OotP song itself, so about 450ish words) because I want people to tell me if I'm a madman or not for wanting to include it.

As an aside, I'm also giving Trelawney a third prophecy just so Dumbles has something to have a heart attack over. I might post that later. Or not.

The text of my lovely sorting song:

/Many, many years ago/

/A millennium long past./

/The Founders Four stood alone,/

/In this empty valley vast./

/They each sought to build a school,/

/a place of magic and of learning./

/They talked to each other and found/

/they shared the selfsame yearning./

/Thus Hogwarts school was born/

/and all went well for years./

/But Slytherin had worries/

/And he sounded out his fears./

“/How will the students be divided,/

/Once we're old and dead?”/

/For the founders had sep'rated their/

/Favorite students from among the many heads./

/For Slytherin, he chose those/

/of great cunning and ambition,/

/while Ravenclaw, she took the/

/students of clever intuition./

/Bold Gryffindor taught those with/

/Courage and bravery of soul/

/And Hufflepuff all who would/

/Work hard to reach a goal./

/Time passed, and Gryffindor/

/gave Slytherin a solution./

/He gave me life of a sort/

/So I could sort the students!/

/So Hogwarts worked well,/

/for numerous happy years./

/Then Gryffindor found Slytherin/

/working magics lost to time and fear./

/In Gryffindor's anger they argued fiercely,/

/Then the school shook as they dueled./

/Three to one, the other Founders/

/forced Slytherin from his beloved school./

/The three did not realize their folly/

/Till Slytherin decades had been gone./

/They were too late, they could not find him/

/The damage, sadly, had long since been done./

/Never since the Founders Four/

/became the Founders Three,/

/Have the four houses been united/

/Like they were meant to be./

/And each year as I sort you into Houses/

/I question if I should./

/But I must fulfill my given duty/

/And divide you as they would./

/This year, however, I'll go further,/

/Listen closely to what I say:/

/Know the perils, read the signs,/

/The warnings in our history on full display./

/Danger creeps up on Hogwarts,/

/Dread foes, they are approaching./

/This school holds many secrets,/

/And one, long held, is now unfolding:/

/The Four Founders knew that hard times/

/Would find Hogwarts in the future./

/So before the split they left a plan/

/To ensure their school endured./

/Those four are not as gone/

/As they would have you believe./

/In time of need they can return/

/To give Hogwarts a reprieve./

/Hogwarts, your Lost Founders/

/Have returned to you once more!/

/All four are here, amongst the crowd/

/Together again and Four./

/And all you who fight,/

/Who duel in Hogwarts' halls./

/The time has come, unite at last!/

/For the Founders watch you all./

/Now I have gone on for long enough./

/Your patience is wearing thin./

/I have told you, tried to warn you,/

/Let the Sorting now begin./

Cheers all. Erebus out.


** Honestly, I just assume 100% of people skim over the sorting hat song, whether its original or not.

*** It adds nothing in 95% of the stories and therefore no one bothers to see if any particular fic defies the expectations.

*** I agree.

Nobody actually gave a shit about that song, whether in canon or in the fandom, as it remained totally inconsequential to the plot progression.

**** That is in fact what I am trying to reverse with this song. The information given in it will be influential to the story and a key part of that particular arc of the story.

Whether anyone cares about that inversion is debatable however.
