What's the most well-written fic that you've read? And by well-written, I mean good writing, good spelling, grammar, and syntax or good descriptions, et cetera. Or alternatively, which are the fics where the writing style is so atrocious that it's physically revolting?

Personally, I really enjoy fics that make good use of language, and I absolutely hate those that have a typo, spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistake once every sentence. I mean, I can condone a few mistakes or typos, and I even expect them (I'd be a hypocrite if I said I didn't make any myself) but there's a point above which something is definitely wrong.

What are the spelling or formatting ignobilities that you've seen so much they become pet peeves?

My pet peeve is definitely the absence of correct quotation formatting:

#+begin_quote
  "Omigod" Harry said "holy crap" "What is it?" said Hermione. Harry added "I just realized something"
#+end_quote

One fic I believe makes a very good use of language is That Terrifying Momentum by Caleb Nova, linkffn(3488634). It doesn't hurt that the story is hilarious and wonderful.


** Looking at the replies, I am a bit disappointed in the responses so I'll give my two cents.

What I assume you're asking for is beautiful prose not necessarily language as prose encompasses more: (usually) good grammar, diction, syntax, style, and descriptions. However, beautiful prose is subjective in nature.

Let's start with grammar. I agree with you, good grammar is appealing and bad grammar is repulsive. However, that's not always the case. There are times where something that is grammatically correct is superior is not the best choice. And I don't mean this to say that grammar is optional - because it's not - but grammar is too overvalued as an objective truth in the fiction genre. For most normal people, it would be wise to follow grammatical standards, however, the best writers forgo grammar at times in order to evoke a better feeling or emotion. Though this is rarely, if ever, done in fanfiction.

Diction is also a tricky one. While recognizing something as a stronger word is quite easy, many fail at using these words effectively. Quite often in fanfiction, you see what I call the "token" or "thesaurus" writers.

"Token" writers are what I use to describe a person who discovered one really good word or phrase and just ran with it. For example, I have found many stories where the author has a love for the word monotonous and every conversation and interaction is monotonous. While I agree that, in certain instances, monotonous is much better that boring, when using a very specific word like monotonous, most writers overdo it.

The other is the thesaurus writer. We all know this person. They are the type of people to take a sentence like this:

#+begin_quote
  The green cat ran away from the fast car.
#+end_quote

and turn it into this:

#+begin_quote
  The virescent feline skedaddled away from the rapidly forthcoming automobile.
#+end_quote

It's just jarring and reeks of auteurism.

Looking to published authors I find that most of the authors who like to flaunt their literary skills are generally less popular and less read as a result. The goal of the author is to tell a story. Using needlessly complex language to show how smart one is only sets the bar higher for the average reader. Few are knowledgeable enough in English to understand it, some passion through it, but most quit. That's why I usually find "complex" words to be of little use in most instances except trying to be specific about an object if its useful to the plot or atmosphere (for example constructions workers will be driving pickups, not cars). In the end, words are how you use them and having better words does not always lend to a better-written story.

Syntax is probably the second most standardized aspect of writing besides grammar. Most authors know that active voice is better than passive voice. And most authors realize that, generally, the most important part of the sentence comes first, not last. I have not really found many problems with syntax as I only read authors who have a grasp of grammar and usually good syntax comes with good grammar.

Spelling shouldn't be optional. Bad spelling just reeks of laziness.

Style is probably the most subjective of the bunch and something that you really can't always pin down. Some styles just work, others don't.

So, you might ask, what was the point of this post? You haven't really said anything, Seylliani.

And, yes, I haven't said much about stories that have great prose. Why? Because they're far and few between.

With all things said above, I generally consider great prose to be lyrical prose and lyrical prose is almost never done in fanfiction. So you might ask, why?

There are the various reasons. Chiefly, is the age of the authors. We all know that fanfiction is largely written by young people much of whom have not been introduced to the upper echelons of literature.

Secondly, many writers limit their reading to fanfiction. This is problematic as most writers grow by reading and fanfiction is not the pinnacle of well-written work. That's why you can see a lot of fanfiction authors have incredibly similiar vocabularies and style.

And lastly, I'd say that, of the people who could write beautiful lyrical prose, many don't because it's risky. Take this quote from The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (really good book by the way).

#+begin_quote
  IT WAS NIGHT AGAIN. The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.

  The most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. If there had been a wind it would have sighed through the trees, set the inn's sign creaking on its hooks, and brushed the silence down the road like trailing autumn leaves. If there had been a crowd, even a handful of men inside the inn, they would have filled the silence with conversation and laughter, the clatter and clamor one expects from a drinking house during the dark hours of night. If there had been music... but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.

  Inside the Waystone a pair of men huddled at one corner of the bar. They drank with quiet determination, avoiding serious discussions of troubling news. In doing this they added a small, sullen silence to the larger, hollow one. It made an alloy of sorts, a counterpoint.

  The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the wooden floor underfoot and in the rough, splintering barrels behind the bar. It was in the weight of the black stone hearth that held the heat of a long dead fire. It was in the slow back and forth of a white linen cloth rubbing along the grain of the bar. And it was in the hands of the man who stood there, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight.

  The man had true-red hair, red as flame. His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty that comes from knowing many things.

  The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn's ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.

It's beautiful, it invokes strong imagery, but it's not crystal clear and it requires much more thinking. Beautiful prose is an art that many don't have the time for, andl, worst of all, many readers don't appreciate.

Now to answer your question, there are a few authors who stand above the rest.

Sesc (SeriousScribble): His writing is flowery in the most praising sense. His descriptions are magnificent and of all the authors I've read in the fandom he probably uses the most complex sentence structure of all, which is very appealing. Unatoned is a very hit or miss story with some, but the writing is incredible.

Joe: I noticed someone said his prose was purple at times. That's wrong. Purple prose is nothing objective. It's subjective in nature. Prose is only purple when it is odd or offputting. Joe's stories are shamelessly epic in nature. But that's his style and the "purple prose" is actually necessary for it to work.

Swimdraconian: Hands down the best writer in the fandom. His prose is beautiful and minimalistic at the same time. He uses just enough to get is message across. If you haven't read his story DO IT. DO IT NOW.

In conclusion, great prose is hard to come by. I, for one, throughout all my life have been stellar English student. Perfect scores on the SAT, ACT, and AP tests, yet I cannot write beautiful prose. It's out of my reach at the moment. Yet, I like many others, can appreciate great prose. And, if you wish to read the most beautiful prose, I'd honestly recommend published work. For all of fanfiction's gems, it is, after all, fanfiction. Beautiful prose needs time and editors to come to its fullest fruition. If you want a fantasy story with beautiful prose, I highly recommend The Kingkiller Chronicle. It's simply magnificent. And the prose is almost lyrical.

*** I definitely agree with you on the grammar; I should have written it as good /use/ of grammar, because you're absolutely right that sometimes bad grammar enriches the story (usually in dialogue).

And spelling is where my main problem lies. To be honest, like I said, a few errors don't bother me, but when the author appears to write a story and hand it to the reader, /accipe hoc/, seemingly without a single reread or beta, then I get annoyed. I can understand missed mistakes, but if you misspell a word four times in a row in four different ways, would it be amiss to open a dictionary, hundreds of which are available at your fingertips on the very device you're probably writing the story on?

Where token writers are concerned, I definitely have noticed a few of those, and their style unfortunately suffers for it. New words are good, but moderation is key. I have found myself almost falling to the temptation of doing this once in a while. It isn't pretty.

Personally, I haven't been a very good English student, unfortunately, but I'd like to think I've read enough well-written books that I can appreciate good prose. It's a little vain, but when confronted worth a poorly- written story, I find myself wanting to fix it.

Thanks for the quite comprehensive answer! (I'll admit this was mostly an excuse to rant.) Thank you also for the recs!

** Nonjon, Newcomb, Enembee, Chem Prof, JBern, Matt Silver, White Squirrel.

There are tons of authors that are excellent at the technical aspects of writing and editing even if their plots are not appealing to certain readers. Even Robst, for as much shit as we gice him for his overdone and cringey plots, never has any noticeable editing errors. Usually threads like these come down to "what is your favorite fic?" So in no particular order:

1. Cauterize by Lady Altair
2. A Black Comedy by Nonjon
3. Browncoat, Green Eyes by Nonjon
4. Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver

** There are plenty of authors who write functionally and edit their work. I have a hard time thinking of any who have /great/ prose.

linkffn(Proud by Summer Leigh Wind) probably has the best writing in a long-form fic I can think of.

The prose in linkffn(Cauterize) is a bit cheesy, but works well.

The latest chapters of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) have been excellently written, especially the dialogue (in earlier chapters, the characters tend to monologue).

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

*** yeah i cannot come up with any prose stylists in hpfanfiction. the closest might be joe, although it strays into purple territory.

for my money the best top to bottom grammar and diction is in hpmor. the characters sound like they should, which is very important -- harry shouldn't use the same diction as dumbledore, etc.

with that said, you're right, there are quite a few authors who have essentially perfect grammar. the life and times, stages of hope, everything by newcomb and enembee as suggested above.
