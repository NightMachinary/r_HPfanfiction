Anyone know of any good fanfics ( Preferably on Fanfiction.net) where Harry's name gets pulled out of the Goblet of Fire, but he isn't attending Hogwarts at the time. Like either summoned by owl or 'teleported' by Goblet magic. It could be wbwl or whatever.

Edit: He doesnt NEED to be teleported by the Goblet, that was just an opinion on how he got to Hogwarts.

Harry Brown is a crossover between Harry Potter and Mrs Brown's Boys (imagine if the Weasleys were Irish Muggles and you've got the gist). He attends a school in Ireland, I think.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

** There's one where Harry skipped the feast and was in a room at The Three Broomstcks having... relations with Narcissa when his name was called. The Goblet summoned them both. "Mom?!"

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  An aged, broken Jedi general came to Earth hoping to retire. However, when he went to a park and saw a young boy with unlimited Force potential getting the snot beat out of him, he knew the Force was not through making his life interesting.
