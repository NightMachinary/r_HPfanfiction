I'd really like to read a novel which puts a lot more focus into either of them. I don't want them to just end up a couple (because the characters I know just don't fit together) but maybe a Neville POV or a Luna POV. Maybe one which lets Luna shine through. She is after all an incredibly open-minded and brilliant witch. Haven't really read any good Neville POVs at all...(which I find surprising)

I'd like it to be fairly long as I want a fleshed out story and not fluff.
