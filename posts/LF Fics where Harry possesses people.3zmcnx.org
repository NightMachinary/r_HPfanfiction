like the title says, I'm looking for fics where Harry possesses people, either by completely taking over the person, having a symbiotic relationship with one or using him/her to extert his/her will on the mortal world. Especially the last one would be interesting :)

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

  Harry enters Hogwarts under strange circumstances where he is sorted into Slytherin. Not what he expected when he fell down the stairs and died at home on Dudley's eleventh birthday. Possession would have been Harry's last guess at a second chance.AU1styr
