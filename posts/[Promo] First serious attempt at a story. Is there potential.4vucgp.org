** Well, for as long as we are nitpicking, “accio'd” is not a word; “accioed” could be, and “summoned” would probably work better (for the same reason you'd write that someone got “disarmed” rather than “expelliarmus'd”, or why you'd write “tortured” or maybe “crucioed” rather than “crucio'd”). I do realise that so many people are doing it that the practice of adding an apostrophe and a “d” might seem like a legit way of changing nouns to verbs, but it really isn't.

That said, it is really just nitpicking, and it's all I managed to get since I only had a few minutes before going to work so I didn't really read it yet. I should have time for that ... tomorrow, maybe, or the day after, and I'll write what I think about it as a whole then.

*** Thanks! English is my second language so a lot of my syntax and grammar is influenced by books, Reddit and fanfiction, so it's a huge help to have someone nitpick. :) I'm curious to see what you think of it as a whole.

** NO

...

I kid, I kid. I find the idea intriguing. Spelling and grammar looks good. A couple spots didn't seem to have the best flow, but that is true of everything except Tolkien. I would say that the summary would be better without the "Slice of life" sentence, and HG is already stated with the tags on the story, so that's redundant. You also don't need to repeat the summary in the first chapter. I don't know why people do that, but it isn't really needed. Or is it because of a mobile thing? If that's the case, ignore that. And I'd move the author's note to the end. Always better at the end, because it more easily allows a reader to skip it if not interested.

Keep on with the word-forging.

Edited for clarity.

*** Hmm, well, I'll add to that that the author's note could be kept at the beginning if it is a first-chapter-only thing, which it should be unless there are really important reasons to write anything of this stuff (any notifications about delays or replies to people should instead be added to the profile or via PMs, and the same about justifications about why you chose to do this-or-that to the plot); that way the readers will have it out of the way first and will be able to enjoy the story.

**** There's just something about an author's note at the end that feels a bit more appropriate to me. Like a bit of a send off for the end of the chapter. Plus my skip over argument, since there are those who don't like author's notes.

***** I mean, yeah, it's better to have them at the end if they are a regular thing or if it's a chapter-by-chapter thing, with that I agree. But if it's supposed to be one big work that's simply separated into chapters, I think it is better than that even to have it simply contained to the very first chapter (or even its own chapter before that) and no more of them later, sort of like a foreword. Of course it is better if the whole thing is at the end of it, the same way you can find notes at the end of some books, but due to fanfiction usually not being published all at once, one would have to move those notes which is kind of weird ... and that's what I mean, really.

But yeah, there are way too many words in general wasted on author's notes that aren't necessary and only take place. Had people managed to make it one page or two out of a few hundred pages' worth, it wouldn't be an issue, but it is because people go overboard and ... yeah.

*** Thanks for the tips! I wasn't planning on adding an Author's Note to other chapters, but I'll move it down for this one. :)
