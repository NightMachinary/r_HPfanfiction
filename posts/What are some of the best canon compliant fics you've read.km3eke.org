  Molly's children do not know much about her second cousin, besides him being an accountant or something. She has a good reason to keep her family in the dark.

** Who's suggesting All The Young Dudes?? Is it me? It's me ðŸ˜Š.

Its a Marauders history following Remus Lupin. You get a better insight into the first war and Werewolves and why Sirius suspected him as spy and Remus through school as he grows into himself and it's completely brilliant and you'll cry and fa in love with Grant.

You have to read it. Please.

*** This is a great fic, has beautiful writing, clever use of music and wonderfully era-compliant, but I would hesitate to call it canon compliant because of characterization. Remus in particular reads like an OC (to me at least), the edgy, brilliant cool one of the gang with a non-canon backstory and with a lot of new werewolf lore. Quite far removed from mild, brisk, shy educator Remus from canon.

**** Really!?? Wild I don't get that at all! I think he's very canon compliant.

I can't spoil it but when we see Remus in PoA he is clever and fierce but caring but quiet. Which is perfect for the guy who's been living out of the loop with depression for 12 years. There's enough trauma there to give rise to PoA Remus. I think the rough whatsit backstory set him up nicely to being the obvious warrior we see in the last few books. I never saw him as that timid and bookish in the books really, more commanding I suppose so it fed in well for me?

I just love the evolution of the characters. How he really grows and matures into himself over time it's really fun to watch! It feels a lot more on par with who Remus is than a shy kid the entire time? But that's just me ðŸ˜Š it's interesting to hear people have a different view ðŸ˜Š

***** Ha maybe it's just me then :) it is a great fic, and I think it's amazing that the author finished such a long and consistently good piece of writing. I also loved Grant, I still think he might be one of the best OCs in the fandom.

I'm referring mostly to the ooc-ness of Remus the teenager. It's been a while since I read this, but I remember thinking Remus was a complete OC but with some of Sirius's characteristics at the time. To be fair I can't quite remember what Sirius's character was like now in this fic so I won't comment on that (except how vain he is about his looks in the last bit of the story, which I remember being annoyed by). But Remus is aggressive, assertive and gets by fine on his own as a teen in this fic and I didn't get that impression at all in canon, although of course that might be my interpretation. To me he is also very much the stereotypical cool kid in AtYD, which I think James and Sirius were in canon. And I think it is objective to say that his backstory is not canon compliant, think there's something about that in the authors notes as well.

I think Remus as a kid would have been mild-mannered, bookish, repressed and eager to please his friends because he's so scared of losing them. I don't think we see much of that in AtYD, partly because of his new backstory. I will say I also think the war changed him a bit and he would have grown fiercer and battle-hardened, and also become cynical and disillusioned later in life, which I agree that we see in him as a grown-up. But I don't think we see any of that in the very few canon flash-backs to his teens we get in canon.
