It was suggested that there be individual threads for recommendations for particular pairings. As someone who especially favours Harry/Ron I thought I might start this one.

[[http://harry-and-ron.livejournal.com/][The Harry/Ron livejournal community]]

[[http://www.thrihyrne.net/FWtW.html][Fling Wide the Whirlwind by Thevina]] 'Immortality- it sounds appealing. Not, however, if it's forced on you, you're Obliviated afterwards, and you're handfasted, realising your partner will grow old without you.' - The best of her fics I've read although the rest are worth a look too. Good plot and well written smut! (NC-17)

[[http://kerryblaze.livejournal.com/187674.html][The Next Great Adventure by kerryblaze]] 'Harry has a chat with an old friend and learns that he is ready for another adventure.' I defy you not to cry. (PG-13)

I'll add more later hopefully, if anyone's interested of course.

EDIT: A little late but the [[http://harryronholiday.livejournal.com/][harry/ron holiday]] community members have been posting their annual exchange of seasonal slash!


** I think setting up threads by pairings is a great idea! It seriously makes searching for relevant fanfictions so much easier. :)

** Oh man I love this pairing so much. A big part of me honestly feels like it could happen as the characters are.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/maddy/HTMABS.html][this]] is one of my favorite things in the entire world. I'm seriously depressed that the author didn't finish it.
