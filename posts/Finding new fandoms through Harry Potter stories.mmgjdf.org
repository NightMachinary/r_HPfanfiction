Have you guys and gals ever read a crossover Harry Potter story that got you so into whatever was crossed that you just had to learn more about it. Then when you learnt more you wanted to read other fanfics about it.

That's how I got into reading My Hero Academia. I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20842904][May Death Bless You]]

What fandoms did you discover through a Harry Potter Fic?


** I've found quite a few that way. Some of the more notable ones are Worm, MHA, RWBY, game of thrones, and a variety of others. MHA, RWBY and worm all have a large number of stories that I love while GOT is more limited. Honestly I've been reading a lot of worm lately and would highly recommend giving it a glance if you haven't heard of it. A massively oversimplified summary of it with no real spoilers is it's marvels X-men/mutants where to get powers you have to have a horrible day and also Godzilla style monsters attacking every few months as well. There's a lot of variety in the powers shown which I really like.
