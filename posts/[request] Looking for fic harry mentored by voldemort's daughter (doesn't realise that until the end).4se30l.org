Hey,

does anyone know the title of the fic where Harry is mentored by Voldemort's daughter (who is, herself, a horcrux - Harry falls in love with her but has to kill her at the end of the story). Harry has some kind of shadow mage power (some extra power, I don't exactly remember which one). Voldemort's daughter is the expert on that power and the only one who can help Harry with it. I also remember her being of Asian descent, an Inuit I think?

Pretty long story and completed as far as I remember. I just can't remember the title... Would be wonderful if someone could help me out! :)

*** (I know it doesn't really matter to me anymore but just in case anyone should be interested:) Her name is Tura. I think she is as old as Harry, perhaps slightly older but not by much. She is appointed as the new DADA teacher by Dumbledore, who knows that she is the perfect person to help Harry with his new power. Harry is still going to school, it must be his 7th year. He is definitely still at Hogwarts. The story is told from Harry's POV and is about 340,000 words long ;)

** Is it Harry Potter and the Heirs of Slytherin by Fawkes_07? The only place I know to find it is The Petulant Poetess - I was just rereading it!
