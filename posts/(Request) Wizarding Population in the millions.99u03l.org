Instead of ten thousand. That's a ridiculously small number. Whoever thought this was a good idea is an idiot. A population can't survive with such low numbers. Stagnation, disease, and if not epidemic ever hits, there goes most of the population.

I'm looking for fanfics where the wizarding numbers in the millions.

EDIT:

Sorry, I wrote this on my phone. Stupid auto-correct.

Also, please no harems.


** It doesn't really have much bearing on the plot itself, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Untitled-Tome][/Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/]] the global wizarding populating is much higher.

#+begin_quote
  "There are several areas in that region deemed unfit to live by Muggles. They've cited radiation levels as the culprit, but that's only a cover story in several places. You see, while we are around four hundred thousand strong in the British Isles, the capital of the Eastern Magical Republic in Ukraine is home to five /million/ magical Beings in total. They're doing very well for themselves -- I mean, surely you'd think the Muggles wonder where all this extra grain is being exported from."

*** Just to clarify this quote: when Doge says "Beings", that's exactly what he means. I'd imagine that it would be quite a bit more difficult to record an exclusively wizarding census for several reasons, though the most pertinent issues here are blood/breed status and accessibility. Some wizards might not wish to participate and would have the resources to do so, while the question of including/excluding half-breeds and the like is muddy territory.

So while the world is a fuckton larger than it is in canon, the reported numbers do take other magical creatures into consideration.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** Magical population has always bothered me in this. The world building makes it seem like there are a lot more than people write about. If you just take the population of the British isles in 2000 (58.8 million), and there are only 10k magicals, that is just 0.01701 % of the population. I find it diffacult to imagine that magicals could even find each other with that low of a percentage, especially when you look at population levels when the "founders" were around. Would the magical population even justify an entire castle for a school (or a school of any kind). The estimated population of the British isles around 1100 AD was 1.9 million people, using the above magical calculation, that would be 325 magicals around when Hogwarts was founded. Also, i feel like the size of the magical government is not justified by just 10k magical people, let alone 325 people.

​

However, if the magical population is just .5% of total population, then that would be 294,000 people alone, which would justify a large school, and the government.

Yes it can. Easily. They could do it with only 1000. Humanity has been at points where there were only a few thousand humans alive. And we bounced back from that. But with magic? They'd have no problem.

****** From the number of muggle-borns and half-bloods among the people whose breeding we know, we can deduce that a relatively high proportion of wizards (a quarter?) have two or more non-wizard grand-parents. This probably means a much more varied gene pool.

(Given the lack of information about how wizard society and economy functions, it's not clear if the non-wizards are mostly magical bloodlines who lost their magic or isolated communities under the sway of wizards.)

******** I don't understand.

Wizards clearly haven't stopped reproducing - that's where the pure-bloods and half-bloods are coming from.

The only way a lot of breeding would change the genetic pools variety (assuming the same percentage and penetration of out-breeding) would be through benign mutations, which aren't common enough to make a noticeable difference.

Unless you think most wizards aren't breeding and a few are having a lot of kids?

** From what I understand a population definitetly can survive with 10,000 individuals or less (they initially theorized that humanity had such a bottleneck I believe). Magic would also be extraordinarily helpful to avoid normal issues resulting from small population numbers I imagine.

But yeah, I have never liked small population idea for the wizarding world. You might like Latet Anguis in Herba and Ignite, the world feels much larger with more newspapers and lots of pockets of magic over the world-secret islands and cities.

***** That kind of depends on how many those are percentage wise. The problem with that is they seem to have been with about the same numberof people for a long time. That means a rather low birthrate for a long time. While there not being that many muggle-wizard marriages as that would create population growth.

That low birthrate combined with marrying into the same group (even non purebloods have not that much options) means there is a rather limited gene pool making them prone to desease and overall declining health.
