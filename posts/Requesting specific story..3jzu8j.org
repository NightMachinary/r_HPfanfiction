Hi. So, I don't remember much. I just remember Harry getting a new haircut and buying a golden Griffin earring. Any idea on what story it was? Oh and he also broke his leg.

If you know the story, do you think it's worth reading? I like stories where Harry realistically develops into a strong young man.
