Fics that are light-hearted, low tension and fluffy of Harry and his peers being kids and learning magic at Hogwarts. No dark lords, no wars, no politics, just pure fluff.

Bonus points if the fic uses the full ensemble cast of characters.

A good example would be Saphroneth's Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]]

NO BASHING


** I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576]] and it's lovely. It's a Slytherin Harry story and I enjoy everyday bits enormously.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** It's not exactly what you want, and holy baloney is the timeline screwed in order for all the pop-culture references to make sense but...

Early [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10051784/1/Uchiha-of-Ravenclaw][Uchiha of Ravenclaw]] and whenever Harry is not around in this fic is very Slice of Life.

Femslashy though... and suffers from the stations of canon on the Harry Potter side of things. There's also the Naruto side during summer breaks that breaks away from the Slice of Life way of things into an action adventure about a teenage mercenary, which is a more fancy way of saying Naruto Ninja in English. It's also a crossover.
