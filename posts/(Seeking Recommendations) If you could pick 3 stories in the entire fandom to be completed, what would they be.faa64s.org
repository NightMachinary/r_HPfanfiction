** People have already picked A Long Journey Home, the Nightmares of Futures Past and Unlike a Sister so I'll have to go with

1. linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader)
2. linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li)
3. linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama)

I was going to include linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) but that one is still updating albeit slowly. And in case anyone is wondering why I'm not including anything by [[/u/Te7]], it's because I know he *is* working on his stories but we keep getting distracted by whisky, soccer, baseball and every other topic that seems interesting. Most recently, Kinder eggs and their availability in the USA.

*** Out of spite I'm now done working on anything and retiring from fanfiction.

I was going to make a crack about how maybe I should have just asked gryffindortom to write the last scene because I sure couldn't but i didn't want to date myself. So instead I'm just giving up.

**** Hey dude, what's up. I'm not gonna ask you to continue your stories(because I know how life can get), but don't put too much stock into someone commenting on your life. They don't know you, and frankly, don't give them the satisfaction to know they've gotten to you. Have a great day, and if you quit writing, have a great life.

***** I'm just giving him shit. [[/u/rpeh]] and I converse almost daily about various things ranging to fanfiction to whisky, to his love for waffles, Boris Johnson, and Manchester United.

I'm curious as to which of those three he flips out on.

I've been having a very difficult time writing a specific scene in Ithaca (so difficult in fact that I wrote an entire other story in December rather than work on it. And I certainly didn't write the first chapter of a Harry/Daphne fic as well in that time no matter what anyone tells you >.>) and it's led to lots of complaining by me about mostly nothing in the last few months.

Mostly I'm just being a troll.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
