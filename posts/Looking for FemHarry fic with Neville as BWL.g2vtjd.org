:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic a while back with a fem Harry and Neville as boy who lived. I remember that James Potter was given Sirius Black Status (The "Traitor" to the BWL family) and as put in Azkaban while Lily died a while later. Fem Harry was in Slytherin as a pariah and the Golden Trio was of Neville, Ron, and an OC son of Sirius Black. I also remember FHarry having some kind of freakout at Dumbledore somewhere around the 20th chapter or somewhere close.


** linkffn(11517506) ... I really liked the setup (and no, Neville was WBWL, the true one was fem!Harry), but later (especially after the second year) it got into weird almighty!Harry and ultramagical, and I stopped reading somewhere there.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
