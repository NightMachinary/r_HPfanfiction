:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic where some characters go to a 'play' that takes place in a pensieve-like device. The viewers can follow along with different story paths that eventually converge. Lockhart is the main character in the play. This was a minor scene in what I feel like was a fairly popular fic, but can't remember where I read it.


** I know it's a fem harry fic because harry was friends with Daphne who took her there. Let me check my history.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
