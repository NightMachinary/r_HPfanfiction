** Minister Hermione Weasley successfully frees the House Elves, giving them full citizenship including the right to vote. Next election, a hardline conservative whom even the Death Eater sympathisers consider a bit extreme runs for the position of Minister for Magic. He campaigns on a platform of abolishing weekends, cancelling Christmas, repealing all workers' rights, and restoring corporal punishment to Hogwarts.

The House Elves love his policies and vote for him in massive numbers, ejecting Hermione from power and ushering in a new era which sets magical Britain back hundreds of years in social progress.

** How is fairytale-like bad? Fairytale-like is good. Now fairytale-/ending/-like, you've got a point. But I don't go to /Harry Potter/ for realistic.

So what's left is, how to make the next-gen universe be more interesting than in canon? Well, basic idea first, how about one of those myriad children is actually evil? For example, Rose Granger-Weasley could be evil, instead of being Hermione 2.0.

Hermione as Minister would, I feel, push a /lot/ more reforms than what she appears to have done by /Cursed Child/. Abolish House-Elf slavery for good, make the Ministry efficient if she has to drag it there kicking and screaming, have wizards colonize Mars, etc. Try and get more Muggle science & arts into the Hogwarts curriculum. And so on. All this would have the flipside that maybe she's doing too much too fast and the Wizarding World is close to coming apart at the seams, not to mention the growing tensions with the I.C.W., who don't look too keenly on Hermione and a growing to suspect her of being some kind of new Grindelwald in disguise. I could also see the wand-wanting Goblin factions trying to take advantage of her for their own not-entirely-noble-minded ends. There is a /lot/ of story potential there.

As the new Head of Auror Department, Harry Potter would be painting an even bigger target on himself and his family than he had by just being the Boy Who Lived. Every ambitious Dark Wizard on the planet would be trying to get the best of him. You could play it for laughs or for drama, but if Harry isn't foiling at least one assassination attempt a month, I'm not buying it.

If you're going to have Delphini Riddle, have Delphini Riddle, but then do something interesting with her; as is she feels as big a wasted opportunity as movies!Barty, an interesting villain who spends 99 percent of their already limited screentime in disguise. Delphini strikes me as someone who'd have obsessively studied all she could find out of her father's history and methods, who'd see Voldemort kind of like young Tom Riddle saw Salazar Slytherin --- with an almost religious devotion mixed with a firm belief that (s)he can live upto, and maybe even surpass, this glorious ancestor. Unsupported Flight would just be the first step: my Delphini would be recreating the Dark Mark from scratch, making her own Horcruxes with failsafes against Basilisk Venom, founding her own order of Death Eaters and making them all swear Unbreakable Vows to her so that none turn Snape. In a kind of dark counterpart to my above Minister Hermione, she too could be overreaching, amassing more power than she can handle and being forced to near breaking point by the hole she's dug herself into. A key point is that while clearly being evil, Delphini /shouldn't/ be an actual psychopath like Voldemort; she is fully capable of human emotion.

...Thoughts?

Andromeda raises her together with Teddy, Harry gets the ultimate revenge against Voldemort by having his daughter call him Daddy (wait, that sounds wrong). She feels like the best example to argue nurture over nature instead of trying to make Scorpius basically whitewashed Draco like the shippers already see him or making AD the token "Good Slytherin" (a role which Andromeda already fills in canon).

Like, the reader expects her to be the second coming of Hitler given that she is the offspring of Riddle and his right hand, but all we get is a cute teenager who tries to matchmake Teddy and Victorie or something like that.

** Oh, I have multiple plot ideas that are all Epilogue compliant, but are absolutely not fairytale like. For example, you can read my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][one shot]], linkffn(12925628), for the occasion of BoH's 20th anniversary. It's mostly about hardball politics and public manipulations. There is reference to a "Skeeter Conspiracy", and here is a scene I wrote:

First of all, [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-final-live-report][here is the canon background about the incident]].

[Hermione's Office in DMLE, the day after]

#+begin_quote
  Hermione: Well, Ginny, it seems you have gotten yourself really into trouble this time.

  Ginny: You got a problem with that, Hermione? I thought better of you. This Skeeter bitch stepped over the line and I taught her a lesson. I regret nothing!

  Hermione: Calm down, Ginny. My staff told me that several opinion pieces calling for your head appeared on Daily Prophet as soon as the game was over. Almost too fast in my opinion, as if they had anticipated your response.

  Ginny: What? You mean that I had been set up?

  Hermione: Possibly, so far we have no proof, and Skeeter hasn't woken up yet. Your really put some power into your hex. It could have killed her.

  Hermione: Anyway, I have already mobilized our Network to stage a rally outside the Daily Prophet's Diagon Alley office later today. They will be calling for Skeeter's head instead and demanding an end to her slanderous pieces. Luna and Lee will soon publish their articles about possible conspiracy. They will encourage her slander victims to make a stand. Once the accusations are coming in, we will have a valid pretext to bring her in. Harry, you need your Aurors to put Skeeter under ‘protection' soon. We couldn't afford some of our radical followers to harm her, and we couldn't let whoever are behind her to silence her.

  Harry: Thank you Hermione, you are always a step ahead of me. I love you.

  Harry: So, you believe there is a conspiracy behind her sudden attack against us?

  Hermione: Again, no proof yet. Once she wakes up, you will be conducting your standard procedure. It's better to be overcautious one hundred times than to let our guard down once. Constant Vigilance!

  Ginny: If there was a conspiracy, I doubt her backers would have exposed their true identities. They would be all polyjuiced anyway.

  Harry: Then we just have to be clever about it. I'm sure Hermione had already put her thought into this matter.

  Hermione: First, we need to establish that Skeeter is part of a conspiracy, which I'm very certain about it. This will change the public narratives and give us the initiative. I will coordinate with our friends in the DoM to step up our surveillance effort, and we will make a big splash in the press and on the street. That should hopefully scare off our enemies into doing something stupid, so we can catch them in the act. Harry, you know what to do.

  Harry: Well, let's get started then!
#+end_quote

--------------

[Later, DMLE Interrogation Room #4]

#+begin_quote
  Skeeter: You can't do this to me! I shall expose you all! This is a blatant abuse of power...

  Auror 1: Cut the crap, Skeeter. We know everything about you. Let's see what we've got here... Yes, 157 accusations of slander and defamation, more coming in by the hours. Well, you already confessed under Veritaserum that you were bribed by certain subversive elements to set up Mrs Potter. Of course, we know you are an illegal animagus too.

  Skeeter: Granger. She kidnapped me back then, held me captive for two weeks, and then still had the nerve to blackmail me. I will let the whole world know what she did...

  Auror 1: Nobody cares. Madam Granger is a great war hero and reformer, and you are just one yellow press journo who lied, slandered, and pandered to the lowest of the rabbles. Whom is the world going to believe? Besides, what happened during the War is all covered under Minister Shacklebolt and Wizengamot's Blood War Exemption Act. You were conspiring with Lucius Malfoy back then to commit character assassinations of Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr Potter, and Miss Granger. So you were basically one of them who had escaped justice for too long! But no more, we now have enough evidence to send you to Azkaban forever.

  Auror 1 pulled out a jar and a let a beetle out, and crushed it with his fist.

  Auror 1: Skeeter, now it's time to carefully consider your options. Fully cooperate with us for leniency, or end up worse than this beetle.

  Skeeter after a long pause: If I fully cooperate, how much leniency can I expect? And how do I cooperate?

** Hermione is in the legislative branch, not the executive branch. She wouldn't be the Minister, but the puppeteer /behind/ the Minister (who in my headcanon, is Percy - he's gullible enough to never realize that /Hermione/ is the actual person in charge). I think Hermione would be the Head of the DMLE or a similar position. Later in life, after Ron's had his fun, they get married and have one or two children (post-2010). They're still very close to Harry, and even though Rose's hair is the bright Weasley red, Rita Skeeter speculates that Rose is actually Harry's daughter.

Harry never prioritized Ginny enough. Even though they get back together after the war, she breaks up with him after about a year and she joins the Quidditch team, where she defines herself as /Ginny Weasley/, not Harry Potter's girlfriend. They never get back together but they remain good friends. All of the Weasleys consider him a part of the family and their children call him Uncle Harry.

With Harry's help as a favor to Narcissa, Draco serves only 4 years in Azkaban, the minimum charge for attempted murder. Lucius brings his own sentence down to 20 years by cooperating and giving the names of Death Eaters/allies.

Harry makes sure his godson gets the childhood he never had. Teddy spends each weekend with Harry, and all of Harry's children consider Teddy their older brother.

** I would disagree with the question itself. The ending was not fairy tale like at all. Harry is a Ministry flunky, even though he despised bureaucracy, Ron is working in a joke shop and Hermione is a cog in the political machine.

​

If anything the Next-Gen universe is the continuation of everything that was wrong with the HP universe to begin with. Albus Severus? Why would you name your second child after a man who manipulated you your whole life, even if it worked out in the end, and a Death Eater who had hots for you mum? It doesn't make sense. Severus Snape, for all his redeeming qualities to an outside observer, was a colossal dick to Harry Potter throughout his formative years. No one in his right mind would name his child after a man who wanted to make your every living hour a torture.

​

Back to your question. Ginevra as a wife is okay. It makes sense, sort of. She was spunky, independent and girly. Canon Harry could get behind that. So I have nothing against a Harry/Ginny post DH pairing. Though I would change some things. Harry should never become an auror. While it makes some sense, his greatest desire was to have a family, so he would logically concentrate on that. He would most likely be a teacher of some sort. Perhaps not Hogwarts, but a private tutor. He is a celebrity after all, people would pay for his insight. But he would mostly focus on his family first and foremost. He was very family oriented when he confronted Lupin in the DH after all. Taking a police job would be irresponsible of him and I can't see Harry doing that. (Okay, you can say he has a saving people thing, but that only ever applied to people he cared about. Harry never gave two shits about anyone not in his circle of friends, so him being a policeman to "serve the community" makes no sense).

Apart from that Hermione, for all her brilliance was just an average witch. She was not smarter or had better grades than Dawlish or Percy. So it makes sense that were others like her. Sure, she could become a lawyer or a lawmaker, but I doubt she would become someone so influential like in the next-gen. After all, Hermione doesn't have a political bone in her body. She's what a political idealist teenagers view themselves, all full of moral outrage, without actually considering how government or society works (the house elf hats). She would most likely be a political idealist who wants to change something without really accomplishing anything, since she has no support base and no-one really likes her, apart from Harry or Ron.

​

Ron's career is the one that makes the most sense for me. He was always very family oriented and he would find it fitting to help his brother at the shop. He would probably be good at it as well. He's loyal and has a good head on his shoulders. I can totally see him as a salesman, selling bullshit promises to customers, like all salesmen do.

***** Well, the idea I suggested was aimed at making Ginny and her offspring miserable. Although some of the other names of Dumbledore would have been equally interesting. Severus Wulfric has a certain ring to it, don't you think?

** To make it more realistic, honestly, a few years down the lane, you'd have the trio and members of the DA be picked off one by one by those Death Eaters/sympahtisers who avoided/escaped the battle of Hogwarts.

It'd be stupidly easy for a sympathiser to do this as well. Since the trio's movements would be broadcasted on the newspapers, it would be child's play to locate them, get a read on their habits, stalk them and eventually kidnap/kill them when they're out relaxing wherever.

This would be even more likely to happen once Hermione starts pushing for reforms when she's high enough up in the Dept of Magical Law Enforcement. She wouldn't live very long, in a more realistic scenario.

**** Well, this would be those ones who avoided/escaped at the end. Can't exactly execute someone if they're on the run. And with magic, it's rather easy to remain in hiding.

** Three years into their marriage Harry and Ginny divorce - because high school romance does not last. So no Albus Severus or Lily Luna. Also, no Scorpius as Malfoy is happily rotting in Azkaban for life. „He helped!” you say? Okay, he helped - this is the only reason that he is alive instead of exploring the other side of the veil or being Kissed. As would be normal for every terrorist and traitor.

Harry barely scraps as an Auror - turns out that killing a Dark Lord does not equate to having N.E.W.T.S. Ron dies of a heart attack because that can happen to anyone at anytime.

So, Harry is a possible single father that sees his child two times a month because that was the court ruling, Ron is dead and Hermione is a widow that is slowly becoming part of the Ministry establishment. And Malfoy will die in couple of years due to cholera outbreak at Azkaban.

*** I feel like Harry would quit when he realises how much paperwork he'd have to do. And there's no way the Ministry would fire him as that would be a complete PR disaster. Well, at least unless he doesn't cause one as well. A big orgy in the Wizengamot Chambers where he snorts come off the asses of his fangirls would do.
