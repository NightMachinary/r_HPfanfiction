Hi everyone,

I just wanted to ask about correct grammatical terms when it comes to writing HP.

Am I wrong in thinking that saying "The Avada Kedavra" is wrong? Isn't the correct description of the spell "The Killing Curse"?

I ask only because I intend to restart writing soon and would hate to use wrong terms that are quite frequent in a lot of writing on sites.


** The name is 'Killing Curse' and the incantation is 'Avada Kedavra', just like Crucio is the incantation for the Cruciatus Curse and Diffindo is for the /Severing/ Charm (not cutting curse or charm, but severing charm).

You can cut off the last word in each case and it works perfectly fine.

"Expecto patronum" can refer to the charm or the incantation itself.

That is a way to say it. Perhaps the more correct way.

But wizards also say "the avada kedavra curse". Quotes from the book are in a comment on this thread. It's not a leap to say that they'd also say "the expecto patronum charm".

Regardless, the balance one way or the other is irrelevant. The answer to the question "Do wizards refer to spells by their incantation?" is "Yes, sometimes."

And it's not like it's relegated to people who don't know better: Dumbledore does it too.

Which makes sense, when you think about it for a moment. In the history of language, the number of times that technical correctness has beaten out common usage and slang is zero.

** Honestly I just call it “the killing curse” or “Avada Kedavra” or AK (but this last one is just slang when talking to friends who love Harry Potter or in my own head mulling over Harry Potter. I'd never write it in a story because it would probably definitely be cringe.) and well, I have a few health issues that leaves me pretty confused, very very often. And one of the words I mix up very often is “Avada Kedavra” and “Abracadabra” totally not the same one word - as one is obviously a dark curse that will kill its victims, leaving no signs of what killed them, and some witness have experienced seeing a green light impact the victim but, as I said, no physical signs are shown on the body inside or out. The second is a muggle slang term used when conducting “magic” usually for the entertainment of muggle children. But, my mind twists things and it makes me cringe a little hearing “Avada Kedavra” because it makes my mind think of muggles, and I'm not really pro Dark Lord or anything but still, being confused annoys me. So I stick with calling it the killing curse or AK for personal reasons. When I have too I'll write it in my stories but it doesn't hurt to let the characters refer to it as the killing curse sometimes. A healthy mix is always appreciated. Otherwise you can suffer monotony (this is mostly when characters are having a long discussion about it. Otherwise monotony isn't really an issue.)

** I am fairly certain that no spell is ever canonically referred to by its incantation. If there are any instances of it happening, they are rare exceptions. Spells are always referred to either by their name ("the Cruciatus curse," "the Patronus charm," "the Imperious curse," etc) or their effect, which is usually also their name ("the torture curse," "the jelly-legs jinx," "the killing curse," etc).

** It's "The Killing Curse", like it is also "The Cruciatus Curse", and "The Imperious Curse". No wizard would actually use the incantation to the deadliest and one of the darkest curses known to man in idle conversation. I imagine it has the same connotation as irl /curse/ words like the N-word, where you have to consciously overcome some innate resistance to saying it.

Even if the curse can't be cast accidentally, and can't be cast at all by the majority of wizards, its incantation would also be kept from children - there's a non-zero danger that a child's relatively pure emotion might be enough to fuel the curse, in the case of bullying for instance (God knows I had a scary amount of conviction to kill those who bullied me).

Think also about where the "curse word" comes from. Many "curses" irl are actual curses - 'Damn you', for instance. It's short for 'god damn you to hell', or calling on God to send you to eternal suffering.

Think about what would surround that statement in a world where that curse actually works, no questions asked. You wouldn't call it "The Damn You Curse", you would say "The Curse of Damnation".

** I think it would be general to say the killing curse and formal to say Avada Kedavra. I could see someone like Snape saying the Avada Kedavra, but Ron or the young years saying the killing curse. Just my thoughts

*** It's actually the other way around; it's more technical to say the Cruciatus Curse or the Levitation Charm and more informal calling them Crucio and Wingardium Leviosa respectively.

** Technically, it can be.

Realistically, what difference does it make? If anything, now I'm almost wanting to see an argument about this in a fic where the consensus is revealed to be that such verbiage indicates, shall we say, simplistic language, but still gets the point across enough that it isn't worth arguing about.
