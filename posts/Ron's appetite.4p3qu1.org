A lot of fanfiction potray Ron as a really messy eater with an enormous appetite. Is there any mention of this on the canon?


** He speaks with his mouth full and eats clumsily in the movies. I'm fairly certain we see an affection for food from him, but not any ridiculously terrible habits in the book.

While I'm sure one could make the argument that at the dinner table with six siblings to deal with he learned to eat quickly, I'm sure Molly would have ensured there was more than enough food on the table for all of them. He may have been messy around the table, I guess, given that the Weasleys were informal about it, but not to the cartoonish extent you see in some fanfics.

I think it's just fanfic's nature to create caricature of certain traits.

*** This point exactly. From what I recall from the books, only speaks with his mouth open while eating.

Furthermore, as a kid growing up with an older brother and guy cousins always around during dinner, you quickly learn to eat fast because you would miss out select portions of a meal. Ron adapted as he had five equally growing brothers compeating with certain food.

Edit: added words for clarification.

**** My dad grew up with three brothers and they always tell the story of how two of them were racing for the last piece on roast beef on a platter- only one of them was using a fork and stabbed the other in the back of his hand.

***** I'm guessing that story is told everytime there is roast beef on the table, yes?

I could understand how and why Ron eats that way. Food in a house full of males will always be quiclly consumed, whatever the food served.

Furthermore, by eating fast, you'll consume more than the others. So, Ron will devour everything in sight to make sure that he doesn't miss out.

Apropos to nothing, if I recall correctly, there is this thing with the stomach that will tell your body that it is full after twenty minutes; even if you consumed little food.

**** Ron in fanfic has always bothered me. He becomes a chauvinistic pig, which, while he can act a bit like both in the books at times, is far outweighed by his good qualities and he does mature. I think it comes from the movies where anything good was given to Hermione (whom I love, don't get me wrong) and her bad traits are given to Ron.

***** As pointed out by the top comment, fanon Ron is a caricature of his actual character. Hermione seems a saint because of the chemistry between her and the MC in the movies. In the books, you can still see the girl in her and not the perfect saint.

** He has a tendency to speak with his mouth full. That's all I can recall of the top of my head.
