Hi Folks,

I'm looking for fics that include interesting wartime strategies and/or spend significant time on the war leaders strategizing. I've been reading HP fanfic for about 12 years, and I know I've read some good (and many awful) fics that talk about strategy, so I'm looking for your favorites. Even if I've read them before, it's probably been ages and I'm happy to revisit an old fic. Give me your best strategy fics!

Please and many thank yous!

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** An excellent story, but be warned it's probably the most AU thing I've read in Harry Potter fanfic.

***** Yeah, it's pretty much an original fic, just with HP character names/locations etc.

** might be a bit outside of the focus of the question but Hogwarts battle school had some great strategising: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

(definitely much lower stakes than actual war though). I had to give the fic two or so tries before it really clicked, but partway through the its first year it really kicks up a notch and becomes very captivating.

** It's hard to come by. You can't write what you don't know, so unless somebody has read stories regarding strategies, is an amateur regarding it or is actually a professional war strategist, the best bet is somebody taking The Art of War for reference.

**** I don't think I've ever seen it recommended here. It's like Game of Thrones with the cast of Harry Potter. Unfortunately it seems that the sequel is abandoned, but it is so worth reading past the weird beginning

  The Lestranges, freed from Azkaban after the Dark Lord uses the Philosopher's Stone to rise again in 1992, discover that they've been called to serve in a way no one could have imagined. CP!
