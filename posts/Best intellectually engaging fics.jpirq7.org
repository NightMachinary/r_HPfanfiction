#+begin_quote
  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

** Huh, not sure what you mean by intellectually engaging? If I'm following your train of thought correctly, you're looking for something possibly a little more literary and a little less instantly gratifying, with some depth to it?

Try linkffn(A Squib at Hogwarts) - brilliantly written, short, and atmospheric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] is really high-quality, probably takes some engagement to sympathize with the protagonist since for some she's not instantly likable. The characters are really complex and take some time to engage with. If you liked Pureblood Pretense you should like this series, it's a little less explicitly written but really well crafted.

For me I found linkffn(Forging the Sword) similar to but better than OTWTG - had much stronger thematic cohesion and was also better written. The character development is really good, and what's extremely impressive is the author's command of the flow of the material from a single point of divergence. Really asks some questions of the direction Rowling took.

** You could try linkao3(Train To Nowhere) which is exceptionally well written. It's very AU but I think it fits your criteria? There is a lot to unpack, and while it's often quite slow moving in terms of action, it is still constantly engaging.

Also linkao3(The Ghost of Privet Drive) which is a sort of self insert? It's complete, which is a plus. And is very well written and fun while also playing with some interesting concepts. It felt like it went off the rails a bit at the end. But I really enjoyed it for its originality.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

While MoR does have engaging moments, it's not exactly in the spirit of what I'm looking for, as I felt it was a bit hamfisted as a whole.
