Looking for some well-written Harry/Hermione fics? Preferably not K or Gen, but I'll try anything. Thanks in advance!


** I've compiled two lists of HHr recs. For multi chapters click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]]. For one shots/short stories click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EkWs8qXJPU_if2D2Cn9yRnCAjqUsf5p-lE_Y_GXUIc/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]].

Try them out. Maybe you'll find something in there for you.
