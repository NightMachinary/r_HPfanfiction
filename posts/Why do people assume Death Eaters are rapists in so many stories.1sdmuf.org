They are a hate group who sees muggles and muggle-borns as sub-human; sex with them would be akin to bestiality (see: Nazi party, KKK), with a leader who can read minds. Death Eaters being rapists makes no logical sense. Torture? Sure. Murder? Obviously. Rape? With a mind-reader enforcing the rules? No way.


** Arguably, rape is more about power than about sex.

#+begin_quote
  Rape and sexual assault are about power and control, not sex. Rapists have a desire to dominate, humiliate and degrade their victims through the use of physical violence and intimidation.

Sounds very much like something Death Eaters would do.

**** In the strictest sense, the Death Eaters aren't terrorists, they are insurgents. Their goal isn't (just) to terrorize the population; they are attempting to overthrow the government. Their Violence and rape are tools which intimidate the public and paralyze them into inaction.

Hell, the UN even passed a resolution because rape is commonly used as "a tactic of war to humiliate, dominate, instil fear in, disperse and/or forcibly relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group". (UN Resolution 1820 if you're interested)

The KKK was actually known for raping back women as an intimidation tactic. Up until 1959, a white man had never been convicted of raping a black woman. There are also a lot of anecdotes about the rape of jews during the holocaust, although it's less documented for multiple reasons.

If for no other reason, it makes sense because it's a illegal paramilitary group. Whenever you have a group of people organized with the express purpose of committing egregious violations of the law, you are going to end up with some sociopaths in that group. They may not are about your cause, but find it convenient and/or fun.

**** Rape has been a common tactic of both throughout the entire history of man. I suggest you do some reading outside of school books. From the crusades, to the Mongols, to World War II (which the whole plot is arguably based on) with the near constant rape of encountered populaces committed by the Soviet army, as well as the Japanese Rape of Nanking/Comfort Women and the German sexual enslavement of prisoners during the Holocaust, to current events in the Middle East concerning the Taliban (rape and acid attacks are the norm). It's literally a cornerstone of military tactics, for terrorist organizations and racists alike as others have pointed out. I have no clue how you would get the idea that this isn't the norm. It's well documented, easy to find information.

** Are you quite young? Perhaps you are confusing the act of rape with normal sexual interaction/attraction.

Paramilatary/rebel/terrorist/etc rape is a tool of controlling populations through fear, and the choosing of a victim is very different from how you'd choose a normal sexual partner. You pick your rape victim for status amongst your peers, revenge over her loved ones, scaring a geographical area, because she looks like someone you hate, whatever.

It was very common for the KKK to rape black women. It was very common for rape to occur in Nazi death camps. Not only does it reiterate to the women that they have no power, it also shows the men that they have no control over their situation. It is also used as punishment- you fought against my army, I'm going to fuck your wife.

People compare the Death Eaters to Nazis, I reckon it's probably closer to the rebels in the Sierra Leone civil war. They dehumanised part of the population through a combination of killing, raping, mutilating, torturing and displacement. Google it, its pretty awful reading.

I think it would be naive to assume that death eaters didn't rape, considering history tells us differently.

** KKK members and Nazis were known to rape. It doesn't matter that they see them as less than human, it isn't about that. It is about degradation and breaking someone down in the most violent of acts. Killing someone and breaking them are two very different things. Rape for the most part is about asserting dominance while making the other person feel/ realize how helpless they are. During slavery many plantation owners would rape the black women that were slaves. They did this as punishment and to show they were dominate. sometimes dong it in front of the women's family/ husbands. They also did it so that the slaves would become pregnant and have children giving them more slaves. Even the children were not looked at like their off spring. This is from the textbook Born in Bondage. Also it took 65 years for an English language book to be written on the subject of rape during the holocaust, so it doesn't surprise me that insinuated that Nazis did not rape Jewish women. I am placing a journal article below for you to read if you would like. Rape has always been a major tool in war. You've heard I'm sure the term "rape and pillage" or "take their women" etc etc. even in the movie 10,000 BC there was a rape scene when another tribe came in and took the men as slaves. They raped the women in front of them.

Also I know I focused on women and rape, but it should be mentioned that men are often sodimized with objects and raped as well in hate crimes. unfortunately men are less willing to come forth and speak on it, choosing silence over admitting openly they were raped. The research on the male victims of rape motivated by hate crimes is unfortunately very little. My professor in college said that many researchers that have attempted to make a study of the subject were unable to for lack of participants.

** Most of us are desensitised when it comes to general violence. I mow down a hundred random NPCs in each fps I play. Rape is an easy way to signal that someone has crossed the moral event horizon.
