Hello I just read *Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds* and as Fem!harry being tansposed in the Naruto verse, she is not at Hogwart to confront Tom Riddle Jr in the chamber, and as he wait for some potential confrontation with the Girl-who-lived while slowly taking Ginny life force, he realizes no one will come, he kinda becomes depressed and say fuck it "/I will take the girl body and just live her life no one would be aware of it/".

So I would like some recs where Diary-Tom takes her body and no one realize, I don't really care about his future goal I just kinda want to see the concept where he/she is either the main protagonist or an important secondary character.

*** Thx you I will check this out.

Edit: wow wither is super dark, I pity Harry but in the same time it's his fucking fault that he let his rage out, killing her knowingly that whom he loved was Riddle-Ginny and that he never actually met the original Ginevra Weasley.

  Things go differently, down in the Chamber. Instead of pouring herself into the diary, Ginny opened her heart to it, her heart and her mind, and that means a different path for Tom Riddle to take. No message saying Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever; instead Tom takes Ginny down to the Chamber one empty afternoon and waits for the last of her to die. When it is all over Tom flicks long red hair over her shoulders, picks up Ginny's wand (not a perfect match, but better than nothing, better than fifty years without a wand) and leaves the Chamber. Saunters out of Myrtle's bathroom looking like nothing more than a little eleven year old girl.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
