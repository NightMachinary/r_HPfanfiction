** Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches - revenge is best served raw)

The ultimate cheating fic, and it fits A LOT of your request.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(8670912) It has two sequels, and is entirely seriously written. The Potters are the founders of teh ministry and one of the riches families in Britain. Harry has a Eidetic memory and a huge magical core, causing him to have a six pack at eleven and already be smarter then most people. He also mastered martial arts from an old asian man living near him. He also gets a Harem. He also gets multiple animagus forms one of them even magical. There are also a bunch of other minor tropes.

Honestly I wouldn't recommend it, even if it is exactly what your looking for.the series has over seven hundred thousand words and is not finished.

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

** linkffn(No More Games) even if it seems really bad, I really liked this. It has GG!Dumbledore, Ron/Hermione Bashing, Triple animagus/Chimera animagus form, OP Harry, Staff Wielder Harry, Dragon and a Thunderbird as a Familiar, Bella being innocent Harry/Daphne Life Mates (not exactly soul, its because of the animagus, so its more like an imprint like in Twilight)

**** Its ongoing, every now and then he updates. Yes, she's innocent, that trope of her being imperioused/compelled to do what she did. Do read it, its interesting the way her personality and what the author does with her. Suffice it to say, she's in my top 5 characters of the story. Along with Harry, Daph, Snape and McG.
