I'm wondering what recommendations people have for fics that are /funny/.

Magic has endless scope for pranks, for booby traps, etc. so I want to see what's the most fun and chaos that can be caused.

I'm particularly looking for Hogwarts, rather than other WW locations, don't mind whether Marauders or Harry's era. Especially keen on any hijinks that the teachers also get involved with.


** Linkfdn (Like a red headed stepchild)

Best crackfic ever, a legitamatly good book. Covers all years, with weasily hijiinks at every turn. (Harry is a redhead, and is adopted by the weasly clan.

*** linkffn(12382425) This is the one, yes?

For future reference, the easiest way to ensure the bot doesn't mess up is to copy the fic's ID number from the URL and paste that into the bot command.

Also, there's no spaces before the brackets. And of course, spelling is important to bots.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Escapologist Harry: linkffn(9469775)

Harry Potter, boy-who-lived, just /will not stay where he's bloody well supposed to/. Albus Dumbledore is driven to insanity trying and failing to keep him at the Dursleys. One-shot.

The Naked Quidditch Match: linkffn(3689325)

Due to a particularly foolish bet, the Gryffindor Quidditch Team has to play in the nude. Hilarity ensues. A story told in "m-mails", a fanon wizarding equivalent to E-mail.

This Means War by Jeconais: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/]] (no ffnbot-compatible links as far as I know)

A Harry/Ginny story that also uses the m-mail concept, focusing on 2 or 3 big pranks, various shenanigans surrounding the fact that Harry doesn't know what's supposed to be impossible and thus just kinda does those things casually, and Voldemort being so thoroughly outplayed it's hard to take seriously.

Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Probably the least outright cracky of my recommendations, this is a more low-key comedy fic. Harry's a dragon. The story adapts and snowballs from there.

EDIT: Forgot one.

Trolling the Toad: linkffn(12098960)

If Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts was going to be hell because of Umbridge, then so was Umbridge's life going to be hell because of Harry Potter. After all, he /is/ the son of a Marauder, friend of the Weasley Twins, and owner of an Invisibility Cloak.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

One of my faves is Oh God Not Again, a time travel story where Harry uses his future knowledge to change some things and pretends that his scar is psychic.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Also, I find it hilarious that it took a crack fic for me to notice the mid-winter part from canon was a nod at Voldemort's birthday.

** *Saying No* - linkffn(7274734)\\
TL;DR: Harry gets pissed off the summer leading to sixth year and says "No!". Ends up drawing most of the students into a rebellion. Adult bashing? Targeting? Revenge?

The premise was pretty great, and then it felt like Bobmin went "Screw it, crack it up!" Prank driven revenge. Drug dealer Hermione. House elf competition. Snape goes on a quest. Polyjuice shenanigans. Next level Floor is lava. Rubber duckies.
