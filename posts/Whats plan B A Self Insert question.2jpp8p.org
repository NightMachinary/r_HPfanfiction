You find yourself in a self insert fic. You've figured out that you're in the potter-verse during the earlier books, and set out to make things better...

But when you go into the RoR and the Diadem isn't there, or walk into the great hall and Harry isn't in Gryfindor... What does one do then, when you've no longer got the leg up via the Oracle at Rowling.

Credit to [[/u/timeloopedpowergamer]] and [[/u/turbinicarpus]] for forcing this question into my brain.


** Lol, I don't set out to make things better. I ignore everything that's going on and focus on studying to be a badass wizard.

******* [[/u/LarrySellerz]] watched from the Hufflepuff table, while losing his fight with the urge to grin. Today was the day his deal with the Twins kicked off. Who knew that the wizarding world wasn't familiar with LSD? or that you could use newt bile and frog brain to up the potency and make it airborne, respectively?

Looking over at Gred and Forge saw two identical grins, shared by most of Gryfindor. It seemed everyone was expecting a show. Five minutes into dinner, Snape, sorry- /Professor Snape/- did not disappoint.

Cue someone better qualified to describe Snape on LSD. <edit> And who remembers who sat next to him to be affected next seeing as I just realized the implications of the initial premise of airborne LSD

*** iirc, canon never says wandless magic is impossibly hard or even that it's easy, nor does it even discuss runes or arithmancy, so when an author creates their own skill, of course it's going to be OP.

**** Harry and many other people have "accidental magic" that is never discussed again. I personally think this is a great place to hang "wandless" magic. Defuse and emotional. There had to have been magic before wands, and potions doesn't fill all the gaps. But it isn't just doing magic without a wand. It is something different, and should be treated that way.

And there should be a good reason that people use wands, not just "herp derp wizards sure are dumb!"

Tom Riddle creeps Dumbledore the fuck out by apparently having done magic without a wand before Hogwarts. Controlling people's minds and "hurting" them. Somehow. Later, Dumbledore seems to think that should have been a clear sign of how powerful and evil he was. Aduhhhh. Thanks to that, we have a second data point.

I'm not saying there is no reason to involve wandless magic, just that most authors are stupid about it, all in a rush to get to their SuperHarry storyline so he can kick Dumbledore in the balls (either figuratively or literally).

Clearly someone before has tried to learn wandless magic. A thirteen year old in his bedroom can't have been the first person ever to try this.

--------------

Arithmancy is never said to be anything but math as it relates to magic in canon. Which makes sense, as Hogwarts doesn't freaking teach math. Astoundingly, this is often not the case in fanfic. Behold the power of math!

Ancient runes are discussed in slightly more detail in canon. As a languages class. But if it ever comes up, it's another whole freaking magic system. When this is part of enchanting or some other complicated, adult topic, it almost makes sense. When this lets SuperHarry cast spells by just waving his +dick+ hands around, it does not.

Whenever making a story that even attempts to be canon compliant, one should ask "why didn't they do this in canon?" If it is NOT canon compliant, and Harry is the only one doing it, one should /at least/ ask "why isn't /everyone/ doing this?" If the answer sounds dumb, the new ability is likely WAY overpowered and dumb.

You can make those new things without them being win buttons. But most of the time...

Worse, it's typically justified by some variant of, "Well, maybe I was able to do it because nobody ever told me it was impossible." Because that's totally believable, ignorance as a superpower.

*Bad* idea. Presumably, you are not inserting as Harry Potter himself, so by even attempting to perform wandless magic, you risk crashing the universe, because a non-Harry character even /trying/ to learn it Does Not Happen.

** Early books = early nineties.

In other words, as the books are ongoing, the Soviet Union has just dissolved and millions upon millions of weapons systems are being trafficked all around the world, companies that we know are going to be huge in the noughties and noughty teens are going to be just starting to gather steam and discover the internet.

You, if you're in the books, either have magic or have direct access to people who do. Including, if Potter's in another house/institution (which could indicate that you are not alone in the SI, which means that xanatos pileup is imminent), a reclusively brilliant bushy-haired girl with no friends that will munchkin reality for her friends. Now, mix muggle weapons & money with a deranged/brilliant magical genius, shake well for a number of years of obsessive self-study & research and then aim the resulting abomination of a war machine squarely at the Death Eaters.

Oh, and then run like fuck because the aurors are gonna list you and your friends as the new Dark Lords.

The lazy option: Steal/gemino a nuke and set it off during Voldemort's attack on Hogwarts. Everyone may be dead, but hey, the dark Lord's dead too! That's gotta count for something, right?

Then run.

You have to be careful putting all your eggs in this basket. For every fic featuring a BAMF!Technomage!Hermione [1], there is myriad featuring a Hermione who is only capable of quoting from textbooks and is constitutionally incapable of defying authority, or, really, doing much of anything. Bet on the wrong Hermione, and she'll sell you out to Manipulative!Dumbledore.

[1] Speaking of which, how's /Snow Queen/ coming?

**** For a fic whose next chapter has been a solid year in the making, mostly due to me reaching 20 pages' worth of text only for my hard drive to die and spending four months rewriting it whilst planning out where to go with it?

Kinda well, actually.

Oh, as for the myriad featuring facts regurgitator Hermione, well then I'm just going to have to do the joined up thinking while she basically gets told that I'm acting under the authority of Queen (nb, the wording's important-never said it was THE Queen) and am thus bestowed with unimpeachable authority ( you'd have a hard time impeaching a dead gay Zoroastrian after all) while I try and recruit more muggleborn for my little adventure in self-defensive genocide.

And on the question itself, I'd first watch the students trying to locate the protagonists and to determine who's to be trusted (for all I know, I could've ended up in someone's evil!Harry fantasy) and who---not. Then I'd send the “trustworthy” guys anonymous memos with everything I got about their world's “prototype”, and after that proceed to experimenting with the world's laws of magic and nature.

To me, the experimentation part would be the most interesting and important one, because there are just so many things in the HP's Universe that seem to be making no sense or contradicting to each other, that the opportunity of exploring their inner structure from inside-the-world would be for me as joyous as was receiving my first gaming console when I was a little kid.

The reason for this is that from an outsider's perspective the most one can do is either apply the Aristotelian reasoning to try to deduce how the canon's inconsistencies should've sorted themselves out (while also trying not to involve meta-level explanations) or create a tangential universe where those inconsistencies are somewhat being amended by the word of a new god (the outsider himself). Being able to experiment with the real thing itself would be just way too much more awesome than any of those options.

** I'd probably be sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, so there's no real chance of me becoming close friends with Harry or any of the trio. Still, I'd make an effort to be as friendly as possible with Hermione and Harry. Since this is a fanfic I'll probably stay away from Ron and Dumbledore, since they're probably evil douchebags. Since this is AU I'll probably just keep my head down, make friends, and study hard. At the end I'll fight for for the right side.

Also, I'll probably be placing some bets. If I bet on Harry catching the snitch every game, I'll most likely win 9/10 bets. Also I'll make a substantial bet that Krum catches the snitch vs. Ireland, because no one really changes the world cup match.
