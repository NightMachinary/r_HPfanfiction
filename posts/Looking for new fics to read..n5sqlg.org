Hello!

I'm in a rut and in need of reading material.

Please can you recommend fics that explore magic? Or just use it and it's whimsical.

Like linkffn(Spells In Silence) and Linkao3(What's her name in Hufflepuff)

I like fics with queer themes but please only recommend gen fics.

Like linkao3(ever upwards; How To Be A Dark Wizard Without Really Trying)

Please no pairings! And please no abandoned work.

Thank you!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]] it's not whimsical though, but definitely explores magic

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] is amazing but unfinished sadly

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440][Unfogging the Future]] is a fantastic short read that expands divination

If you don't mind self recs I have [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29808174][Breaking Taboo]] which is currently exploring Yule (from a historical pagan angle)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] one of my fav Gen fics. Summary Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.

  It takes twenty-five years for someone to finally tell Naesala that he can't keep doing this. For a beorc, that's almost a half of a lifetime. For a laguz, it's barely a blink of an eye. For Naesala, it's somewhere in-between. **** For Tellius Week Day Two: Becomings/Bloodlines

  Ron maybe accidentally-on-purpose becomes a dark wizard, and everything changes. (a canon rewrite, with a bit of a twist)(also this is not a 'Ron is Evil, actually' fic so if that's what you're expecting, maybe give this a skip)

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft

linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) sounds like total crack and is hilarious but is also sweet and moving.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
