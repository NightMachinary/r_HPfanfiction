Are there any fics where Harry (or any other character) goes back in time and gets no Hogwarts letter?

Either because he isn't the Harry who should have gotten the letter or because he never did accidental magic and the letter is triggered by accidental magic or anything else?


** Interesting premise. Watching this thread to see if anybody finds one.
