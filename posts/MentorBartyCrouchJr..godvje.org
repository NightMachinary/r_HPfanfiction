I just finished reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]].

I really like the idea of Harry having a reliable Mentor who actually has some concern of his well being rather than a parental figure/mentor like Remus or Sirius or in some cases Snape.

I was wondering if anyone knew any fics like this. I am not in favour original characters because they usually aren't well developed or they lack back story. So canon characters would be preferable even if they are ooc.

It does take a while for him to show up and it also features the Death Eaters are good people trope which is problematic for numerous reasons and Barty does not show up for awhile in the story.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** linkffn(Blood Crest)

Crouch Jnr does teach Harry, but it's much later in the story - plot has dark/horror style turns, but very well written. The exploration of how and why spells work in Harry's world is one of the best I've seen

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
