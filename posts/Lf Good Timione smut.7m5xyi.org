Reading Lady Miya already, but need some good reads that fill the void. Any recomendations?

Also, I found one I liked, but cant remember the name! Can you help me find it??? In the story Hermione goes back to the past, gets hurt skmehow outside of hogwarts, and Tom sees her. But Tom being, you know -Tom, walks past her and leaves her for dead. She gets rescued and charms heself to have long black hair and green eyes. She befriends Minerva, but Minerva's BF starts longing for Hermione. Tom also "brands" her somehow. Do you guys recognize this story?


** You mean Tomione, obviously.
