*** I mean, what good reason did Umbridge have?

Edit: just to be clear, I'm not arguing for Harry suing Umbridge. That would be utterlt ridiculous. What I meant to say was, is taking Harry's broomstick fair? I would say it isn't, however that is subjective and everyone is entitled to their own opinion on it.

****** Please don't misuse logic. If the fight was about the phone then yes, you would be sent into detention and have your phone confiscated. If it wasn't about the phone then the phone wouldn't be confiscated. Maybe we didn't read the same books but in my version, Umbridge didn't confiscated Hedwig...

********** No it /does not/, it means that some how Harry found a way around Dumbledore's age line so he's in. No where in the text at all is it implied that they considered Harry an adult for getting himself into the tourniment.

Have you even read the books? Because none of what you are talking about was in there, at all.

The age restriction was something that was agreed upon between the schools, it wasn't an intrinsic aspect of the tournament, as the Goblet of Fire didn't give a fig about the age of the entrants only their relative qualifications against all other entrants submitted under the same school. Since Harry was the only entrant under a fourth school he was the best out of a pool of one.

*********** Yes, but instead of holding a token competition and then hosting a new competition, actually investigating the mess or trying to find a way around it, they just went on with the shitshow. And I never claimed that the Goblet emancipated him. Because as you correctly point out, the tournament did not have an age restriction before.

But when Barthy Crouch says that Harry has to compete, he implies that Harry is legally an adult since otherwise he would not be able to compete in an event for adults.

***** Of course you can find some lawsuit where students were restricted by school administration but were able to overturn it. But in general as students are almost all minors they have diminished rights and autonomy. Even adult students (those 18 and older) in the interest of ensuring good order and discipline are expected to follow the rules or can be expelled.
