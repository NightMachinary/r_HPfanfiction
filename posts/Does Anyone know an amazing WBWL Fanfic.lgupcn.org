** Linkffn(Antithesis)

It's complete, makes some people cry, and is an amazing, awesome, and just great story.

Fair warning, it's dark, very dark, and some people have cried.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the forsaken's ascension) the title is kind of pretentious lol. It's the first in the Ashes of Chaos series and IMO it's the better written but unfinished version of Prince of Slytherin. That being said, those two along with Sarcasm and Slytherin linkao3(Harry potter and the den of snakes) are the holy trinity of WBWL â€˜Harry goes into Slytherin' series.

Antithesis is by far the best but it doesn't count because it's so out of the league of those three.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
