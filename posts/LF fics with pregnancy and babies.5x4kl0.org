I'm looking for stories that involve new parents dealing with pregnancies and babies and how magic might make things different and/or easier for them. One of my favorite parts of the books was the Quidditch World Cup, when Harry saw several little magical kids playing. Obviously, this isn't something that we see much of in canon. Does anyone have any good recommendations that explore this aspect of the magical world more? I don't care much about pairings of the parents, but bonus points for one parent that was muggle-raised (so they can comment on the novelty of magical parenting).


** This is something I think about a lot. I've seen a few fics that deal with pregnancy, but none that deal with magical methods of making pregnancy less unpleasant, less dangerous, more reliable, or faster.

If pregnancy is easy and painless, and you're not going heavily AU, you do need to explain why so many pureblood families apparently have only one child. One solution I'm thinking of is that a family like the Malfoys gives their non-inheriting children to their retainer families -- the Crabbes and Goyles -- and purebloods mainly send their heirs to Hogwarts.

*** I can think of one reason that isn't heavily AU--having fewer children means subdividing the estate less.

**** Right, assuming all your children inherit. Then you'd want two children -- your primary inheritance goes to the first, and the second marries off into another family, hopefully taking their primary inheritance. Marriages between first children (assuming strict primogeniture) would be rare and associated with significant upheaval.

Another design is an inner/outer family divide. The outer family operates as vassals, and the most successful are promoted to cadet branches, but the ancestral lands always lie with the primary branch of the family.

This would lead to the outer Malfoy family having dozens to hundreds of members while the inner family is just Narcissa, Lucius, and Draco.

*** Inbreeding causing difficulties in getting pregnant is one I see floated around a lot. Plus they may want to only have one child at a time since they live for a very long time and presumably have a longer window to breed.

Also we have Blacks with 3 daughters to one son, and 2 sons to another. Greengrass has 2 daughters. We don't even have names for everyone in Hermione's dorm room, so its not like canon really gave us much proof how many people are in families anyway.

*** My go-to headcanon is that there's a factor in the pumpkin juice that stabilizes hormones, preventing much of the sex-obsession and acting out you would normally expect if it were Muggles all stuck in an isolated castle for ten months, with no TV and very little sports. Everyone going to Hogwarts drinks the pumpkin juice and comes out with a reduced sex drive.

** Here are a few of one-shots, where Ginny gets pregnant by Harry before he leaves for the horcrux hunt: Linkffn(12078207)

Linkffn(11380898)

Linkffn(12062983)

And a Harry Potter/Buffy crossover fic with pregnancy as a major plot point. Sadly abandoned but there are enough chapters to make it worth reading, imo:

** I've written a few stories involving pregnancy, but the one that goes more in depth about it would be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10612141/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][this one]].

I like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11133057/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Death-in-the-Family][this one]] because I enjoy writing the Trio and their parenting shenanigans. Also involved semi redeemed Dudley if you're a fan of that.

I think that they might be a bit subdued with the magic stuff at a very young age, though. I imagine there's a lot of superstitions about pregnant mothers giving birth to squibs if they use too much magic during important parts of the fetus's development.
