To be clear, I do NOT want any bashing whatsoever, I just want to read a fanfic in Ginny's perspective where she views Harry's relationship with someone else(it can be anyone) and how she deals with the sorrow/heartbreak. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12337874/1/two-out-of-three-aint-bad]] would be ideal. Thanks in advance!


** Man that was rough lmao. Not really depressing or anything but it was pretty sad :(. I honestly wish this had more of a conclusion though what was there was pretty good.
