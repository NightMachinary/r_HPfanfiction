Hi there ✌️ I'm becoming desperate. I'm searching all over the net for an old Bellamione fanfiction Primal Instincts by Gone86, originally published on fanfiction.net

It seems the author wanted to put it on AO3 to bypass a purge but somehow ...

Does anyone have a copy of the story and would ne willing to send it to me ?

Please, please !!

It would be an awesome Christhmas' gift !


** I have a fic by that title that's marked Bella/Hermione, but the author name is liidg. Assuming it's still the right one, you can find it [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsSGNHdUQ4b2ZheWc][here]].

*** Well, apparently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2838453/Gone86][Gone86]] goes by Liidg. And that search turned up [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/72lep5/lf_any_mirror_of_a_fanfiction_called_primal/]], so... hi!
