P.s. shame on whoever mentions cold blood by derlacroix shame upon thee


** I quite enjoyed Outcast's Alley by RhiannanT. The world building is decent and it is a relatively unique premise. There is a sequel, which updated recently but it is very infrequent. Harry is one of the greater fae, and it includes at the very least references to a dozen or so other species.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Well, [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/lord-of-the-high-elves-extended-excerpt/][Lord of the High Elves]] feels like a prologue for a much longer story (4 chapters worth), but it definitely qualifies and doesn't end on a cliffhanger, so it's worth reading.

And the title character is /not/ Harry, btw. But he is an elf.

** Oh, and there's linkffn(angels and devils by beren). And seraphim is not one you're going to see often.

Linkffn(desperate measures by vvc) has Harry as Veela. And a pretty entertaining courting process, I gotta say. I also liked the unusual take on the Weasley/Malfoy feud (in which the Malfoys are the good guys), a fairly well-developed and nice Pansy, and an expanded prophecy. Dumbledore-bashing ahoy, though.

** If you haven't read it, check out linkffn(Hell Eyes by jezaray). It's a pretty good fic, if a bit OP. There's enough world building and such going on that you'd think it was a cross over, but it's apparently all original.

Pretty awesome, and fairly long (210k).

** Hmm...the first fic that comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915237/1/Harry-Basilisk][Harry Basilisk]].

Unfortunately it's only 4 short chapters long, I don't know whether it was meant to be continued or the author left off after that, but you might enjoy it. It's basically 'Harry is turned into a basilisk, but can sometimes assume human form (but still with uncontrollable killing eyes), and everyone...adapts'.
