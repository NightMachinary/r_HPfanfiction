Well, any fics out there that have Harry and Fleur work together at the Ministry? It can be a little AU or rather, they are not with their Canon couples. Harry would be attracted (have a crush) on her and she is aware of it, even teasing him from time to time maybe. But actually she is not emotionally equal with him (although she Could find him physical attractive later on).


** linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic) has a Harry who has fallen in love with Fleur even though she is with Bill. This takes place at Hogwarts, but it's in Harry's sixth year.

**** Ugh yeah. But this is my favorite Harry/Fleur due to the dialogue/characterization and the ample amounts of tension.

***** Yeah, I guess I just find it unrealistic no one has called Harry out on his obvious crush yet -- Hermione or Dumbledore being most likely.

**** How is this a fault of the story? Unless they impact Dumbledore's own goals, Dumbledore being apathetic to Harry's actions and situation to the point of neglect is his canon behavior toward Harry. It is the most glaring problem of the series, especially after GOF when Rowling tried, and failed spectacularly, to explain why Harry was always put or left in abusive or dangerous situations as a child.

***** Let's try this again. They didn't say it's a fault of the story. They said they're "a little upset" which is a simple opinion. Is one not allowed to have negative opinions on certain aspects of a story?

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
