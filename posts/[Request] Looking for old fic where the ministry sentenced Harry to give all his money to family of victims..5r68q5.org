It is a fice i've found a long time ago(not sure how long though), there are parts of the story where Harry is in front of wizengamot and the family of victims are saying why Harry needs to pay them. I remember Susan Bones, and Lavender's father on it. That's all I remember about the story and I do hope you could help me find it again. Thanks!

  After a rough couple of years, Harry disappears on May 2, 2000. Four years later, a pair of Dark Wizards attack and Harry is once again needed. However, no one knows where he is. Can someone from his past reach him?
