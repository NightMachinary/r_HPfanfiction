I read this years ago and it's been nagging at me to find it. I k JW I read it after book 7 was released, but t may or may not have been written before.

Essentially, Harry and Hermione are getting together either for Valentine's Day or Hermione and Ron's anniversary. Before the fic begins, Hermione and Ron divorced, realizing they weren't were that great a couple. Now, the twist to this fic is that 7th year H and Hr were headboy and head firm with a heads dorm. They would make out and stuff in their dorm, but it was sort of FWB because the moment Ron was suddenly available Hermione was with him. Harry never married or dated after Hermione left him for Ron, but H and Hr stayed good friend, H is still close with R, and Hr and R are working on going back to being friends.

All of that happens in flashbacks, but in the present Hr and H are struggling to chill out as friends when the just want to talk about how much they love each other. I believe H shows up at Hr's flat while she's vacuuming and he's helping her move furniture before they settle in for a move. In a flashback H gets Hr to go fly with him and I believe I read the fic on FF.net. If you know of it please let me know!


** I don't know that fic but maybe try posting this at [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]].

** It wasn't one where Hermione is on a ladder painting at one of the crucial moments? That's all I remember, but I think I read that one. I only wish I knew the name.
