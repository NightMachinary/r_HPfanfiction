Was Hagrid at Hogwarts during DH or did he end up having to run? If he did run, when did that happen? I can't remember and can't find my copy of DH. Thanks guys

  “We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” --- all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence --- “well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter' party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.”

  “I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you've got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.

  “It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid's spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry's supporters against following Hagrid's lead. ‘Support Harry Potter' parties are unwise in the present climate.”

** It's mentioned that he's at the school and hosted a support harry Potter party in his hut. Then he went on the run after avoiding being arrested. This was all shortly after the trio escaped livegoods

** I think he had to run. It's possible he just roughed it innawoods in the forbidden forest, picking off any death eaters sent to find him, but I can't be sure given how long it's been since I read the books (if it's mentioned at all).
