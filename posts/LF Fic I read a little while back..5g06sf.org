In it Harry puts out an ad in the paper asking for volunteers to help him fight, and if people don't wanna fight, he gives a vault number to send anything that could help in the war effort.


** That sounds most like /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/1/The-Weapon-Revised][The Weapon Revised]]/ by GwendolynnFiction. linkffn(5333171)

In chapter 22, he gives a speech by Scrimgeour's side, but goes off script and asks for people to fight and if they can't, to donate what they can to his vault to help out with the war effort. I'm not sure about an ad, but in chapter 36, he has Colin and Dennis Creevey's father working for him in creating, publishing, and distributing a war newspaper.
