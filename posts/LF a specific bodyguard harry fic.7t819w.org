This fic was basically a version of Deprived, but without all of the shitty oc's. If I remember correctly Harry ran away from the dursleys (Not a wrong BWL Fic), he became some sort of elite bodyguard, and he was contracted to defend the delacours. After this there is an assault on the delacour family with them attacking the rune stones, this arc ends with Harry escaping with them, but with extreme burns. The next arc is in some other country where Fleur overhears in a tavern that harry will be ambushed by cultists. Fleur warns him, but he goes in anyways. He then gets him by some sort of necrotic curse (or something nasty) and has to go to some old lady to heal him with ritualistic magic. Thats all I remember, hopefully you guys can do what I couldn't and find this fic. Thanks!


** Could it be [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9255377/1][The French Connection]]? I have vague memories of fiendfyre and runestones. It got deleted from FFN, hence the fictionhunt link.
