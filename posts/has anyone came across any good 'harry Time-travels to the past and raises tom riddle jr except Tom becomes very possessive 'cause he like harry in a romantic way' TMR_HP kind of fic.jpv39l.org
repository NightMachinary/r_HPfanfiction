While looking for some interesting HP fanfiction, i came across this particular type of fanfic, andvi must say... I'm addicted to it. (;-; ) so I'm seeking for the aid of my fellow potter-head_fanfiction_experts, to please help me find some more if you can? I'm quite sad that, not only is there an only few, but that most of them aren't even completed ( Ôºõ‚àÄÔºõ) . There is this particular one that I'm quite fond of, but even that one isn't complete. So if you're aware of something like that fic, then i wouldn't even be able to express my gratitude to you! Said fanfic's title is 'What He Grows To Be' by 'Severus divides into H' , it could be found in AO3 or fanfiction.net, it's currently stuck in chapter 6 and I'm literally craving more! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13300353/1/][What He Grows To Be by Severus divides into H]]


** 47 days to change(translation)? I felt too bad for Harry to enjoy it and the translation isn't complete, but well at least the original Chinese work is completed.

Ah and I love WHGTB too! The author said she'll update a new chapter(33k word long! yay!) in a few days.

** Huh I didn't realize this was a full subgenre lol. I've heard of one "Thems the rules" I think? But you may already know that one bc it was probably really big for me to know it

#+begin_quote
  Harry, after being saved by a mysterious stranger, is flung fifty years into the past, where he resolves to save the future by killing a 10-year-old Tom Riddle. He ends up raising him, instead. But when young Tom develops an unhealthy fixation on his new guardian, things quickly spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself entangled in a deadly game. Will history repeat itself?
