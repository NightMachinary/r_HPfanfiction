******* Christ. Three hour exams. Good that they spread them out, I guess. Imagine doing all of that in two weeks at the end of the year. :D

Thanks for indulging my curiosity. :)

**** Ah, okay. So, kind of similar our GCSE and A-Levels (qualifications in the UK), by the looks of a quick google on the subject. Thanks. :)

I am a little confused by one thing though - is it one qualification on lots of topics, or one qualification for each topic? I know you can do courses in different topics, but I'm not sure how that translates to the actual awarded qualification(s?) at the end.

If you don't mind answering, of course. :)

***** The whole thing is called the HSC, but each subject has its own exams, and you don't have to do every subject. By passing, it all adds to your ATAR, which is used to get into uni.

** I would of thought that a paper on the impacts of fanfiction to a person's behaviour would have more variables and possiblity for conclusions and correlations, I would be curious to know what the hypothesis Is on identity and how fanfic changes it ?

*** uhm its more of how like bc fanfic can be used to represent minority groups where the mainstream media doesn't, it is a tool for them to explore their identity but i do think i should've added smth to figure out if they are apart of any minority groups

**** Considering the paper is about minorities in gender identity specifically, it might be a good idea to improve the first question. You can sort non-binary and gender-fluid people from men and women, but transgenders are minorities as well, and they'll choose the same answers as the cisgenders. This can affect the outcome of your research, because you can't tell who is part of the group of people your paper is about and who isn't.

***** If you're talking about the sub survey, that (was?) run by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]. Not sure if it's still going, [[/r/tjaglica][r/tjaglica]], but it might be worth contacting them to see if they've got the information for you and are able to share it?
