:END:
I honestly can't remember much else. I think it was a Snape/Hermione fic, as so many marriage law fics were, but I can't be sure.

I do remember Hermione doing a ton of research in order to create these little boxes she'd give to other teen witches who had to quit Hogwarts b/c their husbands decided it was so. That's pretty much the only thing I'm wanting to reread about, the boxes lol.

Edit: I'm like 90% sure it was on FFnet, /maybe/ on Ashwinder since that was the only HP archive I liked at the time.
