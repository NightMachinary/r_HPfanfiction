I know that it's /fan/fiction, and there are no professional editors or copy writers. A certain number of spelling errors are to be expected, and nine times out of ten, I just ignore them if the story is otherwise well-written. But there are two particular misspellings that I see ALL THE TIME and they drive me absolutely crazy: *Lilly* and *Voldermort*.

How freaking hard is it to properly spell the names of two of the most important characters in the books??? Open up literally any one of the books, and I guarantee you'll be able to find a mention of one of them in less than ten minutes.


** My automatic back-spacers:

- Summaries that say "I suck at summaries. JUST READ." (If your summary sucks, what does that say about your story?)

- 'Mione, Dumbles, Voldy, Siri, Remy, Lucy, Sevvy

- Overabundance of American slang

- Spelling and grammar at the level of illiteracy

- And, of course, MPREG

*** I realize this comment is 8 days old but I just want to say:

YES to the ''Mione Dumbles, Voldy, Siri, Remy, Lucy, Sevvy' Crap!

I could be reading the world's most amazing fanfiction ever written and the use of 'Mione will turn me off in a heartbeat.

And the only 'person' allowed to call Voldemort 'Voldy' is Peeves.

Men loving men is adorable (particularly if they have no appreciable body hair and the writer never discusses anything more than kissing and touching).

Men acting like women is funny.

** Mine:

- OC's (I can tolerate if they're /extremely/ well developed characters, but 99% aren't)

- Soul mates/ soul bonds (can it not be enough that 2 (or more) characters love each other without destiny having declared it so?)

- good Snape (the man is an abusive prick, no matter how much he loved Lily)

- non-manipulative Dumbledore (he doesn't have to be evil, but it is /canon/ that Dubledore was manipulating Harry so that he would play out the part in the war that Dumbledore had chosen for him. Not necessarily maliciously, and he might /possibly/ have only found out that Harry needed to die when it was too late to find a different solution, but he /was/ doing it)

- non-BWL (this is a fundamental part of Harry's character. Taking it away deletes him and instead inserts an OC who happens to be called Harry)

- MPreg (grow up)

- Harry's feelings are an open book to everyone but Harry (I find it exceptionally annoying when a character (usually Hermione or Luna) acting as the authors mouthpiece patiently explains to Harry that he is in love with such and such before even /he/ understands what this alien emotion is. It just seems really patronizing)

- Harry Sue (including but not limited to: Harry inherits super powers from his ancestors, Harry removes a block placed on his magic at birth, Harry hooks up with +the author+ Daphne Greengrass and she teaches him how to behave in pure blood society which results in his instantly becoming a political genius and getting the entire wizengamot under his thumb after claiming various accounts he didn't know he had)

- nice Petunia scared of monster Vernon (they're /both/ monsters, in fact Petunia was probably worse)

- idiot Harry (If I wanted to read a story where the protagonist was an idiot I would read HBP)

- "genius" Harry (unless you are an /actual genius/ don't try to write a genius protagonist. It doesn't work and you end up with the character verbally reminding everyone that he's a genius every four paragraphs because otherwise we'd forget)

- non-psychopath Voldemort (This is why his character is so interesting and dangerous. If you take this away from him he has /nothing/)

*** Harry getting super powers is always a odd idea to me because he's a wizard already. The only way I see it working is if there's a consequence for the power (which there rarely ever is), or you apply different rules to magic. For example, Charmed/X-men/bleach rules where each wizard/witch has an individual power only available to them.

  "Harry," said the ghosts of the founders, "accept our legacy, for you are our great something grandchild." "Oh. Umm. Right. Thanks." said Harry as he suddenly felt his magic grow to a point where it eclipsed that of the judeo-islamo-christian god ten times over. "Don't forget us!" said Merlin and Morgana LeFay, as they too appeared and monstrously increased Harry's power. "Huh, am I related to you to?" Harry asked.

  "Harry, we were alive over a thousand years ago, practically everyone with British family is" replied Morgana.

** Most likely, the fanfiction written by people who spell names wrong, is written by people who only saw the movies...

Though, it took me 10 or 20 times correcting myself to stop spelling Lily wrong...that's just habit. Voldermort though looks the way they "heard" it. You can almost be forgiven for a Lilly mistake, since her name doesn't appear all that often. But Voldermort?

Hermoine too, as it reads the way that Rupert says her name early on.

** Honestly I get sort of confused when I see these 'deal breaker' threads. Almost everything I see recommended in this subreddit is what I would consider below par. Hell, I've only ever read 15-20 HP fanfictions that I /didn't/ dislike for various reasons, including many much more nuanced than the drawbacks listed above. But those 20 stories were so good that I still keep up with the fandom years and years later. 99 percent of all HP fanfiction isn't worth reading, and you guys should probably be able to spot stories that are going to say things like 'Dumbles' just from the description, username or number of favorites/reviews. That's just how it is; most people can't write.

** Any serious story which doesn't obey what Eliezer Yudkowsky calls the First Law of Fanfiction:

#+begin_quote
  *The First Law of Fanfiction* states that /every change which strengthens the protagonists requires a corresponding worsening of their challenges/. Or in plainer language: *You can't make Frodo a Jedi without giving Sauron the Death Star*.
#+end_quote

Non-serious stories get a pass on this. For example, "A Black Comedy", "Oh God Not Again!" are stories which don't need to obey the First Law.

Also (and this is an extension of "bashing" which others have talked about, I really dislike unjustified changes from canon. Your story has a premise and that premise may change the universe a bit; the backstory and the way the plot pans out may cause a degree of further divergence, but to simply have a fic that (say) starts at roughly the canonical beginning of DH and suddenly has Harry falling in love with Hermione and Ron joining the Death Eaters, is not acceptable.

** I read a lot of Marauder fics and these are my pet peeves: -A long and useless description right at the beginning of the fic of how beautiful Lily is, exactly what she is wearing down to the type of makeup she has on and what kind of personality she has -James having lines that are decidedly feminine likely because the author is female and is not trying/able to give him masculine sounding lines. eg. calling Lily names like Lili-poo and Lily-kins. No just no. -James' life revolving completely around Lily and almost no interaction with his friends or it is just mentioned in passing. It makes him hollow and boring. -Peter bashing or avoiding writing about Peter at all and then mentioning in the author's note about how much the author hates him and has decided not to write about him at all. He was still their friend and still needs to be mentioned -Sirius and James having "sex god" status at Hogwarts and reputations as cassanovas. Everyone wants to bang them, all the girls at Hogwarts want them...except for Lily of course, which is why James likes her DUHHH -Remus always being apologetic about his friends behaviour and kind of a stick in the mud. -The author doesn't bother to round out Lily, makes her a prude and a stick in the mud, and doesn't give her any friends -author does give Lily friends and they're annoying and dumb Mary Sues -Lily "isn't like all the dumb, gossiping, make up wearing girls at Hogwarts" shes much better. And apparently there's no other girls at Hogwarts with brains, yup Lily is the only one. -When a character says "oh my god" I just find it hard to believe that wizards and witches would ever say that -constantly confusing words like "straight" with "strait" So yeah... you could say I have some pent up anger about this

** Dealbreakers

- Bashing unless I'm in a vindictive mood.

- The complete disregard of one character. I've seen stories where Ron has like one line in the entire thing.

- Summaries asking me to read the story because it's good without telling me what it's about. Not a good start.

- Summaries listing of things like Romance, dragons, wands, etc. as if that qualifies as a summary.

- Slash where one of the guys is super effeminate because it's written by a girl. They're gay, I think they like men, because their men.

- Bad portrayals of characters. I mean if Dumbledore is going to be completely evil, you should explain why it wasn't so obvious he was in the books or why Harry seems to have a extremely sarcastic sense of humor all of a sudden.
