I just read linkffn(10855282) and absolutely LOVED it. Sadly it's not complete yet so while I'm waiting around for updates I was hoping to read something along the same lines as it. To give a short, and terrible, summary its about Lily's twin sister (who is fem!harry but she has amnesia and all her dreams/visions of cannon fem!hp haven't fully been explained yet... its actually pretty interesting how its written). I honestly don't know how to explain that better without going into spoilers.

I've seen lots of time travel fics of Harry going to his own past, or Voldemort's, or Hermione going to the marauders, or wherever. I would really love to read more of Harry going back and growing up and going to Hogwarts with his parents. Dark and dreary, light and fluffy, I don't really have a preference. No mpreg please. Other than that I'm not too picky. Throw all your weird twists and turns at me!

I've already read the one where Harry is Sirius' older brother (can't remember the title... something with galleons.)


** linkffn(Timely Errors)

While Harry doesn't grow up with the Marauders in this one, it's still a great timetravel story and one of the few completed ones.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again - She's got one more try to get it right. Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now? (extra info inside)

#+begin_quote
  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
