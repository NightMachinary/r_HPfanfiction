Hello everyone! I would love to get some recommendations on dark stories, preferably about war. For reference I really liked the fallout by everythursday, I like Draco that slowly grows and redeems himself and prefer Draco/Hermione pairing to others. However, romance is not obligatory and I actually skipped all the sex scenes. So maybe something like that, that has the war, deaths of main and secondary characters, emotional and physical pain..? Next generation will also work for me. Thanks in advance!


** Seems like you might enjoy the fanfic I'm currently co-writing. Our story features a lot of the dark themes you're looking for, and is going to remain largely Gen with a sprinkle of romance here and there (kind of like canon).

If you're interested, it's on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15425364][A Lamb Before the Slaughter]]

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) really focuses on the affects living in war can have on a person. It gets real dark at times. Also very long.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) is about dealing with the aftermath of war and the actions taken during it.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.
