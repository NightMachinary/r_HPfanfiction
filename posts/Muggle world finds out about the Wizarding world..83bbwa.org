I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446331/1/Mud-Blood-the-Sound-of-Guns][Mud, Blood & the Sound of Guns]] and this made me want to read more stories about the muggle and wizarding world colliding.

Is it a wizard who introduces muggle products to the wizarding world? Is it the army blowing Voldemort up? Any interactions appreciated.


** This is actually one of the arcs in the Albus potter and the global revelation series; its 7 books and really long but I highly recommend it anyway

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** This happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]] by Brennus, which takes a HARD turn to starboard when it happens... it's a rather abrupt change.

And it also happens in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son]] trilogy by Darth Marrs. Which I have a ton of issues with that would just derail the conversation, but it DOES have the muggle world learning about the magical one.

** Funny thing, I was musing on the possibility of asking about 'muggle finds a wizarding galleon'. Archeologists and anthropologists go spare trying to figure out where it came from, or someone trying to melt it down accidentally sets off an anti-arbitrage hex of some sort, or...

--------------

As a side note, are there any fics where muggles find out about at least one magical creature? Centaurs, giants, goblins...?

Edit: Essentially Harry goes through the muggle education system instead of Hogwarts and ends up joining the military. His use of magic there causes events which break the Statute of Secrecy.

** Unfortunately, I can't think of any fics off the top of my head where Muggles discover wizards. I /think/ I've seen or read a couple with the premise, but they've all kind of bled together through the years ... and the only one that I can name is the one that you've just linked.

*** There are certainly a couple where the muggle world, primarily the leadership, "discover" wizards in terms of learning more about them than wizards intended but yea no outright discoveries.

Usually, its wizards revealing themselves that's for sure.

And cannon has muggle leadership already knowing about wizards from the get-go so...
