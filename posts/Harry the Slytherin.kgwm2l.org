The two main characteristics required to be sorted into Slytherin are cunning and ambition.

But in most 'slytherin' Harry fics I see all gryffindors are mindless morons who are useless at studies, do not think before doing anything and are always brash. Ravenclaws are bookish nerds who have zero social skills and also bashed as bullies of poor Luna. Hufflepuffs are loyal but in some fics in 2nd year and 4th year they are also bashed for not staying loyal to Harry. There is some speech where the teacher says "Hufflepuffs are loyal only to themselves. Shame on them blah blah blah"

And then comes Slytherin. Draco Malfoy is the only one is Slytherin who is evil and a bully along with his two minions. Slytherins are all cold and manipulative. They are all very calculative. From 11 years old they are master politicians. They are above friendships. They only have alliances. They only become friends for benefits.

In Gryffindor, Harry is never too aware of his surroundings. He is never manipulative or too political. He is also true friends with Ron and Hermione. But as soon as he goes to Slytherin he becomes cold, manipulative, political and distrusting of others.

I mean my point is are only Slytherins manipulative and politicians. Is it fundamental that only those in Slytherin are allowed to be cunning and ambitious and Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are not allowed to be so.


** The reason why so many authors have a hard time with the House system in HP is mainly that it didn't make any sense, to begin with, and is awfully simplistic and cartoonish in Canon. Basically, you have:

Gryffindor: the Good Guys, Hero, and Righteous folks, Selfless people who have for greatest ambitions in life to be Good People. They are liberals like JKR and so they are awesome.

Slytherin: HitlerJugend. They are conservatives and so not awesome. Apparently, the House is for the ambitious and the one who cares about Greatness in a more selfish way. Which is bad according to JKR.

Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff: exist.

It's just bad writing all around. So when fanfics writers try to "play with it" they have a hard time writing it right since it's too flawed in Canon to make it decent.

If you remove or "share" with the other Houses manipulative, ambitious, and cunning attributes from Slytherin, it's just HitlerJugend.

I mean, this isn't exactly a huge deviation from canon... Luna /is/ bullied by her own house. The Hufflepuffs in Harry's year /are/ absolute shits to him in both second and fourth year.

Re the main point, yeah it's stupid. So stupid. Harry in Slytherin ends up with Harry having a personality U-turn. Harry in canon is mildly sneaky- by need not design. He is used to keeping things to himself because he spent ten years of his life having absolutely no one he can trust, but he's still kind, warm, and very loyal once he realised that he actually was worthy of friends and in the wizarding world people liked him. He bonds very easily with both Hagrid and Ron, and his determination to save Hermione from the troll when at that point he didn't even like her shows just how fixed he is on doing the right thing. So many Slytherin Harry fics take his mild sneakiness- which basically translates as "doesn't tell adults stuff and only shares with close friends" in canon and turn it into someone with plans for world domination who's actually quite dislikeable!

I think Harry has always been distrusting of others and rightly so. Grew up with the Dursleys. First two defence teachers tried to kill/harm him. Best mates pet turns out to actually be the man who betrayed his parents. Another defence teacher tries to kill him and is also a supporter of Voldemort. Umbridge. Then Snape kills Dumbledore and ok Harry never trusted Snape but he knew Dumbledore did... No wonder he only really relies on Ron, Hermione and Dobby! But, like you say, the Slytherin Harry fics take it too far. Its like, Dumbledore says hello to him in the first week of first year and he's like "you may not address me, you must have been stealing my money, you set my parents up to die and had my godfather deliberately imprisoned. Do not offer me sweets I know they're poison," and it's ridiculous.

Yeah I know what you mean. Like, Percy is seriously ambitious. Fred and George are cunning- as are Harry and Hermione to an extent. Oliver Wood is also seriously ambitious and ok it's fixated on Quidditch but ambition is ambition. "Ambitious and cunning" doesn't have to translate as "is a politician in training," you could have an ambition to be a successful sport player or an artist that sells paintings for a lot of money, or you could have an ambition to free the world of hunger and homelessness. "Ambitious" does not have to mean "is a pretentious dick!"

As an aside, I went to school with some people who were children or nephew/nieces of some quite influential politicians (like, at least two of them you'd definitely have heard of if you followed UK politics in the late 90s/early 2000s) and none of them behaved like the Slytherins in fic. Kids of politicians are either like canon Draco and all "my father blah blah blah" (showing off with no subtlety) or they just don't ever mention it because it's just what their dad does for work, and really what 13 year old cares about their dads job? No one I've ever met, and like I said I know a few people who are related to senior politicians, behaves like that irl when they're a child.

** You might like the House portrayals in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. Harry goes to Slytherin and belongs there, but befriends people from other houses too. The other Slytherins consider secrets to be normal and gifts without a price tag to be suspicious, but they do protect each other and Harry makes some good friends. The Gryffindors have bad apples amongst them, but Percy is happy to help anyone with homework, and the Twins are open-minded about the origins of a prankster; if you can cause chaos, you're alright in their book. Ernie McMillan of Hufflepuff is still very suspicious in second year, but in fairness, there's more circumstantial evidence against Harry than in canon (albeit there's also good exculpatory evidence). It never really bashes any house.

(What it does do is completely reimagine the storyline. With Tom Riddle alive and well, running a political party instead of a war, the whole social landscape of Britain is quite different, and Harry's challenges are likewise quite different - but just as life-threatening.)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
