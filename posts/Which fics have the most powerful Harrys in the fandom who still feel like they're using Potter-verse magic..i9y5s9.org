Harry as Death from /On a Pale Horse/ seems to be absurdly powerful.

Harry in /Core Threads/ is absurdly powerful.

Neither are anything close to a faithful representation of a powerful Potter-verse style wizard. That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but I'm looking for the most powerful/skilled Harrys in the entire fandom that /are/ relatively faithful representations of an advanced Potter-verse magic user.

 

Does anyone have any recommendations?


** The One He Feared by Taure has Harry with Dumbledore's knowledge

The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb has Harry with the knowledge of three dark witch/wizard

The magic both feel very authentic to me and both Harry's are pretty powerful

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] - It's not perfect but I've always felt that this story captured a lot of Harry Potter magic. The spells are very powerful, but often exert their strength on a smaller scale (with the same exceptions in canon regarding transportation). Harry's knowledge of decades' worth of innovation in magic help give him an edge, reflecting the research and innovation seen in canon. Magic is scientific, yet whimsical, and the action is incredibly engaging.

** IMO On the Way to Greatness is the one that does this the best.

*** Interesting. I seem to remember disliking the story specifically because Harry didn't seem to be getting anywhere on his way to greatness.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** The fic that must not be named, and its sequel. He is even more powerful in the sequel, but the sequel's magic is less convincing as being from the Potterverse. Actually I don't know how these compare with the other titles mentioned here, since I haven't read much HP fic outside that particular AU.

*** Assuming you're talking about FLOM, iirc that's not a particularly faithful representation of HP magic.

**** Not sure what FLOM is. I was talking about ROMPH spelled backwards. Actually I don't know that Harry's magic in that book was dramatically more powerful than in the Rowling books, but it was in some ways more realistic except near the end. In the sequel (by a different author), he was off the rails and basically took over the world.
