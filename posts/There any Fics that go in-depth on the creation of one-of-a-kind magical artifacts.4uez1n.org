I'd like it if it was on how something like Ravenclaw's diadem was made, but completely original artifacts are fine too.


** I was just reading /Barefoot/, and there were some really good descriptions of numerous magical objects, like the Deathstick and Hermione's Time Turner.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** Good fics? I wish.

But linkffn(The Runemaster) does it, using the runic enchantment nonsense I have previously insulted.

EDIT: It isn't creating a one of a kind magical artifact, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) Harry fixes/improves/re-enchants the Ford Anglia.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
