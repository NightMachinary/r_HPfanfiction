Not stories where Harry is granted sudden crazy wolf powers, but stories that explore the fear and prejudice associated with lycanthropy.


** Theres always linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry]]). Harry is bitten and the horcrux fights it and nothing is quite as it seems. I wish it would update more or finish, something.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** This is a great story. It is a WIP but there is a lot of fear and prejudice of werewolves and Harry is treated poorly when he is assumed to be one. He eventually is turned. It is a Snape is Harry's father story and a lot of internalized homophobia although there has not been an actual slash scene - I know some people are very sensitive to that on this site. Harry has feelings for Ron. It is called Blood by The Lord of Chaos. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9476512/1/Blood]]
