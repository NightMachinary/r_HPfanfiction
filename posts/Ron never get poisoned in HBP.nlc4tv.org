** If they haven't reconciled after that long, would Harry really invite Ron to go on the Horcrux Hunt with them?

**** Maybe I read it wrong or it was edited, I can't tell on mobile, but I read that as Ron and Harry not having reconciled since he wasn't poisoned

****** Even if Ron and Hermione are at odds. It's odd to assume Hermione has her place granted next to Harry and Ron might be left out to accommodate Hermione. There's some OOC there, and even then, if Harry was this way, Ron's place will probably be secured before Hermione's.

******* Alternately, Harry plans to take Hermione along because Ron is safer due to being a purebloods and will be an effective source of intelligence from behind enemy lines. This plan goes to hell at the Weasely wedding, which Hermione chose not to attend. Harry instead has to run for it with Ron and Hermione has to go on the run on her own to avoid snatchers and the like.

******** I agree with the Harry not inviting them specifically. But Ron=fun, Hermione=serious things is way oversimplifying things.

Ron has proven his worth in serious things throughout the series and Harry is really aware of it. Harry didn't invite Hermione over Ron in DA, it was Hermione who sort of invited Harry actually. In no part does Harry take Hermione over Ron, even if he's aware Hermione knows more stuff.

Harry tells Ron about Malfoy too and he never considers stop talking to him because of the HBP argument. They hang around more often than Harry-Hermione I would say, since Hermione is bolting away every time Lavender appears, and no Harry is no going after her in those times.

Not saying Harry wouldn't want Hermione with him, he's not dumb. But he's not picking her over Ron. He's his first friend and the Horcrux thing hasn't happened yet. Their friendship is solid at this point.

I say, most likely thing is that he doesn't invite anyone. They both invite themselves.

Then, Harry OOC, inviting both and asking them to put their shit in order or at least be civil.

Then, if made to choose and both Hermione and Ron were stubbornly OOC not allowing the other, I would say Harry says fuck it and goes alone.

Then, if everyone is OOC and he totally has to choose. I would give the edge to Ron. Harry is the sentimental type over the thinking part at the end and knows Ron would support him.

This is a Harry who trusts Sirius over Dumbledore.

  Okay, the only time Harry ever explicitly asked for help from anyone was during the first task with the summoning charm.
#+end_quote

No, he doesn't. He is offered help.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's relationship with Hermione in HBP on the other hand is easy and trusting.
#+end_quote

If you call constantly being annoyed by their nagging or distrust and uncomfortable when she's being sentimental that, sure.

Coincidentally, this happens before Ron and Harry make up again.
