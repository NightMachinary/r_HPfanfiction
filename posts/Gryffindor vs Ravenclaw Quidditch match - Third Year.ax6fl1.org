Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Flint try to sabotage Harry during the Quidditch match by dressing up as dementors and invading the pitch. In canon, Harry responds by casting a Patronus Charm at them.

Give me fics where Harry is not confident about his Patronus or he panics and casts more dangerous/lethal magic at the Slytherins. Maybe he throws /Incendio/ at them and the four are badly burned. What would the aftermath be?


** Harry seeing some retribution because he harmed/tried to harm someone in front of the entire student body and faculty?

*** He did not try to harm them. He threw a spell at 'dementors'.

*** Generally, for self-defense the maxim "Could a reasonable person fear for their life?" applies. As Harry was already attacked on the Quidditch pitch by Dementors, and the students apparently looked realistic enough.

He might face some retribution, but he's probably staying mostly free.
