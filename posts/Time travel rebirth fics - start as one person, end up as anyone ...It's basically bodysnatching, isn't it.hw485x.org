So, I'm looking for fics where a person time-travels and ends up in the body of someone else in the past. Could be anything from a fem!Harry present to a fem!OC in the past like The Last Peverell (Link below), Harry being passenger-reborn into another canon-character like Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly (Link below), to anything else entirely! They just can't finish the time-travel in the same body they started in. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** More than one way to skin a cat linkffn(13283547) has Snape in the body of Harry and Harry in the body of Dudley.

ugh, I feel so bad whenever the Lockhart's folly is mentioned. that had so much potential, but the over the top Ron bashing bothered me too much so I had to drop it. otherwise I would love to read something like that.

*** I get that, it definitely got a little over-the-top in the early days. I thought it made sense though, what with Harry and Lockhart's personalities leaking over into each other. Harry being resentful plus Lockhart being... Lockhart equals weird Ron treatment to break up the friendship early on. It does diminish significantly later on though and Ron becomes friends with them again, so it might be worth continuing to see if the rest of the fic without the bashing is interesting to you?

And wow. That's... the description is definitely one of the more accurate I've ever seen in fandom - odd is exactly the right word for that. Looks fun though. Thanks for the rec!

Are Path of Decision or I See The Moon fics appropriate to this request? (the ones mentioned as inspirations for that fic).

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.
