At the moment, I am writing Harry-Centric stories. I have written and published the first 2 chapters of 1 of my stories already, but am not sure in which direction to take it at the moment.

This is why I have begun to write a second one that I personally feel much more invested in. The premise is as follows. During Harry's career meeting with McGonagall, he ends up being told to leave, think about what job he may want in the future seriously and come back to her once he has some ideas. Through some research he discovers Magical Law. This is essentially a story where Harry becomes a Lawyer. I admit, I may have been watching a bit too much Suits when coming up with the idea but it's something I really think I'll enjoy writing.

If you have any plot ideas or just advice in general, feel free to write it down below.

Word of warning: While I will try to be realistic when it comes to writing about a career of law, I will take some liberties in order to make the plot more interesting.


** Ideas:

Harry defending an accused death eater. Could be interesting either way you take the case (guilty or innocent). Alternatively, you could have him try to prove the innocence of someone currently in Azkahban (with memories of Sirius inspiring). Or, muggleborns are discriminated against in the wizarding justice system and Harry sets out to defend one of them (To Kill a Mockingbird-ish).

** One thing that occurs to me about this premise is that canon Harry doesn't really have the temperament or interests to be a lawyer. That's not an insurmountable obstacle, but it requires some thought for a fic, IMO: will you arbitrarily tweak his character? Will you give him some extrinsic impetus to want to become one?

Given that this is the OotP year, a possible point of divergence might be that someone (Hermione, Susan Bones, Dumbledore) manged to legally outmaneuver Umbridge and Fudge and get Umbridge sacked. That could inspire Harry, because for once, law works!

** Is magical law different than muggle law? What's magical about it? At the basis, wouldn't it just be centered around interpretation of laws and the truth?

Would the size of the wizarding world of the UK be relevant at all? Are all cases heard by the Wizengamot? Wouldn't that be somewhat hard to do, even with the UK's small population? Or are there smaller courts for smaller cases? But that brings us back to the size issue.

Given the small number of magical people (I think it's estimated somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,000, taking Harry's class as a sample size), wouldn't it make more sense for lawyers to be muggle/magic hybrid lawyers, since probably the whole of the wizarding UK could be serviced by a couple dozen lawyers? Unless they either, don't earn as much as their muggle counterparts, charge even more than their muggle counterparts, or there are only a handful of lawyers to service the entire population. And given that most wizards seem to live in rural villages (a la Hogsmeade, Ottery St Catchpole) instead of large cities would there even be a huge number of disputes needing lawyer intervention?

How many laws can there conceivably be for 3k people spread across the entire country? There are high schools in America that big. Or are you going to make the population bigger?

I dunno, I feel like all these questions are worth considering when writing a fic like this. But otherwise, it'd be a fic with a premise that I don't think has been done before (or at least I haven't seen before) and that's always cool. I wish you luck with this!

*** I see where your coming from which is why the world in which the story takes place is much larger than what is defined in canon. If I had to give a rough estimation of the population of wizards and witches in Britain, in the context of this story, I would say about 500,000 or more.

In regards to magical law, it is a subject that hardly anyone takes. This is due to the fact that many corrupt members of the Wizengamot cannot afford to manipulate someone protected by an attorney. They have dealt with previous lawyers in very abrupt means (read: murder.).

As time passes on, the story itself will become more AU in order to accommodate changes such as these.

**** For your writing, there's a fine subreddit filled with people eager to help you! And for your plot, if I had to just give a quick advice, it would be that you need to see were you're going more than how you're going to get there. The rest will flow naturally. Oh, and discussing ideas with a close friend who knows you well can also help tremendously.

** YOUR STORY IS A RUCKSACK. you can't fit more in it than the story needs, which means if he's becoming a lawyer then don't spend x pages how he's learning how to do amazing cool spells he'll never need as a lawyer.

** I'm not writing your story for you. Any plot ideas? You don't have one single idea of what challenge Harry might face asking the way, law-related or not? At that point you probably need to do more research into what lawyers do and see if anything comes to mind.

***** One of the plot points that I'm most keen on is through the use of Dumbledore. You see in this story he specialized in Magical Law. Don't get me wrong, he's still the defeater of Grindelwald and all-round powerful wizard, he just so happened however to pursue a mastery in Law when he was younger.

It's going to be in Harry's 6th year where Dumbledore will really shine.

Like you said yourself, I don't really want to give too much away but he, as a character, is essential to the plot.

****** Hmm, well, if you wanted to go political, you could have legal battles between factions of the Wizengamut. Maybe something showcasing the work it takes to pass and repeal laws? I don't know if you want to stick to canon in terms of Dumbledore dying, but you could focus on the first year or so after either of the wars, and how you recover from that. If you have Dumbledore die on schedule, you might have Harry trying to retrace his steps in terms of wanting to put society back together.

You could also go full creature rebellion, with them wanting more just laws and how society deals with that.

You could have some major group or even a country break the statue of secrecy - how do you deal with that?

Maybe you have a law and order SVU/Luther type of plot as well.
