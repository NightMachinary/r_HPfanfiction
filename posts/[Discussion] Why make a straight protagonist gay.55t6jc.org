**** Same.

Another reason why I ship slash pairings is because of the dynamic they have, like two people involved in a tightly-knit bromance, and sometimes you just can't help but think "Is this even bromance anymore? Because they're acting like an old married couple."

It also happens when there's so much tension between two characters that it makes you think why they feel such deep hatred towards one another, because a person never feels something so strongly towards another (both positive and negative) unless that person affected them so much. Anger? Maybe it's nothing. But really intense rivalry or deep hate? Makes me think twice.

After all, hate is not the opposite of love. It's indifference. Why make such a big deal when you can just cut that person out of your life?

So yes. Ho Yay and Foe Yay.

**** And if you ship lots of slash pairings, it might be because while there are both men and women in the story, the men have more of a personality and have more interaction with each other, and so you might feel there is more chemistry between two men than between a man and a woman. Since sometimes writers seem to assume a lot of the time if you stick a man and woman together, they'll automatically date, marry, etc., even if one if them is really lacking personality.

I think this explains all the fem!Harry fics. Some authors want a particular pairing, but are for some reason allergic to homosexuality, or any form of LGBT.

Fem!Harry forces everything back on the straight and narrow.

  The author is gay and identifies with a gay protagonist better.

  A lot of stories take canon, change one thing, and examine what happens from there. This certainly counts as one thing to change.

  The author wants to explore how the wizarding world treats LGBT people, and perhaps compare & contrast that to how our world treats LGBT people.
#+end_quote

Lol.

The vast majority of slash fics are written by women who turn the male protagonist gay so they can pair him with a male character that they themselves find attractive. It's the same reason for 99% of fanfiction: the author is projecting themselves onto the main character, and where the author is a heterosexual female and the main character is male, that means having the main character be gay.

The rise in fem!Harry stories represents the same impulse.

Incidentally this is why the vast majority of slash fics also feminise Harry. In real life gay men are still men, they just so happen to be sexually attracted to other men. In fanfiction gay men are basically women with a penis.

I don't think I've ever read a slash fanfic where the protagonist actually behaves in a masculine manner. Which incidentally is tied in to the fact that very few slash fics are actually written by gay men.

** I think it has more to do with the demographics of the fandom.

I have no hard facts to back this up, but my impression is that the vast majority of the authors across the HP fandom are (or were at the time of their first involvement) teenage girls. It's possible that they write feminine protagonists who like boys because it helps them identify more with the characters.

I'd also guess that there is a large subset of edgelord neckbeard males who are responsible for the harem fics.

TL;DR: It's just people writing what they wish for instead of what they know.

** For me:

1)Because there is far too little representation in popular literature. So many stories are about straight protagonists. If it isn't explicitly stated, it is often assumed. Even when LGBTQ characters are present, they are often only hinted at. So it's nice to read slash.

2) Slash fics are often not gender roles heavy. I like that. I don't want to read about the boyfriend/husband does these set of things while the girlfriend/wife does these other set of things. These tend to happen less in slash fics. People do stuff due to their characters and not gender. Author is not confined by unintentional gender role bias.

**** I think it happens everywhere. It is still often the default in our society and it's ok, nothing against it. When I want something different though (and I often want it because I"m LGBT and hate gender roles), slash is often able to offer that to me. Some slash do suffer from it as well, where one of the character becomes the "man" and the other the "woman". I drop these fic quicker than a hot potato.

** I don't write male/male slash, but I do write femslash.

The answer in that case is because I want to. I'm a fan of femslash works(and others are fans of slash works), so I enjoy reading and writing femslash, even if characters aren't portrayed as gay in the original works.

If you actually wait for a "gay main character" to come along, you'll be waiting a LONNNNGGGGGGGG time, and it might not even be in a series you like. People like writing about the MC, because they usually identify most with the MC in terms of who they like in the stories-- there are obvious exceptions to this where people ignore the MC's existence in fanfiction, but they're clearly the most popular.

I don't really think there's anything wrong with that, and this sort of question distinctly reminds me of when I was 12 and I left a review on an Eragon/Murtagh fic saying "Why do you make the characters gay when they're not in the story?"

It's a pointless question that is borderline rude to ask because the answer is irrelevant, and it's trying to put people on the spot for writing gay fiction rather than staying with the heterosexual-ness that 99.9% of stories have inherently.

Addressing a few side points:

The reason people don't look for characters that "could" be gay is that 1.) it doesn't really matter whether someone could be gay or not if you don't like the character, and 2.) If you did this, you would have very few pairings to write gay couples in stories with, you'd constantly be needlessly shoehorned into a specific pairing per fandom.

As to the point of many slash fics having a weak/submissive character: I don't personally read slash, but keep in mind the primary writers of slash are heterosexual young females. I imagine that if this occurs, that's the primary reason-- they're trying to make it sensual/tender, and fit the character's gayness to their fantasies, regardless of how realistic it would be in the real world.

The somewhat rude part isn't asking about why there's so many slash fics, it's this underlying assertion that seems to come through of "Why are you writing a clearly straight character as gay? They're proven to be straight in the original content, so why do it?" Which isn't exactly maliciously rude, but comes off as a bit unintentionally condescending.

A vast amount of fanfiction is in the "What if X was different" category. Change genders, change years, change who lived, change who died, change what house you're sorted in, change your parents. Changing sexual orientation is just another thing, lets you put together characters who ordinarily wouldn't be.

  What is it that makes people write their protagonist like that when there is clear evidence from canon that this is not the case?
#+end_quote

Can I ask - what specifically is the clear evidence?

Because, I mean, for all intents and purposes I "look" straight. I am kinda feminine, I am dating a man (long term), I like boys a lot. It would make sense that people who didn't know me would assume this, and it honestly doesn't come up much in conversation for people to ask differently because they've already made their assumptions.

I also like girls a lot.

Surprise!

I think the big thing in my mind is that, we don't actually know specifically about any of these characters? I mean, we know what JK tells us. We know what Harry (our incredibly unreliable narrator) tells us (and he's dense as bricks sometimes). And really, there isn't much (if any) actual queerness portrayed in the books. So how would someone from an incredibly sheltered upbringing (he lived in a cupboard!) who never really had exposure even know?

I know quite a few people who grew up in small towns and married women because they figured that's what they were supposed to do. Then they got older, were exposed to more of the real world, and are now in same sex relationships.

Lots of people don't actually discover, or come to terms with, their identities until they're older.

And JK doesn't have a great track record of displaying sexuality in the books. We have an after-the-fact "Dumbledore is gay!" but no one really could have predicted that from the books. So again, is that character clearly straight? Or clearly gay? I mean, Harry kisses Cho & Ginny, and is clearly in love with Ginny. He is also high-key obsessed with Draco for the entirety of book six and even books before that. It all comes down to interpretation.

Or do we just not know, and want to explore it in fanfiction?

I agree with a lot of the other points people have made, but I think this is important to keep in mind too!

**** Ho boy. I maybe shouldn't have brought up the Harry & Draco thing since that was not the point of my post, but.

Harry is an unreliable narrator in the same way that all books that only show one person's thoughts / feelings / etc are. The whole point of only knowing what Harry knows MAKES him an unreliable narrator because we have no back up for what he's seeing, or thinking. He thinks x about a person, we never find out more. I'm not going to use Draco again. But like, he thinks Ron's amazing, other people probably don't. That's what makes him unreliable. So if you're writing about someone not him, you can't presume to know everything about them. And even if you're writing about him, he doesn't reveal every single thing about himself because that's just not how books work?

That's clear evidence that he is attracted to females, or at the least to Ginny. That is NOT clear evidence of his sexuality. As I pointed out: you can be sexually attracted to both genders (it's called bisexuality). Also, again, you can be romantically attracted to someone enough to marry them even if you don't know your sexuality - but I'm not getting into the difference between romantic & sexual attraction here.

Yes, that is the canon view of things.

We're writing fanfiction.

If you want to read canon, read the books. Like I'm really not sure why this is such a confusing thing?

** It's a personal preference. I ship Draco and Harry because from my interpretation of the books, they have chemistry and I like to see that explored. Despite what some others have said - and I am in no way saying they're wrong or that I disagree with them, just adding my own personal perspective- you don't have to be into slash all the time to enjoy a slash pairing. I do not really want to read about Harry paired with any other men, for example. I really hate crossovers that obviously exist simply to pair Harry with another one of the author's favorite characters (HP/LOTR fanfiction can be really guilty of this)

I like stories that pair Harry and Draco and based on the plumbing it just happens to be a gay pairing. I don't need one to be submissive to the other. I don't need for one to start acting effeminate to really stress that THIS IS SLASH, REMEMBER. I just like reading about these two people in a relationship. I actually prefer stories that focus on the personal dynamic and more or less skip the sexual aspect. Because I more or less know how sex works already and don't need a blow by blow (hehehe...) account of it in every story, that's not what I look for primarily. Sometimes I want smut and I'll go look for that, same as with Het pairings, I'd assume.

I can take your argument and replace "slash" with pretty much any other trope and they'd all be just as valid.

- Why pair Harry with Hermione?\\
- Why write Harry as an idiot?
- Why write Fem!Harry?
- Why focus on pairings at all?
- Why write about James and Lily surviving?
- Why read angsty fanfiction?
- Why bash the Weasleys or Dumbledore?
- Why keep referring to Harry as "the raven haired boy/teen/man with emerald orbs."
- Why accept some deviations from canon without complaint, but not others?
- Why change Harry's name to "Hadrian" or "Harold" or "Harrison."
- Why assume that every pureblood family is nobility? (Pottor Manor, Lord Longbottom...)

I could go on and on, but basically the answer to all of these questions is "It may not personally be my cup of tea, but someone out there obviously likes it. More power to them." I personally HATE most of the above tropes in a fanfic, but I'm hardly going to question anyone who does like them.

**** I personally think "bashing" is too general a term. The Weasleys do have their flaws. I for one was really bothered in the fourth book (I think, my memory's rusty) where Molly just took it upon herself to get money out of Harry's account and do his shopping for him. To me, nothing about their relationship implied that this was okay and it seemed really invasive. I wouldn't withdraw money from my own daughter's bank account like that and I've raised her myself for 18 years. I think a fanfic that took that instance and others like it and had Harry sit down with Molly and say "Look, you might not see the harm in it, but you're overbearing and kind of annoying." That wouldn't be bashing to me, because Molly IS overbearing and (objectively) annoying.

And I didn't mean to say that you yourself were attacking slash. It's just I've seen too many attacks on it as a trope with really weak justification. It's a trope just like any other, and the stories can be either good or bad depending on the talent of the author.

Malfoy totally works though. I've said it before and I'll say it again, calling Hermione names does not mean he and Harry could never, ever get along. Hell, /I/ was calling Hermione names all through the books because I hate her character. Most of the names I used were worse than "mudblood" as well.

Aside from the bathroom incident in book 6, Harry and Draco's interactions are petty and childish and if either one of them ever decided to grow the hell up, they'd probably get along just fine.

In Harry Potter, even everything Hermione does revolves around Harry, and she's the strongest female in the series.

**** The problem is, none of that development is shown to the readers. So to write a fic with strong female characters who don't just revolve around Harry, you need to make up or change about as much as you do to write a fic with gay male characters. Don't get me wrong; some Harry Potter fanfics do a good job of that! But I'd agree that it's the more difficult, and less obvious, way to go.

#+end_quote

When you go AU (which is the whole freaking point of FF), you might as well tickle your own fantasies as well. The readers (and therefore authors) of Harry Potter (both canon and FF) is probably of a particular demographic that idolizes off-canon relationships. Just as fans of ZZ Top are different from fans of Justin Bieber, so I suspect is the case with HP and other fiction universes. I wonder if Twilight fanfics have the same bias (looking at you, young romantic females!).

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if you guys have noticed it, but if you sort by favourites there are quite a significant majority where the fics portray a gay Harry Potter, despite the fact that canon clearly dictates that he is straight.
#+end_quote

I suspect the movies are much to blame. The movie versions of Malfoy and Snape are much more compatible with leather pants than the book versions. Book Snape had no redeeming qualities, Alan Rickman had plenty.

What surprises me most, is that it's not just slash. Suddenly /everyone's/ gay. There's not a straight relationship in sight, except perhaps between Dumbledore and McGonagall. And the slash tends towards unlikely pairings, between characters that are incompatible in canon.

And suddenly, MPREG. Throw in a bit of domination and submission while we're at it. I wonder if just crossing that "forbidden" gay line (many places in the world /teh ghey/ is unacceptable or even worse) makes authors go all out.

** It's the point of fanfictions to explore alternate main characters.

I don't read male slash, but I understand that many do.

In fact, among my top 10 HP fanfics, only two have the canon Harry.

** Just because. Some people feel underrepresented and thus they create their own worlds, where the protagonist is like them. Also, some people love yaoi and want to see their favorite characters in a yaoi relationship. The latter fics are mostly trash, but the former ones can be good.

To be honest, I have no problem with any deviation - racebending, genderbending, change of orientation, etc. - as long, as it doesn't make it into canon. And if it does... well, there's a reason I drop more and more Marvel comics each week. Which I am glad for, because DC Rebirth is amazing.

** Sometimes I suppose it's fair if you desperately wanna write shipping-based fics and all the characters that fit the protagonist's orientation suck.

I seriously doubt that's very often the case, though, considering often the slash-shipping makes even less sense than canon pairings, even assuming a switch in the character's sexuality.

** Man, I asked this shit in a slash thread the other day and got shat on for being a homophobic piece of shit. No, it's just weird man.
