Sirius referring to Harry as pup.

Stop it. Just, no.


** Or the 1001 ways Harry's eye colour is mentioned every paragraph. Sometimes I think authors are trying to see how many ways they can say "green".

Or "twin speech".

Or how 11-year-old children seem to be smarter and more eloquent than adults.

Or, and this is all fanfiction regardless of fandom, how authors write a 300-word essay on how someone washed their teeth, took a shower, and got dressed. Every chapter. Add detailed hair and skincare routines, and I'm exhausted.

*** Verdant, his luminous leaf-like eyes shone out like glittering emeralds from underneath his shiny frames, seeming to case a grassy coloured glow directly into her soul. It made her heart thump in her chest as she saw his eyes flicker, looking for to the world like a particularly polished green bottle or a fantastic specimens of sea glass. Glaucous would be how she'd describe it if not due to the fact his eyes were so much more; they flowed in the dim light of the classroom and she basked in their viridescence. Like peas with black painted flecks on them, she watched entranced as his eyes once more came to rest on her face. She quelled a blush; how dare he have such a beautiful, nature-inspired sage-like eye colour. No, it would not do. So, fuelled with jealousy at the lover she desperately wanted, she said:

“Mr. Potter, start writing your lines now!”

Once he realised that Umbridge had his best interests at heart, she knew the dulled olive colour after one of their sessions would brighten like a flower on a sunny day. Then, she would gaze longingly into those toad green wells and they would kiss. Rose petals on her jumper with the thorns in his eyes, one day...

(Why did I write this?)

EDIT: Screw it, I'm making an entire post out of this idea.

******* The worst bit is, I actually put effort into that thing. I actually actively searched up synonyms for green, and tried to add as many as possible. I didn't just think up words for green, I actually did research.

I'm now considering extending this into a full one-shot just to prove a point, perhaps deliberately employ some other writing styles as well.

  In response to a Reddit thread about various bugbears we all have in fanfiction, I decide to use as many as possible. And crack ensues.

****** Given the large number of popular annoying tropes that everyone knows, there's now quite a few fics that include tropes in order to parody them. For example killing curse green eyes, but it's an intentional color change to look more intimidating. Or Gringotts inheritance tests, but Lily and James spent most of the family fortune in the last war and there isn't too much left. Or animagus transformation, but it's a relatively useless animal.

** I can deal with pup and cub and I don't even hate when Harry is actually Hadrian or Harrison. But I hate the random shortening of names like if Harry starts calling Severus 'Sev' or Remus 'Remy' and Sirius 'Siri' or god forbid I just saw Draco being called 'Drake.' The absolute last straw for me though is randomly calling Harry 'Ry'.

I can believe 'Mione' coming out once or twice in an offhanded way, but the rest are a big leap for me. Especially from Harry to someone significantly older than him. It feels like they are used to show a closeness that doesn't exist yet.

****** Yeah, I really think it's the manufactured closeness that they typically represent bothers me more than the nicknames themselves.

Like if Harry has known Sirius for two days and starts calling him Siri that makes no sense to me. And iirc he tended to default back to calling Lupin Professor not suddenly be on shortened first name basis.

******* Makes sense. I typically don't mind pet names in fics that out of context would sound ridiculous but that evolved naturally as part of people getting closer over time in a fic. I once read a fic that saw Harry raised at Hogwarts since he was a small kid (I don't remember what fic it was, sorry) and he still occasionally reverted to "Auntie Min" in private when he eventually became a student. If canon Harry did that, I'd probably stop reading the fic, but it made sense in context.
