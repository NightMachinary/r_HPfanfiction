I seriously can't find any that use the Giant Squid for more than just a paragraph. It can be a crack-fic or anything else really, no preferences. I just think this character needs a little more showtime.


** Well, there's the infamous [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3096379/1/First-Encounter][First Encounter]], which is Giant Squid/Hogwarts. Also notable is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10452052/1/One-Night-With-the-Squid][One Night with the Squid]], which pairs it with Tonks. These are the only two that come to mind.

** Abandoned after four chapters, but an interesting take on the messy postwar situation: linkffn(8283844). The Giant Squid begins to behave erratically, and Hermione and Goyle cross professional paths when dispatched to deal with the situation.

** Plays a role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiners Fire]] and sequel. Not a huge role, but bigger than usual. [[/spoiler][Saves Harry's life after an attack by other students, and actual helps point out them/one of them]]
