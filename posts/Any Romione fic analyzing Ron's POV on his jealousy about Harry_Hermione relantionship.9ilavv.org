Like when in book 7 Ron is jealous because he is kind of convinced Harry and Hermione have something. Romione please.


** Well, my story "Divided and Entwined" might come close to your request, during the part where Hermione is torn between the two, and Ron's not feeling too optimistic about his chances. It was originally planned as a Harry/Hermione story, but as the relationships developed during the writing, Ron came out on top, so to speak.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
