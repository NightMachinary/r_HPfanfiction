Looking for fics set in a wizarding world that presents itself as grandiose/fantastical but is really a lot less impressive. Ideally with this discovered over the course of the fic.

Some concepts to give you an idea of the feel i am looking for:

- Wizarding Britain is small (relative to muggle and/or other wizarding nation's) and that actually translates into reduced power.
- Despite presenting the Wiz and Minister as Prime Minister & Parlament, they are more like mayor and city council
- Dumbledore is in the position of a general who returned from a world war to a town with a KKK problem. It isn't his raw power but skills and experience no one else in town has. And his skills aren't necessarily the ones needed for the situation.
- The wizards are not that much of a threat to Muggles (not enough of them to do much damage, unable to hit hardened targets, wouldn't be able to stand against a military unit.). The attacks are more targets of opportunity than strategic.
- Wizarding economy is overly primative. Perhaps based on wizards spending large amounts of time creating enchanted objects. Would easily succumb to an economic attack. Maybe wizards can't have their own Bank because there simply isn't enough free labor for an endevor that big.
- Maybe the wizard world as a rump state: used to be much bigger but is now a shadow itself.
- If doing that, possibly the ever stupid 'Lord and Lady' setup, but have it actually mean nothing. Something like Rapture premise: even if only the top 5% of society survives a disaster, it doesn't mean everyone lives like Kings, as someone always has to clean the toilets.
- The wizarding world doesn't care about voldemorte because the entire wizarding Britain is just a few thousand people.

I do want it to be something the characters discover (start out thinking it is as presented then find out it is much less impressive). 'Character meets wizarding world, immediately finds fatal flaw, and curbstomps them' us a boring story.

Edit: I do note I am generally unimpressed with that lot of strange 'harry and classmates get taken and trained by minitary/spy organization then infiltrate wizarding world and take it down from inside'. That is more 'the wizarding world really is grand but has one fatal flaw' and not what I am looking for here


** One thing to keep in mind is the nature of the Wizarding world as a small post-scarcity society. Canonically, Hogwarts is free, and wizard with sufficient power/skill have the ability to create everything they need for daily life- shelter, water, etc. Food can't be created, but according to Deathly Hallows you can make more of it if you already have some. Even if they have troubles and are "backwards" in some way, they have a lot of conveniences that simply aren't accessible for muggles.

A lot of people also talk about wizards as "backwards," especially as it relates to technology, but remember that Harry Potter takes place in the 90s. Wizards may not have traveled to the moon, but technology we commonly see today didn't have widespread use. The first cell phone was only invented in the early 70s. The "modern" internet wasn't really in existence until ~1993-4.

*** Any fics showing the wizarding world as backwards seem to miss te clear point that it's not the muggle world. Their culture is about magic not tech. There is no reason for them at all to be concerned with technology.

From a economic standpoint I do think that the wizarding economy is quite complicated and diverse while canon doesn't show this is actually shows enough to be able to assume this.

For a disperity of power a war between wizards and muggles is always without even the smallest doubt won by the wizards.

**** It is nowhere near as cut and dry in the books as you are describing it. These are all ambitious points (which is what makes them fun to explore in fanfiction).

As I stated elsewhere, this post was very much not asking for a tech stomp. But since you mentioned it, it is important to note that exploring ideas of stagnation or lack of progress don't necessarily mean technical progression.

For the economy, there are very many gaps in cannon that need to be filled in. (How is there such a concentration of wealth in a post scarcity society? Why does it seem the only wizarding jobs are auror, potionmaster, animal handler, and schoolteacher?)

More importantly, it doesn't even matter if you assume a wizarding Britain small enough for all students to be going through Hogwarts. A 4000 person isolated economy is going to be pretty simplistic, especially with a portion of them being too wealthy to work.

That last point is completely speculation, it is left unspecified in the books. There are several scenarios you can imagine that would fit the books having Muggles win a conflict. The books seem to show Wizards as undoubtedly better individual fighters, but show relatively little of group fights.

The "Muggles could just drown us with bodies until some of them got lucky" is a popular one. Another is "Wizards have not had to stand against gunfire/targeted missiles/Army Tactics". It is a very common explanation used for the SOS that Muggles could do some serious damage if they knew and wanted.

Also remember that raw power is rarely the decider in wars. Organizational strength, flexibility, and will are hugely important. And I don't think there is any doubt that Wizarding Britain is organizationally very very weak.

***** On the economics they need to be filled but that is because we see the wizarding worlds troug the eyes of a boy that has no interest in how the world works. We actually see glimses of many jobs.

The concentration of wealth passive income is the obvious explanation.

And for a wizard vs muggle war. Why do wizards always win exactly because of your quote:

"Also remember that raw power is rarely the decider in wars. Organizational strength, flexibility, and will are hugely important. And I don't think there is any doubt that Wizarding Britain is organizationally very very weak."

Wizards can apparate anywhere any time. They can imperieus anyone. So from a millitary standpoint not a single order is reliable anymore. Everybody everywehre is now an assasisin for the wizards who can make you secretary your wife and your children into murderes.

With the reather easy destruction of powerplants they cut of most communication and food supplies. Same goes for the destruciton of oil supplies. Mass starvation will follow.

Poisoning water supplies will be easy and undectable enough.

Every airplane is now a wizards weapon.

Wizards don't even have to know any of this information themselves. They can easily veritaserum anyone and imperious muggles to do anything.

On the muggle side any organisation is crumbiling in minutes after the start of the war.

"We can use magic, therefore we can be entirely ignorant about biology, electronics, IT and the digital revolution."

Does this really sound like a good foundation for a society? Because frankly, it leads to the majority of the population thinking that non-wizards are literally animals, at best treated with condescension and amusement by the "tolerant" faction. I wouldn't live in Wizarding Britain in a million years, not unless there's a major bloody coup by muggleborns after the fall of Voldemort.

That would be the same as a wizard saying. Muggles are animals killing of other humans by the millions using techonology for the discturction of whole races. The destruction of nature and the abonemend of community.

****** The problem with your perspective is that there is no real "outside". It's not like the Wizarding World is a small country that doesn't accept immigrants, the moment a muggleborn student starts their Hogwarts education, he/she gets pulled into an entirely different world with strange ideologies. This automatically makes it justifiable for muggleborns (and magical races that have been subjugated in the past) to demand change and seek a more educated society. The alternative of course is keeping everything to the "old families" which results in having sex with your first cousin to preserve the population, but that's not exactly ideal.

The way I see it, the magical world is headed towards an irreconcilable culture clash unless it does one of two things: 1) Integrate muggleborn wizards as soon as they are detected, socialising them entirely in the wizarding way of doing things ; 2) Fundamentally change to bring the worlds more into line. The HP series takes place in the 90s, and it was conceivable, if fantastical, to imagine a world like Wizarding Britain back then. But now? Just think of an average child growing up right now, they consider the Internet, smartphones etc. as a basic fact of civilization. Would such a child even /want/ to live in a world where digital media doesn't even exist in any form? The discrepancy is beyond enormous, it's a potent brew for bloody conflict after bloody conflict.

I told you there is no reason for the magical society to be concerned with technology. They have magic to fill every need. They can't use techonogy in their forming years age 11 to 17 10 out of the 12 months. So technology will even if its introduced never be a big part of their lives.

*** Or let me put it a different way:

There are some items that are fun to explore in fanfic: Adults seem incompetent at their jobs, the economy seems primative, has the tenants of 'world ending crisis ignored by those that should know better..

These are sometimes explored with 'All wizards are stupid and can't use logic', or 'wizards are backwards uncultured' or such.

I was interested an a less common approach of 'wuzarding Britain just doesn't matter that much'. You can't compare the 'best of the best' of millions of people with 'the best of the best' of a few thousand. The muggle government / international government could be ignoring the because they just can't do that much damage if they tried (they don't see it as a dark lord trying to launch his conquest of the world, but a wanna be warlord taking over a remote village.).

Seemed like an interesting direction to explore.

*** Well first, the speed at which the world was changing was at a phenomenal clip all throughout the 1900s, and while technology changed radically between 1995 to 2005, it also did so 1985 to 1995.

But regaurdless, I wasn't really asking for a 'backwards wizarding world' story. I know those have been done alot. It was more of one where the wizarding Britain was passing itself off as more than it actually is, and getting called on it. (And not necessarily in auggle vs wizard way. You could do it via wizarding nation's as well)
