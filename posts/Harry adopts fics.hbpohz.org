** There's linkffn(Dudley's Memories), which is a prequel to a series of fanfics which involve Harry taking in an abused child. It's post Hogwarts and follows the epilogue, for the most part.

*** This is really good one.

Also, Harry runs orphanage (but he is in very limited contact with the kids, because he just doesn't have time being a full-time Auror, so he just comes to play etc. and pays for the whole thing) in linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50).

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
