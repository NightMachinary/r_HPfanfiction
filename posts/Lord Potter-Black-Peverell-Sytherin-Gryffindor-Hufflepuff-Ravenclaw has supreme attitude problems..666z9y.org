Don't you hate it when ^ is always super edgy and is disrespectful to every single adult ever, and he is like, "Oh I'm richer than everyone so bow down to me," I know i'm probably exaggerating a bit, but I hate it when he intimidates Dumbledore with all his titles, and Dumbledore is portrayed as a senile bumbling fool. I mean really, just because Harry has like 10 titles, does not mean he is suddenly more powerful than a 100+ year old master of magic. Also in these type of stories Harry always becomes cold and distant to all the Weasley's and is always reprimanding them and being all frosty and a total bitch.

** That's partly the reason why most of those stories are so bad. It feels like some kid just got done watching Naruto where every single clan has like a Bloodline Ability, so naturally, the same thing applies for Harry Potter, and Harry Potter has to be the melting pot of the wizarding world because his mother is secretly pureblood or some bs. I like the way Untitled Tome viewed being Half-Blood as mixing the "oldest of the old" and the "newest of the new" when it came to blood, viewing most of those wizards as being naturally more powerful.

I don't think it's the fact that they make Dumbledore a bumbling fool, it's just that if Harry is the only one to suddenly gain common sense, then yes, everyone else is a bumbling fool compared to him.

Side Note: My least favourite part of these stories is the Ancient Runes and Arithmancy being suddenly super powerful op branches of magic that Daphne Greengrass just so happens to take too. And Harry being apparently a 'maths expert'.

rip fanfiction Dumbledore. I'm not a fan of Yudowsky, but I do agree with the point of characters being "smarter" than you or being able to make

Also yea, Ancient Runes is supposed to be just for translating foreign languages and Arithmancy. The runes thing is just so prevalent because of how magic systems in other fiction literature - the same thing with wards, or (even directly) seals in Naruto. Arithmancy is about magical prediction with numbers, so I have no idea how that turned into spellcrafting and whatnot. Also he's 11 when he stops muggle schooling, it's highly unlikely he even knows algebra.

To be honest that idea always made a lot of sense to me. Lily and James must have been huge morons and terrible judges of character if they had no idea about their bigotry and outright hatred towards magic (The Dursleys aren't very subtle and Petunia is Lilys sister!). The Potters would have made precautions, especially since they were directly targeted by Voldemort and had at least a couple of friends who they surely would have preferred as guardians in case of their demise.

I mean - I get it - Rowling needed some convenient and cliched way to set up her poor orphan child who is secretly a Wizard, but it /really really/ doesn't make a lot of sense. There's a lot more internal consistency in those Dumbledore conspiracy theories.

5. Frank Longbottom with further contingencies left to Dumbledore's discretion.

Unfortunately, Sirius was imprisoned, Peter was thought dead, and Frank and Alice were permanently incapacitated, and when Sacrificial Protection fell into Dumbledore's lap, he made the most of it by putting Harry with the Dursleys.

No seriously though, this was not about Dumbledore's obvious negligence in regards to Harry's upbringing, but that the idea seems reasonable that people should have known they didn't want their child with the Dursleys (be it through their will or their acquaintances and friends). Sure you can construct scenarios in which Dumbledore still has to put him there as a last resort (temporarily?!? I'd still have some questions about why though), but that's not what's going on in canon, right?

The idea that there's a document somewhere saying something like "dear God please not the Dursleys" doesn't seem worthy of ridicule in any case. Again, seems like something responsible parents would do if their relatives hate everything your child stands for.

IIRC, Harry is put there because of the sacrifice Lily made which protects Harry when he lives with someone of Lily's blood. There's no mention of a will in canon as far as I remember, but a will could have been made and included a list of people and a stip that says "not the Dursleys". I can believe that and accept the part about the will, but the "blood protection" doesn't protect Harry from abuse inside the home.

Right which is exactly why Dumbledore is either senile or a cunt. If Harry absolutely has to live with the Dursleys the very least he could do is to scare the Dursleys enough to not have Harry live in a cupboard. "Well these are absolutely unsuitable guardians for Harry, but it's the only save place for him with absolutely no alternative - so i guess i have to go full batshit-insane and never check up on him ever again and have him enter a school full of death eater children completely unprepared in 10 years. let's just hope he doesn't turn out like Riddle did. Yes. Hope has to be enough. This is a totally sensible plan and not the least bit crazy."

Meh I could see it, but I find it really hard to believe that Dumbledore can't afford a personal visit to the saviour of the Wizarding world like once a year and check on his circumstances. Like, really? No-one is that busy. And he doesn't even have any family (except for a brother who hates him). He can make the time.

Heh yep, such instances is exactly why I wrote pseudo-fidelius... It would need to offer some of the protections without the obvious problems that come with it. A normal fidelious is of course out of the question, I'm thinking along the lines of a spell that just would make people disinterested about the location of Harry Potter or forgetting about it if they aren't confronted regularly.

I'd like to read a story where Harry is murdered in his first week in muggle-school though, because he left the wards and Dumbledore's plans are in tatters.

************ OK, so Dumbledore shows up and starts lecturing the Dursleys on how to treat their nephew. What's more likely to happen?

1. The Dursleys take Dumbledore's advice to heart, and start treating Harry like family.
2. The Dursleys tell Dumbledore that they didn't volunteer for this in the first place, so if he doesn't leave and take Harry with him, they are giving the wizard-spawn up into the foster system.

Which one do you think is more likely? My money is on Outcome 2.

Now, you might say (hypothetically), "But turbinicarpus, if the Dursleys choose Outcome 2, Dumbledore can just threaten and/or brainwash them into keeping Harry and treating him better."

To that I answer, that yes, he can, but free will and intent is important in magic, so if he does that, will the sacrificial protection that depends on what little love Petunia still has for he sister still hold?

On point, though, no, it's not implicit, because there are many other reasons she'd not bother ranking her explicitly, like, for example, deciding that 6 people (including the Potters themselves) were enough, as well as not wanting to get Muggles involved, especially if Muggles raising a known child of wizards might be considered a bit weird.

Wait, are you offended on behalf of a fictional family? Why is it "out of line"? If I imagine how a racist family would raise black or jewish child a couple of things come up:

- Treat him as a second class citizen? (Check)

- Use him as a slave or indentured servant? (Check)

Of course, Dumbledore did it for the sole reason of having to watch someone else have to do it.

** I especially hate it when its then assumed that no one fucking knows who the new Lord Gryffindor (or whatever) is. As if there wouldn't be people /constantly/ checking on some of the most important names in the wizarding world, especially when empty government seats are the result. Why didn't James, or Fleamont, or Henry take up the Gryffindor title? And why in the world was this all managed by bankers?

***** I always find that hilarious. Even in non marriage-contract harem fics the only difficulty in having more than one wife seems to be the money. As soon as Harry gets rich no one has a problem with him having 20 different wives (several of which are either twins or sisters) least of all all the women.

** Not all 'Lord Potter' and 'Lord Black' fics have him behaving like a jerk:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): People addressed him as 'Lord Black' later. He remained perfectly level-headed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Other than he seemed too mature for an 11 years old, he was socially well adjusted and had a huge support base.

** Currently, i am writing a fic with a fem Harry which uses th3 Lord/Lady title, but shes only lady of House Slytherin because A, the Wizarding World got rid of nobility (the noble is 'most noble house' is just there for the sake of it) and B, portrait salazars just like "its been 1000 years and my heir has not showed up. You can talk to snakes right? Well, your my heir now... no ifs and or buts about it.". So far her name is just Lady Henrietta Lily Potter of House Slytherin, and thats how long it will stay.

Note, Salazars paiting is under a translation spell to deal with all the ... actually, no, its not stated yet, so i am now changing it to snake speech, thats how they got passed the language barrier. As for why the painting is so life like, is because that was the only thing the real Salazar could speak with during his time hiding from the wizarding world.
