anyone have any suggestions on any Harry/Hermione fanfics? ive been looking but cant find any that I like. either too boring or the same thing over and over.


** What are you looking for?

What genre?

Do you want romance to be the focus?

What tropes do you want/ don't want?

**** Any idea why I just received your reply when it is showing that you posted a day ago?

I am not really into smut so can't help with that. Not really into dark fics either but I know of a few and will link them. You should probably post this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] for more recs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10034363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-of-Deceit]] It has smut and think it was supposed to be dark.

Hope you enjoy them.
