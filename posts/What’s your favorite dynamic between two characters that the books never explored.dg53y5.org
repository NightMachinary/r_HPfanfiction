Two characters that either share a past or a common trait that either never interact in canon or else they don't interact enough.

My personal favorite is Sirius and Bellatrix. Two first cousins who grew up similar in age, probably spending holidays and a lot of time together. Yet the possible complexity of that relationship is never explored.

Bellatrix is 9 years older than him (1951-1960). They would not have shared Hogwarts time, but because Bellatrix is at Hogwarts, they would see each other even less.

**** Bellatrix was born in 1951. Narcissa in 1955. Andromeda somewhere in between (it's not specified, only that she's the middle child, could in theory even be a twin to either sister).

Which coincidentally is the reason I can't stand many of the post war fics where Teddy is significant. A lot of fics make Andromeda a frail grandmother when she would be 43-48. With magical life spans, she should probably even be able to still have children on her own. (For reference, Tonks was born in 1973).

***** The frail grandmother thing makes me so mad, and it's everywhere. She's not old even by RL standards, and wizards continue to have an active career well into their hundreds.

Andromeda also never seems to have a job. Like, she is a single (grand)mother, she was disinherited, and I doubt Lupin had a knut to his name to leave to his son.

**** Tell me, how much do you interact with your cousins who are almost a decade older while you spend most of your time apart (first Bella at Hogwarts, then Sirius)?

I'm not denying that there would be interactions, but given their age differences, I really don't see much happening. By the time Bellatrix left for Hogwarts, Sirius was 2. When she returned, she was 18 and Sirius 9. And presumably, she was already starting to become a monster if she wasn't one already. Cousins can become a sibling, but not under those conditions.

***** Fairly regularly in fact. I wouldn't necessarily call them siblings but I would certainly call them friends. And even if I don't see them as often now I saw them plenty when I was a child.

Besides I do NOT base my fiction and fanfiction off of reality. All that makes for is boring stories. What's more fun to read about? Bellatrix as Sirius' teasing older sister figure who, even if she didn't get him, liked him and had fun with him? Or a familial relationship that is so barely touched upon it may as well not exist in the first place like canon supplied us with?

****** I'm not saying that you shouldn't expand on canon, but to me it feels as if you picked the wrong characters for that. With Narcissa, there would be much more overlap and she didn't become such an awful human being. With Andromeda, Sirius would have more in common due to their shared rebellious nature.

I mean, you could write about Sirius losing his big sister figure, but due to his age, it would be very difficult to write him as he'd in single-digit ages for at least half of the fic and children that young think very differently to what we are used to. They are also rather boring for the most part as their thoughts are rather simple.

******* True but Sirius and Narcissa have NO interaction in canon whatsoever. If I'm remembering correctly the only reason we even know they're related is because Sirius said Bella was his cousin and we know that Narcissa is Bella's sister. As for Andromeda they would certainly have more in common but where's the fun in that. Tragedy is the name of the game.

And besides, in the context of actually writing something like this, I would not be using Bella's real age

********** I guess it depends on what you consider interesting. I honestly can't stand most fics set during that time period because only very few authors dare to make changes which would prevent canon (eg the Potter's surviving), so you know how it will end (or you can tell by the chosen divergence, eg Snape/Lily).

I'd love to read more outlandish premises set before canon (eg Sirius/Lily), but there's not a lot to be found tbh. A Sirius&Bellatrix fic only seems appealing to me if it is not the prelude to the OotP showdown.

*** This has always been the biggest missing plot point both in the books and in fanfiction, imo.

Katie Bell is 1 year up from harry so she would have been starting the team at the same time as him. There is so much you can do with that alone. All 3 of the girls make potential love interests in any sort of a normal world but katie in particular should be a much more important character than we see in the books.

We obviously only saw a small amount of school life but they should be a lot closer unless they end up hating each other (which happens in irl teams plenty).

Harry should seemingly be pretty damn close with the twins. best friends with their younger brother, gave them a boatload of money, sees them constantly at school, practices with them all the time, saved their sister etc etc. They should be much closer friends throughout most of the series.

Ollie i can see going either way depending on how obsessed he is with quidditch he may not interact with harry much at all outside practice/prep or actual games.

Judging by Lily's reactions to Snape's friends, assault on a regular basis. Or at least some were and the others didn't call them out or tried to stop them.
