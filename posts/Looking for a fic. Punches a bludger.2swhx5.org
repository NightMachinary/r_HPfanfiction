I remember a long time ago where harry gets fed up with a bludger for some reason, not sure if it was the one from dobby second year or not, and he punches it. I'm just kinda curious to know what story it was from.


** OH! I know I've read this one!

It's a Slytherin!Harry story? He gets really stressed out between quiditch and constant detentions in potions... and then snaps during practice and punches the bludger... Forcing Flint to talk to Snape about laying off him IIRC.

I forget the name but hopefully this helps someone else's memory.

*** I remember reading this one recently! It was some sort of Snape/Harry mentor thing from what I remember.

I'll go through my history and see if I can track it down
