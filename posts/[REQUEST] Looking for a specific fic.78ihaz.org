Looking for a specific story, from what I remember, it's a time travel one where another Potter/a member of a Noble Family gets a peak at Harry's memories/Harry shows them his memories of the future after Harry Tells them about a great war he was involved in as that he was the only survivor. The person who sees the memories are horrified because they think War Harry was in happened in their present, and all the people in them were members of other families and the reason they can't remember the people in the memories is because someone cast a spell to remove them from the memory of the world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
