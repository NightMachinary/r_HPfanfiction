I ask if tonks or any metamorph are biologically immortal. I recently thought of this when i remembered her turning into an old woman and back again. Could she stay 20 forever is there anything in the books which show she can has to use magic to hold up a transformation or is the magic only in the change itself.


** There is nothing in the canon to suggest that she was blessed with eternal youth due to the shapeshifting. In fact, the power seemed to always be 'on' and would defy her if her spirits were down. I like to believe that she could have been immortal so long as she never grew tired of living. Of course, I'm a bit biased when it comes to Miss N.Tonks.

I also like to believe that Perenelle Flamel is a metamorph whose blood is the key ingredient in making the Philosopher's Stone.

****** On Remus/Tonks: There's the canon-compliant perspective and then there's my twisted way of seeing things. In canon, I think Remus caught her eye because he was kind and funny in a quiet way, unusual for a Gryffindor. They had a spark, and that would have been enough to build a relationship for a little while, but then Remus did the one thing Tonks never had expected or experienced; when she offered to get intimate, he said 'No'.

Well that was a challenge to her entire self-image, and she kept pursuing him until he caved. They had a great time and then he tried to cut it off. Tonks' beliefs in how relationships work were once again knocked askew and she was even more motivated to pursue and resolve the inconsistency of 'We like each other and just had a great shag, so obviously and from a most heartfelt love for you, you must please go away and never think of me again.'

Eventually they fell into a balanced if traditionally-inverted set of roles- her as the agressive protector and bread-winner, him as the caretaker and likely house-husband.

In another time and place, it would have made for a great comedy-romance. During a war when Tonks is quite literally the most effective intelligence agent alive but has to be benched because she's pregnant... it's a fucking tragedy. A stupid waste of talents and resources.

If you want the twisted version, take the above and add 'Remus is actually gay, and the reason they shag so well is because she doesn't care and can play both parts'.

As for Perenelle... that's a trip down a deeper rabbit hole.

******* True. I personally never saw it like that. My thought was basically it was war and they could die at anytime so i always saw it as one of those relationships where if it was happening outside of war it never would of happened.

Mainly because they would have seen it as a little weird (age gap) muggles would make more of an issue, but hey wizard/witch where you live longer.

Also remus could have just ran away since there was no war keeping him there, and lets face it he doesn't seem to stick around for harry.

******** I don't think the war had too much to do with them getting together. If anything, Remus appeared to be looking forward to dying for the sake of his friends and for Harry, as it would end his torment on a high note. He reached for some joy of the moment with Tonks but resisted establishing a household, since he'd already lived thirty years in fear of his disease hurting his loved ones. A family would just up the ante on the risk.

Tonks wasn't thinking about the war when she pursued him to build a family. She saw a controlled, stable, intelligent wizard with a good heart and decided to take him while he was available. After all the immature and shallow wand-jockeys she'd been seeing, he was a serious treasure (with one or two flaws) that she really liked.

********* Yeah, but without the war would she have really settled down in her early twentys. I always saw her as an adventurer and very bubbly not at the point in her life where she was mature enough maybe later, but without the war i honestly don't see it happening as soon as it did. I mean war has a way of maturing you.

** I personally just assume for my stories that metamorphs are really, /really/ powerful if they choose to use their power to the maximum of its potential.

So my answer is: Yes, metamorphs can, in theory, be immortal. If they grow old, they just grow young again.

But I also go really all out with my headcanon of metamorphs so you might want to take all this with a grain of salt. I assume that their entire body is like a normal human's mind. Its starts with a basic, very unformed entity of very little influence. I write metamorph babies as weird "blobs" of organic mass with an instinctual desire to form into a rough human shape.

As they grow up their body comes together as a mix of influences. Most prominent would be the features of the parents, but if the baby would be abandoned and found by apes (or something), the metamorph could also take on this form and live with it. For example, if the metamorph child likes stags they grow antlers as an emphatic reaction to them.

Young metamorphs act more instinctual. If they are afraid of the dark, their skin begins to glow like the back-end of a firefly. If they can't reach the cookie jar, they grow their spines out. If they're cold they grow a fur. If they threaten to drown, they grow gills. If they really want to hold onto something (their mothers hand, for example) they could grow more finger joints and stronger tendons. And so on and so forth...

Its only fully socialized metamorphs that keep their morphs in a more palatable variety of human forms. They hold tighter control over their ability due to stigma, not because they couldn't still form whatever the hell they wanted. Its the human desire to fit in that keeps them from going crazy with their morphs and mostly starts in the early years of puberty.

Metamorphs are hermaphrodites, with functional genitals for both sexes. The term "sex" also doesn't truly apply to metamorphs as they have no biological limits. Metamorphs are in mind and biology their gender and mostly stay within the range of their gender-identity in their casual forms. If a metamorph is pregnant there are two possible outcomes. Either the child, too, is a metamorph and goes along with its mothers (or fathers) morphs, or it will eventually die during a morph in the pregant metamorph's sleep.

Just as the mind of a human can be crippled by mental disorders, so are the bodies of metamorphs going to be influenced by said disorders. Depression lets the body go stagnant and into an automated mode of pure functioning for the sake of functioning. Bipolar disorder may show itself in the form of two separate "casual" morphs that change and intermix. Truly horrible mental disorders can go as far as to dissolve the body of the metamorphs, make them assume horrible visions of terrors as their forms, or take on the form of a corpse.

I once wrote a small drabble where Tonks reacts to the question of her "true form" by morphing into an eldritch horror and chanting "Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!"

I love me my metamorphs.

*** Is there really a link between the change that Pettigrew went through and innate metamorphmagus powers, though? Because for all we know they might not actually be as close as you'd assumed. I will admit to not being fully certain of it but I do not think it is ever mentioned that metamorphmagic actually is transfiguration rather than something else, something unique to itself, and it is that lack of knowledge on that part that makes it quite hard to use Pettigrew as an example because he might very well be a wholly different thing as far as the mechanics of the actual change are concerned.

*** But if it was just transfiguration with enough practice anyone could do it, but with metamorphs they have magic in every cell and is (from what we've seen from teddy) a natural and instinctiual part of them like breathing.

Also metamorphs seem to be very rare so i doubt much is known about them. Lastly it is not the same as an animagus no one can learn to be a metamorph so it could and probably does work differantly.

Sorry this is last, but it has been shown that the animagus has some influence on a human like peter's rat like body/face and sirius bark like laugh and dog like hair.

** Cellular degeneration and imperfect replication would still be a thing in here. Hell, the constant to-ing and fro-ing between forms would imply that her lifespan is actually shorter than that of an ordinary wizard's. Unless her abilities somehow nullified these, in which case she could very well have a lifespan measured in millenia instead of centuries.

This is one of the many, many things that are left to the reader to determine in canon.

**** Not to be sarcastic either, but in that case the answer to the “can metamorphmagi actually live longer due to their magic?” question, a “yes/no” question, that we got is “magic”.

Kind of appropriate in a way, but silly too. That said, as we are given neither reasons why any of those two options would be true nor reasons why it couldn't be true, I think it's up to the readers to decide if this is how they see it and for writers to decide how they will portray it.

*** I think family inheritance being patriarchal and having to keep everything in the family is purely fanon. Harry inheriting only works if there are no strict rules on inheritance like "oldest male relative gets it all", so Sirius can essentially do what he wants with everything he owns (including giving it to Tonks).

Even if the Black's had some sort of inheritance law and they demanded the heir to be male and Tonks counted as male, she wouldn't inherit. Her mother was cast out of the family, so Tonks wouldn't count as related for strict family law.

The only situation that would prevent a female Tonks from inheriting but would enable a male Tonks to do so would be a "Sirius can give everything to any male person he chooses" situation.

**** So are you saying Harry is eligible because he is 1/8 Black (as is Ron in canon), but Andromeda having been cast out eliminates Tonks (or just that Tonks and Andi are basically the only people on the planet that can't be deemed heirs)? Because otherwise Sirius picked Harry, albeit his godson, over his niece. His choice and all, but it still seems icky IMO. And whats fun is that in terms of Narrative, the child of Lupin being a future Black heir just seems such a perfect thumb in the eye to Walburga. I suppose HP could have later selected Teddy as the heir to the Black family or something, and you get to the same point.

***** I'm mostly saying that there's no inheritance scheme where it makes sense that Harry inherits, because Draco Malfoy'd come first, as he's the son of Sirius' cousin. So it's just Sirius' will that decides who inherits and being related to him doesn't matter. This also means that Tonks' gender doesn't matter when it comes to inheriting, unless there's some obscure "only men can inherit" rule that's never mentioned.

It's also not that weird for Sirius to choose Harry over Tonks. James Potter was basically a brother to him, so from Sirius' point of view, Harry is his godson and nephew, while Tonks is "just" the child of a cousin he liked. It would also make sense for Sirius to divide everything up between Harry, Tonks, Remus and other people he liked. IIRC, there's no indication of Tonks and Remus /not/ getting anything, Harry just got the house.

Of course there isn't much to go on with regards to their abilities in the books so this is just speculation on my part.

** Possibly, it depends on how much control she had over her finer cellular details, but that opens up a can of worms on could she basically make herself some kind of superhuman. But even without that, she would have lived a long life, Rowling through a bunch of minor details basically made wizards have no set age they died at.

- Barry Winkle was a wizard who was 755 at the time of the first book
- Armando Dippet died at 355ish
- Nicholas Flammel managed to give himself pseudo-immortality and lived to just under 700 along with his wife
- Griselda Marchbanks was at least a generation older than Dumbledore, probably older which puts her at least at 133, probably far older since she was his OWL examiner.

So yeah, age isn't the same death sentence it is for muggles.

** It's never stated in canon that anyone tried to experiment on Tonks. Other than who her parents were, it's also not stated in canon that anyone disliked/feared/looked down on her for being a metamorphmagus.

The reason I bring this up, is because the Wizarding world is VERY slow to change, socially and politically. We've seen this time and time again. Meaning that metamorphmagi have probably been accepted in society for quite some time, and it's either not necessary or frowned upon to do biological studies on them.

Without those aspects of life as a metamorphmagus, it seems quite simple to conclude that they wouldn't be any more targeted in wars or conflicts than anyone else and there shouldn't be any recent reasons they've been hunted.

We know that Metamorphmagi are rare, but not so rare that Tonks should be the /only metamorphmagus/ in all of wizarding London, if they were effectively immortal.

It's never stated one way or another in canon, but contextually you can conclude that they're not any more immortal than any other wizard or witch.

***** What the hell are you on about? They're constantly talking about how Wizarding London is decades behind in social and technological advancements. No they are not apart from how they can't advance technologically because magic disrupts electronics, but they have advanced magically. As a matter of fact it's stated that albus and flamel discovered 12 uses of dragon blood or messaging patronus, and more. We also only see from harrys point of view for the most part making it a narrow point of view.

Hermione says numerous times throughout the books that the government and pureblood ideologies are ancient and backwards. Yes compared to a muggle upbringing of a different culture. They have an entirely different culture sure you have corrupt politicians but that is suprisingly normal for muggles i.e. Us as well.

The Wizarding world, as stated several times throughout the books, essentially stopped progressing socially/technologically after the Statute of Secrecy. Once again 1. Electricity does not work well around magic and 2. I have never seen that stated. Show me where that is stated preferablly from someone who lives in the magical world not someone who has come in and read a few books and think they know it all now.

Except the history of the Wizarding world (London in particular) is quite well expanded upon if you pay attention to the books. No it's not the best we get are vague comments like albus beat grindlewald or order of the phoenix or i guess tom riddles diary or memories from albus about tom riddle once again making it pretty narrow in view.

I made it very clear where fact end and assumptions started. I'm not sure what you're talking about. Fair enough i may have not read through it clearly. To be honest i was pretty tired when i read and wrote my comment.
