Harry can talk to snakes via parseltongue. Are there any fics which take this up to eleven, so that the MC can communicate with ANY magical or non-magical animal? Maybe it isn't necessarily talking to the animals, rather nudging them along mentally, a la Aquaman's ability.


** This technically fits:

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)

Which has a sequel and is maybe ~150k words altogether.

Great fic, but definitely a little weird, lol. Also Harry talking to animals isn't central to the fic, it's just something he can do that comes up a decent amount.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I'm writing one, in the early stages still. It's a bit trope-y because it's a prompt/gift fic and that's what the prompter wanted, but the beastmaster magic should be pretty original.
