** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5432341/1/The-Black-Bunny][The Black Bunny]] is by far the "lightest" of the fics, but it does carry an mpreg warning. The author has defined it as crack, but it actually does have a really nice plot. Also Fred/Draco/George.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey]] is the go-to author for LVHP for me though, and the Descent Into Darkness series, Rebirth, and Again and Again are all fics I'd recommend without hesitation, although I think all of them are abandoned (descent is completed but its sequel isn't). Don't let that stop you; the plot is phenomenal, and each fic already logs in at like 200k. Seriously, if you read nothing else in this reclist, at least give her a chance.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7899682/1/Schooled][Schooled]] is.... hard to describe. Another self-proclaimed crack fic with amazing plot, and it has a truly complete ensemble cast, with it taking place in this weird au where harry, his classmates, and the marauders are all in hogwarts together, with some of the teachers being from riddle's era. also if you check out only two links from this reclist make this the first. or second. shit, i can't choose. WIP, regularly updated(ish).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4088363/1/Hollow-Thunder-Vital-Lightning][Hollow Thunder, Vital Lightning]] is the fic that carries out the "harry goes back in time" trope the best. It's sporadically updated it, though.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6147206/1/Wand-Cores][Wand Cores]] has Harry going back in time and adopting Riddle, and copious amounts of grindelwald and dumbledore as well. it's amazing.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]] is my favourite fic by batsousai, and i recommend checking out her stuff if you like it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3532054/1/Paraselenic][Paraselenic]] has the "harry redoes his life" trope. Heavy angst.

And if you want something platonic, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] is an amazing fic about Harry going back in time and adopting Tom Riddle. It has a sequel too if you want to look that up.

If you want more recs (most of this is new stuff that was inspired by athey who like singlehandedly lifted this pairing out of obscurity in like '09 and before that there was just a lot of dark angstfic, but there are still a few gems that i didnt include) feel free to pm me!

*** I've read a fair amount of those, but will be reading the other ones. Glad to see that other people like the pairing. Batsutousai's Abandon is my favorite, but Xerosis is a close second. :)
