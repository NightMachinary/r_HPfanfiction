They have to actually kill him. That might not give much room for a story, but one-shots are fine.

Any recommendations?

  When Hermione travels back in time and kills Tom Riddle, the destruction of evil becomes an addiction she can't sate. Follow Hermione as she extracts her revenge...slowly. ONE-SHOT Time-Travel. DARK! RATED-M. R&R.

  Student discipline, true love, time travel, and the life of small ubiquitous objects. A little AU, and not too sensible.

** He doesn't personally kill Tom Riddle, but Tom isn't alive after Harry takes care of things in [[http://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Deja_Vu/Deja_Vu/][Deja Vu]] by Aaron St. Vines, which has my vote for "most efficient way to use time travel to take care of Voldemort."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] - Harry tries several times before he succeeds, though it doesn't quite fully take. I can't recommend this story enough.

*** Tbh I have a real hard time looking past Harry deciding to launch a one-man full out assault on Hogwarts in broad daylight. He'd have to go out of his way to come up with a worse, dumber plan to kill Tom than that.

Did he take Tom's place or something? 'Cause I've skipped to the end of that fic before and there's a Tom Riddle there.

**** The backstory is that Harry comes from a future where Voldemort won, and Harry went insane. Harry does not, it's a plot twist I won't spoil. It's my favorite fic, but don't feel any pressure to read.

  One last desperate gambit lands Harry in the past, to change the whole course of history - for the better. There's no turning back on the path Harry has taken, no second chances. Dark!Harry, vampire!Harry, time travel. 4th place in May DLP challenge.
