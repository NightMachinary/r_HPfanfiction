Standard Formula: Harry is immune to Fleur's allure. Fleur decides he is her mate. They dance around each other. Get together. The end.

Surely somebody has shook this formula up a little right?


** Well... "Adorable Violence" might qualify. Sort of.

** There's one whose name I can't remember, whose plot is one line. Shit.\\
Well, if someone else can get it, Harry is attacked in the Room of Requirement, I think. Rest is plot.

** Linkffn(For Love of Magic) has a slightly different formula that might be interesting to you but I think Harry and Fleur may end up together and fall into the old formula anyway.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
