For example,

Harry unleashing fiendfyre against Voldemort, Crouch Jr, several Death Eaters and half a hundred inferi in Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

Harry single handedly repelling the entire invasion of Kashykk in Linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

Harry confronting Gardulla the Hutt, Cad Bane, and the Death Watch inside the Hutt's bunker in Linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) among others

And then there's linkffn(Wind Shear) with Harry's first battle with Voldemort in Hogsmeade.

Note: No Death Eater Harry, no Death Eater pairings (yes, it includes Snape and Malfoy), no Death Eater apologism. And I'd like /Harry's/ flexes, no matter how non-canon it is, so no Harry getting Dumbledore's memories or powers or such ridiculous shit.


** If you want Flexing Harry, you could do a lot worse than linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity), in which timetravel!Harry starts flexing in the closing moments of the battle of the Ministry of Magic and doesn't stop for five days straight (four by the calendar, but there are time-turner shenanigans).

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

**** Hi! Author here.\\
It is a bit complicated, as he is possessing his own corpse. The body is technically alive, but Harry's soul can leave it behind while he goes to work as the Spectre.

A small bit of the Spectre's power keeps the body functioning, but in a kind of coma.

At a point in his long story, Jim Corrigan existed as both Corrigan and the Spectre as separate beings, almost independent. Harry has not learned to do that.

****** The Spectre is an extreme reality warper. Basically, he can do anything.\\
to take the job, a soul must accept to be bonded with the Wrath of (God or Pantheon) and from then on, the Soul get power, while the Spectre force gains purpose.

Still, you are not far with the astral projection idea. It's just going the other way. That was where Deadman enters the frame, he is nothing but a spirit, and has the power to enter a living body and posses it for as long as he wants.\\
back to Harry, the original body is not really required for the soul/Spectre to exist.\\
In Harry's case, he returned to the Cemetery, to find his own corpse. Under the guidance of Deadman, Harry returned to his body, reanimating it.\\
at this point, the only thing that keeps the body alive is the Spectre's power.

should the connection be severed or cancelled, Harry's body will go back to being a corpse.

**** Sorry, I did notice that after I recced Sum of Their Parts. It's not /technically/ Death Eater pairings. I decided not to remove it because while Harry does become a Dark Lord, he's not a Death Eater, and he doesn't adopt Death Eaters or become in any way an associate or ally of Voldemort. He becomes an independent Dark Lord, and as such, flexes a lot of both magical and social power.
