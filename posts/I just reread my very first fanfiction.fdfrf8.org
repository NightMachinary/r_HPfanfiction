** Mine was a horrible */epic crossover/* of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Buffy (maybe more?). I wrote it when I was 18ish, and dang it's terrible.

I did know to get a beta reader, who cautioned me to reconsider, but I published anyway.

She was right.

*** To be fair, even accomplished authors write romance that has little resemblance to real relationships. It's difficult to tell a great story out of people just getting a bit bored of each other, or breaking up because partner A wants to take a job in another city and partner B wants to remain where they are.

** Loool!

I was same age 13, but mine was that Sirius Black had a son Chad, who was a drug dealer...

Who went out with Daphne Greengrass, dimension travelled and smashed Hermione only to travel back to his original dimension and became a vigilante.

From here he killed Snape because of reasons, and Daphne cheated on him with Harry.

(Chad was also mixed race becuase my cousin who co-wrote it is mixed race also!)

Draco was a racist so Chad sold him drugs that paralyzed him. He got put on trial only to go free by giving everyone cocaine.

He was an assassin at age 10, and his best friend Jack died. Jack survived because Voldemort found him and resurrected him bc Jack is his son.

Jack becomes a Winter soldier character and kills Daphne.

And then our laptop broke and we deleted the story...

At least yours was better than mine.

(I think my cousins account Tydbox still has the 16 chapters we wrote)

** My very first was only ever written on an old mechanical typewriter. It was a Star Wars/Annimorphs crossover, about a creature called an Astral. The Astral looked exactly like an andalite, appart from it had wings and a tailblade that could block a lightsaber.

My second was an HP fic, centering on Corra Black. She was stolen by Voldemort, raised as his adopted daughter. I still remember her entry into my head, being led out from her cell in Azkaban, to stand on the cliff at the the edge of the island, in the middle of a storm. Then of course she went back to her cell. Was released because she'd been sentenced for Unforgivable use, which was about the only thing she never did.

She was also a magical species called a halfblood, which could turn into any form of one specific animal at will. In Corra's case, she was a wolf halfblood. Gave Snape nightmares, on taking up the DADA post, because she used to terrorize him when younger.

Somehow, she was also Harry's ... err... Cousin I think. Second cousin, perhaps. Made Harry and Voldemort meet on neutral grounds, to get to know one another.

It's a bit pedestrian and kind of boring but not terrible. I like to think my ideas and plots and character development skills have come along since then, but I'm not sure how to feel about the fact my writing style doesn't seem to have changed much in almost 20 years....

Back when I used to write single scenes and call that a story. Now I'm all about 100k word epics. No middle ground, apparently!
