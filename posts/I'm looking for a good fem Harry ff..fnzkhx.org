As the title says I'm looking for a good female Harry Potter fanfic. One that doesn't pair him / her with either Voldemort or Snape.

Thanks for your help in advance.

*** Certain Dark Things is eventual Harriet/Snape, though he isn't so repulsive.

Edit: I'm pretty sure Protection from Nargles and its sequel, Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor are not F/F stories. The tags don't have it, I read the first a while ago, and unless the second has a surprise genderbender, it's not F/F.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)
