I have always heard that some fics like ABC have not aged well. I wonder why. Have people's tastes changed?

Are there any fics that have aged well?


** Gotta be honest, I haven't heard a fic being referred to as having aged well/not well too often. At least not that I can remember.

But I guess you could refer to the original fics that introduced a trope/theme as not having aged well. Simply because in the years after, that trope/theme became so widely used that readers became bored with it. There are many absolute classics from 2000-2005 that suffer from that problem. They were absolutely groundbreaking when they first came out, the idea was new and fresh. But nowadays if you go back to read them they are nothing special, simply because it has been copied to death.

***** Rosswrock - The power of time. It's abandoned just as it started to get really good but it introduced like half of the super cringe tropes people think about. Shopping spree, multi compartment trunk, one of the first Dumbledore and Weasley bashing fics, the list goes on and on. It was revolutionary at the time, now it's kind of hard to read and not cringe.

** People's tastes do change even if the collective taste of the fandom doesn't as much. New readers are much more likely to hyper fixate on a pairing, trope, or character bash, to the extent that they don't filter out bad fics as long as they get their fix of whatever they are looking for. What they then see is the good parts of these fics without noticing the poor writing or other issues. As a general rule most readers shift away from fics like that as they read more. Looking back at a Robst focus without the hyper focus on Harmony Pairings and perfect Harry and you notice the questionably young relationships and other issues.

As the fandom has aged though, more people are out of that stage than are in it, so it does feel like the collective taste has changed.

Fics like ABC rely on a style of humor that many have outgrown, which is why they haven't aged as well for many.

There are lots of fics that do age well which come down to solid writing, lack of timeframe sensitive references, slang, or jokes, and lack of questionable content.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** The "They Shook Hands" series by Dethryl has, in my opinion, aged pretty well. As far as I'm aware, it's the oldest slytherin!Harry series that isn't simply retelling the books with Harry being in a different house. Quite a few elements from it are still used in slytherin!Harry fics nowadays.

Granted, the series has been rewritten to fit some stuff to canon as books came out (i.e. fem!Blaise replaced by Tracey Davis), but the originals are still up.

** The only fic I can really think of from 15 years ago that still holds up with is the Death Arch trilogy. First one is linkffn(2567446) Part of this may simply be due to the concept, which is one that hasn't been beaten to death like many other stories.

** Sexism, homophobia, transphobia that might have been seen as okay 15 years ago, but isn't now.

Like there's one well-known comedy fic where Harry has to defeat Voldemort in every possible universe, helping each of the local Harrys. It's a parody of a lot of fanfiction tropes of the time. So in one part, he finds a Harry with a whole harem who had been forced by marriage contracts to marry him, including people like Narcissa. The main character makes a point of thinking this is hot and awesome. In another part, he finds Harry and Draco sleeping (literally) together in a seemingly happy, consensual relationship. He finds this disgusting and instantly Avada Kedavra's both of them.
