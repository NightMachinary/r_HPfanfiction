I find it fascinating how “Mundane” is really trying to become a thing in HP fanfics.

A few authors had said that muggle sounded derogatory and demeaning in their author's notes when they'd have Harry travel back in time from his desolate timeline and he'd slip and call a muggleborn a mundane-born and then he'd have to explain-

In fact, some even called it equal to the N-word. Where did this come from?? Why is this a thing??? Mudblood is already the derogatory term so why...??????

I know it's not the point, but how do you call non-black americans who come from Africa?

** I honestly don't see how this would make sense. Muggle doesn't mean anything but non-magical. It's a made up word. It doesn't have any connotations. It isn't used as an insult because muggles don't even know the word. And mundane is supposed to be better? It means dull/boring or even mortal instead of spiritual/godly - that's a pretty negative connotations. I can see the term turning sour over the years if the story starts out in the future if there's more interaction with muggles, but who thought that mundane is a better, less insulting word?

  julesrbf: Where did you come up with the word "muggle"?

  JK Rowling replies -> I was looking for a word that suggested both foolishness and loveability. The word 'mug' came to mind, for somebody gullible, and then I softened it. I think 'muggle' sounds quite cuddly. I didn't know that the word 'muggle' had been used as drug slang at that point... ah well.

** It's worth considering that at least some of the negative connotations with the term "muggle" likely stem from the general HP fandom itself.

Muggle has become a term of insult across the fandom when wishing to insult those who have less knowledge or have only seen the films etc. On a subconscious level, this gives the term all the negative connotations it needs for writers to want to replace it.

** In general, when a group has a word to define another group, it tends to become US-VS-THEM and thus be used in a derogatory way at least some of the time.

Also, muggle is phonetically quite "bad", with an almost low-brow connotation, coming from mug (historically also a derogatory and pejorative term in itself) and a guttural sound -gle tipically used for "primitive" (as in not refined), harsh or disagreeable things.

** I have honestly considered using mundane before. I don't quite remember whether I ever put up anything that used it, but I wouldn't use it in the context of the HP fandom anyway.

The reason? Because mundanity is not exclusive to the non-magical side at all. In the wizarding world, it is entirely possible to live a mundane life doing mundane things that don't require much, if any, magic to accomplish. Clerks, bureaucrats and janitors are a thing in the magical world. Indeed, they're likely to be the most common jobs available to anyone who doesn't go into sales or a more magically oriented profession.

Similarly, it is difficult to argue that all muggles are mundanes as well, given that astronauts, pilots and engineers exist. Though they seem rather commonplace to us, imagine what it must look like to the wizards. There are massive numbers of people employed to design and build skyscrapers, nuclear reactors, jets, the internet etc without using magic in any way, shape or form-and succeed at it. The very fact that a lot of muggles come to see such jobs as boring or not worth the investment necessary to get them would blow their minds.

Mundanity is a strange concept, one that a lot of people end up equating to boredom. Cookie cutter houses, fast food franchises, white-colored panel vans and beige are all things that pop up almost everywhere in our everyday lives. They aren't, in and of themselves, necessarily boring, but the sheer repetition factor ends up making them so. As such, things that would appear to be amazing at first glance (see Quidditch, the Night Bus, the concept of non-human sapience) would be a rather boring fact of life to the average wizard.

Calling someone mundane is seen as an insult, but I would argue that that is wrong. Mundane isn't the same as boring per se so much as indicating that this person or object is simply one of many, adequately average in the ways that matter and, as such, not really worth much more of your time than you would invest in deciding which brand of breakfast cereal you would want to buy this week.

​

Which is where the Weasley parents come in as a sort of indicator as to what the magical world would consider mundane. With every single one of their children choosing agressively different and often dangerous lines of work (curse breaker, dragon handler, auror, assistant to one of the most extreme and unstable characters in Ministry history [Percy, who worked for Crouch, the dude who basically gave his auror corps the green light for using Dark Magic against the Death Eaters-yeah, that was a terribly unintentional pun right there]), it isn't far-fetched to consider it a rebellion of sorts against the lives their parents led.

Molly, the aggressively motherly stay-at-home Mum would represent an ideal that many witches would be told to aspire to. I am not sure what Ginny's stance on Molly's choices is, but I don't think she would see herself doing the same thing and so pursues a career instead of just settling down and having a truckload of kids.

Then you have Arthur, a typical wizard in almost every way. This is evidenced in A) the fact that he works at the Ministry in a capacity that edges on law enforcement, but really doesn't. Then there is B), which is the rather eccentric hobby he pursues out of the office which probably makes no sense whatsoever to whichever friends and acquaintances know about said hobby. In other words, he's basically the typical boffin.

Apart from the number of kids, it's entirely possible that they are the exact standard for a magical family you can expect to find wherever you go in the wizarding world. In other words, they are perfectly mundane despite being completely magical.

Now, for irony's sake, consider just how bloody strange the Dursleys are in comparison. They have one son they've driven to obesity and bullying by example. Their relatives are best described in two ways-1) coocoo for cocoa puffs. 2)Dead. And they have a nephew they stashed in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years whilst telling anyone who would listen that the pre-teen ragamuffin was somehow a master criminal who would shank them if it weren't for the Dursley's stern zero-tolerance policy.

And the reason why they seem to be doing this? An extremely aggressive (and hilariously ineffective) family policy of Normality. Every weird and insane thing they do, they do to try and blend into the background. This includes keeping their garden immaculate by forcing their pale and emaciated nephew to perform yard work for them in broad daylight, letting everyone in the neighborhood see this child dressed in dusty rags half-heartedly hacking away at some weeds while his hand-me-down shoes disintegrate around his feet due to the extreme humidity and low temperatures typical of your average British summer.

If I had these people for neighbors, I would suspect them of being members of a particularly strange and potentially violent cult (Harry's accidental magic wouldn't help in that sense) or that some intelligence agency somewhere in the world had managed to lose track of their Idiot Decoy Squad in the mid-70's and still haven't processed the necessary paperwork to get the UK to repatriate them without alerting the press.

The last word I would ever use to describe such strange and oddly unnerving people (highlighting their position in the social equivalent of the Uncanny Valley; sitting somewhere half-way between a gentlemen's club and a furry convention) would be mundane.

** I honestly hate "mundane," because it feels so wrong. It's worse than Muggle.

The first and usual definition of mundane is "lacking interest or excitement; dull."

Yes, there is a more rarely used definition - "of this earthly world rather than a heavenly or spiritual one."

However, my point is that mundane cannot be rid of the connotation of the first. I don't want to think that the most interesting Muggle is duller than the most boring wizard, that would be a bigger insult to me than Muggle. "For all the things the Mundanes have done, they're still very dull, aren't they?"

Muggle is also condescending in tone, but not to that degree. But that's just my personal opinion.

I find it lowkey offensive that it's comparable to the N word (I am African American) because plenty of ‘good' characters use it with no offense in mind. And those same ‘good' characters react angrily when Mudblood is used so CLEARLY Mudblood is meant to be the slur instead of Muggle.
