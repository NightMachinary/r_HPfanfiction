** Something I think gets overlooked with Hermione is that she actually has quite an immature sense of humour at times. She couldn't stop laughing at the wizard talking about a breeze round his privates in GOF, and although Harry was howling with laughter she was certainly joining in the banter with Fred and George at Bill's wedding. It's something Ron does well, I think.

** There aren't a ton of moments where Harry makes Ginny laugh in the books, either, but I would imagine that they crack each other up quite a bit in their day-to-day life.

I am definitely in the minority when I say that I liked the slightly goofy Ron in the HBP movie a lot more than any of his book characterisations. If he has those tendencies it is a lot easier to overlook the many times he fucks up than if his character is entirely serious. Pretty much like how Barney Stinson would be a complete douche and not strangely endearing if he was written completely serious.

**** You rang?

Yeah I've read the fic (according to my files), but must have been ages ago because I don't remember much of anything.

I can really appreciate an author putting a lot of effort into writing Hermione out of that relationship in a sensible manner (and the examples you posted are pretty good), but for my taste Hermione from HBP is way too brain damaged and you'll have to gloss over a lot. I'd always want to retcon that somehow.

I don't really have a problem with some of the basic premises of the Romione romance: For some stupid reason Hermione becomes attracted to Ron and she starts acting a bit irrationally, that's fine. HBP just takes it way too far and, as Lenney points out, her being a weeping mess because Ron would rather snog Lavender instead of feeling incredibly insulted is just "WTF". In my version of HBP she'd recognize the unresolved sexual tension for what it is, probably initiate a short-lived sexual and very intense relationship with Ron where she does some stupid stuff (no Lavender) and then comes back to her senses and breaks up after the inevitable explosion.

I'd either want to avoid referencing HBP or I wouldn't want to burden myself with trying to make sense out of the mess that JKR left us with and have an AU 6th year in place. It's just too broken.

****** u/Deathcrow:
#+begin_quote
  Yeah, honestly that's part of why love potion fics are my very guilty pleasure, since they give some sort of reason for that irrationality. They usually tend to be terribly written though =).
#+end_quote

Yeah they work pretty well, but a love potion isn't enough. That's why authors that use this usually also throw in a Harry-revulsion potion or Dumbledore-loyality potion as well.

Hermione's crush on Ron doesn't have anything to do with her irrational behaviour towards Harry. It makes zero sense that she dismisses him so completely and refuses to give him even a sliver of a benefit of the doubt. Her behaviour in regards to both the potion book and Draco is completely ludicrous. This is the girl who brewed polyjuice because she thought Draco could be the Heir of Slytherin and who willingly followed Harry into the Ministry trap... suddenly she won't even entertain the idea that Draco, someone whom she hates, might be up to something.

#+begin_quote
  The resistance of you thinking what you feel is real love when realizing it might just be a fabrication would be reeaaaalllly interesting also.
#+end_quote

I agree.

#+begin_quote
  Eughh, having to put myself in the mindset of being romantically interested in Ron is just demeaning...ewww... I need to take a shower. Poor Hermione and evil authors.
#+end_quote

Hehe yeah. It's really demeaning. I think it's pretty obvious in HBP that she's interested in Ron (even for an oblivious boy, and he's supposed to be attracted as well, no?! Doesn't she at one point say that she wanted to go to the Slug Club party with Ron?), so him snubbing Hermione for Lavender of all people is just intentionally hurtful or some kind of fucked up mind-game. I'd be so monumentally pissed if someone did that to me. Any romantic notions are dead at this point ;)

There's something really special when it comes to HBP fics and Hermione. It's really impossible to 'unread' a book and the portrayal of Hermione in that one kinda sticks with you. Or maybe you overcorrect and overcompensate if you want to 'correct' the flaws.

********** lol yeah. Subverting that stupid plot point is a wonderful idea. I particularly hate the idea that Hermione would somehow feel threatened by Harry becoming better than her in a subject.

IMHO it makes a lot of sense to have conflict over that book, but it would be the other way around: Hermione wants access to the book, but Harry is somewhat reluctant to share. Maybe because he's a bit possessive about it or because *he* thinks that it is too dangerous.

I've pointed out multiple times in this subreddit that Hermione is obsessed with research and obscure knowledge. Why would she think that it is wrong to gain knowledge from a book?! Isn't that the entire point of learning?

  "No. Wait. Okay. I'm just gonna use a few flush potions, and if nothing happens, then I can go be with Ron and be sure whatever I'm feeling is not imaginary, and true, and have lots of red-haired kids, and - No, Hermione Granger, Stop. Okay. You're being obsessive again - look at your list. It's just like if/and in programming. Just follow the logic and don't ask pontificate - there's no harm in using flush potions."
#+end_quote

Something kinda similar to this happens in one of my fav fics:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal]])

Hermione figures out that she and Harry have been potioned and goes completely BAMF, also rescuing Harry along the way. Fair warning though: Most of the order of the phoenix are complete bastards in this fic.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
