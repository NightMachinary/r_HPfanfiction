I put it through two spellcheckers, use [[https://thesaurus.com/][thesaurus.com]]'s writing tool and Hemingway on it, give it another read through and re-spell check it.


** Proofreading? What's that?

** Grammarly and Hemingway cover it with Word usually for me. Also I take a day or two usually and go back to reread it.

** TIL about Hemingway, thanks! That'll certainly help out with wordy sentences.

I tend to reread it a few days later, tossing it onto my kindle: for some reason I can catch errors easier that way. Highlight them as I go, and fix them later.

** I let it sit 24 hours when I think I'm done and reread it. After that, it goes to my beta.
