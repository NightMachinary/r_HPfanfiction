Characters like Nymphadora Tonks, Cho Chang, Lavender Brown, the Patil Twins, etc, are often used as part of the romance, and not much else.

I want stories that actually develop any characters (can be those or outside of those characters), outside of just romance.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing, as in Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Romance is fine, but I'd rather it NOT be the main part of the story. But am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes.
