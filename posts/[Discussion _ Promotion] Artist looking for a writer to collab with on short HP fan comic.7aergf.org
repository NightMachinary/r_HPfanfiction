Hey there! (I hope that i'm doing this right, I'm new to reddit)

My name is Christina, I'm 29, an artist in Texas, USA. I work as a concept artist on a small mobile game but I would like to start practicing comic layout in my evenings! You can find some of my work here: [[https://www.artstation.com/littlewitchcurry]]

   :END:
I'm a total noob when it comes to writing! Was wondering if there were any fanfiction writers out there who would be interested in collabing with me to write a cute little short story I could practice comic layout with! Preferably something very short, simple, and sweet! (a story we could tell in 10 - 20 pages)

I also feel I need to apologize in advance because I would like to find a writer with similar taste in writing / stories, and whom I can work with honestly so I'm going to be quite picky! I'm a professional artist so I'm totally used to getting feedback, and I'd like to work with someone who is okay with working as a team, giving and receiving feedback honestly and kindly. So please forgive me if i'm unsure about teaming up, I just want to find someone similar to myself and it's absolutely nothing against you : )!

** COMPENSATION:

   :END:
I don't currently plan on selling the comic or anything, but I would also not like to rip anyone off- so if I do happen to find someone in this community to work on this little project with me, I'll happily offer you compensation via artwork for another one of your stories or monetary pay. (we can figure something out!) And of course you would absolutely get credit for writing!

Please just link me some of your existing fanfiction so I can get a feel of how you write and your interests! I would rather you DO NOT tell me any ideas / pitches you have for a story to do with me bc I just want to totally avoid any situation of stealing ideas / etc. But feel free to tell me HP characters you're interested in writing stories about! And maybe share a favorite scene or part of any story you've ever read!

As for the story, like I said I would just like to do something very short, simple, and sweet. Hagrid is my favorite HP character, so a story about him would be awesome, but I'd also be interested in doing one about Harry, Hermione, Neville, Colin Creevey, or Luna. I had started a story about Hagrid preparing for halloween during year 3/ his first year teaching but idk what I'm doing haha. I'm not currently interested in a shipping / romantic story, and would rather do something more slice of life / happy / comedy/ etc. Bittersweet would be okay too! I'm totally okay with AU stories.

As for me, I love animals and people. I studied animation in college and some of my favorite things are: Fantasy, Ghibli Movies, Laika Movies, Wes Anderson, Diana Wynne Jones, HP, the Hobbit, Moomin, Animal Crossing, Zelda, Pixar, Avatar the last Airbender, and Disney! I love character driven stories and I love nerds / goofballs.

Anyway, this is probably a bit of a strange post, I hope I did it right! Thank you so much for reading!


** I would be interested in this. Going through a rough time at the minute and would like to write something fluffy and short to get back into it. I am also between jobs at the moment so have plenty of time to fill. Here is my profile: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/]]

I usually write about Ginny (my favourite character) and Harry but I'm not a big shipper. My most popular fic was a "what happened during DH" fic, and I really enjoy those missing moments type scenes. At the moment I am really interested in themes of family and motherhood, but open to anything. I stay canon compliant because I am quite strict on characterisation.

** There's probably someone better at writing the sort of plot you're asking for (though I'd love to I'm not sure I feel up to writing good fluffy happiness from nice characters), but it's not for lack of will, and if by some weird twist of fate you find nobody else I'll be happy to help.

What you're describing is, oddly enough, something I've never heard before around here. /Harry Potter/ would seem to lend itself to visual work easily, but somehow Harry Potter comics aren't really... a thing. Sure, there's a few good ones if you look, but it's a drop in the ocean of written fanworks. Heck, there's more fanfilms than there are proper comics.

Bottom line is, I may not be able to write it (though I'd love it), but I'll be a reader for sure!

*** Yes I agree. There are some Japanese fan comics and few folks who have made single pages etc. It's really too bad there aren't more.
