By this I mean a similar story but taking place in the HP Universe.

Something along these lines perhaps:

Voldemort tricks Harry into killing Ginny, thinking her to be a Basilisk. Enraged, Harry kills Voldemort, and the trio become the new Dark Lords of the HP Universe, attacking both their former friends and enemies. Nevile meanwhile starts a resistance, similar to Batman in Injustice, and tries to stop them.


** Injustice is trash story.

It's like a bad fanfiction with all the cliche tropes.

Batman wanking, Superman bashing, Harley Quinn shilling, edgelord characters, etc.

Please don't bring that trash to HP.
