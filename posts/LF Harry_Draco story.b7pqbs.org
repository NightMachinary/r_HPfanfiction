Hello, I'm looking for a Harry/Draco story where Harry sacrifices himself and it involves a stone I think. Draco decides to save him else he dies of boredom. I can't remember what it's called. Hopefully, someone here knows. :)


** Do you remember anything else? Why Harry sacrificed himself, or what other characters were in the story? If they were in Hogwarts or not?
