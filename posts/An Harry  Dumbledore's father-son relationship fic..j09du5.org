They don't need to be related. I just want to find a fic that showcases the deep care and love that goes in the relationship of Harry and the Headmaster. It can be highlighted through Albus's realisation of the mistreatment with the Dursleys, or it can be an Albus raises Harry type of fic. I just want a situation that has at its core the sheer fondness Dumbledore has for the boy and vice versa. This interest actually came after reading a Severitus fic "In care of", at the end of which Dumbledore finds out the terrors Harry had to go through with his relatives. The anguish and fatherly adoration was palpable, it was almost more heartwarming than the entire Harry&Snape plot.


** I mean, I don't know that I would describe it as father/son relationship, but I love the relationship between Harry and Albus in Albus and Harry's World Trip. It might not be exactly what your looking for, but its definitely worth the read.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
