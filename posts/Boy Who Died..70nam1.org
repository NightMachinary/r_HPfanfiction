Any fics where a young Harry dies before he gets his Hogwarts letter? Crossovers welcomed.


** He dies as a baby in linkffn(Harry potter without Harry Potter). The characters in this story are soooo well done and it's fun and mostly light hearted. Hasn't been updated in a while though. Another is linkao3(the kids who chose themselves by dirgewithoutmusic), but that one is more prose than chapter-based story. It's still really really good (and complete).

*** "the kids who chose themselves" is really good!

It's part of that "Boys with Scars" series, and the ONLY ONE that does not rehash canon stations.

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** "Missing" by Rulern Av Ost is insanely, heartbreakingly good.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540137/1/Missing]])

"In One Basket" by Gweezle features a Harry who dies the day Dumbledore leaves him on the porch.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11667624]])

"The Boy Who Died" by opopanax. 'Nuff said.

  AU. In a world where Harry as a twin, and where Voldemort died that night, Harry grows up with his parents and his brother. However, his parents never pays any attention to him, and has nearly forgotten him. Warning: Character Death. Oneshot.

  Oneshot. Addresses one of the major plotholes in the books: why does everyone know what Harry looks like if he's sent straight to live with his muggle relatives?
