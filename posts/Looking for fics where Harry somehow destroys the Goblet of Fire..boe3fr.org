Whether this is before, during, or after the tournament. As long as the result is a Goblet that can no longer work.

Thanks,\\

** I mean technically..? Linkffn(Powerful Magical Artifact)

Harry had glared at the ceiling at the mention of the Goblet of Fire. He and Ron had indeed taken great pleasure a few weeks after Voldemort's defeat, when the last of the Death Eaters had been locked up. They had gotten thoroughly drunk in the celebration, which had somehow culminated with a loud drunken adventure that took them into the Department of Mysteries, where amongst many other things, they had destroyed the annoying artifact.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

** There are two fics by DisobedienceWriter where Harry destroys the Goblet. In *The House of Potter Rebuilt* he destroys the Goblet before any names are drawn linkffn(11933512). In *Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power* linkffn(8215565) Harry destroys the Goblet between the First and Second task.

â€‹

In the excellent HP/BTVS crossover *Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council* by Tenhawks, Xander helps destroy the Goblet. His website is down but the fic can be downloaded from his [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/th_presents][yahoo group]].

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.
