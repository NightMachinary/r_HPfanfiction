:END:
Hey I need help finding a fic I read a few years back. All I really remember is Harry works with his friends and Voldemort and moves the magical world to the moon. I wanna read it again but have no idea what its title or author are.

Same link, both sites

The story is insane Harry from the future, yeah? They do end up on the moon in this one.

Anyway it's Xerosis by Batusutousai
