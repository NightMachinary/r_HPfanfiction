That's all that needs to be said but it has to 75k words plus.


** I know a story where it's a pairing for only a short part of the story. Are such stories game for you? Otherwise I can't think of anything.

Do note the pairing is a fairly small part of the plot, and it's only for a few chapters later in the story. I didn't read it for that pairing.

  Voldemort never killed Harry, instead he killed his parents and kidnapped Harry to raise as his own son against Dumbledore and the light. Dark/Slytherin Harry. Eventual M rating.

** Harry wasn't technically sorted into slytherin in this story, but very readily embraces his slytherin side. One of my personal favorite fics, however the writing does seem to go slightly downhill the more you read. linkffn(11446957)

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Harry Poter and the Veela, linkffn(6864381). It is incomplete and hasn't been updated and plays heavily on the wrong boy who lived trope but it fits your criteria...

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD
