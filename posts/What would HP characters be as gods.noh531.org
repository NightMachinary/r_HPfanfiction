Now before you completely scroll away, let me explain.

So here I was, browsing through fanfiction when a saw a title of a story where Harry was a god calling himself the Gardiner, and it got me thinking, what WOULD Harry's divine domain be if he ever became a god?

Would it be Death because of the Deathly Hallows? Would it be Sacrifice because of Lily's and his own sacrifice? Or maybe even rebirth because he came back to life not too long after the killing curse hit him. Or hell, maybe even the freaking patron god of orphans, who knows?

And from there, I moved on to the other characters.

Would Hermione be a Justice goddess? Would Ron be a god of War? Would Ginny be the goddess of Vengeance? Would Seamus, being the pyromaniac that he is, be the god of fire and destruction? What would their pantheon even be called???

So yeah, tell me what you all think, I'm genuinely curious to know what others take on godly hp characters.

****** Throne, Titles and Power don't have to equal king

And even if they did, that would litterally be their only similarity. They have different personalities to start with.

And about the power thing- they're not actually that alike. Many people claim Zeus wasn't the most powerfull- even within the Olympians.- And it isn't like Dumbledore is known for lightning either.
