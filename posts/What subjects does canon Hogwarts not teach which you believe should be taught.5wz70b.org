** culture studies like gobin culture, merpeople culture, wizarding culture(for muggle-borns) and various others. as electives that should be able to choosen in first year.

Languages: Just as one subject there has to be a magical way to accelerate the speed a language can be learned other wise Crouch Sr couldn't have learned ove 200 languages.

Physical education: They have children eat as much as they want from all you can eat buffets that they have 3 times a day. And the only sport teams they have are limited to 28(plus a couple reserves) students from over 1000. The children would definitely need the exercise for they have no parental supervision to ensure that they exercise at all.

Health classes: on one hand they can be taught about human biology, learn about how their bodies work, what harmful to them (drugs and diets), about various mental diseases, magical illnesses and sex ed. On the other hand they can learn magical first aid and various healing charms.

***** Hogwarts lacks sex ed classes because during the school's first year, a class of 30 students got to watch Gryffindor and Hufflepuff fuck as a demonstration, and according to Salazar Slytherin, the students were all traumatized.

He went on to say that seeing them fuck didn't stop them from having a massive orgy in the Slytherin dungeons. He tried to break up the orgy, but got mobbed and got a dick shoved down his throat by members of the student orgy mob. He then fled the dungeons and didn't go back down for months.

Headmasters passed the story down to each new Headmaster. It's why sex-ed isn't done at Hogwarts. They're all scared something like that will happen again, and cause a scandal and make the Daily Prophet a ton of money.

Wizengamot seems to be a body with hereditary positions. One could argue that those families that have seats should teach their own offspring about the workings of the Wizengamot, while the rest of the population which essentially gets no stake in the body's workings has no real need to learn in detail about the body and how the politics inside it work.

** Mathematics. I'm a mathematician, so I may be biased, but maths doesn't give a fuck about magic. There's no magic that can affect the Peano axioms, the Prime Number Theorem or the Central Limit Theorem.

And you can't say maths has no application -- mathematics is simply too fundamental to nature. Modelling would give greater insight to the magical world, be it through engineering, probability or astronomy.

Basically, maths (pure and applied) /would/ have application to the magical world -- it's simply too ubiquitous. And students should therefore be studying it in school. Canonically, arithmancy is divination with numbers, but that's never stated in the books. Fanfics where arithmancy is more mathematical make me happy.

Ok rant over. I'd also propose economics/finance and magi-biology as electives.

**** Harry used Lumos during the Dementor attack.

Also, one of the big contention points between Goblins and Wizards is wandcraft; Wizards won't share the secrets with them.

Rowling also wrote on Pottermore about how wands are actually a European invention. Plus Ravenclaw was the first of the founders to use a wand and Slytherin acquired his sometime after. But it was Griffindor who was the best duelist.

Rowling even went on to explain a bunch about it on twitter last year (I believe). She basically said wands just make it easier to do magic but wandless magic is possible, it just takes more practice and varies in ability between wizards. Wands are just tools to make it easier. She says the same thing about brooms as well; AKA there are legit some wizards that can fly without them.

It's a common fandom misconception that wandless magic in the HP universe is some uber skill. It's not. It's just wands make casting spells easier. Like walking vs jogging.
