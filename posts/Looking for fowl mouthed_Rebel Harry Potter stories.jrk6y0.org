Getting tired of a lot of fics where Harry grows up shy and awkward, a hate-filled angsty boy, or an emotionless husk. I want stories where Harry grew up a fowl mouth, swearing like a sailor, 'I don't give a F**K' Harry potter. He grew up where he was given zero care or respect, so why should he give respect to some crazy weird people in robes?

Basically, I'm looking for stories where he's afraid to tell anyone to f**k off, especially Dumbledore and Snape. One story I've got to share that follows this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13541079/1/Magic-is-My-Birthright][Magic is my Birthright]], Harry grows up on the streets of London, and his a little s**t but you love him anyway.
