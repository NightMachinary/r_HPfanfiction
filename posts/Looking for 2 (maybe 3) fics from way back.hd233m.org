:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's 2 fics that I remember reading on AFF years ago that I can't seem to find anymore.

The first from what I can remember;.\\
Harry/Hermione and Draco/Ginny Very long story, 30+ chapters I believe there was a sequel just as long centering around their kids Harry and Hermione end up having a daughter named Harmony and I know Draco and Ginny end up having a kid as well, they might hookup in the sequel?

Second story from what I can remember; Harry/Hermione/Draco I believe it just started with fooling around and then the three found that they were linked by some prophecy? Found that they were very powerful together Warned by many that this prophecy or bond was very dangerous End up moving into an estate that one of them was descended from?

Any help is appreciated!


** You should edit the flair to 'What's That Fic' so that it gets found correctly. :)
