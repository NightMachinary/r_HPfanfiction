I've seen Draco be a good guy, Snape be a good guy, even Voldemort and Umbridge once or twice.\\
But Good Pettigrew seems kind of rare. And I don't think I've ever seen a Good Pettigrew join the main characters and have a major role like rich uncle Sirius tends to.

So...does anyone know any fics where Peter ends up joining the heroes (or at least protagonists) and being a main character? Despite blowing up a dozen muggles (unless that wasn't him)?


** I'm really doubting that this fanfic even exists, but remember rule 2 of fanfic, if you can't find it, write it.

But the reason that I don't see this being written as a fanfic ever is because i'm pretty sure that everyone's pretty much on the same side on how they see Peter Pettigrew, a cowardice man who would only stay on the side beneficial to him.

1: The Main characters would NEVER trust him. 2: Sirius, Remus, Harry and a good deal of others would never forgive him for betraying Lily and James. 3: They already have a spy in the ranks (Snape) if that would be the reason of them keeping him around.

Well, okay.~â™ª\\
Let's see, given the premises that:\\
1. Peter was the Secret Keeper, and did reveal the secret to Voldemort, but did so under duress (per book 7, dying would have only made the secret more vulnerable).\\
2. Peter didn't create the explosion that killed 12 muggles (if he were that powerful and that dismissive of muggles, he'd be a front-line Death Eater).\\
3. He splinched himself apparating away from said explosion; he didn't cut off a finger, turn into a rat and skitter away.\\
4. He hid as a rat for 13 years because he was afraid that he'd be prosecuted for James & Lily's deaths or targeted by Death Eaters at large.\\
5. After talking to Hagrid about his stint in Azkaban and being exposed to dementors all year, Harry is disinclined to send Peter there.\\
And...I dunno, would he have really thought that Sirius was a traitor? If James and Lily could hide under one Fidelius Charm, why not two, with the second Secret Keeper Sirius Black? Or he could have been led to believe (aren't False Memory Charms wonderful?) that Sirius had sold Peter out to Voldemort with the understanding that if Peter resisted, he'd be killed so that Sirius became a Secret Keeper instead.

** Promises Unbroken has this. It's an AU where Sirius remained the Secret Keeper. Peter initially is still working for Voldemort but events cause him to change his mind.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

*** Hmm...yeah, I'm pretty sure that somewhere else in this collection is a 'James finds himself back in time and trains the Marauders to fight Voldemort' snippet.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/108/Odd-Ideas]]\\
'Old School', it turns out near the end that Peter himself is responsible for sending James's spirit back in time to make things right.

** He's one of the many characters in this vast fic:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]])

It suggests that he was ambivalent in canon, so here a nudge in a different direction sends him the other way.
