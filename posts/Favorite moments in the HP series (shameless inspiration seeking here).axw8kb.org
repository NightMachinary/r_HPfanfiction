I like to practice writing by working on a series of true drabbles (100 words exactly) based on my favorite/most memorable small scenes throughout the series (or before). I'm currently drawing a blank for further inspiration, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Examples of what I've done so far: Sirius falling through the Veil, Remus on the train before the Dementors come, Remus's first transformation with the Marauders, etc.

(Edited because I can't spell) Thanks in advance!


** The moment in DH when Harry finally masters occlumency (and legilimency) - it's such a perfect culmination of that arc which began with him being useless at it in OotP, and the way in which he masters it is so well in tune with the way Harry always ends up mastering complex magic: learning by doing, figuring it out his own way rather than learning from books.

#+begin_quote
  He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.

  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.

  On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness...

  The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows...Horcruxes...Hallows...Horcruxes...yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.

  Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why... And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy...Dumbledore had foreseen that...How much more had he known?

#+end_quote

It sounds very much like he has mastered the general skill of emotional detachment which is the basis of occlumency. That skill isn't Voldemort-specific, so yes, I would say he can definitely repel legilimency attacks from other wizards.

As for performing legilimency himself, in OotP Snape tells us that Voldemort is using the scar connection as a vehicle for legilimency. What's special about that connection is that it allows legilimency to be used without physical proximity. But it's still legilimency being used. So if Harry is using the scar connection to perform legilimency, I don't see why he couldn't do the same in the more traditional manner with eye contact.

***** Re: occlumency, how will he do it? Remain apart from, and master, the pain, the connection? I had thought it was his love for Dobby (or at leaat his gratefulness) that repelled Voldemort who would not, could not, understand either.

It would be interesting to explore scenarios like it in his Auror career. Also, can't wait til Victoria Potter introduces such concepts.

****** Occlumency is difficult magic, but it's not complex magic. As Snape described it in OotP, it's pretty much the magic of mental self-discipline, of being able to think about things in an emotionally detached way, a kind of mental numbness. I picture this as a kind of mental knack, a state of mind that you can slip into. You either can do it or you can't. And we see that in DH Harry discovers that state of mind when digging Dobby's grave. He is detached from his pain, he is said to have learnt control i.e. the discipline over his own mind that Snape was talking about in OotP.

Grief was the vehicle to that discovery, the impetus for it, but that doesn't mean that Harry has to still be grieving to be able to recall the mental state he discovered.

******* Based on how you describe it, I dig it.

As a complete, and total, aside, how would you grade Snape's attempted education of it? Making the best case of difficult magic or just being a shithead?

"Control your anger; discipline your mind" seems very apt based on your view. But how would you go upon teaching this?

It is very interesting when reading the text of his lessons that he isn't really doing that badly. Providing a stinging hex to disrupt Snape's attempts, creating a shield charm, etc, intention or not.

******** I would say Snape did the bare minimum - if Harry had wanted to learn, done the practice etc. then Snape's tutelage would have been sufficient for Harry to learn Occlumency.

But Harry didn't want to learn. And therein lay the problem. It's a catch-22: Occlumency is the art of mental self-discipline, but to learn it you already have to be sufficiently self-disciplined to put the effort into practising reaching the mental state required. You simply cannot teach occlumency to someone who does not want to learn it.

Of course, Snape could have been a better teacher - describing things more fully, attempting to inspire his student rather than just going through the motions and leaving it to the student to motivate themselves. Though given that Harry had many more occlumency scenes than we saw, it's entirely possible (indeed likely) that Snape did describe it more fully. Harry knows a lot more about magic that the reader sees him learn - that's a common theme throughout the series, where we only see small glimpses of his classes.

But honestly, I doubt that this would have made any difference. So long as Harry continued to enjoy his view into Voldemort's thoughts, so long as he considered it a useful and valuable skill which allowed him to do things like save Mr Weasley, so long as he remained wilfully blind to the dangers, then no teacher would have been able to teach him the skill. He wasn't just disinterested, he was actively seeking the opposite, wanting /more/ access to Voldemort's thoughts, not less.

** The moment Ron and Hermione decide to go with Harry to protect the Philosopher's Stone always stuck out to me for one line in particular, when Hermione says that she'll go look through her books because there might be something useful. The idea that a first year's book collection (even a first year like Hermione) would be at all relevant to the protections put in place by some of Britain's foremost experts in their respective fields sounds completely ridiculous.

** When Harry won the Quidditch cup for the first time in third year. It was one of the few times he could just let go and act like any other teenager. No danger, no life threatening menaces. Just Harry having a small part of the life he should have had. It's nothing as major as killing a basilisk but it really stuck with me. The way it was built up through the chapter, Wood nearly having a mental breakdown and small things like Malfoy cheating and Lee Jordan screaming at the Slytherin team with McGonagall secretly agreeing with everything he was saying. I was actually felt like I was watching a game of football while reading it. Then this:
