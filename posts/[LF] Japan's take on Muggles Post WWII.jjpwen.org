I was wondering if anyone had done a story outlining wizarding Japan's take on Muggles in a Post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb world?

â€‹

You would think that *some* magicals were lost in those bombings and that it would change feelings on muggles locally, one way or the other..


** Given how close Muggles were at destroying each other during the Cold War, why wouldn't Voldemort pull a Skynet and make Muggles finish each other off? He had experienced Muggle destructive powers first hand, and he definitely should know about nuclear weapons.

If he really wanted to imperius the American President and order him to fire all US nukes against their targets, I doubt those MACUSA Aurors could stop him. Then the Soviet counterattack would destroy the West, and the nuclear winter would wipe out 90% of Muggles within a few months. The whole world would be ready for his magical utopia. He and his minions could of course build well protected and self sufficient Wizarding enclaves deep underground, ride out the mayhem, and emerge as the total winner. If a single shield charm was able to protect them against nuclear blasts, like some wizard worshippers here postulate, then he would have even more incentives to induce such a scenario.

So, why didn't Voldemort do that? My theory is that nukes harm Wizards far more than Muggles. He had checked out Hiroshima and Nagasaki as soon as he heard the news. When he got there after a few days, he discovered that while 100000 out of 350000 Muggles had died at Hiroshima and 60000 out of 260000 Muggles had died at Nagasaki, the three Wizarding enclaves in the two cities had been completely killed off. Japanese Ministry of Magic was in utter panic, and decided to intervene in persuading the Emperor to surrender.

Later during the 1950s, Muggle powers conducted over 500 atmospheric nuclear tests, resulting in unprecedented level of radioactive fallout in human history. Coincidentally, squib births skyrocketed, and led to great panic and increased hostility against Muggleborns, whose numbers had actually grown because rapidly increasing Muggle population. These Muggleborns, many of them strongly influenced by equal rights thinking in the Muggle world, would no longer subject themselves to Pureblood dominance. In 1962, a Muggleborn named Nobby Leach was even elected to the British Minister of Magic. Voldemort, who originally wanted to wait out Dumbledore, decided that he could no longer put things off.

** The ICW put protocols in place to keep these foolish muggles from destroying the world:

1) Infiltrate the government and military of any nuclear power from top to bottom. If any of them seems to start shit, prevent it (e.g. when the Russian Ministry's seers predicted a nuclear war starting on the 26th of September 1983 and put calming drought in the tea of that guy named Stanislav Petrov).

2) Create a self-sufficient colony on the dark side of the moon. It was not /that/ hard, but they had to eliminate the colony the followers of that insane Austrian muggle dark lord created there, lead by (warning, heavy Iron Sky spoilers) this weird extraterrestrial creature which revealed, after having been fed modified veritaserum, that its buddies plan to start shit planetside, which is ofc unacceptable, so they got iced, as well.

** The one story I remember mentioning this issue is linkffn(Invincible by Darth Marrs). Even if it was just a few sentences it was still a very important plot point so SPOILERS ahead.

Witches and wizards were found to be weak to radiation so the atomic bombing INSTANTLY wiped out a community of them in Nagasaki, unlike the Muggles who survived with burns but then succumbed to the lingering effects of radiation later on.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.
