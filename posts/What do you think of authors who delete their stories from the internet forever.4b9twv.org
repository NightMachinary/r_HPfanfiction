So [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/808882/notwritingfanfictionanymore][Sarini]] just nuked their account, and a dozen or so stories are gone forever now.

I'm a little disappointed because I have two or three bookmarked and was looking forward to reading them, but now they're gone forever.

Going back through old internet bookmarks and seeing that 10% or so are stories that don't exist anymore makes me incredibly sad for some reason.

IMO it's pretty selfish to delete your stories like that. I get leaving FanFiction behind, but to suddenly nuke your account like that is really bad form.


** I think that's up to the author to decide They don't owe people their story, a week's notice or an explanation. People act pretty entitled towards fanfiction, especially considering authors put hundreds of hours crafting a story in their free time and most readers can't even be bothered to leave a kudos or a review.

** Personally, I feel frustrated and I look to see if there's any archive left up.

But in the end I can't be mad at the author. I can't think of it as anything other than a privacy issue. People who write when they're young may feel self conscious when they get older and start applying to colleges, applying to jobs, writing professionally. Even if they have a pen name, I understand that pen names can trace back.

** No one is entitled to someone else's fanfiction. Authors don't suddenly owe people their stories or an explanation once they post writing publicly.

** I feel an author gets to do what they like with their stuff, but random abandonment is definitely really irritating. A notice (like a week before deletion) would be better so that readers can download the stories for themselves beforehand.

** Eh, I think it's the writer's prerogative to do whatever they want with their stories. I understand how frustrating it must be to see that they deleted all of their content without any word to their readers, but ultimately it's their decision.

** I view fanfiction as a gift from the author to the reader, and every review as your chance to give back a fraction of what they have shared with you. Correspondingly, I am disappointed when I find a link to a story that is now inaccessible, but I accept it as their right.

** That is rather bad form. I would understand if they left it for people to enjoy or if they suddenly got a licensing contract and had to pull their own work due to said contact, but...

*** What really irks me is that there isn't even a message on their profile. Just a name change to "notwritingfanfictionanymore" and a massive fuck you really.

***** The story I was reading (and I literally mean mid story, I load the next chapter and it's gone) was Child of Four. It's where James and Lily weren't actually killed by Voldemort, just placed in a stasis of sorts.

I can't remember now to be honest, but I think that might have been it. It's not like I can look at a list of them anymore O_o

** It's the author's own decision, and not yours. Author's choose to share their work with the internet, and you should be grateful for it. If an author chooses to stop shareing their work, you need to respect that decision. Trying to circumvent that by getting the fic from someone else who might have it saved is incredibly disrespectful.

It doesn't matter why they removed the fic, it doesn't matter whether or not they gave any notice. That writing is their own work, and they are the only person with the right to share or withhold it.

The only selfish person in this scenario is you.

**** Totally agree to this.

If an author takes down their story then let it be gone. It's okay to have personal copies I suppose but don't go around distributing it.

** I think it's poor form to be honest. They have nothing to lose by not deleting everything and just leaving their account up so I don't see why they can't do that. It just seems needlessly malicious but I do agree that it is their choice at the end of the day.

** I agree with most here that the stories belong to the author, and as such, it's their decision if they want to delete their stories.

However, if you're looking for those deleted fics, there's bound to be an ePub or PDF copy floating around. Check [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/#archive][p0ody-files]] - they have a nifty "Archive" tab that I use when a story has been deleted off FFN. You can search by author, title, and story ID.
