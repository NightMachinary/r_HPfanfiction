I want as many fics of dumbledore being good and harrys potter being bad with wbwl or wgwl


** This is a difficult question. Very actually. When you say good dumbledore, how much of a role should he play? Like a side role or fairly involved in the story? Also I don't think it'd be complete. Tbh I don't really know any WBWL story that was fully completed or is well written.

** First time posting so I'm not sure how to use the bot but I think you might enjoy Deprived by the crimson lord. It's an unfinished Fleur/Harry piece.
