*** So each of them in their own seperate triad relationships?

That could be interesting. Maybe Ron with Lavender and Parvati? Maybe, Harry with Ginny & Daphne (because Haphne best ship) and Hermione with Griphook and Buckbeak.

*** Cho's dad was originally a member of the Wizarding Triad and moved to Magical Britain to evade the aurors back home. After the death of Cedric Cho is extremely upset because the sudden reappearance of Voldemort means the eyes of the ICW and their enforcers is on Magical Britain and her family is going to have to pack up and leave at the end of the year when her father finishes closing up some business deals. Harry learns of all this during their date in Hogsmeade from some tearful exposition and sees an opportunity to escape the struggles of his homeland. He decides to make himself useful for Cho's dad to convince him to bring Harry with them when they make their escape and Ron & Hermione get dragged into it.

** Guy comes to the trio as they are hanging together in the common room.

"So, wanted an advice... Everyone knows you three have a pretty close relationship"

Ron said "Can't be closer, alright"

"And you fullfil each others appetites..."

Harry's and Hermione's eyebrows go up at once as a scarlet color comes to their faces.

"It's not like-" Hermione hurries but is interrupted by Ron.

"All the time," Ron says, thinking of food, "And Hermione knows I have a big appetite, she says so all the time!"

Hermione's cheeks go even redder.

"Err mate, I don't think you realize..." Harry started.

"And you are into sandwiches. If you know what I mean..." The guy asked.

"Tons... All the time... Of all kinds... Just the other day Harry and I had just had our share and Hermione let me had hers."

"Ronald!" Hermione shouted as Harry scratched his head in embarrassment.

"Thanks, I'll tell my friends you could give us some tips," the guy said as he left.

** I remember reading one where Susan and Hannah offered to replace Ron (it was 4th year, pre dragons), with one of them willing to change to male if that was the ratio Harry and Hermione preferred. Totally weirded out our heroes.

Didn't go anywhere, other than being the springboard to the rest of the story.

(I think it was a Rorschach's Blog story where Harry ends up building his own island in the Pacific.)
