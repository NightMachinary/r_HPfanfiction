Looking for story where Harry is becoming more independent, but dumbledore is manipulatinghim trying to get Harry back.

This is all that I remember. Dumbledore planned to adopt teenage Harry, but before he does Tonks gets in with the paperwork first(it was a first come, first serve type of sitiuation). When Dumbledore gets the letter Harry is already in his office. Dumbledore goes on a monolauge telling Harry new rules he has to follow, completely unreasonable ones like,(and don't quote me) but Snape will constantly use legilimency on him, he cannot leave the castle at all and more before he opens the letter, and finds out that the Wizarding adoption agency(I don't remember the name) sent him a rejection letter telling him that someone had already filled out a new form to be Harry's guardian.

That's all I remember, but I know I greatly enjoyed it.

P.s. My writing was so terrible over a year ago. I just spent something like 10 minutes just fixing, and rewording this(even though i'm sure I still missed something).

Thanks,

Warryn.


** This... I vaguely remember this? I think it's super old, one of the Harry/Tonks 5th year fics. Can't remember anything more, or if this'll even help. good luck warryn.
