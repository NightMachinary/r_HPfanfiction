I like the ones where he's portrayed as mysterious and unknown, where people feel automatically drawn to him and want to know his secrets, etc.

On the other hand, I also really like the one where, at first glance, Harry doesn't seem very impressive in the slightest --- he's not the most attractive person (not ugly but just simple), he's introverted and closed off in a way that automatically makes people assume he's just bland, etc. --- but under all that â€˜unimpressive-ness', he's completely and utterly powerful, intelligent (in the kind of way that Harry usually is), and full of personality.

They're two very different portrayals that I love very much. I think they're both amazing and interesting and I love writing them.

There wasn't much point to this post except that lol.


** I like where he's a genuinely nice bloke with a sarcastic streak

*** Yup, canon type portrays are my favourite too. I actually like his portrayal by the first actor who played him in Cursed Child too - it followed on really well from the books. (We'll just ignore the trolley witch as a plot point, though I enjoyed the theatrics.)

***** Thank you! I was skimming book one recently, and even at that age he was so sassy. It's so frustrating that that aspect of his personality was stripped away in the movies and in fandom.

** I like it when Harry is portrayed as reasonably smart and kind of adorable, but as soon as you piss him off his anger is terrifying.

** AU Dark/Greyish that gets the job done and is not half-hearted. But generally just a well written one whose character i'm actually invested into.

** I think part of the issue with portraying Harry is how JK changed his path in the middle of the series.

In the first 4 books, he's pretty much the archetypal Hero with a Thousand Faces, but the last few books he's nothing more than a lucky everyman. I much prefer Hero Harry over Everyman Harry.
