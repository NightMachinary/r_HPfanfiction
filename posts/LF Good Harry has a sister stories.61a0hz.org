I'd prefer blood relation (i.e. not Harry adopted by a family with a daughter) and almost anything goes in terms of alternate dimensions/twins/incest/WBWL or whatever. Just no slash or the sister/Draco star-crossed lovers trope please. Oh, and I've read Too Young to Die. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(Sacrifical Second Chance; Strange Reflections)

SSC is technically a harem story, but never got to that point. Essentially, Harry dies fighting Voldemort and is then given the chance to be sent to inhabit a counterpart of his body. The counterpart was a psychopath with an obsession with (trying to kill) his sister. When Harry 'arrives', the counterpart's soul is damned (off-screen), but the obsession sticks and Harry becomes obsessed with his sister. Not that well-written and is abandoned, but it's the only Harry/Family Member fic that actually shows that they're disturbed and that they're scared they have those feelings.

Seriously. No muggle-raised protagonist is going to want to fuck their sister without being somewhat disturbed. Unless they're from West Virginia or Alabama.

Strange Reflections is complete (a plus) and technically well-written. Premise is that an AU Potter family is sent to a Canon/Close to Canon Potter 'Verse. AU Harry (Hadrian) and James Potter are assholes, and Lily isn't given any good characterization other than an off-hand remark after a Ministry Ball (which is a shame, as she was otherwise far to passive compared to what we know she was like in canon).

The sister, Iris, is flat-out ignored by her family, and ends up leaving the AU family because of sheer negligence and is adopted by Harry. No incest, technically a H/Hr fic, but I don't recall it playing that large a part.

** Huh? No mention of SilverAegis and Co. Aaand i just went to look on his profile and he's erased those two stories. /Sigh./ Regardless a bunch of people has made fanficitons to SilverAegis's fanficiton so here's a couple of them.

This one is the closets copycat of the original SilverAegis. linkffn(3485944) but I would recommend the following instead.

This one branched more from the original and has build significantly upon the original, I also think it's closer to what you seek. linkffn(6644695)

This is a Fan made fanfic to SilverAegis' other story. It's actually finished and is focused entirely on Harry and Sis so is likely something you might be interested if you don't really care about the rest of the quite lacking plot/world. linkffn(4040192)

Goming off my SilverAegis gushing I have to of course mention this one you doubtlessly know about linkffn(I'm Still Here by Kathryn) Sadly it's slowgoing and it's dubious that they will ever really get any actual development together.

** linkffn(Red Sorrow) Harry has a half sister who was adopted by Snape when she was young (although she is also his actual daughter even though she doesn't know it in the beginning). Both have been marked by Voldemort but grew up separately. The fic does focus a lot on Ariel and Snape and does have quite a bit of angst, but it's otherwise good.
