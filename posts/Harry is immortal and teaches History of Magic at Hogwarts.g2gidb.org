- Main Plot Prompt is History repeats itself
- Harry is born during the 14th or 15th Century. HE IS NOT A VAMPIRE
- Everything on the books happened but during the 14th or 15th Century
- Ron and Hermione are reincarnated (both will have completely different names. Ron's reincarnation will still be a Weasley and Hermione's reincarnation will be a half blood)
- Harry will not be reincarnated, of course, but the new version of Harry will be a distant relative of the older Harry. Same hair, the eyes will be your choice. (My guess will be Dudley's many great grandson or it can be your choice)
- Dumbledore will recruit the older Harry to be the new History of Magic and a member of the Order of the Phoenix during 5th year. Harry will banish Professor Binns (his favorite professor during his time at Hogwarts)
- The older Harry will become the new Harry's mentor
