** Also spoiler!? Don't ruin the fecking plot come on...

But the whole point is that Nizar doesn't have any memories of being Harry. Nizar is legally no longer Harry. Nizar is also minimum 42 years old, maximum 1048 years old. Nizar has an entirely different personality to Harry(even portrait Nizar who doesn't have any personal feelings towards Snape is too OOC to be Harry). I've always seen Nizar as an OC, they're written as an OC. Nothing about them is Harry Potter only Part 3.

So like... It is stretching it.

Their other story Swung by Serafim is more way more Harry/Snape than OaCL and nothing happens between them in that at all either. They get a house together and all sorts.

** Not sure what your point is; the story is in fact listed as Harry/Snape.

If you wanted to get a discussion going, you should have proclaimed that Nizar is really an OC instead of Harry.
