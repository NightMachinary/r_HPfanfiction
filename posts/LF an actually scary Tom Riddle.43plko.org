I'm looking for fics involving teenage Tom where he isn't whitewashed or redeemed or made out to be some misunderstood byronic hero.

Is it too much to ask for an evil character that is actually pretty committed to being evil? I want a Tom that's obsessed with power, disillusioned by society, cold and clinical to a fault, a realistically terrifying psychopath -- a villain in the making. Kinda like you'd picture a young Hannibal Lecter or Norman Bates.

I don't care if he has a love interest as long as he's still a manipulative creep about it (preferred ships would be either Tom/Minerva or Ginny or Bellatrix; please no Harry or Hermione or mary-sue OCs).

Basically, a Tom as scary as the one in The Very Secret Diary by Arabella.

So yeah, any recs?


** linkffn(Lullaby by Tara1189) fits, though it's been a while since I read it. The author has other stories in the same vein, so check them out too.

** Tom in Fate's Favorites +isn't+ (as silkrobe pointed out he probably is) evil, but he is intelligent and highly manipulative, linkao3(1103246). In fact any of the Fictionist's works with Tom have excellent characterization, but again not really evil.

**** He is certainly psychopathic. And now I think about it, how he treats some of the other time travels is abusive (especially Lestrange). The behavior is probably more obvious in Past's Players linkffn(5736901) though, where if I remember correctly he also [[/spoiler][permanently cripples someone for being Harry's friend]]. I also couldn't finish Solace in Shadows linkffn(7932144) where Tom is more extreme.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark...

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if thing's went differently...what if, just once, someone followed a time traveler back?

** I can't recall the name, maybe someone else will. It was a long story follows Tom's full fall through hogwarts years and into young adulthood. It's old, I think the site that hosted the story was called Eliza or Elizabeth's fanfiction. Might be from 2001-2002 so no horcruxes.

** Hmm. I recommend this with considerable reservations, as it is one I abandoned early on in my fanfiction days, before I had any sense of taste. It suffers from a overly obscure plot and backstory, a slight slash obsession (though, 50% through and Harry hadn't been subject to it), a sloooow pace with much too much filler, and that's just what I can remember.

However, it featured an amazingly detailed vision of 1940s-era wizarding world, a unique take on Grindelwald's war, and one of my favorite teen Riddles.

Riddle there sounds like he suits perfectly with your requirements.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.
