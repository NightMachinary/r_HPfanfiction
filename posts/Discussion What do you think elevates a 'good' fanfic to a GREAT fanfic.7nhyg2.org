In my opinion, it is when the emotions of characters aren't explained to me but rather shown to me via little things that occur within the narrative. Bad fics gloss over how characters are affected; okay/good fics have emotions described and somewhat explored; great fics show how emotions can impact upon more than just how the character feels.

Another thing would be moments where characters stop and "relax", in a certain sense of the word. This is where a character - after having saved a small town from a Dark Lord - sits down and talks with the survivors, reassures them, plays with the children, and allows themselves to unwind in rare moments when silence can be louder than words.


** Characters who grow and mature, and aren't just one dimensional. This sounds simple, but it's very hard to find. The show Mad Men always did this well - you watched characters do good things and bad things, change from selfish and ruthlessly ambitious to caring and circumspect. I always enjoy a story where characters grow.

** When every character matters. This sub is notorious for making fics where hermione/draco/ron or even Harry are in the story for no reason. Naruto does that too.

When you mention a character by name, they need to be relevant to the plot

*** I feel that's more along the lines of what I'd define good fanfiction to be. Finishing alone does not make a great fanfiction in my opinion.

Great Fanfiction has to be unique. It has to set itself apart from other Fics in some way. It should also have a depth in characterization. It should be believable.

I'm not exactly sure how to quantify great fanfiction, as the above is not definitive, but other then "you'll know it when you read it".

Something like A Black Family Comedy stands out. There are things it does that no one else does. You remember the fanfiction when it's mentioned because it was made memorable. Other Fics seems to blend together would be "good".

***** Definitely! I read red-headed stepchild a few weeks ago, absolutely loved it. My favourite part was the mario kart dragon race but a very close second was "I am darkness, I am snek" Made me burst out laughing, then get very sad that there's literally no one I can tell about it who would understand :(

** Honestly, I do not think there is any single, or even multiple, thing that separates good and great fics, not a thing that we can name just like that at the very least.

I mean, we could try to name all that, certainly. Undoubtedly the style of the author matters, and their use of emotions as well as the proper balance of showing and telling do matter too. That isn't all, though, there is more, maybe even much more; for example, Ursula Le Guin's early works in the Earthsea series are regarded as great whereas the latter ones merely as good, and yet there were no major changes in her style or in that balance or the use of emotions. For another example, Dmitry Glukhovsky's major series is regarded as great, but there isn't really a moment of relax that you get, and what makes it great is a style and story that give it an ethereal, if dark and deadly, quality.

I could try to name some things that for me have made stories, be them original or derivative, great rather than good, but ultimately no matter what I think of I can also think of stories that do not have it or even more so deliberately discard those and yet are also great. I mean, the things you wrote about do matter, there is no doubt about it ... I just think it's not that simple, that there is something else to it, and that this something may have to do with the readers themselves, with the writer playing them with their story. Something of that kind, I feel.

** For me a good fanfiction is one that I didn't have any major problems reading, one that I had a good time with, and one that I could recommend to someone.

What makes a great fanfiction is whether or not I remember that fic in a year's time. If I will take the time to go back and reread that fic, or if I will speak platitudes about it here.

It's hard to create a criteria that a great fanfiction has to follow, some good fanfics have great plots or ideas but weak characters. Some have great characters but tired and predictable plots. Some authors have a way with words that enrapture me. Some don't. It's honestly much easier to point what makes a fanfiction bad, than what makes one great.

** There are so many answers to this question but 2 very general things are:

Don't hold back or censor yourself for a rating or to try and please ALL readers. First off, you can't please all readers, and secondly, a fanfic is not believable if it holds back. The real world is full of messy situations, contains violence, sex, raw emotions of all types, and is REAL, not constructed. Hell the HP book series itself is borderline T rated at times, and several of the movies (even held back) were rated PG-13. A story is always better when the reader can immerse themselves within it, and the closer it feels somehow to the real world, the better.

Second thing is to quit while you are ahead. Soooo many fics are amazing, but then try and do too much. I cant tell you the number of fics I have read that are amazing, and then quickly turn south as they keep adding more and more components that quickly turn it into an unbelievable, silly, irritating mess. This is not to say your story should be overly simple. Complexity, well done, can be amazing. But if you start adding new things or making characters or your world more complex simply for the sake of more shock value or to draw out your story, it's probably a bad idea.

** For me, great fanfics have

- great characterization
- author is 'more clever' than you are. I like when I don't know where the plot is going, the feeling that anything can happen. And when you look back at the story, everything actually make sense
- reasonable wordcount

** I'd say there is no one thing that makes a great story great. I would also say that what makes a great story great is more a case of a perfect storm: There may be similarities, but overall it is different for them all.

** A great fanfic is spelt correctly and with excellent grammar. Poor grammar, poor spelling, and homophone confusion all make it harder to read. If you're not a native speaker of the language you're writing in get a beta reader who is. If you are a native speaker you should still consider getting someone else to beta and edit.

It must be complete. Until it is complete it isn't even good, let alone great, although the potential for greatness can obviously still be present.

Characters must be characters and not cardboard cutouts. In particular I like to see characters having weaknesses like all real people do, and not just a single fatal flaw like Superman's Kryptonite. Ironically this is why Achilles is such a good character in the Odyssey. While he does have his Achilles Heel, he also has real weaknesses that we can all relate to. I'll grant an exception to this when the story is clearly supposed to be comedy or a parody, which is why I love Red Son while hating Superman.

The story must make sense. In particular characters need motivations for their actions, which should have consequences, not all of which are easily predictable. Master manipulators are unrealistic and have no place in great fiction. Human behaviour has too many degrees of freedom for anyone to read an individual's actions very far into the future. Manipulative characters must be active participants, and will be surprised.

And something that doesn't necessarily prevent a story from achieving greatness but certainly makes it harder: get the non-magical world that surrounds your story right. It's not hard to get geography right, for example, or to remember that no-one had an Xbox in 1991. And you could at least try to remember that Surrey isn't the same as Delaware and has different laws, culture, and institutions.

** I'm not sure there's any specific parameters that separate fics from being good and great. For me personally, it's just how /into/ the story I am. There are few fics that I simply cannot stop reading, and it's those that I usually signal as "great".
