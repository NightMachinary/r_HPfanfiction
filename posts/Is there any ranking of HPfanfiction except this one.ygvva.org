*** Wow, I had no idea this function existed! I wish I could specifically filter with a review/favs:chapter ratio though, that's usually the most efficient way of weeding out the best stories I find

***** Okay, sorry. There isn't any way of getting the whole list in order of ranking. You can go into the individual categories of the library, and sort those in order, but not the full list.

** This is specific only to Draco/Hermione stories, but [[http://dhr.accio.nu/][dHR]] is a link archive and users give stories ratings
