But my pairings are firmly Hr/R or G/D. Can anyone recommend any decent fics that pair Ron and Hermione, Draco and Ginny?


** I just love a lot of the bad tropes of FF. I have read a ton of marriage law, WBWL, and soul bond fics. Can't make it through most of them, but they do fascinate me.

** After I read a few marriage fics, I realized that I'm a sucker for fics where Harry or Hermione or whoever beats the living shit out of the Wizarding World because of the marriage laws. Or just ups and leaves, leaving total chaos behind, that also works.

*** I would love to read a fic where there's a marriage law in Britain while Harry and Hermione chill in Australia and simply decide to not give a fuck and stay in down under.

** My favorite marriage law fics are more about how protagonists respond to it:

Level 1: They were to weak to fight it, so they ran off and directed their efforts behind the scene, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]], linkffn(11916243)

Level 2: They organized a mass exodus and left Magical Britain in shambles, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450)

Level 3: They asked a third party to take out those responsible for the marriage law, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901)

Level 4: They took out those responsible for the law by themselves, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536)

Level 5: They overthrew the government and executed anyone who supported the law, as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005)

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.

  After the war, the Wizengamot passes a law requiring all young wizards and witches to marry, and the Ministry will assign the partners. How do Harry and his friends react? H/G, but not overly so

** My absolute favorite is Contractual Obligations by enchantedstarlight. It's Draco Ginny but ir begins with a plausible lucius/ginny. I definitely recommend this. A unique twist on marriage fics
