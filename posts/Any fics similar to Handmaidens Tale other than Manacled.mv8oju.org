I've read Manacled, but I'm curious to see if there are any other fics that use the handmaidens tale as a plot line


** There's /The Tale of Two fools/ linkffn(2026165) but it is seriously underdeveloped and hasn't been updated for a good sixteen years.

You could also try /The Auction/ linkao3(19101535) by LovesBitca8. It's not that much in the Handmaids Tale trope as Manacled is, but is an amazing book and part of an amazing series.

  In the wake of the Dark Lord's triumph over Harry Potter, the defeated must learn their new place. Hermione Granger, former Golden Girl, has been captured and reduced to human chattel. Sold to the highest bidder as the top prize at an auction of Order members and sympathizers, she is thrust into the rabid, waiting hands of the Death Eaters. But despite the horrors of Voldemort's new world, help---and hope---seem to arise from the most unlikely of places.PART 3 of the RIGHTS AND WRONGS series.
