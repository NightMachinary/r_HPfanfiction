Looking for long fic with *Powerful* and/or *Intelligent* and/or *Cunning* Female Protagonist.

No Romance No Bashing.

Can be Hermione/Fem!Harry/OC/SI or any.

Can be set in any era, can be in any House(but preferably Slytherin)

Can be children(study in Hogwarts) or adult

Can be Time/dimensional Travel or AU

Bonus if she is friend with Hermione (if set in 1980s) or Dumbledore.

Thanks.


** This is a pretty tall order cheif, no romance and no bashing really narrows down the already sparse Female MC selection....

** Are crossovers okay? This has a female MC and 100k in no romance so far. It's an Uchiha OC at Hogwarts.

linkffn(out for blood)

This one was also well written, where reality is sort of destroyed at the battle of Hogwarts so the castle itself sends Hermione back in time as an agent to stop it from happening. No romance, and she hits all the powerful, intelligent, and cunning marks.

  A young Uchiha must flee Konoha when Shimura Danzo comes to take what is hers. Her father's summons aid her in taking refuge in a foreign magical community where the loss of her bloodline ability and inability to trust those around her stands in the way of gaining the strength to kill those that destroyed her family. OC, Uchiha Sasuke, Severus Snape, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, etc

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9148492][Do I Look Like Your Hero?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SeeEmRunning/pseuds/SeeEmRunning][SeeEmRunning]] is a Slytherin!Hermione fic. She is intelligent, shrewd, and cunning. It features a lot of dark topics like forced prostitution, child sexual abuse, and torture so please be warned. No pairings and no bashing.

linkao3(9148492)

(It has sequels, but please feel free to ignore those. They are crossovers and this fic can stand alone without them.)

  Hermione Granger is a Mudblood. Hermione Granger is a Slytherin. Hermione Granger is being prostituted out by her parents. When her parents are arrested, the Dark Lord returns, and her life spirals out of control, there's only one person she can trust: Professor Snape.(Not a romance. Gore, non-explicit CSA. Missing chapter added 2/18/17.)

** First, I would like to recommend Linkffn(The Archaeologist), it's one of my absolute favourites.

I would like to follow with the Black Queen series, starting with linkffn(Princess if the blacks by Silently Watches). Be warned though, the protagonist is a child prostitute dedicated to worshipping Death, so she's not very cuddly.

** I have a female Harry main character who is Slytherin and is friends with Hermione. She is intelligent, but she's not making any earth shattering revelations (the series starts in year one, so she's eleven) and she becomes more powerful as the series progresses, but you won't see it at first (in the first book she's even underpowered).

There are also some Snape POV sections, if that's a dealbreaker for you, and there is discussion of abuse.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

My other recommendation for you is the Pureblood Pretense. Slytherin female Harry, but she is pretending to be a boy and her schoolmates believe her to be a boy. Also an element of mentor Snape but that's not the main focus by far. There are some parts where other characters demonstrate romantic interest in Harry, but she firmly rebuffs them.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
