I'm not sure how accurate my memory of this fic is, but I think the first chapter is actually told from Blaise Zabini's perspective, he's in a squad of death eaters with Nott, Crabbe, Goyle, etc and some of the girls are forced to be sort of slaves to the male death eaters (although Blaise is a decent-ish person). The light side lost and Harry is the only one who survives, he finds the house and kills everyone except Daphne and takes her back to wherever he's living. Harry pretty much spends most of his time hunting down death eaters.

Also, the connection between Harry and Voldemort is really strong and they can see through each others eyes all the time.

I may have some of these details wrong (like maybe its Tracey not Daphne or I may be combining two fics in my stupid brain) but if any of this sounds familiar, a link would be great. Thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]] is the fic you're looking for.

I don't know if you're looking for something similar, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8418356/1/A-Darkened-World][A Darkened World]] also features Harry abandoned on the hunt and left to fend for himself.
