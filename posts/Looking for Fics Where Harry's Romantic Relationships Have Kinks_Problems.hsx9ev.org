*No, I'm not talking about kinks like spanking.* Sorry, I felt like I had to put that in there because I didn't want to make the title to long. Kinks like spanking are fine, but I looking for fics where Harry's relationships have problems and he has to work them out. I've seen to many fics where his relationships go perfectly and no issues come up, but those fics feel bland and lack even the slightest amount of realism, which already comes in short order because magic exists in the HP world. As for pairings, I would prefer you stay away from Harry being with Hermione, Ginny, Gabrielle Delacour, or Lavender. I'm fine with Harry and just about anything else. I am currently reading /Hope and Healing/ as well as /Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament./


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12792189/1/A-Beautiful-Lie]] - one seduces him before running away, the other was running him as a potential romantic partner and espionage asset. At the same time. Also a good story.

** the sequels to the Changeling by Annerb feature a very slow burn Harry/Ginny with issues that they actually have to work through. (in the og fic, it's definitely not the main focus, and doesn't appear until the last couple chapters. like i said, slow burn.)

*** Thanks. A 400k fic with OC as part of the character list is a rare find. Will definitely read.

** Maybe not what you're looking for, but Harry's first major romantic entanglement is with a prostitute in Jeconais' unfinished Hogwarts Dawn. The relationship ends on a down note. You have to log in to read it. Probably shaping up for a harem fic, but it hasn't been touched in years.
