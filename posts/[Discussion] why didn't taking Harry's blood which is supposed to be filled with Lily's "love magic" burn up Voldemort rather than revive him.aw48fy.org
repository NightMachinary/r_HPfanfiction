Aside from the need to advance the plot, of course


** The reason if you really want to call it that, is magic.

The ritual's, which had vague descriptions, only written purpose was to revive him and increase the threat level in the story. So we can assume that somehow /using magic/ the ritual bypassed the love magic and neutralized it.

After all, it would be fairly silly although humorous to read about Pettigrew colossally fucking up and having voldemort getting shafted by his own doing during the climax.

*** Pretty sure it would be Voldemort fucking up, because I doubt it was Peter who came up with or discovered that ritual.

** No one seems to have touched on this, so here's my theory. The ritual clearly dictated which ingredients and also in which fashion. Servant's flesh was 'willingly' given and father's bone was 'unknowningly' taken. The enemy's blood is forcibly taken, this means it signifies overcoming/conquering the enemy magic. Remember that in magic, the intent matters. Thus, I think, the ritual was designed to overcome the harmful properties of the enemy magic/blood and subvert those to be conducive to its original purpose. Many writers have explored this scenario where Harry willingly gives it up to mess with the ritual.

** I'm fairly certain I've read multiple fics that did exactly this as a way to off Voldemort.

From a canon perspective, I'd say that his blood wasn't filled with love magic at all. I'd say that the protective magic was tied to the bloodline and using the magic made him part of that bloodline and thus immune to protection. We never really get a description of how the protection Lilly used actually works in canon. If we look at Harry's sacrifice in DH that also imbued a protection to the defenders of Hogwarts there was nothing tied to blood at all.

** Because "the problem is, the other side have magic too". All magic can be overcome. The unblockable Killing Curse could be blocked by Lily's sacrifice; her magic in turn could be overcome by a clever solution. Voldemort's solution was then in turn used against him in DH by Harry using it to tie himself to life.

As Snape described in HBP, magic is basically in a constant arms race.

Which also made little sense tbh. Either the killing curse should destroy the Horcrux no matter what blood Voldemort has or it should strike both of them down permanently (with Voldemort becoming a wraith due to Nagini).

**** I find that in fantasy fiction, consistency is not the most prevalent in many of the most popular novels.

Exceptions are glamorized and often the key aspect of 'fantasy' works.

It's best to take it in good nature, despite our innate desire to quantify and systematically break down the unknown.

** One idea is it might be him that burns Voldemort and as the blood was taken from him by Peter they got around the protection. Then I suspect the ritual was designed to help integrate that protection into Voldemort so he can get around it.

*** But that does not explain the focus on blood when it comes to Harry's living arrangements. Come to think of it, why wasn't Pettigrew treated to a BBQ when he touched Harry? The intent to harm him was clearly there (the dagger) and the Dark Mark leaves no question for whom Pettigrew was acting.

**** Maybe the protection is stretched because it's protecting his home not just him. Maybe because he doesn't have that much love lost between himself and his relatives. Maybe the protection is against Voldemort specifically regardless of who he's acting on the behalf of.

But it roasted Quirrel, not Voldemort's ghost. And that proves that the protection is strong enough to take care of someone permanently.

****** Voldemort was directly influencing quirell through possession whereas peter was being told do do something by Voldemort but my guess would be that there was enough “distance I guess would be right to describe it between him and Voldemort. With quirell Voldemort was literally attached to quirells head.

** From what ive read in some fics they use the fight with quirrel in the first year to say that the protection was recharging as such when he took the blood. The recharging took some time due to there being very little love in the dursley household

** ‘Cus taking on the blood took on the protection, tricking the magic into thinking voldie was harry too, and nullifying the whole thing. That's what voldie was going for; what he didn't know, however, was that he was tying harry to life with his new body as much as he was himself. Two bodies of the same blood for one soul. That way, when harrys body was killed, he could yet survive, and his soul was protected the crux.

That is, his soul was bound to the earth by voldies body, and it wasn't forced to go On to the afterlife, ‘cus the crux could go in his place.

Maybe it also helped that he was the master of the Wand, and maybe it helped that he was the MoD, or that he had Pheonix tiers in his blood, or voldies crux's were all gone but one. Or Maybe he just had Plot Armor. I prefer the first explanation though, and that dumbles planned it all, and it worked even after his death...
