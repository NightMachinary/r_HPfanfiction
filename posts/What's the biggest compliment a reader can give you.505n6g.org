I'm curious, what's the biggest compliment a reader could give you about your story, and have your ever received it?


** That they had a physical reaction to your story. Every time someone tells me my writing made them cry or they had to put it down for a bit because they felt anxious/scared I get an insane amount of satisfaction. I'm aware that makes me sound like a psychopath.

*** So long as you channel it into fanfiction instead of fellow human beings.

In all seriousness though, I think this is it. Someone saying that they cried or were too almost too scared to continue reading at night makes me feel like they really loved it. Like, to cry means that you were invested enough in the characters to care what happened.

**** Well, obviously not negative emotions into fellow human beings, but it's the same feeling, really, as when people laugh at one of your jokes. Perhaps my post would have been less creepy if I'd pointed out that I felt the same way when people told me they laughed out loud at one of my one shots. But yes, I don't make people cry. Unless they really deserve it. ^{This is a lie} ^{I'm usually the one crying}

But yes, it's such a high compliment that someone can become so emotionally invested in your writing. Knowing that they've genuinely cared, to the point that they can't control their laughter/tears/fear is wonderful.

*** As a 'romance' writer, I agree with this. However, I think reactions such as crying are very rare. Personally, one of the biggest compliments someone could make me is that they find my story disturbing, so I agree on the readers feeling uncomfortable part.

** Ooh, that's a difficult question. It's not strictly a compliment, persay, but I love reviews when a reader mentions that they really identified or empathised with something or someone in the story because they've been through something similar, or they say that something I've written has helped them get through a difficult situation. I've received both of these compliments (the latter one only once), and they've given me a really lovely warm feeling inside.

** It's hard to quantify because although I don't have a lot of reviews, I have had a good proportion of very well considered, thoughtful ones. And yes I have had the best compliment (one reader said they could no longer see my main CC with anyone other than my OC). I love to get compliments on the actual writing and the characterisation but my absolute favourite isn't strictly speaking a compliment, but was from my beta who said that a particular song reminds her of my two main characters. In a good way, that is.

** Someone once told me my story gave them cognitive dissonance until he realized that in a utopia such as Star Trek--which paralleled Roddenberry's free love ideals in a number of episodes of worlds they explored--polyamory wouldn't be frowned upon.

I don't really preach polyamory in real life, I'd rather doubt it would work for me even though I do have the occasional fantasy, but that moment where he went from thoughtline.a to thoughtline.b felt fucking awesome. I didn't change his mind, I gave him a view that made him change his own mind.

When people tell me that a moment in my story made them laugh out loud--at least the comedic moments, if it was dramatic I'd be devastated--and long is also really good. I prefer drier comedy than slapstick so usually my comedy is heh or chuckles, not laugh so loud/hard/long it hurts.

***** Well yes (not for everybody, it has to be said), but negative doesn't always equate to constructive criticism which is what I think you really want. In fact an all-negative review isn't constructive at all.

******* I dunno, I can take concrit, but I'd find a very long negative review completely crushing. I would wonder how I could possibly have thought my story was worth posting if it was so awful. But then it doesn't take much for me to think that anyway, and I would also wonder why they had bothered to read something they didn't even like.
