This is a crack SI.

The writing style is unusual, but once you get used to it you really start to see how the author turns it to his advantage. It's a very funny way to relay information without sounding like way too much exposition.

The story "Follows the stations of canon," but in some of the most entertaining ways I've ever seen. I'd probably consider First Year the most similar with Second Year feeling the effects of the changes with Third Year and beyond having been so changed that plans which were set in motion for a long time are still active, but feeling the barrage of the world being changed around them.

The MC is also peripherally responsible for Donald Trump's POTUS status, but not everything can be perfect.


** I honestly can't understand how you stomach the mix of first person and first person plural.

It does take getting used to, I'll admit.

*** The only thing it really has going for it is that it's an SI and is somewhat original. The prose is horrific, and I don't really like the style and plot, but at the end of the day it's an SI, and amid a tidal wave of Indy Harry and Dark Harry wbwl ill take what I can get.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
