He doesn't have to be a good person, just made more realistic and interesting


** There was a story where he was in reality a secret agent of some non-British force (MACUSA? ICW?) and just pretending to be an idiot to hide his identity. But I am not sure what it was.

*** It's a decent fic, but Lockhart is a very weird combination of Lockhart and Harry, and he says a lot of weird-uncle(-though-he-means-well) creepy things about Hermione (he basically ships her and Harry to the degree of some of the more... enthusiastic shippers in the fandom). It's a fun fic, but it's one of those that has one big thing that switches a lot of people off, so be wary of that in advance.

***** Depends on your definition of bashing. It varies a lot in this fandom, especially with characters like Ron - if you think he's good and loyal, then calling him a selfish cunt is bashing, but if you think he's a disloyal layabout, then calling him a selfish cunt is not bashing. The characters are open enough and inconsistent enough that you can take whatever interpretation you like and be at least a little right, so it varies.

Personally, I would say that Lockhart bashes Ron more than the story bashes Ron, though the story definitely does bash Ron at least a little. He says a lot of stuff about Ron that he knows isn't true, but he's deliberately trying to drive Ron and Harry apart for future-reasons that probably come close to bashing for most folks.

That's just my opinion, though. Your mileage might vary. :)

** May I self-promote? My fic just reached the second Hogwarts year and the premise may not appeal to everyone, but Lockhart will definitely be more than a fraud with an award-winning smile. First hints are already shown.

** There's one where Lockhart adopts & raises Harry. He's still very much the same as canon Lockhart, except he never turned against Harry, for obvious reasons.

** Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider and it's sequel have a very interesting Lockhart, both similar to canon and differently competent. He's a bigger part of the sequel, but he's present enough in the first I can rec it for the request and not just because it sets up a lot of stuff for the second fic's plot.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Lockhart's an author famous for telling daring tales of the adventures of his many friends around the world in my story "Patron". He also is quite decent at getting out of the trouble said friends keep dragging him into. He appears in a flashback, and later in fifth year to stay until the end, but he's a side character.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
