I'm looking for fics where Harry is not a bitch that is submissive to everything. No Yaoi. I also want him to be independent


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Ministry and Wizengamot still haven't learnt their lesson after Voldemort's fall, so Harry declared war on them again.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Here's a few:

linkffn(Harry Breaks Free by Fairywm)

linkffn(Harry Potter breaks free by GreyWardenN7)

linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor by sprinter1988)

The last one... is a bit of a stretch but I found it thoroughly enjoyable, although I suspect you would have already hard of it.

The second one... I didn't like it much but you might. There's definitely more but I can't seem to find them on my favorites list.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Rewriting the rewrite to hopefully get over the writer's block. Harry feels there is more he can do with his life. He is not sure how. A night time visit from Kreacher helps him along his way. After OoTP: mostly stays in canon until the last few chapters. This is an Independent Frugal Harry.
