In the present, Voldemort has locked up his horcruxes well enough that they are impossible to get to, let alone destroy.

To counter this, Voldemort and Harry are both sent back in time to before Voldemort was born. In the past, Harry kills Voldemort, and since there are no soul fragments in the past, Voldemort cannot remain as a wraith when he is killed. In the present, Voldemort does not exist as a wraith, and since all of his horcruxes are inaccessible, he is all but dead to everyone.
