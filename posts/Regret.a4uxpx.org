Are there fics where Voldemort's death eaters regret joining him AFTER he wins the war?Like maybe they finally see him as who-or what-he truly is like.Maybe take a death eater and do a Lucius Malfoy but after the war....?Perhaps even Bellatrix-wait Delphini Riddle exists-never mind


** Just read this nice one shot last week.

*** There is a similar fic where The DE lost the war but they then legislated a win, banishing all non-purebloods from Britain. It then jumps to the collapse of their government, I can't recall the name. The only other unique detail was Ron and Ginny had a bunch of kids together. If anyone can find it, I would be grateful.

** Yes! Very AU, though - Voldemort wins the war after the Philosopher's Stone debacle ends the wrong way; Hermione is a secret pureblood. Gets off to a slow start but by the end Hermione is part of a revolution against the Dark Lord with the Malfoys, the Lestranges, and Snape.

linkffn(Strange and Invisible History by madea's rage) The sequel is very long but unfinished and at this point probably abandoned. linkffn(Influence of Souls)

  The Lestranges, freed from Azkaban after the Dark Lord uses the Philosopher's Stone to rise again in 1992, discover that they've been called to serve in a way no one could have imagined. CP!
