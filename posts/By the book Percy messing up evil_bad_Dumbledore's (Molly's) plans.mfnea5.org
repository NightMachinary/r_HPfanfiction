I just posted something about scheming Ron having a change of heart and helping Harry, with them maybe going Dark or gray and now I'm on this weird kick of random Weasley helping Harry with eventually dark and gray Harry haha. But seriously do you guys know any where Percy who is super into Ministry, laws, regulations, or just etiquette and traditions (idk), noticing that Heir Potter seems to nothing about their world/laws/social system and starts to poke around. Maybe he learns that Harry hasn't spoken to a lawyer or the goblins or whoever is in charge of inheritances/wills/vaults and is appalled and steps in to get it all sorted out because it's just wrong that the last Potter hasn't been taught/instructed/ helped with all this?

I get a kick out of smart by the book Percy messing up evil/bad/Dumbledore's (Molly's) plans simply because he is personally offended that his family hadn't thought to help Harry with the legal paperwork that should have been filed and done with ages ago.

I prefer Harry in a slash pairing or Gen. Also love bed/evil Dumbledore and gray/Harry


** This sounds like a cool idea that I'd read
