All I remember about the fic is Harry wears both a glamour but also a deeper glamour of runic tattoos or something similar to appear weaker than he is. One scene Harry passes out in Voldemort's mannor and doesn't have enough magic to heal him so Voldemort removes all of Harry's glamours ridding Harry of his disguise, effectively outing who he is to those around him. Please help!


** At risk of being horribly unhelpful:

First off, I don't actually know the fic name. But I think I do know this fic so I'll just add some details in hopes it will trigger someone else's memory.

If this is the fic I'm thinking of:

Harry is Sorted into Slytherin, but is looked down upon for his apparently weak magical power and general averageness/incompetence. In reality, he's hiding his looks under a glamour, and has basically lied through the entirety of his Hogwarts career.

(There's no actual way to phrase that without it sounding cliched.)

He was also adopted at a young age by a dark witch, who trains him in politics. She may have been related to the Blacks.

I think it was Voldemort/Harry slash. I read the fic on A03, and at the time, it was incomplete.

Hopefully that wasn't completely unhelpful.

*** Lol you actually helped! Thanks, for some reason I immediately discounted that as being the fic I was looking for. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675879/1/The-Art-of-Hidden-Personas][The Art of Hidden Personas]].
