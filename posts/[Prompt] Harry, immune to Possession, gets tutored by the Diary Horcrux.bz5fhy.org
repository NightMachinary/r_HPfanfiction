Things like DADA, charms, transfiguration, and other neat things a 16 year old Riddle would know.

*** I've read one that's from Diary!Toms POV, of he'd succeeded in coming back in CoS. I couldn't find the link tho', so hopefully somebody can.

** The trick would be why would Tom want to help out Harry? At the core the Riddle character is selfish and it would probably figure out it wasn't draining his life force fairly quickly so why would it continue tutoring him. I do like the idea though.

*** Tom wanted to be a DADA teacher, albeit to recruit at Hogwarts/explore it.

It's not that serious of a request, but I was thinking more of gaining Harry's trust so he could pass on the diary, but he just gets distracted with a talented student.

**** Could also be because Tom is aware Harry is a horcrux after trying to possess him and thus becomes invested in him?

***** Yeah, you could play it as he /is/ selfish and he'd do it /because/ he's selfish.

*** Tom thinks the issue is that Harry doesn't trust him enough and takes it as a challenge to gain his trust (Doesn't canon imply that Ginny opening up to the diary deepens its control over her? Or is that just fanon?), since he never failed at it with anyone else (except Dumbledore but we don't talk about that). Harry admits he almost died the previous year and Tom sees that as his in, so he starts training Harry to gain his trust. Then, like others have mentioned, he gets invested (if only for his own pride) and starts legitimately trying to keep Harry alive.

The more I think about this, the more similar it's sounding to linkffn(The Accidental Horcrux), except with a more subtle Horcrux. It'd be great!

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** I've read that fic, but I don't enjoy slash. I just thought it would be funny a horcrux decides to train Harry and keeps doing it because he genuinely enjoys teaching.

  Harry picks up the diary in his fifth year. Tom recognises that Harry is a Horcrux and tries to mould him into a Dark Lord, but he should've realised by now that his plans involving Harry Potter would always go disastrously wrong.
