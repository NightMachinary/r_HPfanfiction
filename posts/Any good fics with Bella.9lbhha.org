I just finished reading Delenda Est. and I really liked Bellatrix there. Are there any good stories with Bella and Harry similar to Delenda Est (i mean similar ages not hugely different ages etc)


** I'd like something like that as well. It doesn't even have to be Harry/Bellatrix.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

******* Don't worry about it. It's not wrong to recommend it... she is in the fic after all and it fits OPs request because they got together. She just doesn't play nearly as big a role as in Delenda Est.
