  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][TURN]] is probably my favorite slash romance fic - it's Drarry, set post epilogue and canon compliant.

My favorite het is one I just read, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]] . It's a Remus/Hermione alllmost canon compliant time travel fic. It's still a WIP but consistently updated. Linkffn(7860277) linkao3(879852)

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? WINNER BEST DRAMA MARAUDER MEDALS 2016!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick][Stanrick]] has some nice stories if you are a fan of Harry/Hermione. Perhaps not for everyone, but his fics do a good job of making me smile.

*** I started reading Thresholds and just couldn't deal with the writing. It feels like the author was far to liberal with the use of their thesaurus. A lot of the writing had an [[/r/iamverysmart]] feel to it. But as you say YMMV.

** /Breakfast in New York/ is one of my favourites. It's Harry/Hermione, contains some bashing (Ron and Ginny, that may be an understatement especially when it comes to Ginny). It is a little bit regency romance - Harry is a very wealthy lord and has a manor, and a charitable foundation, and is the perfect gentleman (except in the bedroom of course). Hermione has, of course, only had relations with Harry (to be fair Harry was married to Ginny who is the only woman other than Hermione he's ever had).

It's all very readable though, and the story holds a certain place in my affections.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
