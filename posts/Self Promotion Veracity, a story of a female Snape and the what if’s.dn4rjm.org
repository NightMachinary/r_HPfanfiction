I know self-promoting isn't really great, but I saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/djihuz/severine_snape/][this post]] a week ago and wanted to showcase a fic revolving around a female Severus Snape, since there might be interest. This story was created to highlight gender differences in the wizarding world as perceived through fanon and maybe canon. I wrote a slightly different version of Snape than the male counterpart, with a few controversial pairings. I'm aware it's not the best written fic, but I'm one chapter away from the end and I've been working on this for a year and I wanted to show off. Either way, I'd love your feedback!

And as a palate cleanser, here's a link to an excellent fem!Snape fanfic, and arguably the first out there
