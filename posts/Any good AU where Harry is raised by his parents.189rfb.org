I have already read [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11820]["A Different Beginning]] .

Thank you.


** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elightningonthewave][here]] If you don't mind Lily and James being /very/ different from canon, it's freaking massive. Some people think it's awesome, some can't stand it (read the warnings before you start it), I'm somewhere in between. As it is longer than canon, I didn't make it to the end. But I hope you like it.

*** well, thank you for your answer. So I read through the warnings, and it doesn't seem to be what I was looking for. I might take a look at it later, who knows? But right now, I have already resigned myself to reading about 2k more pages of other fanfics, which I find interesting and more 'my type'.

*** At about 3 million words and 400 chapters, I think that's the largest series/story I've ever seen in fanfic.
