I just finished reading through Core Threads by theaceoffire

linkffn(10136172)

I found it immensely enjoyable filled with humor and very cool ideas and concepts, if a bit overwhelming. Its not finished but I will be interested to see where it goes in the future (hopefully).

I am interested if there are any similar fics out there that deal with a god like or very powerful Harry but in perhaps a non standard way and one that does not gloss over how such a thing comes about.

A fic that could be dark at times, but contain humor as well.

A fic that explores the world and magic, but yet still retains the HP universe as a structure.

I will say that generally I prefer stories to have a bit more romance in them, and while Core Threads implies such things, because Harry is still 11/12 in it, nothing has occurred as of yet.

I also like stories fleshed out, but felt Core Threads perhaps at times dove too deeply into things and your mind could get overwhelmed or would begin to drag waiting for something to occur.

If you have not read Core Threads I do recommend it. If you have or at least know the type of story, if you could please suggest some other options to read. Preferably complete but thats not a big deal.

Any rating welcome but Mature+ tends to be more interesting. Dark or Light stories are fine. Smut, Lemons, Harems, and the like are not an issue, but No slash if you would please. Just not my thing.


** I love Core Threads too. The three others I'm enjoying for similar reasons are linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero), linkffn(For Love Of Magic), and linkffn(Blindness).

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** To be honest I dont really care if there are sex scenes or not if the fic is good. Although I will say i do generally prefer mature fics that dont shy away from sex or smut if it fits into the story. I hate when authors censor themselves for the sake of more readers or fear of offending or something.

So... I actually LOVED that the author took the complaints of smut in this one, and added more just because he could. I laughed.

I also just finished reading it and definitely liked it as a story. It wasnt the best out there but it certainly was enjoyable and had some elements of Core Threads in it. I look forward to it being updated.

Mind giving me a slightly more thorough overview (without any major spoilers of course)? Does he simply go around learning things or is there action, romance, drama, or other such components? Is he dark/grey/light, have a goal, or something?

You get my drift. Thanks!

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) also does a lot of Potions theory development, with some general magical theory as well. Harry/Rigel has a lot of power, but in a surprisingly not overpowered way (it comes with its downsides).

*** Depends on your definition of ships since everyones seems different. There are no current "couples" in it, but quite a few platonic relationships that could become more, although its a bit of a guessing game. They are all 11/12 in it for the most part so maybe later in the story as they age or something.

Its a hard story to define to be honest as it takes a very interesting approach to things.

  Magic is everywhere. It is the energy that makes up all life and controls the very elements themselves. Magic is alive, a creature untamed, a savage beast. Well, we know what they say about beasts and music.

*** Ive had several people recommend this either on here or in PM's. To be honest it sounds kinda boring from the description (although the description is bare bones). Mind giving me a slightly more thorough overview (without any major spoilers of course)? Does he simply go around learning things or is there action, romance, drama, or other such components? Is he dark/grey/light, have a goal, or something?

You get my drift. Thanks!

** linkffn(11825585) The story starts out slow but it starts getting good quickly after. It deals with interesting magical concepts and theories, and even gives Powerful!Harry a Powerful!Adversary.
