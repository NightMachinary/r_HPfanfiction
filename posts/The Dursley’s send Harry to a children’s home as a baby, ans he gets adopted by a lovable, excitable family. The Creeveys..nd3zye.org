Maureen Creevey, and her husband, Evan Creevey, who wanted another child, but couldn't physically do it again, quickly fell in love with Harry, and started the adoption process, giving him their last name.

The Creeveys were not rich by any means, but well off enough to support just one more child if they budgeted well.

Harry had dreamed for so long that his parents would come and save him, and at the age of 5, he was ecstatic.

He knew they weren't his biological parents, but they loved him like he was their own child.

He gained two brothers, Colin and Dennis. Harry hadn't had many positive encounters with other children in the children's home, but quickly got over it.

The Creeveys were fun, excitable and always optimistic. They were always doing something, whether it be family movies, doing dance battles to the radio, the zoo, over imaginative fantasy games at the park, you name it.

It's during one of those games The family and Harry notice something strange.

Harry was playing the role of Fanras Stronghelm, a night elf mage, when suddenly in mini mock battle with Colin, playing a human warlock, Ryland Stagspyre, both of them simultaneously release colorful sparks from their hands.

It happens a few more times, to their confusion, and even more to their disbelief, Dennis has began to release sparks from his hands in the game.

Years later, when Harry is about to turn 11, he gets a strange letter addressed ‚ÄòHarry Creevey' with a seal with four animals.

At breakfast that morning, he opens it with his family, and to his surprise, he is a real wizard. No one is really surprised, because for years, the Creeveys had seen their sons do impossible things, and honestly, they just got used to it.

They get someone to come and explain, and a stern looking Professor, Professor McGonagall explains. That's how the other two boys learn they were wizards as well, because of course they had to do a role played duel in front of the Professor to confirm it.

Leaving, the professor sighs. This visit was very tiring. But, upon learning dear Harry had a good home and wasn't placed with those Dursley's, she was relieved.

He hadn't taken the whole dark lord thing well, but he was happy to know his biological parents loved him, and protected him with their lives.

In Diagon Alley he had tried to make friends with everyone, including the little Malfoy. He had definitely adopted his family's personality, is all she could say.

----

When It's time for Harry to board the Hogwarts express, it's chaos. He tearfully says goodbye to his family, promising to write EVERY day.

On the train, he gathers a really odd collection of friends, many of which are shooting each-other dirty looks. Harry Doesn't notice.

He takes pictures of all of them, planning to send them to his family.

Harry Creevey was going to go to Hogwarts with as many friends as possible, and no one could stop him.


** well... they do say the power he knows not is love and friendship is a form of love.

More love = more power to defeat voldemort.

**** I'm pretty sure she went to meet Hermione and her family in canon. And in the HP wiki it says that staff members hand deliver letters to muggleborns.

The letter is written on parchment paper and delivered to the recipient by owl, except in the case of Muggle-borns. When a student is Muggle-born the acceptance letter is delivered in person by a member of the Hogwarts faculty. The faculty member acts as a special messenger, who explains everything to the student and parents.[3]

****** Stolen from [[/u/campkat]] :

There is a book at Hogwarts that writes down the name of any child that shows sufficient magical ability, thereby identifying muggle-borns to be invited and squibs not to be invited.

** I love this idea, Harry growing up in a happy family with two little brothers he loves very much and who will go to Hogwarts too. And imagine Colin and Dennis adoring their big brother, the hero-worship of canon turning into genuine brotherly love.

But what if the discovery of who Harry's birth parents really are doesn't go so well? What if, without being blood-related, various factions try to take Harry from the Creeveys?
