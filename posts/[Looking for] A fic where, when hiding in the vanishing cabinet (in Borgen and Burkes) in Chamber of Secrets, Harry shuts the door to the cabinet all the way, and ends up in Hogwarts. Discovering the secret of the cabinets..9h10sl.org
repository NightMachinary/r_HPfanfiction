*** Indeed and I didn't remember it was so early in the story that it was damaged. But I do remember Montague being shoved in it by the twins.

**** Probably either safety or limited applicability. The Floo Network seems to connect multiple fireplaces across Britain, but the Cabinets are connected. Also it seems rather suspect that if humans could essentially be "vanished" and "conjured" as needed for an additional form of transportation.
