Vernon, not knowing enough about the wizarding world, has no idea that raising the dead is commonly accepted to be impossible. He also has no true personal experience with wizards or witches, only what his wife told him, so he can't easily separate the fakes and lunatics from the real thing. Hence, he drags his nephew on a world-spanning journey to learn how to raise the dead. He joins cults, consults with deranged scientists and modern "alchemists", visits voodoo priests, and just generally descends into sheer madness.


** "Uncle Vernon?" Harry looked onto the factory floor where people were slowly building drills together. The man in question turned and gave his nephew a manic grin.

"Harry! Harry, my boy, you had increased Grunnings' profit margins by 200%!" Vernon grabbed the boy by the shoulder and smiled with too many teeth, "Now we'll make enough money to pay back that freaky voodoo lady!"

"But Uncle Vernon-"

"And then, we'll have enough left over for the plastic surgery for Pet and Dudders," Vernon rambled as he smiled toward the undead pair, chained to the wall. Dudley tried to take another bite out of his father's arm but Vernon chuckled, "Still got a hell of an appetite! That's my son!"

"Uncle Vernon!" Harry had to resort to shouting.

"Yes, Harry?" Vernon looked towards where Harry was pointing. A strange star with an eye in the center, "Harry, remind me, boy. I did give that freaky monster the jar of virgin blood?"

"No, I had to use that to create your Grunnings army - Er, workers," Harry trailed off as the Elder Sign started to glow bright.

"Summon something! ANYTHING!"

"I can't! You made me use everything on your army!"

** The years passed for Harry as he was (sometimes physically) dragged around the globe between every single possible magical place that existed, and quite a lot that didn't. The more avenues Vernon explored for ways to bring Petunia and Dudley back, the more avenues were discovered that wouldn't work.

​

They even discovered some ways that people had used to attempt to avoid death entirely. Most of these wouldn't work.

​

The Deathly Hallows were widely believed to be a myth or a fairy tale, one warning about dwelling on what you don't have rather than what you have. Even if the items did exist, it was doubtful that they lived up to the legend.

​

Unicorns blood gave temporary strength but cursed you horrifically with some causality curse that ensured you would die before you had lived even half your natural life, tearing down everything you have built up along the way.

​

Horcruxes did not prevent you from dying at all, only prevented you from passing on to the next life, trapping you as some kind of malevolent spirit with a limited degree of power, allowing you to possess people. There were even rituals to create bodies for these spirits to walk around in, regaining all of the lost power in the process. The downsides for this? Firstly, it required the murder of an innocent, which Harry supposed wouldn't be much of a downside for whoever was going to go through with this. Secondly and majorly though, once you had exceeded your natural life you would start yearning for death, even going so far as to destroy your horcruxes yourself if possible to ensure it's passing. The worse fate belonged to those who survived this phase. Unable to pass on and trapped in the physical realm, over the years they would forget everything they were, consumed entirely by the craving for the piece of soul they were missing. Dementors.

​

All of this didn't deter Vernon in his quest. He just got more desperate as the years passed, so when Harry was ten, he shouldn't have been very surprised to find himself bound to the alter of Stonehenge, with an aching head from where he'd been struck. The corpses of Petunia and Dudley lay nearby, and Marge Dursley was tied to the stone next to him.

​

Luckily, fate intervened, and Harry was saved. Marge wasn't so lucky. Just under a year later, a Harry who was all too knowledgeable about how death was a gift to be cherished, and how magic would always take it's due, recieved his Hogwarts letter.

​

AN: Book Voldemort died at 71. Wizards live for decades naturally. I've left the "who saved him" open for others to interpret as they wish.

*** The Dementor origin is now my headcanon. It also explains why we allow Dementors to exist, we can't destroy them without finding their Horcrux.

This is also why they seem to be very attracted to Harry, who has a Horcrux. Besides spreading their misery to the world and sucking up happy memories (also my headcanon) in an attempt to feel better, they also have the vague urge to destroy their Horcruxes. They know the feel of one, but since they forgot everything, they don't know where theirs is located.

And now I have a half decent explanation for why Gringotts has curse breakers. Descendants of these people were willing to pay money to inherit, and in order to do that, the horcrux needs to be destroyed. Since the hiding places are probably heavily protected, they started training cursebreakers to seek out and dismantle the traps.

Why didn't Voldemort know about this? Descendants are ashamed to point to Dementors and say "Hey, see that big ball of misery there? That's my many times great grandpa." Tom didn't come from a wizarding family, so he never knew the tales. His source of knowledge would be books, and he probably wouldn't want to reveal his method of immortality, so he only asked vague questions about them to people. And dementors can't write books, so they never point it out.

** "Harry, my boy. Do you know who usually follows Dudley at school?" Vernon looked at the sheet he was given. His nephew carried one half of the sheet at the moment, while he carried the other half.

"Well... there is that Polkiss." Harry muttered, reminded of the memories of Harry Hunting. Momentarily lost in thought, he looked at his own sheet. The bone of a father, unknowingly given. How can he do something like that?

"Right. We should invite that Polkiss guy to our home later." That was one crossed out in his list, already. If he could resurrect his son and wife, everything would be alright once more, Vernon thought.

"And..." Vernon continued, "Do you think my little duddlykins has anyone who resent him at school?"

That math teacher because of his pranks during math class. Alice too, dudley just took her lunch money every now and then again, didn't he? There was also someone like Ronald, who was dudley gang's target if he was not there.

"Maybe, uncle Vernon?" He was not sure, really. He was sure he could find people who disliked dudley easily enough. But to the point of resentment?

"Maybe?" Vernon frowned. On one hand, he was feeling good that no one disliked Dudley in his life, as expected as a good and proper child. But it just introduced complication for him.

"Can't you think of any, Harry? Someone who hate my Dudley? We just need a little bit of their blood."

"I'll try to find someone, uncle Vernon." His relationship with Ronald is relatively good. He was cordial with that girl too.

Pondering at his list once again, Harry was sure that teeth was considered bone, if he remembered correctly. Perhaps he could ask someone to break uncle Vernon's teeth? No. There was no need. He just need to do it himself. Make uncle Vernon fall unconscious for the duration of the ritual, break one of his teeth... Right, he could do that.

"So... do you have any problem with your part, harry?" Vernon glanced at his nephew.

"I think... I can get them ready anytime you want, uncle Vernon."
