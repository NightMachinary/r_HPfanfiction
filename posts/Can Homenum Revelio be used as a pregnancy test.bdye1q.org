** That would have very interesting implications for wizards' stance on abortion, that. But I doubt it; the spell doesn't seem to be very precise, so if you cast it in the direction of a potential mother, you'd get a positive either way --- because /you're pointing at the woman in question/ --- with no way to refine the signal.

**** I mean, to be fair, it's not like modern muggle sciences have evolved past a little genital probing for health concerns, anyways.

Wrap that wand in plastic, cover it in gel, and welcome to the 21st century.

***** The awful thing is I can totally see that happening. New tweet from JK Rowling: how wizards get prostate exams.

And now I've horrified myself.

*** What if the woman was the one who cast it? If she was alone, it might then work.

** Yes! I love this idea!

I also think it would lead to a bit of a stigma about casting the spell because there's always the risk of it being socially awkward. Like, there's all sorts of situations where you'd want to quickly know if there's a person hiding nearby, but pureblooded wizards and witches are reluctant to actually cast /Homenum Revelio/. It would be a logical and interesting area for a social taboo to be found.

Imagine this scene:

/Deathly Hallows/

The trio is entering Number 12 for the first time.

"I wonder if anyone else is here," said Harry.

"Just cast /Homenum Revelio/, Harry," said Hermione.

Ron winced and fidgeted a bit.

"Well, I guess you could do that, but, you know..." he said.

"What do I know?" Hermione asked.

"Well, it might make things a bit awkward..."

"How could it /possibly/ make this situation awkward?" Hermione demanded. "What would make things awkward would be if there's a Death Eater hiding in the kitchen!"

"Blimey! Calm down, Hermione! What I meant was, what if you're, you know, /in the family way/?"

"Ronald Bilius Weasley! I can't believe you!"

Etc.

** probably but would require exceptional mastery over the spell which imo would probably be wasted effort since there is likely a pregnancy detecting spell

** I recently read something where a pregnant Ginny was trapped in a cave and Luna found her using Hominem Revelio and it showed two wizards; the implication was that it was a developmental milestone decently far along, so not a good pregnancy test in that fanon.

** I think it's a fanon concept that Homenum Revelio gives indicators as to the number of people present or their locations. In canon it was just that there were people present.
