It's a common thing for societies to mythologize their history, especially the parts with a dearth of hard facts available; and I've been wondering for a while to what extent Wizarding Britain has done this too.


** I love this question!

I'm currently outlining a founders era fic that I want to deal with this quite heavily: what little information about the founders we get are very tied to a very mythologised middle ages that, if it ever existed, existed hundreds of years after their time. I'm not an expert, but I've done a little reading and I'm interested in writing a fanfiction that really deals with an early medieval/11th century Hogwarts and how wizarding culture would have fit within Britain in that era.

The Merlin thing other commentors have mentioned is a great example of this, but it's also worth thinking about how much Hogwarts as a school draws from much, much later boarding school tropes: an early medieval Hogwarts predates universities, even. The educational model it's going to be structured after would be strictly monastic, but no one talks about that because it doesn't fit the mythical Hogwarts "brand" of the now.

Honestly, I wish we /knew/ more about wizarding history full stop, but the bits we get are at the very least highly biased. Take the implementation of the international statute of secrecy: the idea that every society in the world had the same relationship with magic users, isolated them the same amount, and was growing equally antagonistic really doesn't hold up to more than about ten seconds thought. One day, I'd love to write a fanfiction exploring the statute of secrecy as a colonialist European project implemented without any care for local nuance across the world, and how that might have devastated other communities...

*** The fanfiction series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] has some interesting ways in which it uses parts of our history and implements that with the Wizarding World. The dedication with the linguistics both make me weep and make me so excited for it, though.

The 3rd installment is the first one actually set in the founding era. There's also parts that cover Rowena's and Godric's early lives and another one that captures some time later with Salazar.

I don't want to spoil too much, but it heavily relies on people forgetting so much about their history, especially when people set out to sabotage it.

***** Agreed! It's obvious so much love and time went into it and it has a very solid way to weave everything together so it all makes sense. I especially love the different backgrounds and how the names changed due to coming from outside of the British isles (or because of the time gone by) for the founders.

#+end_quote

The full extent.

The wizarding history you've read from the books and Pottermore was written by a squib called JK Rowling who patched the information up with hearsay, headcanon, internet Tweets. That's why the numbers make no sense, the timeline is broken, and the facts contradict themselves.

Every time I read JKR's interviews, I become more and more aware of how much HP is built on a shifting foundation of headcanons.

#+begin_quote
  *Question:* How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  *J.K. Rowling responds:* Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and *Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy.* Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)

And then some. One of the more egregious bits is having Merlin attend Hogwarts, when the earliest known source for the man dates (we don't have the original, just a 12th century copy) from about the time Hogwarts was founded and recounts his role in the battle of Arfderydd /in 573/. If you accept that the later stories of Lailoken and Saint Mungo are about the same chap, again the sources are older than Hogwarts and have him dying around 612.

(Both stories have him spending his declining years in the Caledonian forest, so my own personal headcanon is that he took up residence in a broch in the valley that would later be home to Hogwarts, which broch would later be incorporated in the fortified school built on the site nearly four centuries later.)

**** And that's why it's super annoying when JKR tweets that she planned all this stuff for 20 years.

JKR said that she'd planned Nagini to be a human for 20 years, according to [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044579634581401600?lang=en][her Twitter post here.]]

#+begin_quote
  Q: How long have you been holding the Nagini secret?

  A: Only for around twenty years.
#+end_quote

Nagini's identity was possibly foreshadowed by Dumbledore in the books:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "I don't think so," said Dumbledore. "I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behaviour of the snake, Nagini?"
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

JKR, having known that Nagini was an human woman all along, chose to dehumanise her in the books and use her as a plot device. Nagini is treated as soul jar and weapon by Voldemort, a disposable McGuffin by Dumbledore and the Horcrux hunters, her death by Neville applauded as a triumph. Even in her Crimes of Grindelwald backstory she's a victim, abused by the circus owner she works for, and a voice of exposition and tagalong to Credence, the real hero.

Nagini, who was apparently planned to be an Asian woman the whole time, has no character or personality outside of being a tool or accessory for white men. It's a horrible look if this was all /intentional/ on JKR's part.

** You could ask the same question about most societies in human history, even modern ones (aka formed in the last two or three centuries). Every society mythologizes, diefies, and exaggerates its history, figures, and culture over time to the point that the true nature of history is distorted to fit the needs of the modern culture. The most pervasive of these are what you would call 'national myths,' where cultures mythologize their founding/founders to suit the modern narrative. Examples include:

- Romulus's mythical founding the city of Rome and the seven early kings
- The descent of the imperial throne of Japan from the line of the sun goddess Amaterasu
- The foundation of various cultures incorporated into Mycenaean and Classical Greece through the various children of Zeus

These things exist into the modern day too. Did George Washington really chop down a cherry tree? Did Kim Il Sung really defeat the Imperial Japanese single-handedly? Was Simon Peter really crucified upside down?

Its not some sinister conspiracy either. Hearsay, oral tradition, and so on changes over time until the story no longer reflects the actual events. Or more simply, think of most of our knowledge of history as the Telephone Game, only stretched across time and geography and cultures. Most of the time, their is a some event or catalyst that the history is based off of. A good example for instance is the history of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy][City of Troy]], which was thought to have been entirely fictional until someone actually went looking for it. That doesn't mean that a ten year war was waged because some Trojan prince was given a choice between being king of asia, being the wisest man in the world, and the most beautiful woman in the world and chose the egg-hatched hot girl from Lacedaemon.

Anyway, like most of the Wizarding World, I would say similar patterns exist as in the muggle world. Namely, I imagine their history is likely based on actual events (especially the more famous tales), but has been bent or contorted over time through the lens of the succeeding generations. A good example of /this/ in the Wizarding World? The three brothers and the Deathly Hallows. The Tale of the Three Brothers is highly fictional in how it /seems,/ what with the literal personification of Death going around talking to people. But...well I'll just pull back to this from DH Chapter 35:

#+begin_quote
  “Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.

  Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.

  “It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric's Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.”

  “So it's true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers ---”

  “--- were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

  “The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus's last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric's Hollow.”
#+end_quote

And the same likely goes with much of the history of the Wizarding World. Some of its true, some of its false, but the farther back you go, the murkier the difference becomes.

** Wizarding Britain's history is likely heavily mythologized - but I don't think we know all that much about it, nor the wider world's history.

What I would expect is to have outsized emphasis placed on the great British magical users - for instance, the mythologizing of Merlin and the Founders fit neatly into that view. That fills multiple good roles - in general, it makes it seem like the British are the most important/powerful in the world, with a storied historical background in magic, and then for the purebloods, it lets them have a gloried past to show why they're better than the Muggleborn/half-bloods.

Past that, canon wise we don't have too much information there. In fanfiction it's up to the author to fill in that gap, should they choose to - and there, I'd expect it to follow those lines. Depending on how violent you make the magical world, they could make wars or battles some of those mythologized moments in history - akin to the battle of Agincourt in british history, from my understanding of how it's viewed/taught there. They could pick other moments - victories in Quidditch/other international sporting events, major inventions/advancements, and so on.

*** Honestly I like to imagine the wizarding world being more brutal before Hogwarts

wizards either had to find a mentor, or where trained by their parents, leading to some wizards having mastery of transfiguration but no knowledge of potions.

Maybe slytherin was trained by someone who was trained by someone who was trained by Merlin, leading a later rumor that it was the other way arround.

I imagine the founding of hogwarts was quite bloody and I imagine the founders met during a war get along well enough and decided to try something together

And Harry is in the perfect position to be immunized against Gell-Mann amnesia. Practically every time he reads a story in the ~newspaper of record~ about events he was involved in, it's flat out lies. Logically speaking, he shouldn't believe anything that's not a first-hand account from someone he trusts, or a quidditch score.

#+begin_quote
  The Founders Relics encountered by Harry Potter are NOT consistent with tenth century artefacts. Nor is the narrative of the Founders that he learns typical of how actual people behave. However, the STORY of the Founders is one that has obviously been put to political use, and is well-established by the time Harry encounters it. In this essay, I will argue that the Founders Relics were created to bolster personal and communal political objectives during periods of turmoil following the ultimate separation of Wizarding Britain from the Muggle world, as part of a wider cultural phenomenon which imagined the Hogwarts Four as the founders of a nation.(no seriously, I swear the argument makes sense)[This essay will be DELETED from Ao3 in January, but will remain available at https://authorgwendavidson.wixsite.com/hogwartshistory/ ]
