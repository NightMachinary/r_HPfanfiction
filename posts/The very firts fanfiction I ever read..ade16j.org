Today I randomly remember the very first fanfiction I ever read. I read this ages ago, back before OOTP was published, maybe around 2002? Looking back at it, the author predicted a lot of things of the following books..

It was a long-fic about Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. I remember that among the things the author got right, in the fic: Harry and Ginny getting together. Ron joined the Quidditch team, Dumbledore dying and Snape turning out to be a double agent.

I don't remember most of the plot, but I remember there was a point where the trio travels to India because Sirius was hidden there (this was published before we even knew that Grimmauld Place even existed). I remember Ginny dies at the end. She sacrifies herself for Harry. I may be wrong, but I think Hermione is endgame with Krum.

​

does this sound familiar to anybody?

​

I think this fic was in english, but there is a chance this fic is in spanish since I don't remember if in 2002 I understood enough english to read a fic.
