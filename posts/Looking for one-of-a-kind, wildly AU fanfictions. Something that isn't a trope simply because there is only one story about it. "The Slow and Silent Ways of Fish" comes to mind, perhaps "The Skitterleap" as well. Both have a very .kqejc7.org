#+TITLE: Looking for one-of-a-kind, wildly AU fanfictions. Something that isn't a trope simply because there is only one story about it. "The Slow and Silent Ways of Fish" comes to mind, perhaps "The Skitterleap" as well. Both have a very different setting and both are amazing because of it, in my opinion.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Linkffn(13567404) has a very unique setup to it. Don't want to spoil it, but I haven't come across a Harry/Multi story that was ever done in this way before. I will say that it is pretty heavy on the angst, though, so if that's not your thing, then the story probably won't be, either.

  AU/In an act of desperation, James and Lily Potter decide to use ancient magic in order to save their son. But no one could have been prepared for what the side effects of this magic were -- most of all Harry Potter himself./Or, a different "Power He Knows Not" story that takes place during GoF. Harry/Multi pairing. Rated 'M' for a reason!

  "Bored by unchallenging classes? Sick of sitting around, doing nothing grand? Eager to learn forgotten magics and gain power beyond your wildest dreams? Join the Young Adventurer's Club now!" A mysterious poster for a new club catches Severus' eye. Little does he know... What the club has planned will challenge everything he knows and change the course of his entire life.
