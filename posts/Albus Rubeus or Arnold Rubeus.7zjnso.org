I'm partial to Arnold myself (honors both Arthur and Ron), but I can see Harry choosing Albus, since at least Dumbledore apologized.

PSA: This is a no-Severus zone.


** Rubeus Archibald Potter.

**** Archibald is one of the names Arthur is a derivative from, and I imagine Ginny was sad to have used the name Arnold for her pigmy puff, because the rest of the names she likes are a bit fanciful.

***** /Edit/ because my reasoning was confusing... This quote from GoF

"'...the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.'

Malfoy looked up.

'Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It's almost as though he's a complete nonentity, isn't it?' he crowed."

And with everyone saying, /Hedwig Dobby is better than Albus Severus!/ ... Arnold would be pretty tame for a name coming from a pet.

***** Just imagine if he got in trouble, though...

No wonder Dumbledore thought he could get away with everything. He probably never got yelled at because his name was too long.

***** There we go. Harry can get that unnecessary guilt toward Dumbledore off his chest in a round about way, and Ginny can have a ridiculous name. It's a win-win situation!

** Of the two, Arnold Rubeus. Alb*us* Rube*us* sounds too same-y.

Or something like Arnold Neville and then use Ruby for a daughter.
