Title.


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]], humor story following first year Albus. /Intolerance. Discrimination. That's all it is. Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this, and the return of the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts after 23 years might be the perfect opportunity to do so. But it's definitely not going to be easy./

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]], a dark, witty ensemble story about the clash of two Hogwarts powers. /Albus Potter, arrogant, amoral mafia don, is probably going to steal the answers to the nastiest, most exhausting Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test known to wizard-kind. Sybil Vaisey, self-righteous, scheming rival mafia heiress, is definitely going to stop him./

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
