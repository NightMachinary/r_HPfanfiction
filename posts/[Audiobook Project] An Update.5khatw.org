Hello, everyone,

I kept trying this morning to make the first chapter of */The Accidental Animagus */ upload to no success. It wouldn't upload to SoundCloud.

I thought about a solution for this problem all day, and I came to a solution.

I'm going to abandon SoundCloud as a distribution service.

I will completely re-record both Chapter 1 of *Not From Others* and Chapter 1 of *The Accidental Animagus* and post it to YouTube. This solves the problem of file space and allows me to use playlists.

Both Chapter 1 of *The Accidental Animagus* and Chapter 1 of *Not From Others* will go up within the week.

Best Regards,

ThePianoProdigy

** Is it going to be monetized? Because if it is then that might bring you lots of unwanted trouble.

*** Of course it's not going to be monetized.
