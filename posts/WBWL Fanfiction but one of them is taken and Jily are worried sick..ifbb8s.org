Hi everyone,

I wanted to know if anyone has come across a fanfic in which one of the children (twins or not) has been taken (kidnapped or something on those lines) and James and Lily are worried sick to try and find them and the whole story unfolds then?

I was reading linkffn(Harry Potter: Chosen One) and thought that maybe there might a fanfic like the one I mentioned above out there.

If you have read one please do leave in in the comments below!

Thanks
