If I wanted to sort based on reviews or favorites only in a specific time range of publishing any ideas how I would do that ? Like if I wanted to sort on fanfiction.net according to favorites everything that was published after 2013 - not sure if it's even possible..


** How about [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net][this?]]

** Unfortunately, FFN has absolutely terrible sorting options. I wish they would update the sorting options, I would actually pay money to see better sorting options on FFN.

To answer your question the best solution is setting the time range option to published within one year.
