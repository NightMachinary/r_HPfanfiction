** First things first: Your premise is interesting, and I hope you continue to write.

As far as feedback goes, you really need to break up your text. The paragraphs are large and unwieldy which makes it difficult to read. The rest of my feedback is not as important and is more about refining than big problems.

- The story seems to be somewhat piecemeal, in that it feels as if we are missing part of what you are trying to share, like you jumped to the next section too soon

- There is a lot of repetition, which seems to be a part of the writing style you are using, but in a few places it feels like too much; too many of the same words reused, or the same concept only slightly reworded. No problems with the style, it just needs to be condensed a bit.

- I found no glaring spelling or grammar errors, though there was a place or two where I might have used a diffferent word to help a sentence flow better.

Unless you are going to do a lot of flashbacks later, I would expand this prologue, especially the section with harry growing and discovering his power, and why petunia is so OOC. This will help set the story better, give your version of the characters more depth, and make me happy. (that last bit's important you know.)

*** On the sidebar, there's a link to the Wiki which has a list of people willing to beta. I know one of our writers has hooked up with a good one from that list, so take a look. üëçüèª

***** I hope you're able to find someone to work with. Think about if you want just spelling and grammar or if you want someone to bounce story ideas off of. I do that with mine all the time and it's great!

*** Would you be up for beta-exchanging? I recently published my own first two fics at linkao3(World Turning) and linkao3(The Promise of Pain) if you want to check out my writing. In any case, I would be happy to beta your work over google docs, as your premise is interesting and the writing is promising.

***** We can exchange on Google docs and use some sort of messenger to bounce ideas off each other! I think discord will let us have a private chat.
