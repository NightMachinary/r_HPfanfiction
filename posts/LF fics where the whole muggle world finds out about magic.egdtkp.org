Could be through Voldemort taking over like Beyond the Curtain or just an accidental exposure too big to hide. Or wizards just deciding it's time. Anything that deals with muggle reactions to this hidden world.


** It is the culmination of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15287883][Annals of Arithmancy by White_Squirrel]], which is the third and last part of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse]] series.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** well i started reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4626147/chapters/10547214][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]] on ao3, but it's a little difficult to get into, and has a /lot/ of OC's. It's still pretty good tho

*** Yeah this one has some pretty amazing things but also some pretty weird parts. It's got wayyy too much going on. Like a dozen plots going on at the same time all around the world. Pharma company trying to mass produce magical potions, car company making flying cars, Voldemort taking over the world a country at a time, anti-magic religious extremist terrorists, the things going on at Hogwarts, the President of the United States dealing with political fallout, and scientists in various labs all around the world trying to make sense of everything.
