:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry gets thrown into an AU. I don't remember too much outside of one line: "I deliberately neglected to tell a child he was going to die?" The AU Dumbledore never held the Triwizard Tournament because it was considered barbaric and the death toll was too high, and Harry was telling them about his life.

I think it was on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. Anyone know this story?


** It sounds familiar, but I can't come up with a name. The story I found while looking for it, linkffn(Dumbledore vs Manipulative Dumbledore by HeirGaunt), has a slight resemblance, but I'm pretty sure it's not the one you want.

I'll see if I can find the right one.

Okay, bot. Be that way. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13629405/1/][Dumbledore vs Manipulative Dumbledore]].

** I'm not sure, it's been a while since I've read it, but that sounds like it could be from nonjon's A Black Comedy - linkffn(3401052)

edit: I decided to re-read it, and I was wrong. I'm still pretty sure I've read that story at some point, but I can't place it.
