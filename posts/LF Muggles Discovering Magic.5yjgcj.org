  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** I really very strongly dislike stories wherein muggles discover magic, the muggle government/s almost immediately accept the existence of magic and go on to rather easily dominate and/or exterminate magical society while the magic government in particular and wizards and witches in general run around acting like idiots without a clue what to do.

Often times in these sorts of stories it comes to light that the muggle government had "known all along" about the magical society and had plans in place for easy genocide.

While all these stories are fantasies, they strain the burden of disbelief long past the breaking point. The worlds of these stories have a somewhat common denominator of rules about how magic works and that both societies are basically human and possess basic ability to reason. Just because wizards and witches can use magic doesn't render them retarded, though that seems often the case in these sorts of stories.

Please try to avoid recommending stories that fall into this stupid cliche. It's the next door neighbour to "Dumbledore is evil and/or super controlling" and "Ron is the worst thing since Hitler and so's his mom".

*** Looks like you were trying to write a rule of cool Potter story but then got a bunch of bad reviews and abruptly changed course and nerfed Harry before turning the entire plot into a tragedy drama mixup. Its great if that is what you want to do, but the transition is pretty abrupt and not enjoyable at all.

**** If anything I was trying to write a rule of cool muggle story, not a Potter story. I've admit I've gotten a load of negative reviews, but an astonishing number of them are all from one person who seemed to make it their life's crusade to lecture me which I found enormously amusing. Considering the story is still in the first act, there has to be some drama and tragedy, or their would be no story.
