From the limited knowledge of shit I have, I assume that Harry would become antisocial, emotionally stunted, socially stunted, or something similar. So, I guess I'm asking for a fanfic where Harry either doesn't /really/ have morals, doesn't /really/ understand how to socialize, or is a psychopath (preferably an accurate psychopath, but a crazy serial killer is fine). Thanks.


** No Curiosity is a good one. Been trying to find a fic like it for some time.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

** linkffn(3618966) is a very short story that makes a point about Harry's upbringing from Snape's point of view.

linkffn(4172226) has Dudley start to think more about the way Harry is treated. You see accurate bad treatment of Harry, but since Harry is no the main character, you don't see much of his psychology.

linkffn(3389525) has a Harry who is socially competent, but is suicidal, in part because of the Dursleys' behavior.

  I assume that Harry would become antisocial, emotionally stunted, socially stunted, or something similar

This isn't quite the case - you can't assume that a child who was abused will be emotionally or socially "damaged" to any great extent. They are /more likely/ to be so, that's all. Doesn't mean you shouldn't use it as the basis for a story, but in real life please don't assume that abuse leads to being seriously fucked up, or that being seriously fucked up is caused by abuse.

*** I didn't say "seriously fucked up." And someone that goes through abuse has a child /will/ have some form of scarring or emotional problem. Children aren't supposed to be abused, because it /will/ lead to problems. A child who is shunned and hated by his own family will assume that something is wrong with them, or at least develop violent tendencies.\\
And you're putting words in my mouth, saying "seriously fucked up," when I didn't use such drastic words. Don't downplay abuse, it always leads to problems.

How can you possibly say that those things aren't "seriously fucked up"?

***** Because it's not seriously fucked up. Seriously fucked up would be a delusional, paranoid, anxiety-ridden person who kills people, or something similar. Many people are emotionally stunted, or on the psychopathic/sociopathic spectrum.
