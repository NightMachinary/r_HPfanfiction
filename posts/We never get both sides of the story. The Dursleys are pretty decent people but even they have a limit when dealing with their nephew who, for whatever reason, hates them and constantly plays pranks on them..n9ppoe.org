#+TITLE: We never get both sides of the story. The Dursleys are pretty decent people but even they have a limit when dealing with their nephew who, for whatever reason, hates them and constantly plays pranks on them.

Like that time where Dudley was locked in the cupboard under the stairs for hours after his cousin tricked him that there would be a treasure in there or when Uncle Vernon's car brakes would just refuse to work or maybe that time when Aunt Petunia discovered cat poop in the cake she was about to serve to her husband's rich client.


** It seems a little but hard to put a positive spin on locking a child up under the stairs and swinging frying pans at his head.

*** Actually In books Petunia never swings a pan at Harry. She threatens to do so but doesnt.

Harry doesnt cook for them either. Petunia makes him look over the bacon for a while but thats it. Apart from the cupboard there doesnt really seem to be any indicator of neglect in the books.
