As the heir of the Wizarding World's famed mercenary family, Daphne Greengrass was raised to have a ice-cold demeanor. Her demeanor and her infamous Freezing Charm had her titled the Ice Princess of Hogwarts. But now, the ice-cold bitch face had cracked hearing her Father's words.

Recently, the family's mercenary services weren't used much. Instead, the other services they provided were more popular. For example Traceless International Portkeys. Some smart Death Eaters had fled Britain relying on them. The idiots were rotting in Azkaban with their magic sealed up.

There was a popular saying these days, anyone who dared to fight Harry Potter was a idiot.

"...You want me to 'take care' of Harry Potter? Are you feeling like a idiot today?" Harry Potter, the Man Who Won. Possibly the strongest wizard of Britain. He gained this reputation after ruthlessly subduing the many Death Eaters in hiding after Voldemort was defeated.

There were rumors that he possessed the Elder Wand.

There were rumors that he had mighty wandless magic and the ability to kill with his eyes.

There were rumors that he had mastered the 'Power He Knows Not', granting him complete immunity to not only the Killing Curse, but all curses and hexes... and he could grant this protection to his allies as well.

A participant of the final battle against Voldemort, Daphne knew that the third was likely true.

Currently the Death Eaters weren't much of a concern and the youngest Head Auror was stuck in desk duty. However, the Blood Purist factions would rather have him out in the field. His political power was rapidly expanding and his words could move the Wizengamot.

Riding upon his coattails, the mudblood Hermione Granger had taken control of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and was destroying the old laws that were biased in the favor of Purebloods!

"Don't worry, you don't have to fight him. Serenity Selwyn came to me with a offer... it is more a boon than anything, actually. After you get blood adopted by her, you can inherit the Selwyn family's wealth. One of those inheritances is a Marriage Contract that the Potter Family owed to the Selwyn Family, and it is heavily biased towards the Selywyn Family's side..." Daphne understood her father's plan. After marrying Harry Potter, she could control him and obstruct the changes he was spearheading in the Wizengamot.

But was it worth it? There was no Albus Dumbledore in this world. Could Harry Potter really be controlled?

How do you find middle ground between "muggleborns deserve equal opportunity and rights" and "muggleborns should be exterminated" if your somewhere between those two lines you're either at best, a coward and and enabler or someone okay with them being treated as second class citizens. Theres so many easy parallels you can draw with real life here but every time I see this trope played straight apart of me dies inside. Its even worse when authors try to justify this both sides BS with how the muggleborns are ruining their culture. Because that's somehow equivalent to genocide?

Its also strange how somehow every allegiance of every family is known and public information, when the reason why Voldemort was so terrifying the first time around was because nobody knew who was a death eater, who was imperioused, etc.

** I always kind of imagined the marriage contract discussions would go something like this:

"You've got a what?"

"A marriage contract signed between the Potters and the Selwyns."

"And who signed it?"

"It was your great-grandfather Henry Potter and Whatever Selwyn."

"Well congratulations. When's the wedding?"

"With who?"

"The Ice Queen of Hogwarts."

"No clue who that is..."

"Blonde, blue eyes, was in your year? Nothing?"

"Wait? Did Malfoy get a sex change?"

"NO! You are supposed to marry Daphne because of the contract signed by your great-grandfather and Whatever Selwyn."

"But I have no clue who she is and I didn't sign anything."

"Well you've got no choice. If you don't agree, you'll lose your magic."

"Why would I lose my magic over a contract that I didn't sign?"

"Because the rules of the story say so."

"But if the contract could wait for four generations then why can't it wait a few more until the Selwyns stop inbreeding and start producing some decent children."

"But Daphne is not an actual Selwyn."

"So then why would a contract force me into marrying her anyways?"

"Because she's been adopted by the Selwyns."

"So it works like that? In that case I disown my great-grandfather."

"But you can't do that."

"Well watch me. If that's all, have a good day!"

"Wait..."

"Have a good day!"

As soon as whoever tried to shove the marriage contract down Harry's throat leaves the office, Harry took a deep sigh.

"Can you believe the things people will come up with these days in order to scam me out of the inheritance Uncle Vernon left me?" he said to himself.

"No, didn't you accept the inheritance your Uncle Vernon left you? This marriage contract is part of the inheritance."

"Wait what?!"

** It's already more interesting than the prompt was, because unlike the prompt, something can actually happen here.

For anyone who didn't click the link, or who weren't in the thread, the prompt was essentially just a bashing scenario, where the Greengrasses have a marriage contract with Harry after the war and he uses it to just emotionally abuse and neglect Daphne for thirty years out of sheer spite.

It was kind of pointless, to be honest. The prompt made it a point to show that Daphne tried to make things work with Harry, but he just snubbed her on everything, constantly. For years and years and years. As I said, and as several others said, if Harry never cracks, this isn't a story. It's just some kind of emotional revenge porn, but not even good emotional revenge porn, because I've got a sack of those in my back pocket, and they all have actual stories and drama involved. This is just "and then Harry punched Daphne, metaphorically, in the face, over and over again until they both died of old age, or she presumably hung herself in a closet or something. The end."

I don't see that here. So it's far more interesting right out of the gate.

You say the contract is "biased." Let's talk about that. How is the contract biased towards Selywyn? What restrictions would Harry be under, and what freedoms would Daphne have? How is this written to make it biased towards one side? Keeping in mind that it has to be at least somewhat reasonable, or it would have never been agreed to in the first place. And that it can't be too terrible, or Harry would just, I don't know. Leave.

*** I haven't exactly thought that far, but it somehow makes it very difficult for Harry to take part in the Wizengamot. Either by changing his nationality (Selwyn inherits a seat in the French Wizengamot) or by some other means.

The part that favors Daphne is that Harry doesn't get any say in the Greengrass family (contract was for the Selwyn) so he can't ruin her family's business in revenge.

Apart from that, it doesn't interfere with Harry's life in any way. He is still Head Auror, doesn't have any duty to Daphne (no heir procreation clause) and has full access to the Selwyn inheritance (Daphne disposed off all the Dark stuff, ofc).

By the contract Harry is officially married, has inherited the French Wizengamot Seat of the Selwyn Family and cannot participate in the British Wizengamot.

The point of the marriage contract isn't actually the /marriage/ but to keep Harry away from the Wizengamot. No need for interactions with Daphne either - she did her job and entangled Harry into the contract, her part is done.

In that case Wizengamot rule will not work at all. There has to be other forms of control. The prompt implies that Harry is ruthless, if that's the case then any form of control will not work.

******* In this prompt, Daphne is the heir of a mercenary clan who has been commissioned with the wealth and status of the Selwyn Clan to entrap Harry in a Marriage Contract. She has successfully done so.

Generally you'd expect her to act like a 3rd rate romance novel villainess - publicize their upcoming marriage, take max advantage of her status as Heiress Potter, take Harry to bed for the purpose of having his children, control his actions and whatnot. She isn't doing ANY OF THAT.

Keeping to the terms of her commission, she has given Harry a certificate pronouncing their marriage, a certificate that grants him the Selwyn Clan Head status + French Wizengamot seat and a certificate that bars him from entering the British Wizengamot due to the French seat. That's all.

Daphne is upfront with Harry and tells him straight that she was commissioned to entrap him and now that she has fulfilled the commission, she is fucking off. No sex, no betrayal, no hard feelings, this is just politics - that kinda thing.

Harry can do literally everything EXCEPT take part in the British Wizengamot. To take part in the Wizengamot, he'll have to reject his Selwyn Clan Headship, accompanying French citizenship and marriage to Daphne. All of that is a bureaucratic landmine that doesn't require Daphne to act as a villainess.

****** If Harry wants to interfere in the Wizengamot, he can. If the point of the contract is to deny him a seat because he's technically a foreign national, that's clever, but Lucius Malfoy wasn't powerful because he held a seat in parliament. He was powerful because he was rich, and because he inserted himself into as many places as he could, like the board of governors at Hogwarts. Lucius was willing to spend money freely because he knew that money is less important than the power it can buy.

That should be the real conflict here. The Greengrass family, not necessarily Daphne, uses this to try and get Harry out of British politics because they fear him. It has the opposite effect: it motivates him to meddle where he wouldn't have really cared before, because fuck you for telling me what to do and trying to control me. Harry's rich, he can make friends and buy votes. Harry's famous, he can give interviews or show up on WWR talk shows and discuss politics and give his opinions on things. He's a national hero, if he tells his side of the story and lets the British wizarding public know that he's effectively had his British citizenship robbed from him by a marriage contract he didn't want, there would be outrage. Not enough to overturn anything, obviously, but it would twist public opinion against the Greengrasses and, by proxy, stain any of their political platforms and policies. The marriage contract denies him a vote specifically, it can't stop him from becoming the single biggest donor to St. Mungos or giving an exclusive interview every month in the Quibbler or the Prophet.

That should be the real thrust of this, I think. Hogwarts motto, never tickle a sleeping dragon. If the Greengrasses had left Harry the hell alone, he probably would have ignored politics for the rest of his life and either played professional Quidditch or worked a desk job as an investigative auror. Now you've pissed him off. You've also pissed all his friends off.

And Daphne gets a front row seat, and maybe starts to reevaluate her opinion of Harry Potter, and how wise of a move this really was by her family.

*** The prompt I put up turned into a bit of confusion-firestorm in the comments, so I just decided to watch from a distance, scratching my head.

It wasn't intended to be "just a bashing scenario" but a subversion of the cliche "marriage contract, fall in love regardless" trope seen constantly -- especially since in the prompt's case she was fully on board with it and her family's goals, no matter her motivations, and was not a victim of circumstance like in most marriage contract fics.

Some people were treating Daphne in the scenario as a snow white victim, when she was fully on board with essentially maritally-enslaving (because, yes, that's what it is when one party has no decision in the outcome like that) Harry for her and her family's selfish ends, and couldn't understand/agree with why he was such a spiteful asshole to her for basically robbing him of the life he wanted (a loving wife, kids, et cetera), despite her attempts of trying to make the bondage work as a sham of a marriage; others tried to pull the "but he'd want kids anyway" card to try to pass off the shit-show sham -- even if you wanted kids personally, would you want to have them with someone who basically used a legal form of slavery on you?

Others fully agreed with Harry being so cold towards her because of what she and her family tried to pull.

In the end, I thought, "yeah, if I post something more in that thread, I'll just be pissing petrol onto a bonfire and cause things to nasty between other people posting there with differing views", so I remained silent.

*** I will offer some perspective, take it from someone who read his first HP/DG fanfic on 2009-2010ish.

1. By having less known characters, it can shape the narrative and give certain take on story settings and conflicts. JKR indeed gave us such a beautiful world to mess around unfortunately there is noticeable lack of known female cast around Harry's age. From canon, we can infer personalities of Ginny, Hermione, Luna in somewhat noticeable depth and Lavender, Padma, Pansy (just barely), Cho in somewhat superficial depth. While this is understandable, it is disappointing in terms of worldbuilding. So fans alike want to make something new and refreshing to fit certain story narrative (or trope) and here comes Daphne Greengrass to the story. She ticks all the "unique" boxes. Pureblood lineage? Check. Slytherin? Check. Somewhat strange and peculiar name? Check. From here you can imagine whatever you want to write. Death eater family and romance ala Romeo Juliet? Easy peasy. Political fic? Just make her family important politically or something. Business magnanate? Make her dab in potion trade or export import stuffs.

2. She has a somewhat stereotypical name. I don't know about you guys but when I heard Daphne, my mind automatically picturing a posh girl or at least a girl with middle to upper class upbringing despite the reality. And it helps my #1 reason that Daphne somewhat fits a pureblood, posh, Slytherin image. It is also always interesting to see how people write a posh girl story. In canon it seems Harry never meet this kind of characters barring maybe Hermione though it was kind pushing it. I always imagine Hermione as middle-class kid with.

3. People want to avoid OC even though Daphne Greengrass is basically an OC just with canon name.

Sadly marriage/betrothal contract trope is probably most common because it's an easy and cheap way to force together two people with radically different personalities. There are some decent and great take on this trope but of course there are also badly written take on this trope out there.

Ultimately pairing preference is like coffee or music taste. Everyone has different tastes and different reasons

Yup -- the prompt I posted was basically an attempted subversion of this: no happy ending from one party trying to martially-enslave another, just bitterness and spite all around... which would be far more realistic.

**** Omg, I read my first Haphne. It was literally the most joyless harry potter I have ever seen in my life. It was so depressing. Ugh.

It was like reading a Vernon/Petunia pairing where petunia is as she was in book 1 of canon.

Literally, harry would never aspire to be Vernon Durseley and thats what Haphne Harry was.

Maybe there are better Haphnes out there but this is officially my least favorite ship now. Ugh.

*** I think there's two categories haphne fans fall into

1. It's different. I know it's very common now a days but the first haphne fic I read was such a breath of fresh air after so many Hermione and Ginny fics. And honestly I don't read slash so the Griffindor/Slytherin dichotomy isn't horribly old to me like it is to Harry/Draco fans.

2. A lot of guys wanted to unfreeze the out of reach cold girl in school. This fulfills that fantasy.
