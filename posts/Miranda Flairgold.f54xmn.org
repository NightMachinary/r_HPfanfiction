I can't recommend her work highly enough. Although going inactive has left me on a cliffhanger for well over a decade now. A second Chance at life trilogy is fantastic and she has a devoted following even now. Still getting rave reviews on stories that haven't been updated since â€˜09.


** I remember liking the trilogy back when I was a teenager, however a word of warning to potential readers: it's a super powered Harry taken to extremes, including a fantastical new school that eclipses Hogwarts in every way amd teaches magic that makes every canon character incredibly weak by comparison while introducing original characters that could wipe the floor with Voldemort, yet Voldemort stays the big bad evil that Harry must inevitably face.

Multiple magical animagus forms, overpowered new magic, etc.

*** yep, I think the consensus back the. was that it would have been better as a standalone fiction trilogy.

** I love this series.

I really want to know how it ends.

What is Harry? Does he have Elvish blood or something? What does Namach see in him? What is the big secret?

If I win lotto I would seriously consider paying someone like Brandon Sanderson a bunch of money to finish it.
