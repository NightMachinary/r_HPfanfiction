Hey,

as the title says, I'm currently looking for interesting crossovers; what better place to satisfy my curiosity than the HP fanfiction subreddit. Post your favourite Harry Potter x-overs. I don't care if it's Twilight or Hello Kitty, as long as it's not Yaoi, we're totally fine. I don't have a specific word count this time, but as long as your uncompleted story is still being updated regularly or from time to time I'm okay(dead stories are a sad thing). Thanks in advance!

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.

** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian)

A slight xover with Dresden Files (and I mean slight), but it still counts, right?

Also, linkffn(Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger). I actually haven't read it myself yet, but it's getting rave reviews and it's on my reading list, though real life keeps interfering. Many people who are good writers themselves like it, so it must have that X factor. Most likely worth checking out if you're into LotR.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
