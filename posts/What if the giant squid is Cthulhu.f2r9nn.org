What if Hogwarts is the safest place on Earth not because of wards, but because it is the resting place of the Old Ones and they protect it when it is Truly In Danger.

The giant squid is the only actively seen because he kind of got bored and just wants to have fun with some mortals.

The Black lake could be called that way to symbolize the helplessness and horror one feels when in the domain of the strange squid that never dies and various pochers that disappear when trying to hunt it down.


** That would make the merpeople living in the lake cthulu worshipers, no? And the second task could get quite a little more dark depending on how you take the story.

**** If we do that then, sometimes, people in Hogsmead will turn into merpeople and go live in the lake. That's where they all came from, actually. Mermish isn't a real language, it's just the mutterings of twisted fishpeople touched by an Old One.

Although that raises questions about how Dumbledore knows Mermish, and what that means.

Or, it's the result of mutated vocal cords designed for speaking underwater. Whether or not it's /also/ the insane mutterings is still up for debate though. Because why not throw in extra body horror while we're at it?

****** I'm thinking of something similar to Innsmouth where fish people who worship Dagon were people before and they just progressively become fish people. Maybe hogsmeade is like the Innsmouth people who are still human enough to not transform into fish people but still worship the old ones

** Stood at the edge of the lake, knowing that it was now or never, Harry began to incant "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn." Hermione, realizing what Harry is doing nearly screams in horror "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" Harry just smirks "Dumbledore said that the Giant Squid was the Power the Dark Lord knows not, and told me this was the Incantation to get it to help against the Death Eaters."

***** They did this in Faery Heroes, technically. They used a Shoggoth to kill Death Eaters once or twice.

******* Heh. Oh yeah, it's cliche and bashey as fuck. I still find it fun anyway. It's such a, like, Ocean's Eleven vibe to it that it's just stupid fun. It may use cliche tropes, but it uses other tropes that aren't and uses them in really fun ways that are just really enjoyable to see. Sometimes you wanna read about a bunch of smart people outwitting a bunch of idiots and gloating about it.
