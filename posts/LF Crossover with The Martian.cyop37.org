How would Mark Watney react to being stranded in the HP universe?


** In trying to understand how magic works: “I'm going to have to science this shit out of this.” He would them become instant best friends with Prof. Sprout and they would bond over their mutual love of botany. If Sprout isn't around, he would constantly be badgering Neville with questions about magical plants. He'd end up doing some kind of experiments that would blow up one of the greenhouses eventually.

** Something similar would be "Of Veils, Gates and Magic", with Carter and O'Neill getting stranded in the Wizarding World.
