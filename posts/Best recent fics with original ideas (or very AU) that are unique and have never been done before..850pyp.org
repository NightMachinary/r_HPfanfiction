WIP or Complete. As long as they are very different and interesting. Thanks!


** The Mind Arts is kind of recent. It stars a Harry Potter who starts using legilimency naturally at a very young age, and how it affects the world around him. Harry is constantly using legillmancy to read his friends and enemies minds, and he uses the information to sort of manipulate them. It's a great fic.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** WIP:

linkffn(We, Harry Potter): Harry turns into a five-headed dragon. Fun ensues.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor): Hermione is a Parselmouth, the Sorting Hat is a gossip, Boggarts want to go to school, and the timeline is /so/ wrecked.

linkffn(Why Time-Travel Should Be Illegal, And Other Morals) A very surprising self-insert. The SI comes into the world /as a Muggle/ in the mid-1980's and decides to adopt Harry, send word of the Horcruxes to Dumbledore, and then nope away to Magical Hawaii with Harry and his newly-found wife, a Squib of the Macnair family. Magical Hawaii is well-worldbuilt, the SI and his wife are both complex, non-Mary-Sue characters, and it's overall a very refreshing take on the SI genre. Only warning: some religion (although it's done better than I've ever seen it).

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.
