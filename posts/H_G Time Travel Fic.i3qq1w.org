:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry goes back in time to his 1st year, and redoes everything. And I would like for it to be a H/G fic. Meaning he asks her to the Yule Ball, starts going out with her earlier, and stuff like that. Thanks in advance!

** There are a lot of these, you'll need to give more detail if you want to narrow it down. To my knowledge though, most of them are unfinished.

*** The premise generally is that Harry is now physically one age but with memories of experiences that extend beyond what he could possibly have lived through. Some of these stories do include Harry mentally worrying about the morality of if he can date anyone. How old is he? He doesn't fully react like he would have in an adult body he does not have, nor like the other eleven year olds around him. Too many memories make him too mature in one respect, but physically he is still eleven...

â€‹

Is he attracted to the young girl she is, or the young woman she will become? If the latter, will she still become that woman, or will the changes to the timeline mean she becomes someone different? Is it fair to her either way? In the well done works you see him wrestling with all these questions.
