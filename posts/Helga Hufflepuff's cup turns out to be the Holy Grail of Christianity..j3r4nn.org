**** I will be the first to admit that I never really cared too much about the holy grail legend, but by the little I know of it (mostly from Indiana Jones and other miscellaneous bits of media) it would guarantee the one who drinks from it immortality, now, translating it into the HP lore (namely that Helga Hufflepuff is dead) it could be that it has an effect similar to drinking unicorn blood, just more benign, it wouldn't be permanent, but by drinking the user could survive whatever is killing them at the moment until the drink leaves their system, though it would be a coin toss if it would heal the damage or just make it so the person survives it.

** Just imagine if this had an abridged series. It would look something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Ignotus sighed as he sat on the top of the Astronomy Tower, deep in thought. He was considering his new Master -- a young witch who summoned him to the mortal realm once again to fight in the upcoming Holy Grail War.

  He... wasn't sure what to think about her. She had some strange ideas (like suggesting to /carpet bomb Hogsmeade/ to see if any Masters come out), she preferred to call the tournament they were now engaged in “Murder-death-kill”, and then there was her insistence that he was, in fact, some sort of demonic figure from Muggle mythology. On the other hand, after spending a full day with her, he had to begrudgingly accept that Hermione was, in fact, a talented witch.

  “What's your wish, by the way?” he asked the witch, who was now looking over the Forbidden Forest from the edge of the Tower. “I want to double-check that I'm not getting myself involved in anything /ridiculously evil/ right now”

  “Sorry to let you down, but no such luck.” she responded. “I just want the Cup.”

  “You want the Cup?” he asked, surprised. “Just the Grail and not the mana reservoir within?”

  “I just want to stand over the corpses of six fallen heroes drinking butterbeer from a goblet touched by the blood of Christ.” Hermione shrugged. “Teenage girl stuff.”

  ...

  ...

  ...

  “Fuck it, I'm in! I'm all about that zero-accountability life!” Ignotus proclaimed, and then -- for the first time since he arrived in this world -- bowed to Hermione.

  “I humbly swear, my Master, that together you and I are going to /fuck up all the witches/.”

That's another fic I'd read - I don't think I've ever seen one where Hermione gets the diary. In a close-to-canon universe, it'd work. Horcruxim are secret enough they probably aren't explicitly against any rule, and Tom could easily help her study and even pass on secret insights, so if he plays it the right way he could definitely use her. And without her to figure out the monster is a basilisk, Harry will be in dire straits.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Helga watched the proceedings with interest. "Perfect. Now, observe." She delicately cradled her jeweled teacup. It did not look like the original Cup of Midnight, which was deliberately grandiose, meant to serve as a stark contrast to the plain wooden Cup of Dawn. But its essence was unmistakable. The thick black Nothing contained within its bonds poured out slowly, a single drop flowing through the air. (From Orders of Magnitude. The Cup of Dawn is identified elsewhere as being the same cup as both the Holy Grail and the Goblet of Fire).
