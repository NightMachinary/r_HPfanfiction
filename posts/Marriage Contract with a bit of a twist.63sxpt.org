I've read a few marriage contract fics where (Harry/ Pick your girl) fall in love or enter into one to get away from someone. Usually the girl is betrothed to someone of their own age group.

I'm looking for one where the girl is betrothed to some old guy and they go to Harry to try and get out of it.

Also there are bonus points if you can recommend a fic where Harry takes advantage of them and they don't warm up to him.

Does anyone know of something like this?


** linkffn(HP and the Marriage Contracts by Clell65619) - basically what you asked for: Daphne Greengrass is betrothed to a wizard twice as old as her father, and seeks help from the local hero. Harry, in the meantime, has to respond to the literal deluge of marriage offers from just about every eligible witch in the UK and some abroad. Also has a running joke about Dumbledore wanting to know exactly how Harry beat Voldemort.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

*** You just know that was written by an American.

The reason Harry is in need of money is because he has massive hospital bills... I think Americans don't know how silly that sounds to most european ears.

****** Loophole City for the financial sector. If the tax is bigger than what I'd pay to draw money in a foreign country from an US account, people could just start giving their relatives the bank account data. For one solution.

I'd take a bet that the estimate won't be reached in the first year of this bill existing, and the overall tax output over a few years will be far, /faaar/ below that estimate because institutions will have found loopholes en masse.

If I can use a service that loopholes me out of paying 2%, I'd use it and I bet a lot of others would too.

**** I saw one the other day where Harry was bankrupting himself paying for Dudley's surgeries or something. It's kind of sad that the Yanks think their fucked up system is on a par with the rest of the world.
