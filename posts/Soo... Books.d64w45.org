Any books where an OC is pulled into the potterverse and is just completely done with the worlds shiz? Or they just pull a massive prank on the place that spans years but is suddenly blown into the open?


** Cause I've been tempted to write a story about a Female OC being summoned and being mistaken as both male and Harry Potter because something happened to that universes Harry. She has a stuffed cat that turns into a Kneazle Kitten, she plays mute and doesnt bother to correct people of her gender and name. She is so paranoid that she refuses to meet peoples eyes (for fear of Legilimency), she bought enough food and water to last a school year so she doesnt have to fear people potioning her. of the whole school population only three people know she is a 'she', that shes not really Harry Potter, and that she can Speak. (Until fourth year in which she blows the secret wide open to defend herself and not have to proticipate in the Tourtament.) Those three people are Marcus Flint and the Weasley Twins. Also anyone can use this if they want, just credit the idea to me and send me a link.
