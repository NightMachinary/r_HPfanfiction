** The effects would be /way/ too slow for this to be a good fighting tactic.

Go for cyanide or nerve gas.

** Mercury poisoning is really slow. You might poison your enemy but he'll kill you seconds after you start putting your focus into transfiguration instead of shield charms and he'll die maybe months later or he'll take a bezoar and live.

** If you can do that, why not just turn the target person into a piece of wood?

Before you attempt to get too creative with “how to kill a person in 101 painful ways”, I suggest you asking these questions first:

- How difficult is it to cast that spell? Any complicated wand movements? Any emotional components needed? Does it have to be cast verbally?
- How fast is it to cast that spell? My theory says all 3 Unforgivables MUST be cast verbally. Obviously, the two syllable Avada Kedavra takes longer to cast than Crucio or Stupefy, and reduces its rate of fire.
- What is the range of that spell? Do spells have different range? Do some spells need to be cast in close proximity, while others go a very long distance?
- Can that spell be blocked by shield charms? Do different spells react differently to shield charms? One of Avada Kedavra's main powers is the ability to bypass them. Stupefy and Reducto could also break them faster than those transfiguration spells.

I highly recommend reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), for inspirations in applying Transfiguration in combat situations.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** That would definitely do a large amount of damage - even a small amount of mercury can cause massive brain damage once it's in the blood, so if there are any open wounds, it would cause a rather horrible death.

As for if it's possible, I don't know. I don't see why it wouldn't be, but it certainly wouldn't be legal.

** It would be better to go for mustard gas or something if you want fast acting poisoning that isn't overly complicated.
