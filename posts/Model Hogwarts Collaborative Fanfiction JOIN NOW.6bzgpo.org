*** *Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: hello-witches-and-wizards-of-reddit
    :END:
Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelHogwarts/][r/ModelHogwarts]]! Join a magical world just beginning to unfold, on Reddit and [[https://discord.gg/SPkBB3B][discord]] (yes, in order to join, you *need a Discord account.* It takes two seconds to make one and if you have questions we'd be happy to answer them). Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night.

** *What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: whats-unique-and-awesome-about-model-hogwarts
   :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences. You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is two eight-week semesters, with a one-week winter break and a two-week summer break. All you have to do is pass two classes in order to move on to the next year. With the support of your classmates, prefects and teachers all rooting you on, you're going to ace that test on the properties of Venus! You also get to chose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You can just take two and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.

2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house (cough cough Pottermore). We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.

3) We're new. This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. Want to be a Prefect? Want to start a chess club, or a book club, or even a flesh-eating slugs fan club? Hey, we won't judge! Model Hogwarts is ripe with opportunities but still is developed enough to give you the structure to succeed.

4) It's easy to join. We don't have a whole different site that you have to create an account for and remember to check the URL every so often. We use Reddit and Discord, which are already developed sites and are easy to use! If you're already on Reddit, why not add this to your subreddits?

5) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

6) You may recall us posting before the school year started. It may have been dubious the success of this project, but I am happy to confirm the server is active with about ~30 extremely active players! There's a dangerous ghost roaming around Hogwarts, looking for revenge, and students are quickly trying to learn how to defeat it and improving their magic. Classes are going strong, and you can join whenever you like! In Transfiguration,for example, they're discussing the theory and origins of magic, and in Defense Against the Dark Arts they're learning about magical creatures and classifications. Drama is always present, and whether you're a muggleborn or a pureblood supremacist, Mexican or a British nationalist, shy and reserved or the class clown, Model Hogwarts has got a group of friends just waiting for you.

** You mention in the student handbook about the timescale of the activities on Discord, notably the half-hour duration of the lessons that a student is enrolled in. What time of day to they usually take place (on average)?

I'm in the UK, see, and I'd need to know if I were available at the times the lessons were taking place before I could consider committing to anything. That said, the whole Discord real-time thing sounds like a great idea, better than some forum-based RPs I've seen.

We have a wide variety of different class times and lengths. My class usually lasts an hour long and takes place on Tuesdays at 7:00PM EDT *or* Sunday at 3:00PM EDT.
