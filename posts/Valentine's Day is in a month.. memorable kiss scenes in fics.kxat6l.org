Anyone have any kiss scenes they thought were good/romantic/original? Prefer f/m, can handle m/m kiss but no sex.


** Oh god it is in only a month, just kidding I don't care cause I'm lonely

** Long buildup and rehash of canon, but a pretty satisfying scene (double POV) in Chapter 8

  Ginny suddenly realizes two things, in very quick succession: One, that Harry's never really looked at her that closely before, and two, that he is absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, doing that. Right now.This is the story of how Harry comes to notice her... but more importantly, it's the story of how Ginny comes to notice that he noticed.

** Well, I do recall part of linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) where Harry and Ginny's new neighbours see how affectionate they are with each other and are inspired to a greater spark in their own relationship. Includes a morning after with clear indications of what went on (though that goes over the kids' heads :D), but no lemons.

The recent chapters of linkffn(Grow Young With Me) have some fairly passionate kissing, too.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
