With all due respect, where is the creativity in ship names? It seems every ship these days is just a combination of first names in an order that sounds like an std. We had Harmony and Wolfstar, and now we have Tomarry, which makes me think of tomatoes. I'm not bashing you if you like this naming convention, I'm just curious as to its prevalence.


** There's been a shift in how ship names are decided upon in most fandoms, really. My guess is for simplicity's sake, as portmanteau ship names are and have been common in fandoms since the days of Star Trek. Portmanteaus are usually shorter and thus more convenient to use, but they also have the advantage of being more obvious as to which characters a ship involves. Although there are still some [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming][idiosyncratic ship names]] in place, like Wolfstar, a lot of the [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4591][older idiosyncratic HP ship names]] were vague or abstract, long, or could easily be applied to more than one ship, even if they were more specific. And then, of course, there are names which, although indicative of more specific characters, would generally be seen as more ridiculous or offensive now than they would have over a decade ago (just look at the ones that involve characters of color, for instance). That said, as someone who prefers idiosyncratic ship names to portmanteau ship names, as, like you said, they are generally more creative, I wish we did see more of it used. Gin n' Tonic and The Government Stole My Toad are both really fun.

****** Well, it's actually rather simple. It's the term that stuck in the fandom for magic being somewhat internal and used up when cast, and replenishing naturally. The form it takes will vary fic by fic.

The most meme-d upon type of magical core is using it as a perfectly quantifiable measure of strength (It's over 9000!!!) and used to power up Harry to a million - but it's not only that.

As a name, I think it stuck because wand cores are a thing, and it makes some sense to have a 'core' of magic within oneself - and can be tied in nicely with use of focuses (eg - a wand might work by making it easier to connect to a magical core and use it).

A much better use for this train of thought would be a dark ritual that allows you to use your body as a wand (i.e. - wandless magic) by doing a grotesque perversion of the wandmaking process, using your body as the wood and something horrible as the core

******** I've never seen it actually used as a wand core, though that's an interesting thought - I meant more that wand cores are a thing in canon, so the terminology exists (and the 'core' of a wand is usually the magical ingredient) - I imagine it just got lifted.

That would be a rather interesting dark ritual to find in a fic, though - turning one's arm or hand into a wand would be a pretty good trick to have up your sleeve.

********* Well, not really. Wand cores work based on their symbolism, and how well they match their wood.

The first issue with those cores will likely be that you won't really find woods that match what those substances represent. For example, a basilisk is a very large, very evil monster constructed from dark magic and loyal only to a single master. Finding a wood with connotations of the same kind will be difficult, but not impossible. Conversely, phoenixes are symbols of rebirth, healing, eternity and cleansing fire, which would need a wood of matching purity. Really the only wood I can think of that fits isn't even from HP canon, but LotR - [[https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Two_Trees_of_Valinor][The two trees of Valinor]].

The second, and bigger, issue with these cores is finding the wizard worthy of wielding them. As a wand constructed from extremely dark magic and encased in a matching wood, the Basilisk Wand would be notorious. It would require a similar wizard - one with an alignment to the dark, suffused and loyal to the extreme. Really the only wizard I can think of that would concievably wield a basilisk wand is Bellatrix Lestrange. She perfectly embodies all the qualities such a wand would have. The phoenix wand would be even harder to find a master for. They would need to be unwavering in the face of darkness, a light shining into the dark recesses of life to burn it all to ash and cleanse it anew. At the same time, they would need a capacity for infinite mercy, ready to heal and assist anyone who asks them.

This obviously only adresses the individual cores. I don't believe a combination of the two is possible in any way. They are diametrically opposed, both annihilate until nothing is left. They are aligned on opposite sides of the spectrum.

Any wand you would concievably craft, if it doesn't explode during creation, would need a wood or set of woods that both adheres to the individual components and attempts to bring them into a nonviolent balance. I'm unsure if such a wand were possible. The core would need to either twine or be parallel, with the woods also either twining or running parallel, but then they would also need to be similar enough to blend and stabilize the dual core.

And of course finding a wizard to wield it would be nigh-impossible. The entire wand would be a contradiction, being at once an instrument of inescapable death and boundless healing, infinite mercy and relentless murder. It would constantly clash with itself.

Forcing the two ingredients to work together would be like pressing two north poles on a magnet together. It's possible, yes, but it resists at every step. If it can't annihilate the other, then it will stay seperate. I doubt you could mix the two in any real sense.

That might be because I like the idea of a main character with less raw power but more control - so the opposite of the setup for the actual Naruto, but a lot of Sakura-centric fics do have that in there.

** Ship names made more sense (or were at least more justifiable) when things like character limits and very limited search functions were a factor.

Recently---like, since FFN added the ability to tag [character1, character2] as a pairing and since AO3 created a new Wild West of tagging possibilities---making up new nonsense words to indicate a pairing hasn't been necessary. Or even vaguely palatable. Stuff like "Wolfstar" might feel clever to whoever made it up, but it comes across super cringey, in an "I own four katanas" and "I tell everyone I meet that I love yaoi" kind of way.

There's also the issue of clarity---fanfiction is more popular and accessible than ever, and obscure or "clever" ship names make no sense to readers who may be new to the fandom. It's a bit gatekeeping-ish to insist on ship names that only longtime fans or the "in-group" will understand.

** My only guess as to why the more creative ship names declined, and this is pure conjecture, was that the popularity of FictionAlley also declined and/or the newer crowd who got into fanfiction were more comfortable with the portmanteau ship names.

I'm a big fan of the older ship names too, I mean come on: Orange Crush for Harry/Ginny and S.S. Betrayal for Lily/Sirius, H.M.S. Flaming Toad for Ginny/Neville; all of those are amazing! Feels like your speaking a special code disguised as real words, whereas the portmanteau ship names are clearly nonsense.

That said, there is something to be said about speed of the portmanteau ship name when saying it aloud or writing. Nuna or Luneville is way less of a mouthful than "S.S. The Government Stole My Toad."

** Ship naming is a compromise between brevity and clarity.

On the brevity side, you could get initials or even first letter or two: H/Hr, HP/GW

On the clarity side, you get standard slash format: George/Fred, Hagrid/Giant Squid

In the middle you get Portmanteaus: Tomarry, Hinny, Harmonione

​

Then there's the "clever" names: Wolfstar, Flowerpot, Pumpkin Pie

These have the dubious distinction of being neither particularly brief, not clear.

As a rule of thumb, any ship name that has someone ask what it is whenever it's casually referenced is a terrible ship name that needs to die in fire.

I clicked into this ready to say that. That, and with all the ships out there, it's pretty freaking hard to remember all of them. And then there's the ships that have like three different names for them, because it's really hard to standardize a fandom.

That, and Name/Name is easier to read and recognize. Drarry? Tomione? Dramione? Severitus? Sorry, I thought we were speaking English. Or do you need some penicillin to make the burn go away?

The prompt specifically called for bio!dad snape, appearance altering on 16 birthday, and remus to returning to teach. Its divulged to basically include any kind of dad/mentor snape just about though, or gets tacked on as an umbrella tag.

Makes it a little hard to find specific flavors if you want something a little different outside the prompt though.

** I just want to say, Tomarry (as it sounds - not written like that) in my language means the hide of an animal and is also a rarely used swear word for pathetic/bad person, so it's very weird to say that ship out loud.

Also, harrymort (the voldie alternative to the ship) may be names together but it sounds really cool. I remember when I was starting out liking a pairing with a very random (for me at least) nickname, and it took me 2 weeks to find what that name was. So the names smushed together as a ship name is for me easier to find than to use person A/person B and start searching in Google/tumblr/reddit and hope to find someone mention their ship name - and understand that it is for that particular ship

** My personal thoughts on seeing shipnames:

Flowerpot? What is this, Jily? Something Petunia due to the somewhat common forced gardening in the Dursley home?

Ginger snaps.. oh, Snily? I guess that's an interesting ship variant, but why would this one fic portray Snape as devil incar--oh it's Jily, okay. Wait, that doesn't make any sense...

Potions and Snitches is Snarry? But there is a fanfic community also called that that explicitly forbids the romantic versions of the ship...?

"Fancy" shipnames is just confusing. I kinda like the Wolfstar shipname, but really, the only reason it doesn't suffer the same problem is that it's one of the most common fanon HP ships. Had it been a a rarepair, it would be just as confusing (case in point: Starbucks)

** I've never been a fan of ship names. Or using abbreviations and acronyms. Are we so lazy that we can't spend a minute to write full words and form a complete sentence? It seems every fandom has some sort of jargon and I can't be arsed to learn it. Just recently a title from this subreddit contained this: "MC (OC/SI)". How is that supposed to make any sense? What does it even mean? Divide OC by SI and multiply by MC?

Any time someone writes MoD Harry I imagine he is a moderator on a forum. Ooh, and my personal favourite- AK. "Voldemort threw an AK". I imagined him throwing an Avtomat Kalashnikova and was confused for a minute until I realised the author meant the killing curse. Seriously, how fucking hard is it to just type out "the killing curse"? It only takes a few seconds- the killing curse, the killing curse, the killing curse. See? It's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

In conclusion- fuck the so-called "shipnames". Use the full names of the characters so that people know what you're speaking of. Not everyone can spend their free time memorizing useless trivia.

*** A lot of the abbreviations stem from character limits in summaries. Like on FFN, there's only so many characters that you are allowed to use, so shortening ships and other stuff (like MoD!Harry) is just smart. And yea, the need for it mostly went away with people switching over to AO3, but some people also still use FFN.

And honestly, who wants to read OR write Archive Of Our Own or Fanfiction.net 20 times when you're talking about something? Yea, there's some more obscure stuff, like severitus, that takes a while to understand, but once you do, it makes it a lot easier to look for very specific things. That's why we have stuff like TvTropes. If you want to look for a Snape and Harry Mentor fic you're not going to get super mixed results because most people know that term and will put it in their summary or tags. Then you can look exclusively for Severitus, instead of looking for Snape/harry mentor, harry/snape mentor, snape and harry mentor, harry and snape mentor, harry snape guardian... I think you get the picture.

And really? Stuff like that is just,, happening to internet language. You think most people that AREN'T on the internet a lot know what a 'rickroll' is? No. That's just how language works.

Fanfic language is literally just jargon, and the natural progression of the circumstances and limitations surrounding early fanfiction writing, reading, and discussion.

At this point, so many people are used to it, and most people have at least a base understanding of the meanings, and trying to switch over to everything being fully written out would be way more trouble than it's worth, and it would just go back the way it was eventually anyway.

That's my opinion at least.

** In my fandom (Japanese anime/manga) they mixed the languages for the ship name. Like one character is Japanese, the other American.

So they took the initial A from the American name and the first kanji for Ei from the Japanese name (英), so they often write the ship name as A英

I thought that was a pretty creative way of a ship name. More creative than most ship names I've seen until now, at least.

But the ship name with name x name exists as well. In my fandom the names of the two main characters are so short you can't really shorten them.
