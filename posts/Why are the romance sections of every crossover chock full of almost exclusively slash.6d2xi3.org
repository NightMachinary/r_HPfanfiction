*** This, and I'd also say it's due to a lack of good male pairings for harry in canon. It makes sense that Harry should have some counterpart that is comparably prominent as him.

Who is there in canon that matches this? Ron? Snape? Lol. So they pair Harry with the main character from another fandom.

In contrast, Canon has plenty of viable female romance options in canon comparably.

I should say, I don't read slash. Maybe I'm way off base.

** A few reasons:

Protagonists tend to be male, and thus crossovers with romance between protagonists will be male/male.

Mainstream media tends to be predominantly het relationships so people looking for slash will often be forced to write their own, which led to fan fiction being a place where slash is available, which attracted people that wanted to read/write slash which meant more slash was available....

While maybe not a major reason, I have read a few articles talking about how stories with no female romance feel safer for women as there is less chance for them to replace one of the characters with themselves.

**** If I remember correctly the logic was that without a woman in the romance, there was no risk that the woman would be placed in a situation that made the reader uncomfortable. Since very often we will heavily empathize and even self-replace characters in fiction with ourselves, by removing females from sex, there is no potential for uncomfortable sexual situations to arise with a character that the reader is self-substituting with.

******** I do not. I've seen a few studies that suggest the numbers lean slightly towards females, but not a massive amount, and others that show a ridiculous slant towards females, and still others that show average gender ratios but skewed sexual preference ratios.

The problem is that all those reports are based on self-reporting so they're not going to be accurate.
