Fics where main characters enter the story as very different people than what the other characters expect.

To clarify, something *really* far out of left field, not: 'they expected Harry to be a hero but their abuse turned him into a villain!' but rather more like: 'they expected Harry to be a hero, but instead he was a zen Buddhist monk that was really into whittling and the healing powers of green tea'.

​

As examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] - MoD Harry is uncountable eons ancient. He has seen worlds rise and fall, blown up stars in a fit of pique, and is totally and incurably bored. Until he is summoned into a parallel universe during the summer of OoP. Dumbledore thinks he can easily manipulate his newly acquired 'hero', totally oblivious to the fact what arrived is actually a primordial god of death and destruction. Everyone else gets it though, and is suitably terrified, especially the young pre-MoD Harry who is being sidelined. Delightfully surreal with equal parts macabre/horror and crack.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11666799/1/Minato-Namikaze-and-the-Destroyer-of-Worlds][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]] - A crossover with Naruto. For those unfamiliar, Naruto is an anime staring children trained to be deadly assassins. Fem!Harry has been trained as a Ninja since she was 6 or so, arrives in the Great Hall and her immediate response is to murder everyone. Because while she isn't sure exactly what's happening, it's probably enemy action. While this might seem like a fairly stereotypical villain!Harry, it isn't. She isn't interested in gloating or evil, she's a professionally trained soldier who has killed multiple people in the line of duty. All this 'chosen one' stuff sounds like bullshit, and she's got a war to prepare for. It almost defies classification, as while the basic theme is highly cracky, it all gets played so straight that it becomes instead a sort of hyper-real drama.

​

Anybody else got recs for fics where characters have to adapt to changed rules or people behaving in ways that they are totally unprepared for? Probably, but not necessarily, crack?

*** If you don't mind me asking I wonder what this fic is a crossover with? It mentions being a crossover, but fails to mention with what...

**** It's a crossover with a book series that I've never read that starts with “Created: The Destroyer” I think, but you really don't need any prior knowledge for this fic.

It basically involved Harry being raised by a village of Korean assassins after they stole him off the Dursley's doorstep.

**** I would tell you a couple of the hilarious differences this results in his character, but frankly I don't want to spoil anything. This is the rare fic I've read multiple times

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

  AU: Itachi didn't kill the clan, instead he and his friends are teaching the next generation to drive them (and maybe the rest of Konoha) crazy. Won't that be fun?
