Basically this, as the title suggests - thought it seemed an appropriate thread to start with Halloween in mind. Are there any good horror fics that say, have the students of Hogwarts up against Pennywise, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, an Xenomorph, The Thing, Jason etc (maybe even Hannibal Lecter as a wrongly-appointed Defence teacher?). I've been brewing over an idea for a potential horror crossover myself that has James and the Marauders with help from Lily team up to defeat Pennywise when they are at Hogwarts and several years later, Harry and the trio find themselves against a similiar threat. But then there's the whole problem of the sewers already being occupied by the Basilisk... (Or maybe it might be easier to do an AU where you remove the Basilisk altogether from the second book you have Pennywise).

Alternatively, a Shining-inspired fic that has people staying at Hogwarts over Christmas when the majority goes home and somehow becoming isolated from the rest as one of the characters is driven mad and pitted against the rest sounds like a cool idea if executed well.


** Probably doesn't count as 'iconic horror villain', but I found the idea of a Weeping Angel at Hogwarts delightfully frightening. I barely know anything about Doctor Who and really enjoyed it. In fact, I don't think you have to know anything beforehand and it works.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

**** That was the idea, pretty much. An AU where the monster never was a Basilisk, but It all along. In fact, with Pennywise's "true form" being a spiderlike monstrosity, Aragog being wrongfully blamed makes even more sense in that scenario!

I'll also add one more recommendation that isn't a HP fanfic. [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/ti-index/][/Terror Infinity/]] is a Chinese web serial that is technically a multi-crossover fanfic. The premise of the story is how a random group of people are forced to travel from one horror \ action movie into another and try to survive each one. Among the universes the protag has to travel through are also those from the following franchises (spoilers): Resident Evil, Alien, Final Destination, Nightmare on Elm Street.

** I feel like you'd have to pick a little carefully, several iconic horror villains /should/ be no match for HP wizards.

Pennywise seems like he's a suped up boggart.

Jason is little more than a guy with a machete. A fourth year Hogwarts student should be able to handle him, unless Jason catches 'em by surprise.

Michael Myers is literally just a muggle with a knife.

Xenomorph should be entirely vulnerable to magic, levitate/transfigure it. The only reason wizards have problem with beasts is that they're magical beasts with magical resistances.

*** Pennywise, I think, fits especially well in the Potterverse /because/ he's so similar to Boggart. See my musings above on how perhaps, in this AU, Slytherin would have experimented on a Boggart to make it smarter and deadlier, instead of creating a Basilisk.

And the Xenomorph could easily be explained as a Dark Creature --- I don't think it'd be out-of-character, so to speak, for their hide to be magic-resistant like dragons', and for their acidic blood to be explained as something close to Basilisk Venom.

Jason and Myers are harder nuts (heheh) to crack, but so long as we're going for an AU rather than a straigh-up crossover, they /could/ both be wizards in this version --- perhaps with the extra-scary ability to Apparate inside Hogwarts? They found a loophole, and now nobody knows where they're hiding in the castle, and they go after the kids at night... something could be done there.

** I actually came up with a crossover with Jason two days ago. I wrote a bit but not much because I haven't actually wrote a Harry Potter fic yet. Though i have the entire plot set out.

The premise is on Halloween night, Harry and co along with the Slytherins head to the Forbidden Forest based on killer myth and a missing professor.

Harry and Hermione, being Muggleborns point out how stupid and cliche that is but reluctantly go anyway because their friends don't want to back down to Slytherins.

They go through the Forbidden Forest. Eventually they come across the missing professor's bofy. Jason pops out, grabbing Draco and slitting his throat.

Everyone panicks and start to run except Crabbe and Goyle who meet similiar fates but try to put of a fight. Spells on the most part, don't affect Jason.

Harry and Hermione manage to get Ginny, Neville, and Luna before they dash oyt if the group.

After running a bit, they catch their breath and Hermione explains that you shouldn't split up when coming across a killer.

On the other hand, Ron and Cho Chang bump into each other and Jason comes and slits them to. (But they stay alive for a while).

As all the groups try to escape the forest, Fred and George discover Ron and Cho.

Everyone meets up at the end of the forest _with seveal chapters dedicated to their POVs beforehand).

However Jason suddenly grabs Harry. In unison all the surving groups launch joint spells (thinking about a group Reducto or perhaps a killing curse. Harry blacks out and it is left ambigous whether Jason survived.

When Harry comes to, he finds out Rona and Cho have died from their injuries. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyles bodies are never recovered by Hogwarts.

In the epilogue at Malfoy Manor, it is revealed that Voldemort had revived Jason and sent him on a mission to kill Harry on the condition that hebwould be able to run free again in the Muggle world.

The Malfoys, angry about the death of their son, and Voldemort treating his death as "collateral damage" launch a killing curse at him.

Voldemort effortlessly defeats them and kills them for their betrayal.

What do you guys think?
