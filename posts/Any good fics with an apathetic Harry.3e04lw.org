** Would lazy Harry from Harry the Hufflepuff count as apathetic?

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

**** Do you mean an indifferent Harry who doesn't get involved, or one who doesn't have and/or doesn't understand emotions, so who is a bit sociopathic and thus does things not acceptable by moral standards?

  When Petunia had to allow her hated nephew into her home, she'd expected troubles to arise sooner or later. Nothing though could have prepared her for the reality of what was to come. The boy sleeping under her roof, eating her food, wasting her money, was no normal child, oh no. It was an evil little demon hiding beneath innocent features. My take on sociopath!Harry.

  What Do We Fight For? Â» Having mastered the Deathly Hallows, Harry Potter is reborn time and time again so that he is now so tired and dead inside that he no longer cares what happens to the world or the people in it. So what happens when, as a six year old, he wakes up in 1944 in Wool's orphanage? Apathetic!Dark!Harry

  When he witnessed the murder of his parents, the darkness got in him. Dumbledore took him in, taught him the best he could, and when it was clear the darkness was in too early, Albus taught Harry how to hide it, and how to get away with killing. AU based heavily on Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. Update: New sections in chapter 5.
