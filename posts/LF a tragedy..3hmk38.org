** Not really a tragedy but the ending of linkffn(The Pureblood Princess) is very anticlimatic and interesting in my opinion. The story is a Daphne POV fic beginning during 5th year and gives a really different approach to the teenager in Hogwarts than Harry and all his hero adventures.

Eventually Harry/Daphne but not focused too much on him, at the beginning at least.

*** I was dithering about whether or not to post this myself when I realised you already had! I think you're right to post it though because while it might not technically be a tragedy, I always think of it as one.
