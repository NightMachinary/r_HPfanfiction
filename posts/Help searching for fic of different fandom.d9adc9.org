Does anyone know where I can find help looking for an Avengers fanfic?


** [[/r/FanFiction]] exists as a catch-all for any fandom. I haven't tried them but [[/r/avengers]] or [[/r/marvelfanfiction]] might have some guidance.

** I just wanted to make sure I didn't break any rules.

The tessaract opened a new portal this time from an alternate universe. In this universe the chitari won. A teenage girl who was the daughtet of Bruce Banner was sent through. Bruce was not the Hulk in the other universe.
