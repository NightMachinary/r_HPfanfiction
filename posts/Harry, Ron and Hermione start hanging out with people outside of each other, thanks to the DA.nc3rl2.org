Turns out, that Susan is crazy competitive when it comes to Quidditch, and that's why she doesn't play at school. But they end up having a mock Quidditch game.

Anthony Goldstein, Padma Patil and Hermione end up having debates about a whole lot of stuff. Often getting even some of the Hufflepuffs involved.

Neville also becomes better at talking to other people. Becoming better friends with Ginny, Luna and Hannah, as well as some other students, and offers to help people out in Herbology.

DA starts becoming more than just a place for Defence learning, people who are also good at other classes, offer to tutor students that need help in other classes to the point that Harry often isn't the main instructor in those lessons.

And Harry continues the DA, even after Umbridge is no longer the Professor. Once Umbridge is no longer a threat, he opens the DA for all years and all houses.


** I've always really liked this sort of idea. I know narratively it was easier for Harry to only have a few close friends but it seems strange that they are locked in a castle together for 9 months of the year and yet nobody seems to socialise outside of their established small groups.

** This prompt reminds me of yet another reason why I hate HBP with a burning passion.

You mean to tell me that, after a summer where Death Eaters move out into the open and start killing people, Harry just nopes the fuck out of bringing back the DA solely because Umbridge is gone? Your classmates' families are being murdered but apparently there's no point in learning how to defend yourself anymore. And that doesn't even begin to cover the fact that it was a perfect way to flesh out minor characters and expose Harry to new/different situations. But I guess we really needed five chapters of Won-Won instead.

*** i honestly just assumed that while the main reason they don't bring it back is because Umbridge is gone, the real reason they don't bring it back is because Harry just lost Sirius a year after watching Cedric die while also finding out about the prophecy and seeing his friends almost die at the hands of the death eaters and he feels like he's to blame so there's a lot of guilt there. Harry's also extremely paranoid (rightfully so) due to all of this death and trauma so taking up the job of leading the DA paired with all of the above and again Harry's own self doubt ^{(he spends a lot of time in the series feeling like he's not as good at defensive magic as people see him as}) after everything that happens in the Department of Mysteries Harry is not going to keep the club up. If anything he'll feel like if anything DOES happen to them that he wasn't good enough at teaching them and so it's his fault something happened to them. So on that front it makes sense but i still would have loved to see more flushing out of the minor characters but that would involve Harry trusting anyone outside of his immediate circle and let's be honest the way JK had written the series up until HBP there was only ever signs to him that his classmates were fickle and it was easy for them to turn against him so even if he likes them he wouldn't trust them or even know how to begin trusting them ^{(which could have made for a great character development but that would require more writing on JKs behalf so....we were DENIED!!!! lol})

**** See, your explanation makes a ton of sense and would fit well into Harry's character. It's a shame it never truly got conveyed in the books. Like, imagine Harry facing increasing pressure from Neville to reform the DA and Harry's torn between the prospective guilt of something happening to them and facing the stark reality that, really, everyone is in danger no matter what. Book Six felt like everyone stuck their heads in the sand when it came to the war outside the walls--hell, Ron and Hermione think Harry's a moron for being rightfully suspicious of Malfoy--and I would've loved to see the tension born from students realizing that they can't hide from it anymore.

***** i honestly think the reason that it's not explained in the books is 1. because poor writing ^{(listen i LOVE the series but i would be lying if i said that the author didn't do a piss poor job at developing these characters properly}) 2. because the author expected us as the reader ^{(for gods sake woman we were CHILDREN lol}) to pick up on these characteristics of Harry's ourselves which....NO we shouldn't have to piece this together years later when talking with other fans to realize this. Harry's guilt is a very consistent theme in the series so delving into that would have been amazing to read. I feel like book 6 is the best representation of how poorly written the characters are as a whole (by the author mind you) because that's the book where everything should start clicking together for people. Voldemort being back isn't a secret anymore the disappearances from and mysterious deaths from the previous book aren't that mysterious anymore. The attacks on muggles and magical folk alike have started up again hell Amelia Bones who is hailed by most in book 5 as being a fair and level headed and logic driven voice of reason if you will is murdered outright by Voldemort himself and she put up one hell of a fight! So him being back and that reality setting in for the students ^{(also students family members start dying too!}) would have been SOOO good to explore! I hate how it's implied that the reason they don't believe Harry in book 6 is because he was wrong about the Department of Mysteries situation. Like the nuance for that is gone because Harry was only susceptible to that manipulation because Dumbledore ^{(no shade to him for doing this because now that i'm older i also would have doubts about how open i would be with a 15 year old in a similar situation even if it was Harry}) wasn't open and honest with Harry about what was happening and why he needed to take occlumency but in book 6 Harry has the full picture now and while there are still a few things he doesn't know he's not in the same situation of not knowing the important things and info like in book 5. So them not trusting him only for him to turn around and be correct is so frustrating because aside from the DoM situation in book 5 Harry had a pretty good track record of having a hunch and being damn near spot on. But let me stop because i'm seriously ranting at this point LOL
