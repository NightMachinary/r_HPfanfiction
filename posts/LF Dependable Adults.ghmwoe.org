In canon, we could not see much of that. Wrong genre, teenage boy hero perspective etc., etc...

In fanfiction, there are more possibilities.

I'd like Fics in which adult matters are not left for children to handle, but any specks of responsibility and competence are welcome. I'd love any fic in which the Boy Who Lived is a curiosity, not a necessity and adult, fully educated and well compensated wizards resolve the pressing issues.

Examples of what I'm looking for would be, despite other traits of varying desirability, works like:linkffn(Weary Wizard by yunaine)linkffn(Public Safety by yunaine)

â€‹

Weary wizard in particular includes an amazing scene with Molly Weasley:

///"Mrs Weasley," Harry said, getting her attention. "Hermione and I were told by Sirius that a single passing grade in any

N.E.W.T. automatically registers as passing school ... and obtaining wand-rights."

Hermione summarised her piece of paper. "Exceeds Expectations in Defence, Acceptable in Charms and Transfiguration."

She swiped Harry's results. "The same for the first two, Poor in Transfiguration."

'We did it,' Harry thought, sharing a smile with Hermione.

"You -- You're not going to fight him, are you?" Mrs Weasley asked.

"The opposite, actually," Hermione said to Mrs Weasley's confusion.

"We're going after Sirius," Harry said. "We're leaving the country."

Before they could react, Mrs Weasley had both of them struggling in one of her famous hugs. "Thank Merlin."

"You're not going to stop us?" Harry asked. He needed to know how quickly they had to make their escape.

"For leaving a war?" Mrs Weasley asked. "I wished my own children were this smart. Children don't belong in wars; not now, not ever."

Harry and Hermione sagged in relief.

"Do you know when you'll leave? And could you let me know when you arrive someplace safe? Do you need any help?"

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Well you could try Potter's Protector by mjimeyg. It's a buffy crossover where Hogwarts brings Xander Harris to the HP universe to protect Harry. Now Harry is still involved because he's Harry but Xander and other adults try their best to limit his involvement. It is pretty angsty and Harry is more damaged from his time with the Dursleys.

linkffn(7665632)

Then you can also try Protecting Harry by Fairywm. It's a WIP that is a fanfic of a fanfic (Potter's Protector). Harry is less damaged and less angsty in this one. And the writer is taking things in slightly different directions but the basic premise is the same eg Hogwarts brings Xander Harris to help/protect Harry.

  The spirit of Hogwarts feels Harry needs protection. Dumbledore isn't doing a good enough job, so she calls on the only man she feels can get it right. Prophecies fear him, demons flee from him and Slayers love him. Enter Xander Harris. A fanfic of Potter's Protector, by mjimeyg. Now with Spike added. On Hiatus.
