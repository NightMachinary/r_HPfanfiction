** Yes, you're defective like that. Normal people are enraged by fluff.

** In the entire fandom, none exist who feel that way about fluff. It's only you.

** In a one-shot, maybe. It honestly depends on the writer/pairing/etc... But in an actual story, I dislike like constant fluff (mainly why I stray from Slash and Fem!Harry).

** Maybe as a small part of a much larger story... I'm more in it for the adventure and possible combat aspect of it all. I * *LOVE* * combat systems.

** What do you mean by fluffy bits? Fluff sounds like a good word (as I type this there is an ad for [[/r/aww][r/aww]] on the sidebar), and I like the sound of warm fuzzies.

Is it specific to Harry Potter fanfic? People with cute animagus forms transforming and doing silly things? McGonagall with a ball of yarn, anyone?

*** Fluff is the sweet/romantic/funny feel-good parts of fanfics that don't drive the plot at all. Not necessarily involving animagi or fluffy animals at all; well, Minnie the moggy with a ball of yarn /does/ qualify as fluff.
