From what I remember it was a semi-serious conversation between Dumbledore and Snape about separating Harry and his twin brother with Dumbledore explaining how everything made perfect sense.

I think the Dumbledore was a bit like the one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1115311][Wait, What?]]

Edit: Oh, and Harry was drawing pictures of the Dark Lord on the ground or something too, I think.
