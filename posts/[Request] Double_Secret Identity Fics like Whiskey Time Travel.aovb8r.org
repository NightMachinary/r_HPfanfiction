And one other fic. ( I remember that the author's username was Japanese sounding). Linkffn(Shards of Time by Shitshumeshi). Linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel)

Preferably, a GEN time travel fic and Harry's the one with the secret Identity.

In addition, the following:

- No good death eaters.
- No antimuggle sentiment.
- No pro-pureblood ideology.
- No dark Harry.
- No bashing of anyone.
- No Dumbledore bashing.

If a story is really good, I can waiver off the above.

However, these are the things I would never budge on.

- Harry/Malfoy
- Granger/Malfoy
- Harry/Severus
- Harry/Daphne
- Harry/Fleur
- Tom/Ginny
- Harry/Bellatrix
- Harry changing his name and the new name is used instead.
- First person POV.

I know I'm a bit picky. My apologies.

If you have any recs that's similar enough, though, please suggest.


** My story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief"'s main theme is Hermione's secret identity as a thief robbing the pureblood bigots who framed her for theft and got her expelled.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** linkffn(Wind Shear) probably counts? At one point Harry even lampshades that Storm Chaser is a stupid name.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
