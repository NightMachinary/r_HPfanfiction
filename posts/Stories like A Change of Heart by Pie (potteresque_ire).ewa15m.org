This story was finished more than ten years ago (2008) and I think its one the stories which should be more known.\\
Its well written in a fascinating way and I am not sure why it doesn't have more fans.

Anyway my question is, do you have some story which isn't well known but you really like it?\\
Thank you in advance.\\
P.s: I wan't sure which flair to use so I apologize if I used wrong one.
