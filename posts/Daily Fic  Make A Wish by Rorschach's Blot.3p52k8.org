The general premise of Make A Wish is that Harry learns the prophecy and interprets it as a death sentence. Instead having to be abused at the Dursley's, he goes around Europe under the pseudonym Mr. Black and many Forrest Gump-esque coincidences and events lead him through a comedic-journey of action and adventure.

**** The purpose I originally intended for Daily Fics is to introduce readers to fics that I or the community think are good. I think Daily Fics will also function well as an archive of sorts. I also wanted there to be discussion of the fic in the comments.

I wanted there to be reviews of the fanfic from other people in the Original Post but I didn't have time to reach out. If anyone wants me to PM them asking for reviews, be sure to reach out.

I agree with your assessment of Make A Wish as well. Forrest Gump was much better. There weren't many characters, and none of them were well developed. I did use a /5 rating system for the overall rating.

*** Sure, just as long as they all aren't as well known as this one. Everyone's heard of Make A Wish, and it's overrated and frankly slightly dull later on. How about something less widely known, such as HPMOR, or Harry Crow?

***** Yes, that was hilarious. generally, I liked it, but also it's overrated. it's a bad story, and at any point where it isn't trying to be funny successfuly, it stinks. When it succeeds, it's good, when it fails it's, at best, so bad it's good.

** I read this years ago. Was okay. Not good, but not as bad as it could have been. I almost skipped this one because of the *prophesy*. What's so difficult about the word prophecy?

Still, 3,5 out of 5 is way too much in my opinion. Should have been just 2.

I find favorites is by far the best, unless you want new ones. Follows or Reviews is affected far too much by number of chapters/slanted against Oneshots. Reviews can also be negative, see the "Prayers and Miracles" fic.
