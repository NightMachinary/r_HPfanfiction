*** That was really good. It could do with some editing for grammar and maybe a little clarity in the time skips, but it's not too confusing. Definitely going in my recommendation list for MoD.

** linkffn(6254783)

Basically Harry absorbs Tom Riddle's memories and parts of his personality after the horcrux is removed. So you get a charming, knowledge pursing Harry/Tom amalgamation who has a severe distrust of Dumbeldore and is even paranoid of his close friends.
