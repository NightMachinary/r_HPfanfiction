I am looking for the full version of the fanfiction The Price of Love, by RogueSugah, if anyone knows where to find it, that would be greatly appreciated.


** So I have a copy from The Quidditch Pitch that's about 8k shorter than the version on FFN, but it's labelled uncensored. I'm guessing that's the version you're after and the word count difference is maybe just author notes or other edits or something?

+Only problem is the formatting is a /mess/. Half the punctuation is replaced with question marks; I don't know if there was a problem during download (it's happened in the epub and the pdf) or if it was a problem when it was uploaded on TQP. In any case, the only fix is going to be going through it manually; there's too many problems to just find/replace them. As it's over 450k and I'm already trying to sort fics from TQP for my archive, I'm not inclined to read the lot and fix it myself right now. I might get around to it one day (maybe even this year) but certainly not any time soon.+

+*ETA:* I have converted the epub to rtf if someone wants it and is inclined to go through and sort out the formatting problems for themself.+

*18 Oct '16 Edit:* I've fully fixed all the formatting, and still accepting PMs from anyone who wants a copy.

*** Sure, I will take it, I read it long ago and would like to read again, and I do not mind the formatting, I can go over it myself of course (I would never expect you to do it because I want to read the fanfiction).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione & Ron spend the summer together, but the closer they get, the harder it becomes to share her secret plan even though she must. If love really is stronger than hate, as she believes, their feelings for each other may be enough to save them all.

**** Bummer! I suppose you could search the title in "quotes", author, and filetype:pdf or whatever format you can read it in (i.e., filetype:doc, filetype:ePub, filetype:txt etc)
