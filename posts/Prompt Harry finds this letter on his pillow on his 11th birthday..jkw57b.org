Letter found on Harry's pillow on his 11th Birthday

Son,

I'm writing this letter 2 months before you're due to be born, and I hope to be able to burn the letter in a couple of years and teach you what you need to know myself, however our family history suggests that may not be possible. You have grown up in, or are about to join, the magical world. As you have just reached the age where your magic stabilises, I need to tell you some things. The information in this letter cannot be shared with anyone else outside our family, and not even your father knows this information though he does know some of it as does every magical through fairy tales. I hope that by the end of the letter you understand why you can't talk about it to anyone that isn't related to my Great Grandfather by blood.

You may have noticed that there are no truly nocturnal magical creatures, even the owls sleep at night. This is because our world is not alone in space, rather it is accompanied by a myriad of other worlds that breach the aether every night during the witching hour. My great grandfather theorised that it was to equalise the magical pressure across the worlds, but what's important about this is that all magicals that are awake are carried along with this flow while their personal magic is active. What does this mean? Magic is active when it's being used, and while we are awake, we are always using magic.

This is because our magic only becomes quiescent once we sleep. I could never tell her, but once I found out about our family, I always envied my sister for her lack of magic, for her ability to go out all night and come home at dawn. The thing is that while you'd think that you could just power through and tough it out for an hour, magic doesn't work like that. Time is not linear, especially when magic is involved; and the further into the dream, our name for what happens, the more magical the worlds become and the less hospitable to our worlds life it becomes. Because of this it's possible to experience a lifetime in the dream, if you can survive that long. Once you spend any amount of time in the Magical world, you start to hear about the odd disappearance. It's always the same, someone disappears from their room at night and is never found again.

Why is all of this important to us? It's because of Great Grandfather. He was what is called a squib, that's someone that's magical, but not magical enough to use a wand. He considered himself to be somewhat of a scientist, and in 1895 he read about an experiment where dogs were prevented from sleeping. On the 23rd June he met your Great Grandmother during the experiment and managed to bring her home. They had 4 children together, your Grandmother Trudy was the youngest and a miracle child born in 1918, Twins Simon & Fredrick were born in 1899, and Susan born in 1903 were her siblings.

Simon and Fredrick were both conscripted during the 1st world war and disappeared some time during a sustained bombardment in 1916. They were marked as AWOL, though their companions claimed they just disappeared in front of them during the night, but the doctors said they were just suffering from shellshock.

Susan married and had one child at the age of 20 in 1923, but she disappeared from the marriage bed with her baby 8 months after it was born. Your Grandmother married late in life to a doctor she met at the tail end of world war 2. I was born in 1959. My Mother died in childbirth, and your Grandfather remarried and had Tunie. Because of your Great Grandmother, our magic doesn't automatically become quiescent when we sleep, rather we need to feel safe and unthreatened.

As children this isn't a problem as our magic isn't developed enough to be active except under stress, however you are now old enough that you need to learn how to feel your magic and then learn how to coax it into quintessence even when you're stressed. I've asked your Father to give you my journal, it's blood locked to my line so only you or your children will be able to open it. If for some reason he is unable to give it to you, get a book on Meditation that doesn't use a breathing technique, or a book on Occulumancy and don't move on from calming your mind until you've found your magic. You should then be able to learn how to make your magic quiescent.

From your loving Mother

Lily Potter.

***** I'm in my 40's, but I read the hobbit before senior school and was reading adult fiction like the Amtrack wars then too (My dad had them on the shelf). So I was thinking that Lily was probably a reader like that, so she thought she'd written something that she'd have been able to understand as a child.

** Harry awoke to the sound of crinkling under his head. Rubbing his eyes he sits up careful not to bang his head on the steps above him and reaches for the wooden beam he keeps his glasses on while he sleeps.

In the darkness his hands fumble against the bare pillow that the Dursely's have provided him. "Paper?" he thinks to himself as his hands find the small envelope that somehow appeared between his head and the singular comfort his keepers allow him.

It is dark, but Harry knows from experience that if he holds the paper up near the slats in his door just enough light will filter in that he can make out exactly what it is. "A letter?" he whispers to no one. His fingers fumble with the wax seal. As he detaches it from the paper the envelope melts away before his eyes leaving just the contents, 2 pages of paper, in his hands.

Harry was never good at reading. He learned at a young age that academic success only brought him more trouble at home, but he wanted to solve this mystery so he forged on.

Harry didn't really understand what the letter was trying to say. Words that held no meaning for him filled the page and swam before his eyes taunting him.

MOTHER

FATHER

LOVE

MAGIC

QUIESCENT

MAGIC!! Magic was bad. That at least Harry knew. Vernon had made that clear to him on more than one occasion. A soft whisper broke the silence that had over come him "I can't be magic".

Harry didn't understand. Was this a joke? No it couldn't be. No one in the house cared enough about him to put in this much effort just to scare him. It was much easier to just beat him.

So was it real then?

Harry's breathing started to quicken. "No" he whispered again, the words slipping out as his mind ran wild. "No, I don't have a family no one loves me. I am just a freak. I'm a freak. I'm a freak. I'm a freak..."

.

.

.

Vernon woke to a frantic scream from his dear Petunia. With a quickness of a lumbering walrus he plodded downstairs. "What has the freak don..." he began before seeing his wife sitting on the sofa clutching a letter crying happy tears. "Petunia my flower, what's the good news?" he corrected, his initial panic somewhat abated.

"He's gone Vernon" Petunia laughed.

And Harry was never seen again.

*** I presume that the letter appeared at midnight on the morning of his birthday, and so he was so scared that he couldn't get back to sleep during the witching hour.

**** That was roughly the intent.

As other comments have said your letter is very dense. It would take quite awhile for an 11 year old who has poor (at best) reading skills to get through it using only the small amount of light in the under-stair cupboard. He would not understand much of what is being said, and I can't imagine that he would be able to process it in a calm manner. It is a letter telling him that his is in fact everything that he was abused for being. It is conformation that his is a freak from his own mother. His mother that is by her own words envious of her sister, his aunt. Maybe his aunt was right to call him a freak. It would be too much for him to handle. His last bit of hope that he was holding on to evaporates before his eyes just like the envelope did. As the panic attack sets in and he wonders why someone would be so cruel as to send him this letter he is pulled from this world never to be seen again.

**** There is an alternative version of this story where Petunia knows that this phenomenon is something that happens. Instead of putting him to bed on his birthday she decides that they should for once celebrate and the whole family goes out to the midnight release of a film that was being advertised on the TV. Harry is ecstatic, maybe things are looking up for him...

They drive into town Petunia telling Harry that the only reason they are doing this was that Dudley wanted to see the movie and they didn't feel right leaving him home alone. What would the neighbors say? The movie lets out at 2:30 and a tired Harry falls asleep on the car ride home. Harry feels the car come to a stop, he wakes up the clock says 2:59 and he hears Vernon from outside the open door to his left gruffly saying "Boy get out of the car we are here". Half awake Harry stumbles out of the car and on to "gravel?" There is no gravel at number 4 harry thinks as he hears two doors slam and the sound of tires peeling out. As the shock of what is happening sets in on him the bleariness leaves his eyes and Harry realizes he has been abandoned on the side of the road in the middle of the night. Harry begins to cry.

Dudley confused watches out the back window as they pull away from his cousin. He does not like Harry, but even he thinks leaving him on the side of the road this late at night is a bit much.

The clock ticks over to 3am. Dudley rubs his eyes in confusion. One second Harry was there standing below a streetlight next to the roadway bawling his eyes out for the world to see, and now nothing is there. It is like Harry never existed at all.

The next morning as petunia goes to clean out the cupboard she finds a letter sitting in the middle of Harry's mattress.
