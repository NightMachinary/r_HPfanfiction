I was wondering about the Weasleys place in the Order of the Phoenix. We know that the parents both are member during the 2nd blood war, and that the family had at least ties to it during the first (with the 2 brothers of Molly being member), even if it's not confirmed they were members (they are not in the picture showed to Harry right?)

So my question is, would the Weasley be as heavily implied in the Order if one of their son was not best friend with Harry?

In the event Harry was not Gryffindor (let say Slytherin to be really far), would the Weasley fight for him? I guess the death of Ginny (if she dies at the end of CoS) may be a good enough reason to join, for revenge. But if she survives, would someone tell them about Sirius Black so they join Square Grimmault and (more importantly) would Arthur Weasley still be a guard in fron of the DoM the night Nagini attacks?


** It's an interesting question. The Weasley's have close ties with Dumbledore, which is why they joined. It wasn't so much 'fighting for Harry' as you put it. I think its reasonable they wouldn't be so heavily invested without their ties to Harry. Probably Arthur still would be a member, especially as his place in the ministry is helpful to the organization. Also without being close to Harry they wouldn't have felt it necessary to live in Grimmauld.

** On a somewhat related note, why exactly are the Weasleys and Hermione at Grimmauld Place at the start of Ootp?

*** I don't think it's ever explained (except maybe on Twitter . . .), and plot reason aside, I would guess because it's convenient :

- Since Voldemort is back, and is out for Harry, his friends might be at risk (at this point they didn't know if he would stay low or try something like killing everyone dear for Harry), Grimmauld is the safest place possible for them.
- While Sirius might have lent the house to serve as a Headquarter, he is still stuck inside, having someone stay with him may help him and reduce the chance of him doing something stupid like going to Privet Drive.
- The house need to be cleaned, it gives the kids something to do rather than being worried.
- The members may (for most of them) not know about Harry's protection, but they knew he would come there. If they have to wait for him, might as well do it there (also with this Harry doesn't have to choose between going with his Godfather or surrogate family).

That doesn't explain the kids being there before Harry.

The chosen method was barely better than what penal battalions did when ordered to clear minefields. No one even wore latex gloves, nevermind something which would protect you from curses like the one on Malfoy's necklace. And they were doing the whole thing without magic. Honstely, child endangerment doesn't fit here as much as throwing their lives away.

Most Order members actually have jobs. Only Lupin, Sirius and Molly are unemployed as far as we know. They have lives outside of the Order.

That's sort of a running theme throughout the entire series. "Hey, there's a horrible monster running around the forest full of already deadly creatures killing unicorns. Let's send the guy who isn't allowed to use magic, his dog, and three 11 year olds to investigate. Children are inherently expendable, right?"

****** Yes, but Grimmauld and the midnight detention are the only situations where adults willingly put children in danger as opposed to simply being neglecting.

***** I'm of two minds about Order of the Phoenix. The themes were fantastic. The Government being in denial, the attempted assassination, the torture, covert warfare, and the implied bribery and corruption are all interesting and the atmosphere of the book is astounding.

On the other hand, the adults are possibly the stupidest people in the books. They make every wrong decision, from information embargos on very online involved children to almost wilfully ignoring abuse of children.

I feel like Hermione and the Weasleys were brought because of safety issues foremost, but having the information embargo on Harry was a secondary idea.

Harry is forced to pick up all the slack, with a media release and teaching DADA in his spare time during his OWL year, with a teacher occupying Harry's free time by torturing him. All the pressure on a 15 year old boy who has to prepare for OWLs.

For all the in book complaints about Sirius, he was probably the most responsible adult. He wanted Harry safe, informed, and happy. He gave a gift that would have made for easy communication.

The book would have much improved with a more assertive Harry. Not indy lord potter crap, but like-minded treatment. Harry gets ignored by his friends (platitudes don't count), he ignores them for a similar period. He gets press-ganged into teaching large chunks of the school, he calls back to previous years. McGonagall tells him to put this head down, he brings up the literal torture he's undergoing.

Harry has no choices during this book. He's kept in isolation, probably longer than is strictly necessary. He is denied his rightful badge, he's tortured for standing up for himself, and he's forced to have Occulumency lessons with Snape. The fact he maintained decent grades was a miracle. I doubt anyone else could have done the same.

Don't get me wrong. I don't want bashing (Snape doesn't count, he's not really a good guy), but for Harry and friends to start questioning Dumbledore's decisions more. Because that theme was perfectly ignored the next book. Hermione regressed in maturity and Harry did everything Dumbledore said without question.

**** Maybe. I think the first and third possibilities are the least likely. At the time, Voldie was trying hard to keep his return under wraps. Its hard to imagine him raiding the Burrow, especially while his best commanders were in Azkaban. And the Weasleys are at home during the actual war, so their security was likely no concern during Ootp. As for Hermione, well her abandoning her muggle parents to Death Eaters is just on a whole new level of messed up. And the cleaning, Kreacher would have obeyed any commands Sirius gave, no matter how much he would have whined about it. And I think they were not using magic during cleaning, if im not mistaking? That seems so off.

I guess the last option is most likely, though I get the feeling there was some kind of ploy at work there. Though that very well be because of how much manipulative!Dumbledore fics I have been on.
