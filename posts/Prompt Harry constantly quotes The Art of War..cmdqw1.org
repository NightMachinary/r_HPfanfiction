I can just imagine a scene of Harry listening in on The Order of the Phoenix discussing tactics before interrupting and quoting the Art of War.

#+begin_quote
  The spell that should have killed sent its victim to a world where man bound machines to their will. Warcasters commanded and warjacks obeyed, and the Fates that had meant for the boy to carry a burden found instead a girl who stared at them beside the empty crib of her twin. Fifteen years have passed and the Dark Lord has returned. The Light must have a champion, but who?
