Just curious if there are any fics where this happens.

They all start right next to each other at the same time and I don't think it was ever mentioned that they couldn't fight/sabotage each other. It seems like a solid strategy to stun the other three and levitate them back onto the platform, guaranteeing that he'd get the best score on that task.


** I can see this working in one of those rebellious Harry fics. I can imagine him finding a way to win the task by bending the rules as much as possible just to screw with everyone.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
