Pretty self-explanatory... fics where Harry has a sibling (twin, older, younger, whatever) and, on that fateful Halloween, Dumbledore in all his glory did a quick examination and without any evidence to support him declared that sibling to be "The child who lived!"

A result of this could be;

Harry is neglected/abandoned by his living parents either because Dumbledore hit them with a compulsion/loyalty whammy and says that "Harry is a squib/Harry will be jealous/Harry is useless/Harry will get in the way/etc" leading to Harry either ending up in an orphanage or still raised by the magic-hating Dursleys.

Harry was simply given up because Dumbledore used his silver-tongue to convince the Potters that "Harry will forgive you when you collect him in time for Hogwarts, he'll understand that you needed to focus on his sibling who was much more important than him, and it is for the greater good".

The Potters are rather greedy and decide "We care about fame and money and Harry isn't giving us either so let the house elves deal with him/get rid of him because we don't care about him!".

Preferably this doesn't lead to him bowing to the Dark Lord and kissing the hem of his robes saying "Yes, my Lord!". He becomes strong in spite of them not dark because of them.

Optional Bonus points:

Harry is a girl and the reason her sibling was declared the boy who lived is because Dumbledore didn't believe a girl could ever be the "Chosen One" of prophecy.

And/Or; Voldemort knows who the true child who lived is and takes great pleasure in revealing this fact when he's revived so that everybody knows.

And/Or; Harry has multiple inheritances/titles outside of the Potter line allowing for him to be potentially disowned leading to regret from potential greedy parents/Dumbledore when Harry claims those inheritances.

â€‹

Of course most of this post after the first paragraph is just "could be"s and "what if"s and "optional"s. It doesn't have to go any of these ways just good wrong child who lived fics.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) has a Harry who was thought to be a squib so he's sent to live with the Dursleys and then is ignored by his family after he's sorted into Slytherin.

Antithesis linkffn(12021325) this is a Harry who's neglected by his family in favour of his brother until he's sent to the Dursleys. This story does feature a "dark Harry" but in my opinion it's one of the more well done ones and I really liked it. Fair warning, this story does get fairly dark, tone wise, at times.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
