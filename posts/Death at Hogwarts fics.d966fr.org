Hi, I'm looking for fics where Harry's homelife is discussed/discovered after another student died of abuse at the time (like in "digging through the bones").

Any that you come up with?


** Linkffn(Bowling for Hogwarts) deals with the aftermath of a student's rampage due to incessant bullying in fifth year.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

** But of shameless self-promotion here, my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001435][Phantom]] has a string of student murders around Hogwarts. It's a Haphne mystery thriller, the downside is I admittedly haven't updated in a while, but do plan to get back to it

Edit: Read title without reading description and realised it's not exactly what you're asking for, but I'll keep the link there all the same

** I saw Death at Hogwarts and got excited at the prospect of Death from the Discworld series popping up every time Harry almost dies. But alas.
