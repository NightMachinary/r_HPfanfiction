* He Was Responsible For Sirius' Death

*Not only did he ruin Harry's life, he ruined Sirius'. He ruined Sirius in the worst way possible, and was definitely responsible for Sirius' death.*

Look. Harry might blame himself for this one because Sirius was rushing to save him, but what was Dumbledore thinking when he made Sirius stay in the home that he was neglected in and probably abused in for his entire childhood? The Black family were not good people. They were insane blood supremacists. /Sirius ended up being murdered by his own cousin./ And yet, here's Dumbledore, thinking it's okay to lock him up in that house 24/7. Did he seriously believe that it wouldn't drive him to do anything rash or self-destructive? Do you /know/ Sirius, Dumbledore?!

We are told over and over again how intelligent Dumbledore is. I mean the man even knew Ron so well that he gave him the Deluminator. How tf doesn't he know Sirius enough to deduce that he overact and act impulsively?

** He Lets Dangerous Things Happen At Hogwarts

   :END:
*Dumbledore doesn't seem to give a sh*t that his school is overrun by dangerous things or the fact that students can pull pranks that could kill their peers.* He actually lets a detention happen IN the forbidden forest... at night. Um, what?! And this isn't all. Hogwarts repeatedly proves itself to be an excessively dangerous place, with Dumbledore doing absolutely nothing to protect the students. At one point, there are Dementors around it. Yes, he's furious, but he doesn't seem to have argued against it particularly hard... And all of this combined makes it seem like Dumbledore doesn't really care too much for the welfare of his students.

** He Kept The Elder Wand
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: he-kept-the-elder-wand
   :END:
When Harry gets the Elder Wand, he does the right thing. *To prevent more bloodshed and more people who are desperate to get their hands on it, he snaps it. Good on you, Harry! Someone had to do it.*

But why didn't Dumbledore?

Because of Dumbledore, Voldemort ended up with his hands on it. It all worked out in the end, but Dumbledore couldn't have known it would come to that for all the decades that he held onto that wand. He would have done so many people a favor in the past if he'd had the guts to snap it; but he didn't because on some level, he wanted the power.

This goes back to him once having the ideology that magic trumps all else. You were shady, Dumbledore. You were shady /at best./

** He Handled Harry's Pseudo-Possession Poorly
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: he-handled-harrys-pseudo-possession-poorly
   :END:
Not only did he lie to Harry -- he actively kept him in the dark when Harry might have been starting to catch on because he was /literally being possessed/ by Lord Voldemort/./ Well, kind of. Voldemort was edging his way into Harry's head and pretty much making him crazy. He was influencing Harry's emotions to be more like his own, making him angry and spiteful, turning his entire world dark -- and *how did Dumbledore handle this? By ignoring Harry and letting him spiral because he was worried Voldemort would try and get to* */him/* *through Harry.*

This was seriously selfish AF. Dumbledore might try and say he had Harry's best intentions at heart, but considering how broken and angsty Harry was in book five, I'm not convinced.

** He Employed Snape And Refused To Hear Anything Bad About Hi
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: he-employed-snape-and-refused-to-hear-anything-bad-about-hi
   :END:
As someone who is in Snape's corner myself, I still had to bring this one up.

Snape was a terrible, and abusive teacher. He crushed Neville's confidence repeatedly. He made fun of Hermione for being smart. He unfairly picked on Harry for reasons we didn't find out until book seven. And yet, he was fine to his own students in Slytherin, even favoring them often*.* He was absolutely terrible, and to let him teach in Hogwarts for all those years knowing just how spiteful he could be was nothing short of unforgivable.

* He Swipes Snape's Attempted Murder Under The Rug
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: he-swipes-snapes-attempted-murder-under-the-rug
  :END:
â€‹

Despite the fact that Sirius' prank, could have potentially lead to the death of a student, and the expulsion or imprisonment of another. Dumbledore doesn't suspend or dock points from Sirius. All he does is scold Sirius and pat James for "saving" Snape.


** The whole plot was really convoluted - assuming all people are at the same skill level as in the original series (no cheats, no magic enhancing runes, no goblin deus ex machina), how would you have handled the situation?

Sirius was a wanted murderer for what all the magical world knew and he wanted to be close to Harry. That was the best option and Sirius accepted it until Harry was in danger.

The whole Hogwarts thing being dangerous is, realistically, to keep the plot going. In-universe it could be justified by Dumbledore not really having absolute power over Hogwarts due to the governors or whatever but I see your point.

Harry only snaps the Elder Wand in the movies. In the books, Dumbledore specifically says that he was doomed to possess the worst of the Hallows to make sure that no one else ever will use it to harm others. At the end of DH Harry puts it back in Dumbledore's grave.

The way I excuse Dumbledore's behavior in OotP is that he was working out the Horcruxes. If Voldemort found out it was all for nothing. That's why he has Snape teach Harry Occlumency instead of himself. So once Harry masters it, he could reveal the contents of the prophecy and his Horcrux theory. His mistake is he underestimates Harry's and Snape's hate for each other and eventually the conflict is resolved by Voldemort possessing Harry and finding out he is scared of Harry's love. I don't think it was handled the best way but he is only human and he did whatever he thought was best.

Snape was a troubled character but he was one of the best aces in his sleeve that Dumbledore had against Voldemort. By being employed at Hogwarts, Snape was both of value to Voldemort and in proximity of Dumbledore to report the former's actions. Also, as a general rule... talking shit about a professor in front of another professor will never be well received.

Not much detail is given actually about the whole incident. Not in the series anyways... Many things could have happened including the fact that nor the Marauders nor Snape nor Lily spoke to anyone else about the incident until disciplinary action could no longer be taken.

** Dumbledore was arrogant, inconsiderate, and high-handed in OotP, but Sirius was an adult of thirty-six(36) years old who laughed while dueling Bellatrix Lestrange. Sirius ruined Sirius' life as he made his own bad choices.

When it comes to Dumbledore and Sirius it seems some believe the former should've given the latter tasks to behave. And all I can think is: this is what we do for children under ten.

Do you think Dumbledore combs through every detention? For the life of me I don't understand why the deputy-headmistress who sent them out there is rarely blamed. As for the dementors, Hogwarts is a state school and we are shown repeatedly the Minister can do whatever he wants there.

** Sirius is an adult, Dumbledore told him that staying inside the house was the right choice, Sirius disregarded this. Sirius /chose/ to leave.

** I can agree with you about Dumbledore's treatment of Sirius, although I have more issues with him letting Sirius be sent to Azkaban without a trial and without even a short conversation with him. Sirius was in the Order, and I think even if Dumbledore believed he was the traitor, he should have at least make sure that's the case. Weird shit was happening during the war, and I can't understand why he gave Snape a chance to speak for himself, but he didn't find a few minutes to talk to Sirius before the man was shipped off to Azkaban.

As for keeping Sirius locked at Grimmauld Place, I find I'm more pissed at him for not giving Sirius something to do there except for cleaning. At that point, Grimmauld Place was the most secure place in England, and Sirius was a wanted man. It's not like Dumbledore could have let him wander around, but he should have known it's best to keep Sirius busy.

As for the rest of the things you listed, he let dangerous things happen at Hogwarts, but I feel like wizards are more relaxed about dangers, which is no wonder when they have no problems with healing so many serious injuries.

Harry snapped the elder wand in the movies. In the books, he put it in Dumbledore's grave, so for all we know, the next dark wizard can steal it again, and as long as Harry is alive and he defeats him, the elder wand will work for him.

He explained why he handled Harry's connection to Voldemort that way, and while in the end, it was not the best course, I can accept his explanation. He was only human after all.

With Snape, I guess he has to keep him at Hogwarts so Snape would be valuable to Voldemort, but I always wondered why he didn't force Snape into being nicer? I guess I don't think a spy who's hated by everyone would be a good spy. If I had to find an excuse for this, I would say he didn't want to force Snape into doing more than he had to. When Snape came to Dumbledore and asked him to protect Lily, Dumbledore wanted something in return, and he exploited Snape's promise very well, so maybe he didn't want to force Snape into pretending he's someone else? Or maybe he knew Snape wouldn't be able to pull it off.

As for the Prank, I guess I don't see it as attempted murder. I think Sirius was stupid and reckless and didn't think it through when he told Snape about the whooping willow, but Snape was obsessed with Remus' secret, and it's not like Sirius pushed him into the tunnel. It was Snape going there willingly, acting on words of someone who hated him, and probably breaking school rules as he did so.

** There's a lot, so let me handle this Chronologically.

1) He let Grindelwald run rampant all across Europe for years, only getting involved when he was practically begged to do something. And even then, I think he got involved solely because the Elder Wand was involved. Of course he was gonna keep the wand afterwards, can't risk someone else stumbling upon it and becoming MoD.

2) It's entirely possible Dumbledore atributes the Dangerous crap at Hogwarts as part of Riddles DADA Curse. I mean, more often than not, the danger during Harry's time involves(or takes care of) that teacher, so it's possible Dumbledore connected the two at some point. That still doesn't excuse him seemingly doing nothing about it. Curse breakers exist for a reason.

3) The Shrieking Shack incident was swept under the Rug because Dumbledore didn't want his werewolf Spy experiment to fail. Had Snape Killed Lupin, you bet he would get expelled inmediately for 'killing a fellow student unprovoked' or something along those lines. If Lupin bites Severus, then Lupin gets killed or sent to Azkaban, and Snape becomes the future Spy. Since neither happened, under the rug the incident went.

4) Hiring Snape was more a means to an end than anything else. Dumbledore Knew Riddle wasn't dead, if not How. So keeping his double Spy close was Paramount for when Riddle decided to show his face again. Can't risk said Double Spy to do something idiotic like commit Suicide, or move to another country(or continent for that matter). So off to Hogwarts Snape went, while Dumbledore did(or ignored) everything possible to keep him there. No, the fact that Snape was a TERRIBLE teacher means nothing to Dubledore, keeping him close and available was far more important in Dumbledore's mind.

5) Dumbledore put the entire Hogwarts population in danger on Purpose just so he could test Harry in 1991. There was no other reason whatsoever for those 'defences' being what they were. He even drops a hint about Fluffy during the welcoming Feast(not that Harry noticed) and explains to Harry how the Mirror works later, again, on purpose.

6) When it comes to Harry's Link to Riddle, Dumbledore had been keeping Harry in the Dark about pretty much everything up until that point. Why chaange now? He wasn't about to tell the kid he was a Horcrux. The only reason we got that rather lengthy conversation at the end of OotP was Dumbledore noticed Harry was very close to the breaking point. Quite close to calling it quits for good. So he had to say something to stop that from happening. It had nothing to do with caring for Harry.

7) Dumbledore wasn't directly responsible for Sirius dying no. But he did make the mistake of not considering what his time in Azkaban had done. 12 years + a year on the run as a dog eating whatever he could scrap together, and to add insult to injury he then has to go to a different kind of prison. I'm actually surprised Sirius was functional at all.

So no, Albus Dumbledore is not a good Person. He's a very arrogant selfish asshole. Oh and Collateral Damage is perfectly acceptable to him, no matter how big.
