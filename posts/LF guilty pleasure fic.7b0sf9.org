I like to indulge in OP!Harry silliness from time to time >_< I remember reading a fic in which Harry had had a magical accident, causing his wands to be encased inside his forearms. When Aurors attempt to arrest him with magic suppressing cuffs, a feedback loop is created which nearly blows him up. Anyone recognise where this is from?

*** Hey, if someone disagrees with you on the internet, what else are you supposed to do except delete any evidence that you were ever involved?

I don't know about everything in your original post, but I do know that the wands-inside-forearms thing exists in linkffn(Harry Potter, Geth), though I'm not sure if that's the one that you're looking for.

** linkffn(5142565) fits the bill.

Harry is older, not the boy who lived, is good at everything, hooks up with fleur etc. It should be an awful fic, but I always enjoy every single read. For the life of me, I can't tell you why.

** linkffn(Core Threads), I suppose? I love it to bits. Don't know to what extent it's genuinely good and to what extent it's a guilty pleasure fic --- if the latter, it's certainly very self-aware of it.

*** Core Threads, and Taylor Varga of the /Worm/ fandom, only work as stories because they:

1. Are absurd
2. Know that they are absurd
3. Revel in the fact that they are absurd
4. Give no fucks about logic so long as the end result is fun.

If you try to apply "sanity" or "reasonable outcomes" to God!Harry or DemonLizard!Taylor, the story would collapse under its own weight and cease being fun.

Also, both fics are very long with only a tenuous grasp of pacing (376K for Core Threads, *1.3M* for Taylor Varga) because the above conditions allow the authors to churn out as much content as they want without getting bogged down in boring bits, nor having to worry about a set ending.

** Linkffn(Too Young to Die)

I have no idea why I love this fic so much. There's so many things wrong with it- Harry's brother is the boy who lived, neglectful James and Lily, Edgy!Harry-in-name-only, Harry tries to fuck pretty much every girl he meets...

And yet it's just so fun to read. Harry becoming a drug addict, breaking into a drug cartels warehouse to steal shit and getting into a melee a trois with the Brazilian Ministry of Magic and the Drug Cartel, and the entire final battle at Hogwarts (ESPECIALLY the confrontation at the very end).

It's not necessarily a well written fic, but goddamn it is fun to read.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
