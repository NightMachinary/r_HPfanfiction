I've seen alot of fan fics, specifically lord harry fics where Harry has access to ancient family magic that gives him some weird batshit crazy powers. The family magic links everyone in the family together, you can make someone a squib with the family magic, the family magic forces you to obey the patriarch or matriarch of the family, the family magic gets stronger each generation...etc

It's stupid and validates pureblood agendas, sure the authors can use the excuse of "well muggleborns help make it strong too" but unless said Muggleborns are adopted into the family they don't get access to the super power magic juice, they just get normal magic...

I'm fine with family spells, spells and potions passed down through generations, that makes sense. Their was one fic where Rons family used to be famous for their fertility spells and potions while Harry's was known for making some of the best home protection wards and spells on the market (and then breaking into them to get the clients they helped to come back for more)

That's what family magic should be, not some Phoenix Force sentient bullshit

Edit: To elaborate a bit further, most authors seem to write family magic as a cool power up, and ignore the world building implications of it and also ignore it when the plot demands it.

If their was more consistent ideas written about family magic it'd be fine, like say when you swear an oath to someone it's not "magic' as a concept that enforces the oath it's the person you are swearing said oath to's magic that does so.

You could also make certain spells like the Fidellus reliant on family magic etc.

instead most authors use it as a kill switch, "Voldemort used potter blood, he's now a potter, he attacked the patriarch of the potters, he is kill." and then the potter family magic finds and kills him and all his horcruxes.

It's things like that that irritate me, that and the lack of proper world building around it, but the latter is alot more ignorable for me than the former.

** ... Parseltongue is canon family magic, though? Another example for me is Harry's patronus being so similar to his parents'. Whether inherently in the blood or a subconscious desire to be closer to their family, someone's magic (perhaps as an extension of their personal identity) is influenced by their family. A muggleborn's magic would also be influenced by their family, but their family is nonmagical so the effects could perhaps be more subtle. For example, Hermione being drawn to more structured magical arts could be due to her parents' careers.

It could be a combination of natural predisposition and a body of knowledge passed down from previous generations.

I actually think it has a lot of creative potential, but I wish more writers would treat that kind of magic like canon does.

***** Yeah I agree. Metamorphmagi, Potter's' weird hair-growing ability, Parseltongue, etc are neat examples of magical abilities passed down genetically, but from a single "mutation" in their family line from a magical ancestor.

Kind of like their magic has a very specific quirk which operates 100% of the time all the time. It's code, in a sense: "If hair != x then HarryHair(1);" or whatever. Maybe magical peoples have some weird DNA editing ribosomes that, in certain families, prefer to turn DNA into proteins that just go bonkers and give these unique qualities. People think magic is dying out but it's really just a case of people being more concerned with maintaining the status quo, being safe, raising families, having opportunities, etc rather than embarking on crazy experiments or massive ritualistic community projects that reshape the entire landscape.

This kind of ties into how magical the world "used" to be in the times of Merlin and the Founders etc, which I like to just chalk down to people being far more patient and less reliant on wands. They got shit done because they decided to do a project and everyone committed. Need to seclude a district in London from the Muggles? Yeah, I agree, let's all work together to hide it with runestones and come up with a plan and some rituals etc. People just had patience whereas now everything is mastery of wand work (a prevalence I'd attribute to the Tales of Beedle the Bard) and so all that old magic shit just seems really "powerful" when it was just the way things worked in the past.

***** That's the point, though. Having superior abilities that are passed down through the generations means the pureblood fanatics and bigots are actually right. If you nerf it through time, they're even more right, since obviously muggle blood has diluted it.

The exact opposite is true in canon - Andromeda black, the first one to have a child with a muggleborn in generations, has a child who is also the first metamorph in generations. That metamorph's child is even more powerful than she is.

While that would be an example of "family magic", it's not as all-encompassing as family magic or what you described tends to be. For instance, I bet a skilled wizard could pull off the same trick, and essentially "learn" to be a metamorph through a few years of training, until they can basically wandlessly transfigure their own body. This is even better than being a natural metamorph, because all that practise will mean you're going to become a master at transfiguration in the process.

****** yea but it could be played upon. for example some family having the ability to mind read. someone was like well eff them and their spying I'll just figure out how to do it too. so they create legillimens (sorry I don't know spelling) and teach people so the family isn't unique any longer. maybe there's some family that were natural animagus (ie an equivalent of metamorph). someone said that's so cool I wanna do it, and dedicated their entire lives to creating the spell/potion wtvr to replicate it. this now shows purebloods are wrong they aren't special or unique anymore. with hardwork and dedication you could get the exact same "unique" trait and make it so anyone gets it. In fact maybe because of this the family lost all notoriety and now nobody knows of the family. just lost to history because someone did it better. sort of like someone creating a cheaper easier alternative to big pharmacy company expensive drugs but the magic equivalent.

a kind of eff you to the purebloods. you think you're so cool because only your family can talk to snakes? well I just created a spell that allows me to talk to all reptiles not just snakes. and if you consider Grimoire and how those are often the written down accounts of spells and potions etcetera it's just someone figuring out that without having the recipe. Fullmetal alchemist's alchemy would be a way to sort or run with it I think.

** Having Family Magic dosent have to be all upsides, The advantage of Being a Muggleborn is that you are a Blank slate and can learn any magic you want. Were as a person with Family magic might have more difficulty learning magic outside of their Familys magical affinities.

Think of the magic like a Bit of cloth the Muggelborn start out with a Clean bit of cloth outside of a few Drop of colour from were their accidental magic started to dye it.

Were as a someone with Family magic gets a Cloth that is partially or almost completely pre Dyed. and the Older/Stronger the Family magic the Stronger the Dye and the more of the cloth is pre dyed and the harder it is to Overright it its.

** I remember the Santi's HP and the Boy Who Lived had a pretty interesting take on Family Magic.

Rather than it being just a specific set of spells that only a certain family could do, it was that certain families had predispositions to certain types of magic, but they also had certain types of aversions to other types of magic. So certain families that were really good with transfiguration would marry into other families with good transfiguration predispositions so that their kids could do amazing things in transfiguration, but at the cost of having their kids being practically useless in charms.

The muggleborns were like the true neutral of magicals, no real predispositions towards or against certain magic types, so they could never really excel at a particular field, but they could also be well rounded magicals unlike the pureblood families who decided to specialize. A system of family magic like that could reinforce both the idea of pureblood supremacy to those who were trying to have their families specialize in certain fields, but also the idea that all of those specialized families would eventually be seriously inbred.

** I'm not a fan of family magic either. However, there may be a kernel of canon truth to it. Some of these families have been around a long time, dabbled in all sort of magics, accumulated books and artefacts, know of magical places probably only they can access.

And it is canon that certain magical traits are hereditary. It is likely that some families would marry strategically to chance the most powerful and gifted offspring.

In that sense yes - "family magic" makes sense. However I'd like to see well built premise and reasoned backstory. Not because magic simply chose or otherwise sanctified one family over the other.

** Of course Family Magic and Lordship does credit the pureblood agenda it is only logical. The only bad side of the pureblood agenda is genocide in this case. But if there is equality without Lordship and family magic the pureblood agenda has only the statute of secrecy preservation as valid point and the inherent consequences for Mudbloods that create a delay in their education from those raised in the magical world. Yes Hermione is a counter example but she is just that an exception towards a general rule. But if there is the elements of Family Magic and Lordship the pureblood have more valid points that their counterparts. That is why the middle ground in this case would be to raise all magical children in the magical world without exception. And create a way for the Muggleborns to gain in social status maybe some new patents of nobility ?

*** It's not that it doesn't agree with my ideals, it's the fact that in most fics where this is featured the entire Family Magic system is basically built around it growing in power as it's family does. And instead of doing something cool with it like say, making the pureblood fanaticism come from them misunderstanding how family magic works, which in this case would be it growing stronger over the generations with each new magical added to said family. They misunderstand it as "If we keep it in our bloodline it gets stronger and those darn muggles can't steal it from us"

their are many ways to keep it interesting and do the idea well, but most authors use it as again, a power up or phoenix force style bullshit where it has it's own mind and gets stronger as a plot device. they don't explain it in world and they ignore it when the plot needs them to ignore it.

Their are plenty of cool fic ideas you can do with Family Magic as a sentient concept, but most authors don't, they just think "Oh it'd be kill if harry's magic was sentient and the shape of a lion and could fuckin kill people who wrong his family" and that's about as far as the line of thinking goes, they don't think past the cool ascetic of the powers and ignore the world building implications of said powers.

a good example is how does family magic form? Why don't Muggleborns have their own though weak form of family magic? Why is it that in most fics the Weasely's or Malfoy's have some weak spaghetti family magic while say the Greengrasses, Longbottom's and Potter's get some uber strong family magic? why doesn't Voldemort get his own Slytherin Family Magic?

it's questions like these that are unanswered that cause alot of fics to fall flat on their face and just fall into the rule of cool and anime style power up bullshit that they like to fall into. Don't get me wrong, when you want to read something just to read something and be entertained that's fine, and I still enjoy some fics like this, but reading a fic that you want to read because the plot and story look interesting and will draw you in, only to be hit by "and then harry summoned his family magic and bitch slapped voldemort" isn't fun, it's frustrating.

It sucks for those that don't and in the world of Harry Potter the pureblood are sure to try to treat it as proof that they are better than muggleborn, but that doesn't make it truth.

** I read one fanfic that I felt did the family magic right and that one had it if you were brought into the family the older members of said family cod use as a port key/apperation endpo8nt in a similar way to the dark mark if you were in danger which did make sense to me. As nearly all the time people were killed it was either in hogwarts where no one can apprrate or portkey into or it was the family elders or hit and run (apprrate in though a bunch of killing curses and apprrate out) attacks so no one could respond.

** The problem, is as always, bad writing not bad subject matter. I personally don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with the idea of powerful family magic that is passed down through blood. It certainly doesn't validate blood purism any more than the fact that magic is generally passed down through blood means that witches and wizards are better than muggles.

Yeah, witches and wizards live completely different lives than muggles, and have powers that muggles don't, but that doesn't mean that they magical supremacist ideals such as those of Grindelwald are correct.

It's the same thing. (Family magic -> muggleborn with no family magic) as (magic -> muggle with no magic)

It's actually a really valid opportunity to examine a different world with even more handicaps for muggleborn. One where muggleborns have to face the fact that they don't have these family magics, but convince the pureblood that do that they aren't worse than them. That being said I have never seen anyone write family magic like that super well, it's either not a major point, it's done super poorly like in your examples, or it never explores the consequences on the world.

I'd like to see a fic where muggleborn are almost envied for the control they have over their family magics. Pureblood families have strong magic that has grown over the years, but it grows along the path set by their ancestors, while muggleborn are the first of their lines and able to forge a new path for their lines. A tradeoff between strength and flexibility.

** I admire how much thought some authors put into their original mythologies, trying to explain what exactly magic is and where it comes from, and what is really going on with blood purity, muggleborns, Squibs, and rare magical talents. One of the worst "purebloods really are better" stories I've read was both interesting and frustrating to read. I think there is room in the fandom for some of these stories, if they are done well, but I agree that they can be bad examples of lazy writing.

Are Parselmouths descended from Naga, and Metamorphmagi from some kind of shapeshifters? Where did those creatures come from? Were these actually latent Potter/Black family talents, which were somehow brought out by the mix of muggle genes from Lily and Ted's parents? Or were Lily and Ted actually fairy changelings, and these talents really came from them? (I love this idea) Are muggleborns descended from Squibs, or does their magic spontaneously appear? Why doesn't the number of muggleborns seem to mimic the population explosion of muggles (or does it, and only a small fraction of them are actually invited to Hogwarts)?

There is so much in the books that is never fully explained, and so many plot holes and inconsistencies that leave room for fanfiction writers to fill in the gaps. When one person comes up with a new idea, and their story becomes popular, it will inevitably spawn a host of copycats who do it badly, until this idea becomes a reviled trope.

** There's three schools of thought on family magic, each can be written well, but the first is the one that's usually written badly.

1. Family magic = super powers

In this case, each family has some kind of spell or ability that either only family members can use, or is a family secret/grimmoire. This is the one OP is (justly) complaining about, since it flies in the face of 99% of canon. That 1% being hereditary abilities like the ability to speak Parceltongue, metamorphmagery, and the Potter Hair. One way to write this well is to include the fact that Muggleborns ALSO have a family super power, they just have to discover it. This lends itself to the propaganda that pure bloods favour - muggleborns are stealing the magic! Panic! A caveat to this is that Family Magic shouldn't make Harry a god or all stakes are gone, and it ends up being a power wank.

1. Family magic = the sum knowledge of those who came before.

This one makes the most sense with canon set up - it's literally just tips, tricks, and spells that family members have found and contributed to the family's store of knowledge. Not really flashy or amazing, but gives pure bloods a bit of a leg up when it comes to learning magic (if they put in the effort). This ones pretty easy to write well, as long as there's no long-lost “turn a person who has made horcruxes into a squib while destroying all their horcruxes at once” spell hidden away in some Potter journal.

1. Family magic = families specialize in branches of magic

Another that can make sense, if given proper context and pretty easy to write well. This idea is that a family's magic starts to “prefer” casting certain branches of magic. For example, the Finnegans might be predisposed to fire spells, making any spells that deal with combustion easier, while everything else is a bit of a struggle. In this example, muggleborns would basically be Jack-of-all-trades types, where a pureblood in a long line of pure bloods might be AMAZING at transfiguration, but absolute pants at charms. A really interesting twist on this would be if certain pureblood families that specialize in dark magic are losing their ability to cast all other types of magic, since they never introduce any “new blood” that would reset some of their specialization.

My two cents, but there you are

** I think that family magic is a pretty cool concept, up to a point, and not imposible to start anew.

If the family magic makes it so that you are super powerful, unkillable and able to do the impossible easily the it's shit.

But, if family magic pushes it's own to a certain way of acting, gives the family a bit more talent or affinity to certain subjets etc, then it would be awesome.

Yes, in a way it validates the movement, but no more than good genes make a good athlete with training, or a family of scientist have a better chance of getting a smart kid. It is still shit if you don0t give others the oportunity to grow, but for purebloods to have some kind of advantage would make sense, more so in magic.

I think having magic with it's own rules is pretty neat, swearing on your magic causes magic to fuck with you if you break it makes sense if the world's magic works like that and the punishments are consistent.

A et peeve of mine is about things ike the goblet of fire, it would be a great assassination tool, just covertly start a faux tournament, and put the names of your enemies in it without informing them, they will lose their magic beqcause it is so, no intent, no need to do it yourself.

One of the things I love about most magics is will, if someone can make a contract for you and have it affect you without your consent, family or not, I hate it.

** I believe I read one where the 'powerup' actually made sense. I believe it was Family Magicks or something where Merlin basically gifted some magic to the founding families. Which normally just shows up on oaths, to signify it. However, this fanfiction plays it beautifully(IMO) and says the reason Harry can use it so well is due to his power, magically. It would make sense, seeing as the two power rivals, Voldemort and Dumbledore, wouldn't be able to use a method of such. Voldemort is a bastard heir, so not really considered one by Magic, which is sentient. Dumbledore's family didn't contribute to founding the wizarding council and such, so his family wasn't gifted a totem. This gives a special element for Harry, without it being too overpowered as it is not able to do everything.
