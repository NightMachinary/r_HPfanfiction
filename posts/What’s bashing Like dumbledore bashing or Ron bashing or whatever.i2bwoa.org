** Take the character, accentuate every negative trait they have, possibly invent a few more, and put the resulting character in opposition to the main-character.

As an example, if you wanted to "bash" Ginny, the easiest way to do so would be to take the canon character Romilda Vane (creepy stalker girl who tries to feed Harry a love-potion at some point), change her name to Ginevra Weasley, and forget all about the original Ginny.

** It's where a character's flaws are exaggerated to a ridiculous extent. Ron bashing would turn Ron into a buffoonish cartoon character with the literal mentality and manners of a troll. Dumbledore bashing would turn the most intelligent man of the age into a literal mustache twirling villain who conspires with the Weasley's to steal a child's inheritance and dose him with love potion to keep him compliant.

Basically, unrealistic, exaggerated emphasis on canon character's actual flaws.

*** Not only actual flaws even. I mean Ron did ate a lot, so there's ground for the trollish eating, even if vague. However, there's no base at all for Dumbledore stealing money. Not sure where that came from.

Possibly because he kept Harry's Gringotts key for 10 years (and where did he get it from? Did he search through the rubble after James and Lily were killed?), and then gave it to random people to get money from Harry's account (Hagrid, Molly). And then in 5th year Bill just hands him a sack of money that he got from Harry's account to "help" him.

Take those irregularities and ask, "Why?" and you come up with possibly sinister reasons. As Hellstrike said, wars are expensive and Dumbledore knew Harry needed to die, so why shouldn't that money go to a good cause instead of being confiscated by the corrupt Ministry when the family died out. (It's not like he encouraged Harry to make a will.)

Presumably because wars cost money (paying for Order stuff is the most common "justification").

***** There are spare mentions to Ron eating in the books... though I don't remember if he ate a lot, he ate too fast... or too messy. However that's like less than a handful of times through the 7 books and nothing gruesome or compulsive as the fandom makes it out to be. The movies did made it worse than it was in the books though.

***** It's CANON that he left Harry and Hermione because he got tired of being hungry. Yeah, the horcrux added to his angst, but it only worked on what was already there.

****** Where does it say that he left because he was hungry? He only left after harry asked him to leave them 3 times. The fight started because he was tired of them moving around like headless chickens and harry being dismissive about his family being in danger. And the horcrux played its part.

**** Dumbledore is one of those characters only likable if you make excuses due to the series being for children/YA. Otherwise, well you can blame most of what went wrong at Hogwarts him and he does not come out looking good.

***** Yeah he deserves lambasting. For his behavior in Hogwarts and out. Given how easily he seems to be politically out maneuvered and his unwillingness to punish evil, I can't view him well for his actions outside of Hogwarts too, unless you start making Doylist excuses.

Like, it wouldn't be surprising if he was one of the reasons the Imperius defense worked.
