:END:
Let me preface this by stating that I absolutely adore Hermione. She's one of my favorite characters--only, I've discovered, not in fanfiction.

And my problem is that stories with her in ir seem to always gravitate (much like canon come to think of it) with her being awesomer than everyone else in every way and solving every single problem. It seems like most stories can't help but praise everything she does, too.

In contrast, while there are certainly a plethora of stories where Harry is written as a godly Mary-sue, I find that even when Harry is written as a powerful (very powerful) person, his character has a lot of natural checks. He's hotheaded, doesn't think things through, and he's prone to pushing people away. Many people tend to give him checks, too (usually Voldemort or Dumbledore).

I don't really see this with Hermione very much. She's either beyond perfect, or the author doesn't like her and bashes her to oblivion.

It's kind of made it to where I avoid stories marked with Hermione on FFnet because it either doesn't offer me the protagonist I'm hoping for or I just see her character absolutely demolished by haters.

What do you think? Know of any stories where Hermione is given more checks while keeping her in character?


** Yeah, I've definitely encountered this, and it always makes me sad - I love Hermione /because/ of her flaws, not despite them. (Though, if we're arguing which trio member comes off the worst in fic, I think Ron is the clear winner - or loser, I suppose.) That said, I do know some fics that treat Hermione as a real person:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2653181][The Supervisor's Tale]] linkao3(2653181) - Hermione & McGonagall mentorship post-DH; I like how it shows some of the challenges in transitioning from classroom work to less structured original research

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6686665][Monster]] linkao3(6686665) - features an older Hermione, using some creative methods to get her way in court (the same author also wrote [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]], a trio-fic I highly recommend)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731][The Two Body Problem]] - Hermione gets Riddle's diary in 2nd year; it makes great use of her research skills, but also doesn't shy away from her ruthless streak

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1180475][Along the Way]] linkao3(1180475) - Hermione from age 18 to 50, learning how to not burn out as she tries to fix the wizarding world

** White Squirrel's /Arithmancer/ series' Hermione does suffer a bit from "awesome" syndrome, I'll grant you, but her characterization feels very much real, at least as far as I'm concerned. She breaks down from too many responsabilities, she miscalculates sometimes, she misjudges people's intentions. I dunno. I think Squirrel mostly gets it right. But, of course, you've probably already read his stuff if you've been looking for Hermione stories...

In my own story, /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, I fully own up to the fact that it's a story about the AU Hermione curbstomping through the villains, but I do take pains not to Mary-Sue her either --- she's too rash when she thinks she's found a great idea, she is much too dismissive of other people's emotions (to the point of taking a month to realize Harry was beginning to be possessed by the Scar Horcrux, once)... and she talks too much. But, again, this is still, unapologetically, a story about Hermione being amazing, so who knows if you'd like it --- especially considering that it's an AU Hermione whose different upbringing shaped her personality to be somewhat different from the canonical one, increasingly so as time goes on.

No, I absolutely cannot agree. I've never seen a single high-on-their-horse Hermione fic as bad as the multitude of indie!Harry fics, where he's simultaneously a perfect gentlemen to women and great lover, a savvy politician, extremely smart and studious, magically powerful and the heir of multiple founders. Putting in an alibi "check" like Dumbledore or Voldemort to be defeated in a meaningless scene close to the end is ... well.. meaningless.

You must be completely of your rocker if you think there's any Hermione story that comes even close to that. And Harry fics do that routinely. There's an entire *genre* for fics like that.

***** Yes, but that kind of dynamic completely ruins her character. Hermione is not supposed to be a trophy girl with a mental link to magical Wikipedia. It takes away all her initiative while also treating her as the perfect woman. Also, a lot of the less plausible pairings for her are a complete character assassination because her depiction does not correlate at all with canon and they sell that twisted version of her as an ideal state.

*** One of my all time favorites (although crack) is Like Juggling Snowballs Through Hell by lightblue-Nymphadora ( linkffn(7901231) ). This story simply makes EVERYONE OP that the author likes, and is unapologetic about it. The characterization of Hermione (and all the others) here is hilarious, and I'd like a story with this Hermione where she's the heir to at least 5 noble houses.

Also, rap song lyrics. Nothing better than that.

But I do agree with you, indie!Harry is a creature unlike no other. I hope we can reach this level of monstrosity with AU Hermiones someday, just for the sake of it. It would be an awful read, but I'm still curious about the mysterious past of the Dagworth-Granger line, and their family grimoire, and 11 mansions.

You're right, there's plenty of potential there. If people continue to pursue that stuff maybe I can one day agree that Mary Sue Hermione is just as bad as her Harry counterpart.

** It's hard to say, because the story is only in the summer after First Year, but I like Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]]. Of course, the story is about Slytherin fem!Harry, so Hermione isn't the focus at all, but she certainly does have flaws. She's bossy and bratty, but also obviously intelligent and has her wonderful thirst for knowledge. And I think that's pretty canon-accurate as to how Hermione /was/ in first year. It took her a bit to grow up and mellow out.

Also Hermione in Drenarian Renegade is completely right in her deconstruction of that story's Harry, even if he blows it off because he's a huge asshole. But again she's not a main character :/

I think what oftentimes disappoints me about Hermione-centric stories is that they coincide with muggle-wank, which while I recognize has its place in fanfiction and many people enjoy, simply isn't my cup of tea.

*** Thanks for the recommendation; I am enjoying it. At the same time, I'd say that while Hermione is in character personalitywise, the story sells her intellect short. She is playing the everyman passive observer, rather than someone who is actually pretty proactive, diligent, and quite brilliant---good at noticing and remembering things and putting clues together.

For example, she sees Harry, Draco, and Luna are all suddenly casting impossibly far above their grade level, but she doesn't acknowledge it or ask how they are suddenly so capable. She presumably knows about Lockhart, yet she doesn't consider Memory Charms or take precautions, even after she discovers something terrible. She doesn't follow-up with the Remembrall. She doesn't question Dobby, even though she has every opportunity to.

And, while she observes all the clues, she never even tries to put them together.
