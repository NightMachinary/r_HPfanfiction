Basically just Big Flying Lizards being controlled by a Teenager.


** Not quite controls them but this author had a unique twist on how the dragons get dealt with during the tournament.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

** Not related, but you just reminded me of Dragonlance, which I haven't read since I was a kid. I suppose I could chew through a lot of those in a short time, now. Wonder if they're worth a read, now.

** I'll admit to not being a fan of this particular trope, but linkffn(Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion) and its sequel sort of fit.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
