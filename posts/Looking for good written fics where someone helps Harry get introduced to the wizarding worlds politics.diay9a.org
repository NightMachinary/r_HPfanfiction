Hey all, I would really apreciate some good fanfic recommendations. I am a bit at a loss how to search for this kind of story.

So I love fics where someone helps Harry prepare for what is to come. Could be someone adopting him, discover his abuse by the dursleys or a mentor/timejumper. could also be a group of people. I like it when the story is not only Hogwarts based but includes the political system. So I am looking for an emencipated!Harry fic, but not too powerfull or grownup. I want him to have an adult help him. I am not averse to a slytherin helping him (malfoy/snape/andromeda) or him being adopted by a muggle (random or grangers) who decides to step up and get to understand the WW. But weasleys, Minerva, Bones or Serius and/or Remus would all be fine. I dont care much who it is as long as they are in his corner. :3

Romance-wise I dont care if it is slash/het. etc. As long as it isn't too crazy with age differences or that every male seems to be gay for some reason. But I would realy like for the romance to NOT be the focus of the story.

Looking forward to some good reading :)


** The accidental animagus is like this! Harry gets adopted by the grangers and they all get introduced to magic early on, and eventually Andromeda helps Harry navigate the politics of the wizarding world.
