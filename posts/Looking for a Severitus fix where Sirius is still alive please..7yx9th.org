** I know I've read several with this premise, but the only ones I can think of off the top of my head are linkffn(The Best Revenge) by Arsinoe de Blassenville which begins right before Harry gets his Hogwarts letter and linkffn(Far Beyond A Promise Kept) by Oliver.Snape which starts during the summer between 2nd/3rd year.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Snape never wanted anyone to know of his promise to Dumbledore, but has realised that he can protect Potter much better by taking a less passive role in the boy's training. Actually liking Harry Potter has never been part of his plan. mentor/guardian.

** linkffn(Harry's New Home) has this and it's pretty good. Not perfect, but I did like the Sirius subplot. linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) is actually one of my favorites in spite of being rather OOC all around. Snape is hilarious, Sirius is hilarious, and Voldemort is scary but still hilarious.

** I guess it might be a spoiler... Kind of, but the Leo Inter Serpentes series has this. I'm just starting the sixth year now and I enjoy it!

Linkao3(Leo Inter Serpentes: First Year)

I don't know why the bot is linking to the sixth year fic and not the first? Not really very spoilery from canon based on the description though.

  Now that he knows the full contents of the prophecy, Harry begins training in earnest to kill Voldemort, with the help of his dad and two best friends. Dumbledore has voluntarily offered to divulge extra information to Harry, and the Ministry has finally realised what's been staring them in the face for a year - but that doesn't mean that things will start to go smoothly for Harry. He and his loved ones will be tested in ways they haven't seen coming, and some relationships will buckle under the strain.

**** It's a good story. No OP harry, Snake familiar doesnt give him miracle making powers, snape is just mature and not a dark beauty -_-". Not much bashing at at all. This is my best severitus fiction that I've read. Sirius and Snape make up and the apprentice mentor like relationship between Harry and Snape evolves beautifully not like snape is all hunky dory right off the bat.

** "By Baker Street Station I Sat Down and Wept" should fit. Sirius is alive, and Snape's Harry's biological father. And both aren't fit to be parents.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
