This obviously only applies to fics set in Britain.

One things that pushes me away from a fanfic is lack of English terms. For instance, we don't have "Recess" here in the UK. Instead, we have 'break-time' or simply 'break'.\\
It might just be me being nit-picky or it's something that bothers other people too. Either way, I'm less likely to read your fanfic if Harry is playing 'soccer'


** It annoys me to. But... As an American, I don't know all of the words/phrases that are different in Britain. Some of the obvious ones (soccer>football, trash can>bin, trunk>boot) yeah, but I can say that the Recess>break thing is completely new to me. I try to use British words and spellings when I'm writing a story set in Britain, but I really appreciate it when someone lets me know that I got one wrong lol. So I think it's important to remember that a lot of fanfiction authors aren't British, and they probably just don't know any better.

** The only time this has really bothered me was when the author kept calling the black characters "African-American." Most other things it's just like "err, okay, that's not how that works but okay" and I just skip over it. Soccer vs football etc is just not that crucial to the story.

Calling him black outright feels a bit uncomfortable, but if he is a black dude and there are four white dudes near him, it is the easiest and most obvious descriptor. That's why I was curious.

***** I'm pretty sure it was considered offensive a while ago to call people black. That's why the term African American was even conceived of, and why it persists in formal language.

I always use black in informal conversations simply because my black friends have told me they prefer it. But context as to why the term African American even exists.

****** I disagree. Calling Asian people "yellow people" is offensive, as is referring to a Chinese person as a "chinaman" or calling a Native American a "red person".

Just because the term "black people" is what we use nowadays doesn't mean it can't be considered offensive down the line. That's what happened to "negro" (which black people in the early 1900s called themselves, but nowadays is not appropriate).

It's totally reasonable to assume that the Brits have their own term for black people, even if that term itself is just "black people." I don't see what's wrong in asking that question is all.

** It bothers me when it's something massively egregious that breaks me out of the story. I'm not going to lose the plot if someone uses "math" instead of "maths" but if Harry is the quarterback of his 'high school' football team I'm probably going to back out of the story.

This goes both ways, by the by. There are certain cultural elements about fics set in America written by non-Americans that will kill my immersion in the story. Common terms I've seen pop up recently in some fics include the use of the word "hob." That's...not a word in the majority of the United States. If at all.

Generally speaking though, it's pretty easy to figure out if the author is American, from the British Isles, Australian, or doesn't speak English as a first language. Once that is accounted for, I generally overlook minor mistakes as there are some things about cultures that are IMPOSSIBLE to know unless you actually live there. It's the mistakes that show that author has done zero research into what they're writing about that end up annoying me.

What I can't tolerate are distinctly American things being used in a fic, which are obviously not British in any way, shape, or form. E.g. Thanksgiving, July 4th, American football... all of which I have seen being used in fics before.

It may seem odd, but the thing I hate the most is the use of 'American names', i.e. names for OCs or whatnot that just wouldn't be used in Britain. I will nope out of a fic the second Harry starts chatting to a 'Brooklyn' or 'Hunter'.

** Generally, I don't mind /if/ it's third person/narrator voice.

If it's dialogue, I mentally start adding an american accent, and it kinda breaks the immersion a bit, but not a dealbreaker. But one thing to remember, is that "Old-Time" words that your grandad used to say /Is Not/ the same as "British English". I've had to look up a large number of idioms, and that just makes it confusing for me.

My biggest dislike is not the words, but parts of culture, but it's also the hardest part to get right.

Not everyone here had a car when they're 16, but the vast majority have drank (significant amounts) of alcohol by then.

You're more likely to hang around in a town center that happens to have a shopping center, than a 'mall' as it's own thing.

Not everyone in the UK is either a Lord/Lady from some questionably-historically-accurate 'drama', or if they aren't in the top class desperately looking for someone they can swear their families eternal fealty to.

The church in our village is a hodge podge of buildings from around the 12-14th century. My halls of residence at university was a castle dating back to the 11th century. A 'few hundred years' isn't particularly ancient.

It also has a different set of national languages than the UK -- Welsh and English, while the UK's national language is English. It has its own national anthem.

From a cultural standpoint, Wales is chock full of L1 Welsh speakers, unlike the majority of England, and many are monoglots. Wales also fields a number of national sports teams.

Similarly, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are each separate countries within the United Kingdom.
