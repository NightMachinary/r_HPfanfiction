Reading Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero]]) and I'm enjoying it, would enjoy to read more well written Wrong Boy Who Lived fics that are out there.

â€‹

Cheers :D


** Have you read the classic linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the Santi)? It's kind of foundational for the genre.

The only others I know of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) which I personally like but has started to drag in the current updates and linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches - revenge is best served raw) which is a little darker, a little more smart! Harry and heading for harem territory eventually.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherins]] sounds like the type of fic you're looking for, though it hasn't been confirmed yet who is the BWL. If you are okay reading a WIP, give it a try!

**** From the author's note in the beginning of book 5:

"To answer some FAQs regarding romance in this story: Harry is straight, there will be m/m and f/f relationships as well as m/f, I'm not telling any of them yet because that would be boring, everyone will have multiple experiences with dating because they're teenagers and not likely to start dating their spouse at age 16. looking at you, jkr. that said, some characters might come back to someone they dated first or early. I'm still not going to focus too much on this aspect of the fic but it'll be there."
