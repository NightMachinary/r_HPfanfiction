:END:
I'm rereading the Order of the Phoenix and I just read... THAT scene and am currently crying like a baby. Please give me your best recommendations in which Sirius lives, to mend my broken heart.

Have a great day/night!

Edit: Any pairing is fine, just no noncon. Thanks so much for all the recommendations!


** Technically Sirius hasn't yet survived past canon, as it's only partway through fourth year, but he gets to raise Harry in the linkffn(Innocent) series. Basically: he escapes 5 years earlier with accidental magic, and lacking any leads on Peter, he instead goes to check on eight-year-old Harry. And Harry is unhappy, so Sirius offers him another home. Cue public uproar about the "kidnapping", Harry getting a proper chance at a childhood (albeit sometimes in stressful circumstances), and Sirius making mistakes while doing his sincere best. No lordships, no secret Black family magic, just people. Book 1 is pre-Hogwarts, then the other books cover one year each; book 5/year 4 is in progress.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

******** I don't think it is necesarilly that. Maybe it's very Huflepuff of me, but we do live in the 21st century and slash is nothing new and homosexuality by itself is mostly accepted (and I live in a catholic 3rd world country, which should be more "strict" than other developed countries) .

I do understand not reading slash, as I myself prefer Het leading couples simply because is more relatable to me. I dont mind side M/M though, specially if the character's sexuallity is doubtfull in canon (i.e Seamus Finnegan, Draco Malfoy, Dumbledore, Maybe a bisexual Sirius?).

So, let's continue with my Hufflepuff-ness. Maybe try mentioning any tags that might cause disaproval when you rec something. I believe abuse, slash, teacher/student relationships or too much gore might be something that you migh want to know before starting to read any fic. If after this, you continue being downvoted, well... let's just say that this world is not as foreward-thinking as we might think.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~‚ÄúAre you trying to get killed, Potter?‚Äù Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. ‚ÄúThis is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.‚Äù Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, ‚ÄúPotter, what the hell--‚Äù~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
