I remember reading a fic where Lady Hogwarts helps Harry train in the Room of Requirement. And another where Hogwarts possesses Luna (but she's not unhappy about it).

Any recommendable fics like that? Preferably where Hogwarts isn't just another woman to be added to Harry's harem. For example she could have her own objectives (teaching magic to new generation?) and view the entire conflict with Voldemort as petty human squabbles beyond her. She (or he I suppose) doesn't necessarily need a body either, could be Hogwarts consciousness communicating with select students through dreams or manifesting as a poltergeist or whatever.

  Every student knows that Hogwarts has a mind of its own. They probably wouldn't sleep at night if they knew what the castle really wants...

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** In linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt), sentient Hogwarts sends Hermione back in time as someone else's reincarnation to hopefully fix a rip in spacetime caused by /something/ during the final battle, and then helps her during her Hogwarts years.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
