** There is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/160208][Eyesight]] series with a bisexual genderqueer Harry. It's a slowburn though, so the harem part comes with time. Here's a link to the first fic in the series - linkao3(904579)

** Linkao3(Vanteeria Domestica) is my /favorite/ bi harem fic. It's very good imo. Love the slow burn of one of the ships, although I won't say which one.
