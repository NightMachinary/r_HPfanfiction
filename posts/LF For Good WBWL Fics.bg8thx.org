** If you enjoyed Prince of Slytherin, you'll likely also enjoy the Sarcasm and Slytherin series, starting with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) . They're pretty similar through year 2, but DoS actually kept moving with its plot and is on year 5 currently

*** I would say that Den of Snakes has a very narrow plot where as Prince of Slytherin is much more expansive in both world size and plot.

**** While I thoroughly enjoy PoS, I'd argue that DoS actually sticks to its plot, while PoS can't keep from going off on tangents (even if they are interesting!) and I think we'd both be right ;)

They are definitely different in their execution and I appreciate that, otherwise there'd be no point in reading both.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

**** The author addresses this in a note during second year - I think the way the timelines sync up, DoS was releasing before PoS at a certain point? I don't remember the specifics, but I do remember looking into it because it was WEIRD how similar they were, but I came away with the conclusion that it really was just a coincidence.

If you find otherwise, please let me know!

*** If OP really dislikes the cliche Harry's parents are monsters direction then this fic may not be for them, since it follows that very heavily. Still it's probably the best written example of that, but the constant bashing of James, Dumbledore, Ron, The Twin, etc, bothered me. I only read through the end of year 3 though, so don't know if that let up at all, but the revelations at the end of year three were so absurd I had to take a break from reading it. I plan to read the rest eventually, but haven't gotten around to it.

*** I assume you mean Saving Connor and the sequels. linkffn(2580283) Great series, one of the best in HP fanfiction imo. There is pretty heavy James/Lily bashing, but it's different than most WBWL tropes. It's not the typical 'the BWL has a twin who James/Lily inexplicably leave with the Dursleys because they're stupid/evil/whatever' bashing, all of the plot and characters are completely different from canon.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** linkffn(Antithesis) doesn't have major Potter Parents bashing, although it does exist in a minor form. A very heart wrenching and sad story. Completed. Doesn't really follow the wbwl trope structure too much at all. It's a good story, though not for everybody's tastes.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
