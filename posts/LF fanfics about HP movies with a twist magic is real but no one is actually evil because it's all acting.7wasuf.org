Two years ago, I read this crazy long Star Wars fanfic (can't remember title) wherein all of the events of the prequel movies were "fiction" but all of the characters were real. The Jedi Council was real, Queen Amidala was real, Sheev Palpatine was real. It turns out that there was this film maker who liked to shoot things happening in the Jedi Council and Senate and put together his shots to create the movies. That was mostly how he created Episode I. Eventually, he managed to convince the Jedi and Senators to act for Episodes II and III, too.

The funny thing was no one was actually evil but Palpatine had great fun acting as an evil guy, Darth Maul was a great martial artist and a cool guy, and Anakin Skywalker kept on thinking the movie was about the dangers of drugs which served as an in story explanation of why he was always creepily staring at people in the prequel movies. Haha... I am rambling. The movies were big hits in the galaxy's equivalent of prime time television. Another running gag was that all the Jedi thought that their peers were strictly following the Jedi Code that they must not have a wife but it turns out all of them have a wife hidden in secret somewhere (even Yoda).

Anyway, remembering that fanfic made me wonder if anyone has ever written a Harry Potter Fanfic with a similar premise.

*** It's annoying that I can't remember the title. It's hard to look for it using Google search.

**** I think I may have both found and not found it. It was called "Bad Boys, Jedi Style." The author has taken down the story from various sites (FF.Net, AO3, LJ). So I am left with a summary from the DLP Forums: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/bad-boys-jedi-style-by-kelaria-t-star-wars.21347/]]

*** Thanks. I didn't know that this story had a (relatively recent) update. Though it is different from what I'm looking for.
