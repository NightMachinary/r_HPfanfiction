  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I don't have exactly this, but there is:

- linkffn(Blood Binding by SphinxScribe) --- ritual in the Little Hangleton revives a little bit more than what Voldemort hoped for. And this shows exactly the problem with this line of thinking. By removing a lot of pain from Harry's life (both by giving Harry parents and saving Sirius), the author did make story a way more bland and boring. It doesn't even continue after the end of the fifth year, because there was obviously nothing much to add (HBP lost most of its plot and I am not sure what remained from DH).
- linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) --- of course, family which Harry grew up are Grangers, not Potters, but the point about a boy who grew up in the normal family so he is not pathologically distrustful (as in the canon) is valid. It changes the situation a lot.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems.
