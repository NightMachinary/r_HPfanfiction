I'm reading this fic that has Lupin living with a werewolf pack, and at least one of his pack mates is a Muggle who was bitten by a werewolf and ended up having to register with the Ministry of Magic and leave his life behind. It was actually shocking; like, on an intellectual level I knew anyone could be turned into a werewolf, but somehow I never considered the implications of a Muggle getting bitten.

Do you know any fics where a Muggle is similarly forced into the wizarding world that isn't the cliche "their sibling/their friend/their spouse is actually a wizard or witch"? Doesn't have to be werewolves, though I realize the werewolf situation is kinda unique in that you can't just memory-charm it away (which the Ministry would do for most breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy). Also it doesn't have to centre on the Muggle though it would be nice if they're more than a passing mention.


** Odd, I didn't think a muggle could become a werewolf. I don't know why, but I thought the werewolf virus acted like rabies in a muggle.

#+begin_quote
  In the late nineteenth century the great English authority on werewolves, Professor Marlowe Forfang, undertook the first comprehensive study of their habits. He found that nearly all those he managed to study and question had been wizards before being bitten. He also learned from the werewolves that Muggles 'taste' different to wizards and that they are much more likely to die of their wounds, whereas witches and wizards survive to become werewolves.

***** Perhaps Muggles who have wizarding ancestry, or Squib ancestry? Thus, a little more able to survive the virus than the standard magic-free bloodlines. Or maybe Muggles just died from the bites because it was the 19th century and medicine wasn't too good, and most people died after being attacked by normal wolves. Wizards and witches are more likely to be able to perform healing charms, and to apparate away to get help.

Thus, I find it perfectly reasonable to expect that a Muggle turned in the 20th/21st centuries would survive.

  What would you do if you woke up one morning, looked outside your window and could see Hogwarts? This is what happened to Nigel Chaucer. For the first fifteen years of his life, he grew up in St. Luke, a village in the North of England, and for fifteen years, the view from his window was an empty horizon and a warning sign in the distance. But now, home from a long hospital stay after a devastating accident, this new vision, this castle out of nowhere, will change the course of his life.

*** Sure! linkao3(Are We Yet Free Men?)

It's set in the first wizarding war, and it has a couple of inconsistencies - I think the most glaring is that the prophecy was made before Harry was born instead of a few months or even weeks before the Potters were killed as per canon, which ends up whitewashing Snape's character since he's been a spy almost all along. Also it's slash :/

But both aren't really the focus of the story, if you mind them - it's more about Remus' struggle to make an adult life and come to terms with being a werewolf without protections like the Shrieking Shack.

** [[/r/magicmuggle]] is sorta like that, except somehow the main character can use magic - if I've understood it correctly so far, he's somehow channelling something or someone else's magic. But apart from falling through the barrier (which was the original prompt), seeing Hogwarts (I suspect though that the Muggle disillusionment charms probably are all wiped at the platform, since parents visit), and being able to use a special wand, he can't do most things wizards can, i.e., owls, magical creature, portraits, normal wands treat him like a Muggle. It's also canon compliant, mostly, and doesn't mess with Harry's story.

Whether or not you consider him to be so, he is. He has a magical aunt and cousin. He is privy (and has been privy since he was one, really) to knowledge of the wizarding world. Hell, it's arguable that his blood (along with Petunia's, it's Evans blood) helped keep Harry's protective enchantments going.

Pretty much the only thing this recommendation has in line with what I'm looking for is that there's a werewolf situation. And my post is clear enough that it's not about the werewolves in and of themselves, it's the fact that you can't memory-charm away lycanthropy like the Ministry would do for normal breaches in the International Statute of Secrecy. Dudley Dursley was never in any danger of being Obliviated for knowing about magical stuff, because he has been privy to it since he was a toddler if not since before he was born.
