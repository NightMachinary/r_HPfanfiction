Looking for longer fics which involve a romance or a purely sexual relationship between Harry and Draco where Harry is confident about his sexuality and not pulling the "OMG I kissed Malfoy what is wrong with me" card or the "But I'm not gay, I'm so confused" thing. Hopefully the plot would not be solely revolving around the romance (but also some type of action/adventure).

** There's a crossover with Supernatural in 3 parts that's quite long. It starts slow but there's a Harry/Draco relationship about halfway through the first part. The Supernatural elements are quite minor and well explained (at least until the third part, but having seen Supernatural I can't really say how well a non-fan would understand it. The first 2 parts at least are set in the Harry Potter world, with only a few elements of the Supernatural world.)

Harry's actually asexual in this, but his sexuality isn't a big part of his personality, nor does he try to avoid it or hide it. I'll link to the first installment.

The summary sounds clich√©, but it's one of my favourite fics. It does get quite dark as it moves on though, so proceed with caution if things like that bother you (actual dark as in dark themes/events not dark as in dark magic)

  When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years. (Eventual HP/DM.)
