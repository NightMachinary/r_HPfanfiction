** Can't recall one. But there is definitely one. I am curious was it a bluff? Or was losing your magic a condition if you refuse to participate? It's been awhile since I read Goblet of Fire.

****** linkffn(Forging the Sword) had an interesting mechanism: the contract was binding on the Ministries of Magic of the participating countries, where each Ministry committed to forcing the champion(s) chosen by the Goblet from their country to participate. So, when Harry's name came out of the Goblet, his choice was either to participate or to flee to a country that was not involved in the tournament.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup][The Lawyers Against the Cup]] has Harry refusing to participate and the fallout from it. It's also a pretty good story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6311075/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Fourth-School][Harry Potter and the Fourth School]] is a short oneshot of Harry refusing (and the second chapter of Harry then using the cup in a logical conclusion). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961358/1/A-Refusal-to-Compete][A Refusal to Compete]] is tiny but complete.

I haven't read it, but this seems the main plot point of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8682644/1/Harry-Potter-Reborn][Harry Potter Reborn]], which also isn't finished. As [[/u/ScrotumPower][u/ScrotumPower]] recommended [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][The Power of the Press]] has Harry refusing to complete, but it seems to be the jumping off point rather then the main plot of the story. I didn't get very far into [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9124279/1/A-Not-So-Story-The-Fourth-Champion][A Not So Story - The Fourth Champion]] which is a (to me) not very funny crack fic, but then I hate slapstick and toilet humour so... From memory, I think he /does/ end up competing in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], but there's a whole bunch of stuff about him fighting against it. In the last few chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3804253/12/House-of-Potter][House of Potter]] there is a thing about refusing. Same about half way through in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2959739/26/A-Sirius-Matter][A Sirius Matter]].

There are a couple of fics where Harry tries to get disqualified as unfit to participate, but I don't think that is what you are after? I mean [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/260680][The Family Way]] and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097277&chapter=1][A Marriage of Convenience]] come to mind, but I'm sure there are others out there that aren't Harry/Serverus slash.
