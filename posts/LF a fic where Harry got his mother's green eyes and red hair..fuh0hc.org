#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

*** Happens to most fem!Harrys and of course the meeting between her and Snape is a glorious one:

- linkao3(Red Hair and Grass Blades by Flustered) perfect set-up of the story, then it seems the author has not managed to stay on the quality and at Hogwarts the story becomes bit ridiculous.

- linkfn(Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687) just fluffy fun, but well executed.

- Oh, in linkffn(The Videus Charm by rebeflynn) she has a black raven hair, but otherwise it is one of the best fem!Harrys I know about.

- hmm, there was one more, when red-haired with the eyes of Lily Evans sent Snape into a tailspin, but I cannot find it. What a pity.

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.
