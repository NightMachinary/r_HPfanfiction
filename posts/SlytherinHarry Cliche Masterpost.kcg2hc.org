** Clich√©s exist for a reason.

I suspect many of these are guilty pleasure reads, and if you're looking for something different there are quite a few good Slytherin!Harry fan-fictions with a distinct lack of these, OR alternatively there are quite a few good fan-fictions of Slytherin!Harry that implement these well.

On a side note... some of these do make sense when written well, and you can easily see how and why the Wizarding World might behave in that way.
