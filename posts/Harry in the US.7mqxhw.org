** Since you seem OK with crossovers, here's a WIP Avengers crossover but the author is really good about updating weekly: linkffn(Heroes Assemble! by Stargon1)

EDIT: forgot about this one: linkffn(Bearings by MattD12027). It's been a while since I read this one but from what I remember it was pretty well fleshed out with an interesting story. Both of these are post-Hogwarts by the way, you didn't really specify any couples you're opposed to or time periods so I went with what I had read in the past.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** I remember one fic where Harry had an OC aunt and they moved to America. I didn't read it all but I don't think he went to Hogwarts. Don't recall the name right now sadly.

I do rememeber Harry McGonagall (linkffn 3160475) that had him raised in America by her OC relatives, though he does go to Hogwarts.

If your okay with crossovers, I can pull up a few fics with the Avengers (usually raised by Tony Stark).

  Everyone always forgets about the Merpeople. So did Harry until the day his, Lee's, and Hermione's Portkeys land at Reagan National Airport's Arrivals dais. He's just had to leave a job he loves and pack his entire life---literally---into his luggage. Then Malfoy and his subplots arrive, and suddenly, saving the world again, one Mermaid at a time, sounds like the perfect excuse to do something he's always wanted.
