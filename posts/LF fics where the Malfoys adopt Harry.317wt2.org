As the title states, it's a veela fic. Harry is ooc. At times it is brilliant, at times.... Not so much... But Harry is indeed adopted by the Malfoys, and well, it's a Drarry fic. Only one that I remember reading, but I have read a few summaries on ao3, where he's been adopted by the Malfoys. Hope you enjoy!

They Shook Hands

I'm not caught up to it but I remember that the first 4 years were quite good. This is coming from someone who usually enjoys Draco bashing as well.
