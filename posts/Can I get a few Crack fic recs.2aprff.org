Longer the better, also the more obscure the better as I've read most of the well known ones.

*** If you look at the author's fics, he's added a sequel to /Harry the Hufflepuff/. It's called /Harry the Hufflepuff 2/.

Cracky, silly, sexy, sort of old. You might have read it before, but it isn't the usual lolwut or stupid crossover stuff. Also, complete and --/cough/ -- enjoyably large.

Harry is Raised by The Rock. Not a super obscure fic, but a pretty obscure crossover.

A long time ago, a few authors including myself were making fun of some godawful story someone posted in the DLP WbA section.

We decided to turn our ridicule into a story, and each took turns writing a chapter. Most of this isn't written by me, but some of it is quite hilarious. Much of it isn't consistent or doesn't make sense because we didn't care, but you wanted crack.
