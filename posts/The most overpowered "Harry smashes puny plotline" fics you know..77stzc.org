I'm talking Harry Crow level here people.

Conditions:

1. Harry either wins the graveyard confrontation, doesn't feature in the graveyard or has already defeated Voldemort at that point.

2. No one remotely important to Harry dies, gets kidnapped for an extended period or unduly suffers.


** linkffn(Core Threads)'s Harry is so thoroughly above the canon plotline he just /ignores/ it. Later he dimension-travels to the world of a clich√©d Manipulative!Dumbledore story (It Makes Sense In Context) and utterly /curbstomps/ said evil Dumbles in hilarious ways.

Also, of course, linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton) has some chapters that feature a very OP Harry curbstomping his way through the Graveyard Confrontation. The "Master of Death" chapter for instance.

****** To be fair very little of that 300k is dealing with anything close to a cannon first year plot line. On the other hand the author really could have paced things better because it seems so absurd if you look at it after a certain point. Harry ends up being like 'Well I know I'm Skeleton God King of my own dimension and have a large population to rule over but I gotta head back to Hogwarts for second year' which is beyond silly. It isn't a crime to have your character not go back to Hogwarts when there is no good reason to do so and many to not go. Also not a crime to stretch out Harry's accession to Skeleton God King over a few years instead of months.

** linkffn(11913447). Time travel goes wrong, Harry ends up back in 1992, but in Lockhart's body... sort of. Interesting take on a time traveling Harry, and one of the few stories where Harry is a hogwarts professor and it's actually relevant. Rights a lot of wrongs with canon and is moderately funny, doesn't take itself too seriously. Very little conflict, some people dislike this; Harry goes around unobstructed by anything for a good while.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

**** I'm one of the people who really didn't like this story, to this day I'm pretty sure I only finished it because I had sunk so much time to it by the point I had soured on it. It is not the worst story, but the amount of cliched bashing that goes on really starts to wear on you eventually, and the authors insistence on calling Voldemort stupid names made me want to strangle them by the end. If it was a funny story it could have worked, but I found it rather cruel spirited by the end.

***** I've started it. The main peeve for me is when both Harry and the Harry/ Gilderoy combo are in the same room and it just keeps refering to both as Harry without distinguishing which one it's talking about.

****** It should become very obvious once the combo start shouting down at people or acting like a holier-than-thou ass.
