** It's not really "headcanon" because I'm not actually thinking of these as "canon" in any way... but I did once, while pondering a next-gen fic, write down a few notes on how I would characterise the various Potter and Weasley children in said fic.

It never got anywhere because I couldn't think of a plot... but I think it would have mostly revolved around Roxanne, for reasons that should become obvious when you read her entry at the end of this list.

So then:

BILL AND FLEUR'S CHILDREN:

Victoire Weasley: Oldest of all the Weasley grandchildren and thinks she's entitled to a lot of respect because of this. A princess. Beautiful, graceful and charming, with a backbone of steel. She knows she's pretty, and at times can get a little demanding, thinking the world owes her -- but she's bad at schoolwork and has quite a few insecurities about this, thinking herself to be stupid and a "brainless beauty." She's a little jealous of her younger siblings, who are both clever and good at school -- and she'll never understand how Dominique, with her brains, can be so lazy and so unconcerned with doing her best.

Dominique Weasley: Second oldest Weasley grandchild. As effortlessly beautiful as her older sister, and also extremely intelligent and magically talented; she could easily have been top of her class if she hadn't been so lazy. A slacker by nature, she's happy to sit back and coast by on her good looks and natural talent instead of doing actual work. Often found curled up and asleep in the most unlikely of places.

Louis Weasley: On the surface a calm, peaceful (and verrry good-looking) boy, but he has a mischievous streak a mile wide and is often the culprit behind the pranks nobody can figure out who instigated. Forms a mischief-making trio together with his cousins James and Fred.

PERCY AND AUDREY'S CHILDREN:

Molly Weasley: Molly is the traditjonal "rebel without a cause"; she likes to think of herself as the "black sheep" of the family -- yet she was sorted into Gryffindor like the others. Molly wants to rebel and screw the establishment, but isn't very good at it --- so far her rebellion has consisted of dyeing her hair black and going to Muggle bars to hang out with the Muggle crowd... and ordering non-alcoholic drinks because she wouldn't want to get drunk.

Lucy Weasley: A somewhat shy and introverted bookworm, bit of a stickler for rules and much preferring to stay in the background. Scrawny and a little mousy, but with the traditional Weasley red hair. Wears glasses like her father. While Lucy is in no way a rebel and usually a stark contrast to her sister, she has been the cause of one of the bigger shocks of the family, namely when she came out as a lesbian.

HARRY AND GINNY'S CHILDREN:

James Sirius Potter: Cheerful, energetic and with a wicked sense of humor; James Potter is pretty much his grandfather reborn, for good and bad. He's very popular because of his charming, witty nature, but he's also a born troublemaker and can occasionally be unthinkingly cruel and borderline bullying in his neverending search for fun and laughs. He's not actively malicious, though, and will feel bad and genuinely try to make amends if he sees he's gone too far. Lois and Fred are his usual partners-in-crime.

Albus Severus Potter: His older brother's polar opposite and the sole family member to be sorted into Slytherin, Albus Severus (don't call him "Al") is a sullen and angry young man who isn't particularly skilled with magic and doesn't get along with a lot of people --- apart from his best friend Scorpius Malfoy, with whom he has developed a very close relationship. He's almost suicidally brave, but is not very good at thinking things through.

Lily Luna Potter: Small, but loud, a bit of a chatterbox who always tells it like it is, Lily Luna ("Lily-Lou" to her brothers) is on the whole a sweet and cheerful girl who unlike her mother before her thoroughly enjoys being the youngest sibling and only girl in the family. She can occasionally get demanding and has a bit of a temper, but compared to James and Albus she's not that much trouble for her parents. She's very close to her uncle Ron.

RON AND HERMIONE'S CHILDREN:

Rose Weasley: A perfect blend of her parents, and the worst part of them both. Rose Weasley is very intelligent and a bit of an overachiever, but also rather haughty and bossy, with a tendency to judge quickly and aggressively, and being slow to forgive or change her mind. Albus used to be her favourite cousin, but she could never quite forgive him that he got Sorted into Slytherin... much less that he keeps hanging out with that annoying Scorpius Malfoy...

Hugo Weasley: One of two Hogwarts-going Weasleys not to be sorted into Gryffindor, Hugo ended up in Hufflepuff. Youngest of the Weasley clan (so far) and a social crusader to the max -- if he sees unfairness or oppression, he's right there to fight it... Even if the unfairness/oppression doesn't exist, or is different than what he thinks. Always eager to help others out, but not very good at actually listening to what they need.

GEORGE AND ANGELINA'S CHILDREN:

Fred Weasley: A fun-loving joker and a prankster; he's always up to some kind of mischief and loves goofing around, but is far more good-natured and less mean-spirited about it than James and Louis can sometimes be. He is usually the conscience of the prankster trio, the one who holds back when the other two look like they're going too far. Extremely protective of his younger sister.

Roxanne Weasley: Third youngest of the Weasley grandchildren, and a Squib. Introverted and bookish, often sullen and a little bitter, she hates being pitied or coddled just because she has no magic but she doesn't feel like she fits in among either wizards or Muggles. Very close to her Aunt Audrey, who is a Muggle, and gets along best with Lucy, who is quiet and not very big on flashy magic -- plus, Lucy does understand at least partly what it's like to not be like everyone else.

*** If you ever write a story about Roxanne the Squib, I'd be interested in reading it.

Also our ideas for Molly and Lucy are actually a lot alike, except Molly is more of a "rebel with a cause" and more bookish than her sister. But it sounds like a lot of your theories come from CC, which is too cliche for me.

**** It doesn't only sound like that -- a lot of my theories DO come from CC. ;) The characterisations of Albus, James, Lily and Rose are taken directly from how they are portrayed in the play.

Unlike a lot of people, I don't hate CC and I won't ignore it when pondering next-generation stories. Oh, the play is by no means my favourite HP thing, and there are several problems with it... but it DID salvage the character of Albus Potter for me.

Before CC, I just thought Albus was the dullest and least interesting character in the franchise. He just seemed to be set up as "Harry 2.0" just without any of the circumstances that made Harry moderately interesting to read about. I couldn't fathom why he was set up as the main character for the next generation. Then I read the script for CC, and changed my mind: The Albus Potter of the play is not only a whiny drama queen, he's an absolute fucking lunatic. Whereas the Albus Potter I read about in most fanfics was so perfect that he was annoying, THIS Albus is so annoying that he's likeable.

Besides, if CC got one thing right, it was the character of Scorpius Malfoy. If nothing else, I'm willing to accept the entire play as canon just to canonise him. I love that guy.

So yes, I incorporate ideas from CC, and I'm not ashamed of it! :D

***** Scorpius is the only salvageable thing from the play for me. Also I can totally see where you're coming from, but unfortunately, both versions of Albus are too annoying for me ;) Those choices are either a glorified version of Harry or an emo/sociopathic horrible combination of Dumbledore and Snape.

That's why I was planning on for the story to focus on James. He was almost utterly ignored in both the Epilogue and CC (we don't even get a description of his appearance), so his character and the repercussions it would have on him are more fascinating for me. (Scorpius will still be a dork, though, just slightly more... Malfoy-ish. Even before the atrocity of CC came out, I imagined him with Hufflepuff tendencies.)

*** I've always imagined that Ginny picked Luna (they were part of the DA together while Harry was off camping) and Sirius (she spent that one summer with him and probably got to know him even better than Harry, who, in retrospect, didn't really seem to care about getting to know Sirius). Albus Severus though is such a selfish name. I get that Harry wanted to honor their work but Ginny was tortured under Snape's reign. Make whatever excuse you want about Snape protecting the students but I never saw evidence of it. Ginny would agree to Albus but not Severus. Part of why I hated DH is because Ginny became a doormat/caricature of a hero's girlfriend (also shown in CC).
