**** Lockhart doing something stupid while in the Chamber could cause Harry to be distracted, or cause another cave-in - thus putting Ginny at more risk.

Sure it looks better for Ron to actively go rescue his sister, but it's not an either-or as in "either be useful in the effort or mind Lockhart".

I called you an incel because you were being belligerent and hilariously immature before I had even left a comment here, and still are continuing to act that way when every single person in this thread recognizes you for the obnoxious man-child that you are.

I don't know if you know this, but incel doesn't always mean /literally involuntarily celibate./ It refers to a very specific kind of fragile, bitchy little man, one you're just the perfect archetype of.

And the reason why he didn't blast his way through was because the Cave was unstable and could have collapsed at any point. Besides, reprimanding a 12/13 year old for not immediately throwing themselves into danger is a bit mean-spirited. I get that it's his sister but as far as he knows the basilisk could be right around the corner ready to eat him.
