:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
ahhh I apologize if I tagged this wrong or formatted it improperly, first time posting here :3 I'm look for a fanfic: i'm pretty sure it's Rose X Scorpius and I am very certain that Ron accidently shoots himself in the foot at some point in the fic (I think because he disapproves of the relationship or smth?? not sure abt this part ). Not sure if it was on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] or ao3, and sorry for the lack of detail. any help finding fic would be very appreciated and thank you :))
