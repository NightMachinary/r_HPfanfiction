In an inversion of the trope, Harry and Dumbledore pretend to have the classic Indy!Harry confrontation as a joke, but it gets misunderstood by anyone who hears it.


** "Harry, my boy, you must understand that I stole money from your accounts only for the Greater Good." Dumbledore said calmly.

"AHHHH YOU SENILE OLD MAN, I KNOW YOU HID IT FROM ME BECAUSE YOU WANTED ME TO BE WEAK WELL NOW I KNOW I'M LORD POTTER-BLACK-GRYFFINDOR-RAVENCLAW-HUFFLEPUFF-SLYTHERIN-MALFOY-MERLIN. I'M DESCENDED FROM GOD MEANING IM GETTING THE POWER OF GOD YOU OLD MAN." Boomed Harry with righteous, noble, selfless, and righteous fury at the old man.

"Harry, my boy, you leave me no choice, this is for the Greater Good" "AVADA KEDAVRA!"

*** -If you think, I'm going to put this thing up my ass, you're a senial, old man!

-My dear boy (whispering) this time turner (end of whispering) can only be safe in your anus while you'll be at Azzkaban. Do it Harry. My boy, please take it for the greater good.

-No, not even to save Sirius, I can't your thing is too big for my hole.

-Then stretch Harry! Stretch for the greater good!

-I can't do it alone! I need help.

-HAGRID! Help Harry here, he requires your assistance.

-Please Hagrid, you must put it in me.

-No, Harry. You are too tight for me to put it in you...

(Severus Snape has never heared such bullshit before. He quickly decided that Longbottom melting another couldron in his class wasn't worth dealing with this insanity today. He didn't run from the door to the headmaster office, proffesor Snape doesn't run, but he doesn't waste time either.)

He swooped. This is crack, so we get to break out the fun adjectives and verbs.

**** You know how the sphincter tightens whenever you feel you are about to die?

Wouldn't that nudge the timeturner just enough? He'll permanently be in the "life flashes before his eyes. Until the end of time.

** This reminds me of the Denarian series where Harry would come to Hogwarts once in a full moon, spread rumors about Dumbledore being a senile old pedophile, Dumbledore would warn the professors to steer clear of Harry because he's quite likely to kill them and/or turn them dark (that particular Harry genuinely would, tbf), but they still had study sessions, worked against Voldemort together and would come save each other's ass whenever it was required.

*** I really really liked how they treated the crossover in that series. It was refreshing and fun and dumbledore was still a badass from what I remember but it tied really well with Harry's powers.

**** The author did extremely well, but also Dresden Files just merge so well with Harry Potter. I'm honestly surprised that the Denarian series is the only finished full-length crossover.

Link to the first fic. There are three total fics in the series plus one oneshot set eight years afterwards on the author's profile.

Do be warned that the series is somewhat... disturbing at points.

***** Logged in to let you know of another complete crossover with Dresden being active during the founders era, it's pretty good too.
