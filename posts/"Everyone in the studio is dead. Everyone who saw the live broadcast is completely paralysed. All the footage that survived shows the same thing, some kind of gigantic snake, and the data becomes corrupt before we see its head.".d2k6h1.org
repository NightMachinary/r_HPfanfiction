In other words, a basilisk gets into a muggle newsroom and kills/petrifies /everyone/, what happens next? How was it (presumably) engineered by a dark lord and why? What kind of explanation will the Office of Misinformation come up with to try and save the Statute of Secrecy? What will happen to the petrified muggles?


** There is no way that doesn't end with the discovery of magic by muggles. It already stretches the imagination to say that a magical society described in the books would actually be able to keep the secret, and you have to rely on "Well, no-one would believe people if they tried to tell the truth".

‚Äã

A massive, widespread, physical evidence that the laws of physics do not function would be the target of intense, very public scrutiny by the entire world. There would be really no way to paper over inconsistencies or surgically target specific people. Every scientific effort in the world would be explicitly trained looking for anomalies, so the standard 'magical side effects get explained away by other phenomena' would probably not slide.

‚Äã

Just a studio shutting down? That could be explained (magically mind wiped) away. Images that can petrify through the television/over the air? You would literally have half of all the military budgets in the world working on the sole project of trying to reproduce it....

Also, people would be scared. You know the whole "Wizards are worried muggles discovering magic will go on a rampage" trope always felt super fake: There is just no way 'we found some people with extra abilities' translates to 'kill them all'. You can explain it away a bit by it just being the paranoia of wizards, but it always seemed farfetched.

‚Äã

But in this scenario? Thousands to hundreds of thousands paralyzed in a way indescribable by the best science in the world, with the constant fear that any screen you look at might kill you? Yea, the fear and paranoia that comes from that could easily result in a VERY hostile reveal compared to your standard discovery...

They why hide? That's the problem with these secrecy debates. Either they're hiding because they were being hunted and afraid of the Muggles, or they're hiding because they want to be left alone.

There is a /huge/ difference in hiding what no-one is looking for and hiding what everyone is looking for. At the very least we are never shown wizards dealing with the latter so it would be a new/stressful, potentially dramatic situation...

Reguardless, once magic has been acknowledged, even a single creature, two very challenging new realities occur:

1. Muggles will be actively developing technology to find/understand magic. They would have to after such an event. This would not bode well for secrecy.
2. Perhaps more important, you can no longer assume anyone who goes ranting the truth to a muggle newspaper would be ignored. "Well if you told who would believe you" is a pretty common idea. That is completely out the door after something like this.

IMO, that sound extremely realistic. Human history is full of people killing others because of their differences, war being started because of different beliefs... And let's not forget about the military and various governments, who, I think, would take a "you're either working for us or a danger to us" stance.

** First, given what happened to Colin's camera, it's not clear that the basilisk's gaze would actually transmit over the airwaves instead of just destroying the equipment, and that's before you account for the six-second delay that live broadcasts usually have, but we can assume it does for now. Second, we don't know for certain, but people who are petrified would probably register as dead to muggle science--as in no signs of life--but they also don't decay and are as immobile as stone while still appearing to be flesh and blood. I'm not sure muggle biology or materials science would be capable of accounting for that.

But even if you handwave that, I think it would be an end to the Statute of Secrecy. It would be impossible to hide from the muggles that something defying the laws of physics was happening. There would be enormous pressure for muggle-borns especially to reveal the existence of magic, and even if the Ministry prevented it from getting into the muggle news, it would spread by word of mouth, and people would /believe it/.

The petrified muggles would be in a serious predicament, though. They could only be revived by planting enormous quantities of mandrakes, which are things that could be just as deadly as the basilisk itself if misused. At that point, I feel like the whole thing just dissolves into a lot of infighting, and I don't know who comes out on top.

As for covering it up, it would be virtually impossible. Someone investigating is bound to happen to know that magic exists, if nothing else. The only way for magical beings to stay hidden would be unbreakable vows forced on everyone, and obliviating anyone a muggleborn ever met prior to joining the magical world.

** Hiding it would require something like a fidelius charm on knowledge of magic- it'd be very complex magic on a global scale. Granted, I also think that's the only way magic stays hidden in an age where everyone has a camera on their phone and is constantly connected to the internet, so I assume that they figured something like that out.

** If it happened in real life, I'd assume that some government project went really really bad. I definitely wouldn't believe that a magical society existed lol I think this would just lead to a temporary magical martial law in the wizarding world while the muggles argue until they find themselves a valid reason and stop giving a shit.

** As for why it's fairly simple, some dark lord has decided the statute of secrecy only exists to protect muggles from wizards, when wizards are clearly superior and should be controlling the world.

This breaks the statute of secrecy nice and thoroughly, giving the wizarding world in general little option but to sieze control of the muggle one, for even those who aren't prejudiced have little interest in being ruled by muggles.\\
It also provides an excellent first strike against the muggles, with a massive body count.

This is the sort of reveal that can really only lead to conflict, no peaceful relations here.

This basalisk lord isn't just relying on the superiority of wizards in combat (and since all his troops wear shield hats and cloaks to protect agaisnt surprise attacks and dwell in unplottable muggle repelling areas they have a very strong advantage indeed), he's got basilisks with portkeys.\\
it's not just a single TV studio, it's every live broadcasting studio in the world, parliament, the white house, the kremlin and similar locations. Billions of muggles fall in the first attack and their only real options for fighting back are to bombard their own cities with artillery and aircraft, as noone can actually aim at the things withough keeling over.

** It is put down to an anthrax attack by a disturbed individual. The CDC/other equivalent organizations are obviously run by wizards, so they cure the 'infected' and everything's fine. None of the talking heads on the news mention the broadcast, so any connection to watching the broadcast is put down to coincidence or fringe conspiracy theories.

Have Alex Jones or another convenient idiot start some kind of obviously false but mundane rumor ("ALL OF THE INFECTED PEOPLE ARE ACTORS! IT'S THE JEWS! WAKE UP, SHEEPLE!") and everyone will go about their day.
