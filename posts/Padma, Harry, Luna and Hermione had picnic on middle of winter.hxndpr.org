Padma, Harry, Luna and Hermione had picnic on middle of winter and got points for required charm work by Flitwik. Also girls got themselves pregnant by Harry without telling him because they thought that Harry won't survive Voldemort's efforts. Padma didn't even sleep with him and Luna got her sperm sample.
