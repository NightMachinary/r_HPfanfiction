The entire Inquisitor Carrow series by Littlewhitecat is about 150k words each, totaling about 600k about Harry having grown up in the 41st millennium of Warhammer 40k, having been summoned back and deciding that the world is full of Heretics and needs the love of the Emperor.

***** The summary of it is that Harry's Aunt Petunia is using him as relief(purely oral), because of Harry doing a good job he now has his own real room,proper food, and new clothes as this goes on, a new teacher(Andromeda Tonks) takes special interest him and starts tutoring Harry in many subjects such as Latin. During this time Ms.Tonks finds out what Aunt Petunia is doing with Harry and indulges herself aswell as telling Harry about his past, Harry then recives the Hogworts letter then Ms.Tonks takes Harry shopping for supplies but messed up the travel spell which introduces him to Narcissa Malfoy who knows who he is but Harry lets slip his relationship to Ms.Tonk who he now calls Mistress Tonks Narcissa than gets Harry to sign a contract with her to him about lordship and some bedroom fun. So Harry now at Hogworts is sorted to Hufflepuff, saves Hermoine from the troll, confronts the shade in the forest, claims Lordship of Potter, and thats the first year. Second year Harry joins quaditch, kills a big snake, gains Lordship of House Black. Third year is here Harry is the train to Hogworts but the train is attacked by Dementors and ends there.

** I've recently read Letters from the dark by escoger, it's a sev/lily fic.

The writing is solid, I found the story to be very engaging I couldn't put my phone down at all lmao. Basically the fic is about lily being pen pals with someone (no prizes for guessing who the pen pal is lmao) and through these letters lily has her worldview challenged and she finds companionship. I really like the fics where they showcase a strong friendship between both because I can see there being some similarities between both to bring them together and to let them stay friends till 5th year (and maybe if it weren't for their differing ideologies, they could have been friends or more for longer).

And the best part of this fic in my opinion is how this fic really challenges lily to understand how Severus must have felt during his time at hogwarts and the reasons for his subsequent actions. And of course both of them go through some trials that exposes their weaknesses but they do take effort to become better. This fic really made me feel the struggle, anger Severus may have had but all this is done through Lily's POV so you're understanding along with lily. And i could feel the confusion and upset feelings that lily has in trying to navigate her own relationship with Severus.

I really enjoyed this fic because usually sev/lily fics have both of them compromising on their views or Severus giving into Lily's views but this one was different because this one really had lily truly understanding the underlying emotions behind his actions.

(Hi [[/u/thrawnca][u/thrawnca]] I don't know if you've read this fic maybe you would wanna give it a try! And also I just read the latest chap of Peace not promised and saw that you were a beta reader, congrats!!!)

linkffn(Letters From The Dark by Escoger)

Warning: I think that since this is a sev/lily fic marauder fans would generally not read this fic but just in case there's a marauder fan out there who reads sev/lily I just wanna say that the marauders are not portrayed in a favorable light, so be careful.

***** Just finished this. It seemed like a much rockier road for them than The Peace Not Promised, but of course there are /decades/ off-screen in canon that contributed to that. It makes sense that for their relationship to work the first time around would require some painful adjustments.

At first they were harsh enough with each other that I sometimes wondered why they persisted, but it was nice to see them settle back into friendship and have some open and honest communication.

It was also interesting to see the Marauders display the dark side of Gryffindor values. Courage is essential, and to hold to one's principles in the face of changing circumstances can be noble - but it can also be an apt description of prejudice and upholding an oppressive system. From a certain point of view, the American Civil War happened because slave-owners firmly stuck to the principles they believed in. Conversely, although JKR apparently intended for Harry to be a Jesus-like figure, she seems to have quite overlooked the fact that sacrificing whatever stands in the way of an overarching ambition - clearly a Slytherin principle - was an integral part of Jesus' preaching, from "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart," to "seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you," to "if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not that thy whole body shouldst be cast into hell." Courage and ambition, and learning and even hard work, are all valuable but morally neutral in and of themselves; the question is to what ends they are directed.

****** I think another reason why it's a rockier road is the environmental influence on them is unrelenting. Even if they be as they are their peers and the environment won't let them be and therefore they have to make greater changes for their continued state to exist.

And wow your last para was pretty insightful. Human beings all have the same potential it's just what we choose to apply it to. Most people cant really see eye to eye anymore when their beliefs differ which is a shame because most of the time even when their beliefs differ the main driving emotions behind their beliefs tend to be similar.

And it seems like you included a trait from each of the houses in your last statement lmao that was nice :) Now I really wanna read a fic where they explore the darker aspects of each house, like a dark foursome with 1 from each house that would be super cool

****** I've always been of the opinion that the biggest reason their friendship failed in canon was a lack of communication about their clashing world views -- they'd rather pretend everything was fine, to devastating end. It makes perfect sense to me that as penpals, they're able to properly reconcile by truly talking to each other about their differences.

** I'm a big fan of the Innocent series, so am trying out The Wise One, which has a similar premise: Sirius escaped when Harry was eight, and collected him from the Dursleys. However, where Innocent had Sirius and Harry bunker down in Grimmauld Place under a Fidelius Charm while the country searched for them, The Wise One instead has Dumbledore assume that Sirius must have killed Harry, and focus instead on preparing Neville, while Sirius and Harry wander the world.

Haven't read all that far yet, but it's certainly faster paced than Innocent, and a bit grittier, without the stability of a single home.

Edit: Gave up on it when 13-year-old Harry hired a prostitute and Sirius apparently had no problem with this.

** A fic I've recently read is Lily Bud by schak. So far, it follows Lily through her first six years of Hogwarts. The Lily in this story feels very real, and is not without flaws, flaws she is often unaware of. The portrayal of the Marauders is nuanced, and there is no Snape apologism, except on Lily's part while she refuses to see him as what he is becoming.

Another recent read of mine was Cheating Death by Seriously Sam. In this story, the Unspeakables manage to pull Sirius from the veil, and Auror Harry is tasked with investigating the case. I recommend this story mostly for its portrayal of the Potter family.

  Before Lily Potter, there was Lily Evans. Before a martyr of the Light, there was a little girl that had to find her place in a world at war about her right to live. Lily Evans wasn't just a prologue or side note of other people's lives. She was the protagonist of her own story. This is Lily's story, told in small moments and oneshots.

** I read the latest chapter of "House Potter for Children in Need", G, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22185070/chapters/52964074][house potter for children in need by ailec_12]]). It's an interesting and different kind of de-age story centered around a suddenly eight-year-old Severus Snape. Most stories have turned into a child and then cared for by Harry. Instead, he's taken care of by Lily and James after things diverge a little from canon, and Peter is found out and the Potters continue to stay safe in hiding. It's interesting reading him and the Potters figure out each other and bond in their weird situation.

Not this week, but pretty recently still, I read a story in a sort of similar vein called "Little And Broken, But Still Good", G, linkao3(little and broken, but still good by WindySun). It is also a de-aged Severus story. It takes place right after the final battle where instead of dying, Severus is turned into a nine-year-old and Harry decides to take him in because there's not a lot else to do with him. There are only a few chapters so far and it's been sort of interesting see how Harry reacts to this very young Severus and how he handles him and his prickly nature as well as help him understand the new world he's basically woken up in.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Ashes-of-Chaos][Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos]] - A WBWL fic that's heavily inspired by Prince of Slytherin. However, it takes ideas from a sufficiently wide number of stories that it avoids being only a clone and manages to be something unique. The AU elements include a significantly different female Voldemort and a manipulative Dumbledore who are both quite successfully portrayed as terrifyingly competent. linkffn(13507192)

*** I just finished reading this, and as a big fan of WBWL fic, I'm incredibly disappointed! The only redeeming factors are Lady Voldemort / Emily Riddle / Amelia Hurst, and a competent, interesting Peter Pettigrew.

It takes "inspired by Prince of Slytherin" to a whole other level (cramming in elements from PoS that do nothing to build the story), is poorly written, and so full of frustrating points. If the characters were all 6-10 years older, I would deal with more of it. I can suspend disbelief for so long with good fic and with children being very competent when it's well executed and internally consistent within the world building, but that is not this fic. You have some children being smoother political operators than seasoned adults and you have children the same age or older whose only function is to be stupid enough to make the other children look smarter. It's like the Goblet of Fire meme, but replace Film!Dumbledore with Charlus and Ron, and Harry is the book version calmly stating things.

Essentially, Charlus Potter /is/ Harry Potter, while the Harry Potter of this story is the most cliched Slytherin!SuperGenius!Smug!Entitled!Misanthropic! I've ever read in a WBWL.

The writing makes it worse, everything from the overly long author notes at the beginning of each chapter and 4 different styles of text to explain speech, to the awful repetition (half the charactes clearly have Tourette syndrome with all the lip and eye twitching), mistaken word choice, and poorly constructed dialogue.

EDIT: I also want to add that it's frustrating that Harry is oh so smart and oh so talented, he's doing 6th year spells in the first term at Hogwarts, is years ahead in reading the Hogwarts curriculum through self-study, and nothing comes of it! If he's going to be so good at magic, so smooth at dealing with difficult situations and conversations, that has to mean something or go somewhere.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

** I finished Exile!! It is very introspective and somehow philosophical! Anyone who is purely fascinated by the complexity of the character of Draco Malfoy (rather than simply lured by his appearance) would definitely enjoy reading this book!! ‚ù§Ô∏èI love how Draco was portrayed here in a truly realistic manner: he gradually got to realize his limitations and embrace his cowardice, mediocrity as well as vulnerability. After struggling with the reality, finally he reconciled with himself, accepting who he was, and grew into a better man in the Muggle world.

Now I am reading The Green Girl for some fun reading.

** Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe

I'm a fan of powerful! Independent! Harry fics and I was hoping this would fit the bill. But oh boy a few chapters in and it just gets worse and worse. The writing is incredibly inconsistent and as Harry starts learning he apparently starts having incredibly inappropriate/gross/misogynistic thoughts about the girls around him. There was a particularly gross and out of place one about Susan Bones' in a previous chapter, but I pushed through until I got this one as he's waiting for the Yule ball and had to nope out.

‚ÄúEspecially Cho intrigued him, as she wore a white and festive Kimono, that showed enough skin to entice interesting thoughts, but didn't look like the outfit of a common whore.‚Äù
