a story where harry salvages ancient shipwrecks to salvage gold and other antiques using the point me spell and the summoning charm and becomes one of the greatest treasure hunters of the modern age. perhaps even some curse breaking and rival muggle treasure hunter who keeps up by using advanced technology.

is there a story that fits this?
