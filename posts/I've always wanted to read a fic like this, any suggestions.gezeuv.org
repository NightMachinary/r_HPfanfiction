** Closest I've read may or may not be to your taste since it's a Hellsing crossover

Harry separates from the wizarding world and befriends a vampire. He visits her a lot and they read and discuss philosophy, history, literature and such. Later on he tends to visit outdoor cafes to read and drink wine. His teasing of Seras made me laugh quite a bit too. Some bashing of Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Draco.

Your post just made me think of this story.

  After a rather painful revelation and deciding to try to leave the Wizarding World behind, Harry accepts an invitation. One that may very well put him at odds with the Hellsing Organization.

** Damn, that sounds like a really interesting story idea. I saddly don't know a story like the prompt. The closest thing I can think of is Hero's Assemble! linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781]]) where Harry opens up his own pub in America to get away from the wizarding world.

Do you think you can link that whole tumbler post. I am curious to what else was going to follow that prompt.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

*** I wasn't sure if I was allowed to, the whole post is super cool. I didn't see anything in the rules saying I couldn't and the Tumblr doesn't seem to have any personal info so.... [[https://marauders4evr.tumblr.com/post/175528443977/harry-isnt-quite-out-of-his-teens-when-it-fully]]
