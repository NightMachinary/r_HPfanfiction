Looking for any fics where harry sleeps around a lot (doesn't matter with who) just as a horny teenager, without it being some soul bond or harem relationship.


** I shall choose to take the title of your request literally.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry."

  "Yes, headmaster?"

  "Why are you in my bed?"

  "Because Fawkes's perch was too small, professor."

  "What I mean to say is, for the past 3 weeks you have been seen sleeping in Ron Weasley's bed, Neville Longbottom's bed, Hermione Granger's bed, Luna Lovegood's bed, Draco Malfoy's bed, Professor McGonagall's bed, the house-elves dormitories, the centaurs' caves, Mrs. Weasley's bed at the Burrow, a couch at Madam Malkin's...it would not be inaccurate to say that you have been sleeping in every possible location except your own bed, and I was wondering if you wanted to talk about it."

**** Harry sleeps around with a couple of different girls, but by the last third of the story, he's with Fleur, Tonks, and Luna, while having Narcissa on the side. The relationship is actually one of the better portrayed poly relationships in fanfiction, they all have a relationship with each other, and the girls aren't just there as a sex puppet for Harry to use.

Harry sleeps around during HBP. Including Hannah, Romilda Vane, Gwenog Jones, Marietta, Pansy, Rita and Daphne. Especially the first chapter (Hannah) has a great level of detail while still keeping it believable as "horny teenagers".

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
