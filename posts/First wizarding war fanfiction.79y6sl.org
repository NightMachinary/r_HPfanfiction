Could anyone recommend fanfiction stories that focus on the first wizarding war and that include characters mentioned in Hp series who took part in this war?

  Mac Macdonald loves working at Reynolds Ranch even though the double alliteration would make a lesser man quit on the spot. Every summer he brings the flock up to the best pastures on the Snapridge mountains. Normally alone. This summer, Frank Reynolds thinks his own son really ought to get involved with the ranch. Absolutely no one agrees with this.
