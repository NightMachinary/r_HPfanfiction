** Harry and Fleur is probably the hardest ship to write well. There are so many easy outs that the pairing has been saturated by soulbonds and straight up smut.

I am going to assume it's set during *GoF.* Here's my advice.

- Don't break the Trio up. The interplay between Fleur and Hermione is a treasure drove of drama, look at the scene in DH where Hermione dismisses Fleur as a bit of an airhead and Harry defends her by mentioning her selection as school champion. That's ready made story, use it!

- Don't break the Trio up. Yes i wrote it twice. Ron's struggle with jealousy and his susceptibility to Fleur's allure is rich with opportunity. You have a premise, a conflict and a conclusion just sitting there waiting for you to use it. Ron going from drooling to jealous to repairing his relationship with Harry is potential gold. Don't bash Ron, make him grow up!

- Harry has to earn Fleur's respect. Harry really is just a leetle boy at the start of GoF. How are you going to change that? Remember that Harry isn't and really shouldn't be an super powerful wizard. He is the underdog, that's where the drama with the fight with Voldemort lies. Harry's greatest strengths are elsewhere. Find a way for Fleur to discover them.

- Harry and Fleur have a lot in common. Harry is isolated by his fame, Fleur by her appearance. Use that sense of isolation. The journey from conflict to understanding works here. It brings them closer, they develop empathy for each other and makes the romance more believable.

- Don't take Harry shopping... just no. Fleur shouldn't be a tool for you to fix Harry. She has her own needs and wants, keep those in mind. Please don't go to France, please don't have Harry adopted, please don't have a marriage contract.

- Please don't feel the need to bring them perfectly together by the end of GoF. They are both young and inexperienced. The don't really know the steps of the dance. Not having them as boyfriend girlfriend at years end isn't a failure, it's grounded. Look at how long it took Harry to work out his feelings for Ginny in canon. Foreplay damn it!

- Most of the fics I've read never have any real setbacks in the relationship. They are hormonal teenagers under immense stress. They are volatile, their interactions should reflect that. Develop trust, break trust, hurt the other and finally reconciliation and growth.

  I'll probably add more to this later as I think of stuff. Good luck. Harry and Fleur forever!

*** If I could, I'd upvote this post more than once. I'm not much of a writer, but I'm pretty sure I've read every half-decent Harry/Fleur fic out there (as well as most of the bad ones), and I have to say, this is all excellent advice. While I don't necessarily mind most of the cliches you've told OP to avoid, I would certainly love to read a fic like the one you describe. VIVE LA...oh bother, does Harry/Fleur even have a ship name?

**** I've seen people refer to it as Fleurry.

Apart from that, even though I love the the H/F pairing every time I see it discussed here I've just got leave what another user wrote on another thread a couple years ago:

#+begin_quote
  *Shippin'*

  *Harry/Ginny* - Girl falls in love with her prince charming. They marry and have kids. They name their kids after people they don't know very well, some of which have screwed them rather directly.

  *Harry/Hermione* - Girl falls in love with her best friend.

  *Harry/Hufflepuff* - Guy falls in love with the nice girl.

  *Harry/Ravenclaw* - Guy falls in love with brainy girl who isn't Hermione? Author likes Asian Amateur porn.

  *Harry/Slytherin* - Hatesex is glorious.

  These happen. These aren't hyper difficult. These are tropes which are all over our literary works, our culture, all over our every day life, in our relationships and others. We have a POINT OF CONNECTION to them.

  Now... then it gets a bit... Harrier. Bwahahaha.

  *Harry/Tonks* - Guy digs the police chick. They have kinky shapeshifting sex and fight crime. Author might like pegging.

  *Harry/Luna* - Guy falls in love with the insane girl

  *Harry/Sue* - Guy inherits magical powers from the four founders and has a massive penis that the prepz hate.

  The quality severely deteriorates. You have to jump through holes. Tonks may have a personality that's young, but Harry and her have to find a point of connection. Easy, he joins the Unspeakables for an unforgettable summer in being cleared to use the Killing Curse. Ugh. Luna is insane. How many of you know insane girls like Luna? Well, I have a friend who's a little bit of a schizophrenic, maybe she's like him? I have a bunch of Morning Glory seeds to chomp on, maybe I can replicate schizo in my head? Mary Sue? That one's a joke.

  Then...

  We have... the ships that are fucking really, really difficult.

  *Harry/Blaise's Mom* - Harry becomes the Don. He kills people. He enjoys cocaine with his afternoon tea.

  *Harry/fem!character* - You'd best explain how genderbending's going to work out, dude. etc etc.

  *And then.* /We have THE ship./

  *THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.*

  */Harry/Fleur/*

  /A LEETLE BOY HAS TO IMPRESS A FRENCH SEX SYMBOL FROM A DIFFERENT RACE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARE A PLACE ON THE 0-10 SCALE WITH A VICTORIA SECRET'S ANGEL WHO HAPPENS TO BE THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HIM AND IS THE MOST COMPETENT STUDENT IN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL WITH THE POWER TO MAKE MEN FALL HEAD OVER HEELS BY EXISTING./

  *Good. Fucking. Luck.*

*** Thank you for the advice! And yes I will not do a marriage contract or anything like that! I will however make a Harry a year older or fleur a year younger what's better? Also I will make Harry slightly more confident but that'll be more so about being a seeker. He'll still be nervous around girls etc..it will go up to 7th year in the process of trying to find away for fluer to stay at hogwarts til then and also for harry to actually be their for 7th year

** My advice:

- Don't break the Trio up.

- Fleur is intelligent, powerful, and has access to valuable resources. Therefore, adding Fleur to Harry's team should significantly improve their situation.

- You need to find a good way to steer Fleur away from Bill Weasley.

** Don't make this a fix it fic. To echo a point made by [[/u/faeriniel]], adding Fleur is going to make a LOT of things easier. Why does Hermione need to look up the stunning spell when our bff Fleur can show us? Etc. Etc. Adding Fleur needs to come with a cost; harry is spending his time dating Fleur and not doing some of the things he did in cannon. What does he lose or miss out on? Maybe harry spends the summer in France after 4th year. Does his relationship with Sirius-never the most stable of pepple-suffer? Or does Sirius follow him to France to keep an eye on him? (thus opening up more areas for drama and plot).

** My list of do/donts for Harry/Fleur

*Don't over-complicate things

*Don't use the word "allure" at all. It's not canon.

*Don't change either of their ages. It ruins half the challenge and cheapens it. 14 + 17 year old is not the craziest or most unrealistic thing.

*Veela-bond shit and other gimmicks to get them together without any work. Just don't.

*Don't do the normal 'woe is me, I'm beautiful yet no man can see me for me' shit. Super lame.
