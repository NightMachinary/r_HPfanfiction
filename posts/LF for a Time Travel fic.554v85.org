In this fic, both Harry and Hermione go back; the twist being that the Light lost the war and Harry has spent the intervening years as an assassin/burgler/etc for higher by the pureblood regime. During that time he got a nickname which I thought was Vulpes, but I can't find the fix when I search for that name.

Thank you for any help provided.


** Are you sure it was in English? I seem to remember something similar from Russian ficbook, but I may be wrong...

  Voldemort was dead, but his rule and his ideals lived on. The Resistance had failed, their Saviour had fallen, and Hermione Granger went back in time to fix things. Unfortunately someone else tagged along for the ride.
