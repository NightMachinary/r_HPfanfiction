Both should know by book 6 that you don't need to be an adult to accomplish significant things, and Hermione ought to know of Muggle cases where criminals or terrorists used children to do their dirty work.


** Harry: I think Draco's a Death Eater

Hermione: No, there's no evidence.

Harry: Remember when he screamed blood slurs in a crowded hallway? How he hoped that he could help the heir murder people as a 12 year old?

Ron: No evidence.

Harry: The guy who takes pride in harassing us? The son of one of Voldemort's most favored, the one who lived in the same building as Voldemort for over a year? We are talking about the same Malfoy, right? The pointy racist one?

Hermione: Yes, that Malfoy. He's not a Death Eater.

Harry: HE'S PANICKING ABOUT NOT COMPLETING HIS TASK AND IS SPENDING TONS OF TIME WITH POLYJUICED BODYGUARDS IN A ROOM THAT CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING? DOES ANYTHING STRIKE YOU AS ODD ABOUT THIS?

Ron and Hermione: Kumbaya...

*** It made no sense for them to not at the very least suspect Draco of being one, considering that he hadn't exactly been all that subtle about his views on Muggleborns over the years.

For me, it was the first big indicator that Rowling was willing to trash characterization in favour of the plot; and in book 6 the plot required, for some reason, for Harry's suspicions to be ignored, despite years of behaviour on the part of Draco Malfoy indicating that he was a true believer in the Pureblood Supremacy ideology espoused by Voldemort's followers.

** Hermione jerked at the touch on her arm, her quill drawing a black line across the parchment. "Hey-" she started to say then stopped. It was Harry, his expression set and intense.

"Abandoned classroom, one level down. Five minutes," he said without preamble.

"My essay! I need to finish-"

Very deliberately and without breaking eye contact, Harry picked up her pot of ink and poured it over the neatly stacked sheets. "Five minutes". Then he disappeared in the direction of Ron and Lavender who were lip locked in a corner of the common room.

Hermione scowled at Harry's retreating back then down at her work. It wasn't the disaster it might have been in her First Year; a flick and the spilled ink collected itself into a blob on the end of her wand; another, and it flowed neatly back into the pot. Still, this was schoolwork, important schoolwork, she had half a mind to not go... oh, who was she kidding. Banishing her books and notes back to the dormitory, she headed out.

--------------

Hermione had expected it but she still glared to see Ron leaning against the teacher's desk in the abandoned classroom. "I hope you don't expect us-" she started.

"I don't care," Harry interrupted. "He could be fucking Pansy Parkinson on your favourite table in the library." Ron made a disgusted sound. "It doesn't matter."

"But-"

"You think Voldemort," Hermione couldn't suppress a little squeak of fear, "is going to stop while you sort out your love lives?"

"Alright". Hermione folded her arms. "What's so important?"

"Malfoy. His father is a Death Eater; he's been an open advocate for Blood Purism and genocide since we've known him. He has Crabbe and Goyle standing guard under Polyjuice while he does something in the Room of Requirements. What are we going to do about it?"

"Dumbledore-"

For the first time, Harry seemed to lose his cool. He started pacing back and forth. "Don't say Dumbledore has a plan. Did he have a plan last year when that foul woman was running wild?" He stopped and swung out his arm, the white, scarred letters still visible. "It took the six of us blundering about to restore him as Headmaster. Just like every year, there's a disaster and I have to fix it. This time I'm not waiting for whatever nasty little surprise Malfoy has in store."

His expression became pleading. "Come on, guys. Just like old times."

Hermione looked at him for a moment then drew in a breath. This could break their friendship but the words had been boiling inside for six months. "You lied!"

Harry jerked in surprise. "What-"

"You lied about learning Occlumency. You complain about Dumbledore; who was it who thought the same mind reading trick would work on You-Know-Who twice? Who thought they knew better than everyone else?"

Just like always when she was nervous, Hermione found herself babbling. "I know you think I was nagging you about Occlumency. Hermione says eat your greens, blah, blah, blah. I just don't know how to talk so you'll listen. And I was right about your vision of Sirius but I couldn't make you understand. We were supposed to be your friends and you lied. Yes, I'm a bitch for saying 'I told you so' when you lost your godfather. But I could have been killed; we could have been killed. And I have a scar from here to here." Hermione slashed her hand from shoulder to hip. "A big purple rope. I had to hide it from my parents under long sleeves and high collars all summer. And I know I'm not pretty and I shouldn't care but now no-one will ever want to see me na-naked."

Abruptly, she realised she was crying, the room blurry through her tears. When her vision cleared, Harry looked stricken while Ron had advanced to stand close. Tentatively he reached his hands and took hers, his thumb rubbing gently across her fingers. "Come on, 'Mione, all a boy cares about is that you have a pair of tits. And we thought you were beautiful when you were a tiny thing ninety percent hair with big buck teeth, chattering a mile a minute."

Hermione hiccuped a laugh. "Such a smooth talker, Ronald."

Beside them, Harry coughed, "If you two are done flirting?" Ron let go and stepped away, as he did so Hermione inexplicably felt a little colder. Harry continued, his voice turning serious, "I know I keep things to myself too much. I... The Dursleys... I'll try harder. But it doesn't make me wrong about Malfoy. What are we going to do?"

Ron smiled grimly. "We follow him. Don't give the prick a second's peace. One person under the Cloak from the moment he leaves the dorms to the moment he goes back; another with the map to keep track of him for changeovers. When he summons the Room, bam, stun him."

"But it could take days. Class-"

"Get the DA involved. Make up a rota. Merlin knows, they all hate Malfoy since the Inquisitorial Squad."

For the first time, Harry looked happier. "And when we've got him?"

Hermione thought for a moment. "I'm sure I can get Slughorn to let me make Veritaserum as an extra-curricular project." She winked at Harry. "I'll even let you tell me if the Prince has any tips for making it."

Especially if it offers the potential to do me harm?

Hermione: well Harry when you put it that way it's hard not to see there being a possibility.

Harry: Look I'm just saying let's find out what he's doing, if he's doing anything, we can prevent it, and if he's doing nothing all we did was waste some time. He's been acting odd lately, and not that Malfoy isn't a braggart but his father is a death eater, most of his close relatives are death eaters, for all we know voldemort could be holed up at malfoy manor right now.

Voldemort's non existent nose tickled and caused him to sneeze. "I don't know how, but I know Potter is involved in this..." -my lord? Said Malfoy Sr. "Silence fool, Crucio!"

** They do believe him later on when there's more evidence: Crabbe and Goyle taking Polyjuice and the House Elves seeing Draco go into the RoR. To me a lot of the skepticism, particularly Hermoine, reads like playing Devil's Advocate.

What's weird (and crying out for a fix-it) is how passive everyone, including Harry is. He tries for ninety minutes to break into the Room, gets interrupted by Tonks and then seems to forget about it. The explanation for why he can't wait for Draco to emerge or follow him about is: he might miss class!

Rather inverts the fanon trope that Dumbledore placed Harry with the Dursleys to make him more tractable. First and Second Year Harry is a devious little shit who happily lies to his teachers; Sixth and Seventh Year Harry lets Dumbledore lead him around by the nose.

--------------

/[In the Great Hall, Harry and Hermione are eating breakfast.]/

*Hermione:* /[slams down her utensils]/ Fine! I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, but the Cruciatus crosses the line. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* Um... OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practising nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

*Harry:* I guess that's as good a solution as any.

--------------

/[Late June of 1997, Hogwarts Express, after Dumbledore's funeral.]/

*Harry:* Hermione, is it just me, or have we forgotten something important?

*Hermione:* Well, it can't be that importan... bugger.

--------------

/[Spring 1998, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Ron:* I am a man of many tale... What.

*Hermione:* /[with a sigh]/ It's a long story of procrastination. Just leave him there for now.​

--------------

/[Later the same day, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Harry:* Open! Open!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Ron:* Yeah, you are, mate.

*Harry:* I guess Parseltongue was from Voldemort as well...

--------------

/[Even later...]/

*Ron:* Hshsshssshss! Shshshs! Hsshhh!

*Hermione:* Come on, Ron! I know you can do it!

*Ron:* Hsssshshshshs! Hshshhhs! Shsshsh!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

*Ron:* Honh ahgue oeh him. Mahfoy ih a phat.

*Harry:* That he is, mate.

** I think the disbelief was pretty fair, especially on Hermione's end. Harry didn't have any solid evidence to back his claim except his gut, and the last time Hermione and Ron blindly followed Harry on his gut, Sirius ended up dead and both of them had to spend weeks recovering in the hospital wing. She's the type to not make the same mistake twice, and so when she asked for proof and Harry couldn't provide, it was pretty fair for her not to follow.

Ron, on the other hand, was completely out of character. Ron has never turned away from an adventure - especially not on something as dumb as lack of proof. Ron followed Harry whenever he asked because that's the kind of friend he is. Combined with the fact that it was Malfoy of all people that Harry was tracking, and Ron should have readily jumped on the mission the first time Harry asked.

Malfoy's bigotry doesn't automatically mean membership in the Death Eaters. And that's a big enough accusation to warrant actual proof - proof that Harry could not provide.

Besides the lack of proof, you are also discounting one of Hermione's greatest characteristics: her ability to give the benefit of the doubt. She is the person who kept believing that Snape was a good guy until he killed Dumbledore. She was the one who reassured Harry that Dumbledore loved him despite reading Skeeter's book. She advocated for Kreacher despite the fact that he got Sirius killed. Hermione's belief in the goodness of people is legendary.

Malfoy is a cowardly 16-year-old. He's a bully but nothing more, at least as far as Hermione was concerned. Harry was levying huge claims with no evidence to back it up, and up until said evidence turns up, Hermione will give him the benefit of the doubt. Coupled with Harry's last gut instinct getting Sirius killed, it makes perfect sense to me that she refused to follow him.

Malfoy has been openly gleeful about the idea of Hermione dying and being sexually assaulted

****** Dying I remember, but is it cannon the thing about sexual assault being part of the DE's MO? Yeah, I know that in real life there is plenty of that going around, even more so in times of war, but with polyjuice, transfiguration and that daydream candy it just seems kind of redundant in HP even discounting JKR's tendency of ignoring the existence of sex in the books (which, fair enough, it is not everyone's cup of tea and if she doesn't feel comfortable writing it than no big deal).

Edit: in fact I think the closest thing to sexual assault happening in cannon was Umbridge with the centaurs, and even that was mostly just implied from some of the myths about centaurs.

********** Yeah, alright, this /is/ terrible and definitely sexual harassment. Though it probably wouldn't be recognized as such in the nineties -then again my frame of reference for this assessment is only from what was considered appropriate in movies of the period I've watch (which are mostly placed in North American) so if anyone was living or was friends with someone living in Britain at the period please correct me.

***** Circumstantial evidence is enough to investigate. Especially after five years of struggling against the Death Eaters. After almost dying in the Ministry, it makes no sense that Hermione wouldn't want to investigate a potential threat like that.

****** It's a Veil of Death/Deathly Hallows scenario. Harry was spouting conspiracy theorist bullshit, so she /overcorrected/ and absolutely refused to entertain him. It's a well-documented mistake she makes. Her almost dying in the ministry last year probably compounded the need for denial on her end.

I agree that she probably should have entertained Harry more than she actually did in the book, but it's still not as out of character as everyone is claiming as it is. There's a lot of precedent for how she acted in HBP.

Edit: Anyway, let's just agree to disagree.

******* It wasn't "conspiracy bullshit theories". "Hey, you know that neighbour's kid? Who has been shouting racists slurs at people since he was elven? Who has lied to the police to get the pet of that PoC killed? Who has bullied PoC whenever he could? Who wished that PoC died when there was a killer going after them? Whose dad was arrested for trying to murder PoC? He's acting suspicious this year" is not a "conspiracy theory". It's a damning amount of evidence. Hell, if this were a criminal investigation, Draco would've spent more time at the cop's than at Hogwarts because he is so obviously among the main suspects for joining the KKK.

***** I can't think of any part of the books where Hermione actually gave people the benefit of the doubt. The examples you gave with Snape and Dumbledore are not her giving the benefit of the doubt. Hermione had an almost obsessive respect for authority figures. Supporting Kreature I believe was obvious given the fact that she created S.P.E.W.

As far as the lack of evidence Harry followed Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes a store known for selling dark products where he saw the owner look scared after Malfoy showed his arm. That is enough evidence to at least investigate. Which is what Harry wanted he wasn't asking them to go to the Aurors or Dumbledore right then.
