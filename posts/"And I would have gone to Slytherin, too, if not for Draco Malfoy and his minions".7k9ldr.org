I see this scene a lot in HP fanfiction, where Harry reveals that the Sorting Hat offered him Slytherin, and he normally explains that he chose Gryffindor because of Malfoy being a prick or whatever.

Is there any basis for that in canon? I don't remember Draco factoring into Harry's choice at all; if anything, I think it was to do with /Voldemort/ being in Slytherin.


** I wonder, however, if Malfoy had been friendly to him when they met in Diagon Alley, would Harry had more of an inclination to Slytherin? Because Harry associated Slytherin with Malfoy's rudeness (Malfoy had mentioned wanting to be sorted into Slytherin), and was probably influenced further with Ron's comment against Slytherins.

I imagine he wouldn't have been so receptive to Ron had Draco been friendlier.

*** It's not just Malfoy's rudeness, though that was one of the many contributing factors.

Hagrid also tells Harry that not only was Voldemort in Slytherin, but every witch or wizard who went bad as well. Biased Hagrid is biased, but at that point Harry trusts him implicitly because he is Harry's only source of information.

Harry also notices in the Great Hall that he likes the look of Slytherin table less than the others, a first hand observation on top of Ron and everyone else except Malfoy hating on the house.

Pile all that together and I don't think it would have mattered what Malfoy did. I can only imagine how much Harry would have been turned off if he shared a compartment with Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle regardless of how slick Draco managed to be.

You're kind of right, but I read that as pretty negative toward Slytherin specifically and worried about others for family reasons.

Also, not sure how Ron thought Ravenclaw would be an option for him.

****** Ron wanted to stand out from his - arguably brilliant - brothers, and I suppose Ravenclaw has a better reputation than Hufflepuff and Slytherin. Also, he's /11/, and being home-schooled, he probably had no idea about the workload that awaited them.

That's at least far from the "anti-Slytherin vitriol" that he's supposedly said.

*** Ah yes, the (in)famous handshake that changed history. There are a lot of (bad) stories that deal with that idea and overlook that Draco is still a little shit who calls for racial purges at 12 and wanted animals slaughtered at 13.

** Unless I'm confusing canon with fanon, I think Ron also said something on the train bashing slytherin shortly after he and Harry became friends. I think that that would have made more of a difference to Harry's choice than Draco being a jerk. If only because we are led to believe that Harry didn't have many friends when he lived at the Dursley's.

*** In order:

1. Draco mentions Slytherin at Madam Malkin's. We get no impression about what Harry thinks about this.
2. Harry asks Hagrid about Slytherin. Hagrid says that there isn't a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. (I guess Sirius Black doesn't count.)
3. Ron implies that his parents would be gravely disappointed in him, or worse, if he were in Slytherin.
4. The Sorting Hat says that Slytherins use "any means" to achieve their goals.
5. Harry observes that Slytherins tend to look like an unpleasant lot.
6. Harry asks the Hat not to sort him into Slytherin.
7. The Hat says that Slytherin would help him become great.

So it's not a want-of-a-nail sort of thing; from what Harry can see, if he goes into Slytherin, everyone will hate him and think he's evil. And he'll have to deal with people who aren't good at looking pleasant. Remember, kids, ugly on the outside means ugly on the inside!

Lol you have to look at it from the perspective of a kid who was bullied all his life and didn't really receive any love at home, why would he go to the house of unfriendly looking people.

**** That said, I will point out that if Draco wasn't being a little piece of shit (I know, it would make the story very AU), then Harry might have gotten enough info about Slytherin, info framed in good colours, from Draco to not have to ask Hagrid about it. Then, again if he wasn't being a little piece of shit, he could have actually met Harry properly in the compartment without giving him a negative impression about himself and thus also Slytherin after he got sorted. And the sorting had also sings “You'll make your real friends” about Slytherin, which is something he could have followed on instead of the latter line if he valued whatever relationship he had with Draco (again, would require Draco to not be a little piece of shit).

As such, I do believe that while Draco being friendly to Harry does not automatically mean that Harry would go to Slytherin, it definitely was a possibility, however low, and Draco did squash that by being himself.

** I think Draco did factor into the decision. He didn't much like him, not because of his beliefs or dogma, but more his resemblance in character to Dudley. Harry also notes the "thuggish, and brutish" appearance of the Slytherin table. Combine that with Ron's comments (about You-Know-Who), Malfoy and Co. moving to Slytherin, you get Harry against joining said house.

*** Did the Slytherin table really look that bad, or did Harry see them as thuggish because he had been primed to do so by others? Not a conspiracy theory here, just an observation that humans tend to see what's been pointed out to them by people they are inclined to like.

Also, Ron could be a prejudiced little git nearly as much as Draco could, but Harry had already fallen in with Ron and so absorbed some of his prejudices as truth.

** Canon, the Sorting Hat basically offered Harry /three/ choices†: "Plenty of courage ... not a bad mind ... and a nice thirst to prove yourself...", and Harry responded /Not Slytherin, not Slytherin./ The Sorting Hat then simply suggested some reasons why Slytherin might be a good choice, but didn't put up much of a fight about it.

I'm sure Hagrid, Ron, and Draco all played a part in Harry's not wanting to go to Slytherin, so it's fine with me if fanfics want to be slightly AU about it.

† Apparently the Sorting Hat saw nothing about hard work or loyalty...

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

** It's partly that, and partly the fact that Ron and Hagrid have been badmouthing Slytherin hardcore to him. So you get this kid with extremely limited knowledge of this world, and all he has for Slytherin is that 1 prick and 2 people saying Slytherin = PURE EVIL. Ofc he would not want to go there.
