I read a book a while back about someone I think it was Harry that got really pissed and started calling professor Mcgonagall, Mcgoogles. Any one read It?


** Are you maybe thinking about the Shoebox Project? It's not Harry but I think James and Sirius who call her McGoogles.

Young Harry calls her "Professor McGooglegul" (but not until Chapter 28).
