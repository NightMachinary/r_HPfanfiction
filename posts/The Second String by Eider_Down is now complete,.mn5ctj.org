And it's so gooooooodddddd. I had that song that goes it's all too/so beautiful stuck in my head for most of the epilogue if that helps.

Sad to see it finished but what a brilliant fic.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** That was a spectacular epilogue. I loved all the different scenes (especially Snape and Rhys), but Albus and Harry getting drunk and bowling? Priceless.

*** Don't be, it's really good. A bit sad/bittersweet in a couple of places but I reckon it's practically the perfect epilogue for this fic.\\
Eider_Down did an amazing job.

**** Agreed. And the bittersweet was nicely balanced with the optimistic and hilarious. Totally in-tone with the rest of the fic.

** It was everything I expected and more, one of the few fanfic epilogues that I can truly say is a perfect ending to the characters' stories. It's bittersweet, sad and heartwarming at the same and a perfect encapsulation of the story as a whole. [[/u/Aethardun][u/Aethardun]] this story was a masterpiece from start to finish, and remains one of the most enthralling and unique stories I've ever read. Rest on your laurels, you deserve it.
