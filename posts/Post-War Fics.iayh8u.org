** [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/NextGen][FloreatCastellum]] has a bunch of next gen ficlets that fit your request. They're not really fics, but something like oneshots that fit together.

Canon compliant and pretty well written.

** - whole series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]], start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on (earlier stories are good as well, but they can wait for later)
- linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) ... although it is probably one of the best Harry-as-a-father stories, I was talking with my mum how ALL fanfiction stories are incredibly too long (she used to be professional editor in the publishing house, so she knows a bit what she is talking about). Even though this is one of the best written fanfiction stories, it also badly needs to be cut down by half of more.
- linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) and its sequels
- one of the less-known-pearls in my opinion is the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]], with rather different Harry than what he usually is in most stories, but very good as well.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
