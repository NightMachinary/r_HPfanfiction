I just posted the first chapter of The Fundamentals Of Healing, a Cho-centric fanfic that focuses on her, Hannah Abbott and Draco Malfoy applying for an apprenticeship under Madam Pomfrey so they can eventually take over her post as Hogwarts' Healer. It's very much a story about healing and growth after the end of the Second Wizarding War. I really just wanted to explore what the hospital wing must be like in Hogwarts, especially from the perspective of the people working there.

Here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16049405/chapters/37468694]]

Let me know if you check it out and also what you think about it!


** From a technical perspective, I thought it was well-written. The dialogue was even and fluid; descriptions felt natural. You gave a good introduction to both the characters and the overall exposition.

I think the biggest barrier to the fic will be drawing attention. It's not a very common pairing that you have, and getting people to read it will (probably) be difficult. For a lot of authors, that will inhibit their motivation, long-term.

*** Thank you for the feedback! I always worry about my dialogue, so it's nice to hear that it flows well. And as far as getting attention goes-- yeah, it's gonna be an issue. But it's what I wanted to write and who I wanted to write about, so I'll just keep going til I run out of steam. This is just a bit of fun anyways. :)

** It's like you watched a couple episodes of House and thought "Let's just do that." 3 people fighting for 1 position in the +diagnostic department+ Hospital Wing, a patient arrives at the start of the +episode+ chapter with a strange disease that inevitably has very visible symptoms, it's all there, innit?

Boring. Unimaginative. The story might as well not happen in the HP universe. Characters' motivations are unclear/flimsy at best.

Oh, and of fucking course, Draco is going through a redemption arc right off the bat.

*** Thank you for the feedback. I'll, uh, I'll keep that in mind. Sorry for wasting your time.

EDIT: No, wait a second. I'm sorry it wasn't to your taste and it wasn't what you were looking for. Some of the things you complained about were design elements, and the character motivations thing-- is something I have to work on improving, I know. But still, thank you for the feedback, even if I personally find it a little harsh. Good day!

**** Hey, you wanted feedback. No need to get snippy when the feedback isn't quite as glowing as you'd hoped.

***** There's feedback, but that wasn't what you provided. Your hostile tone /might/ be justified if it wasn't accompanied by flimsy critiques that completely fail to mask your biased attitude ("Oh, and of fucking course, Draco is going through a redemption arc right off the bat," when he is, in fact, not; the arc hasn't even begun in the first chapter, we just observe some of his reactions through Cho's eyes).

Why did you even read this if you're so initially predisposed against malfoy and yet you know he's going to be a character? Was it to vent?

Sure it was. There were criticisms and everything.

I'm not predisposed against Draco. I'm just weary of him getting redemption without much justification. (Edit: the justification might come in the following chapters, sure, but right now it isn't there).

The author extracted the salient bits well enough, that is, the need for clearer character motivations and the story seeming rather mundane (as in, not magical) so far.

And anyway, despite the unkind tone of my comment, I've at least took the time to read the story, think on it, and then write said comment. Which is more than you've done.

Criticism and feedback are the best things one can give to a writer, so instead of saying what a big meanie I am, why not write your own feedback? That will surely be more helpful to the author.

******* So, you based your ‘criticism' of Draco's ‘redemption' on an assumption of what the following chapters of the story would look like, despite those chapters /not actually being written/, and you're trying to tell me you're not predisposed against him? Really?

Also, let me ask you: what did you even mean, using that word, “redemption”? Because, according to canon, Draco was not incarcerated. He was a member of society, and this is taking place in said society 12 years after the war. So why would he even need to be redeemed? From what? It's like you're trying to voice a criticism against a bad war-time dramione fic, except you've completely missed the mark as this fic isn't placed during the war.

Hence, any talk of ‘redemption' isn't applicable and certainly wasn't even close to the focus of the sole published chapter.

I guess you missed that.

Also, calling the /entire premise/ of a work ‘boring' and ‘unoriginal' is, while technically a criticism, also as helpful as salt water to a man dying of thirst. It is not constructive. It is also hopelessly subjective. A constructive criticism would address plot lines or execution. It would talk about characters -- and you actually take a stab at that regarding their motivation. Sadly, this is the sole helpful comment in what is otherwise a quagmire of a thinly-veiled bashing attempt, which baffles me, because why?

Oh, and for some reason you question why I didn't leave a review of my own.

I actually did. Hours ago.

I guess you missed that too.

***** Communication over the internet is generally quite difficult when its text-only-- its hard to read tone, anyway. I didn't necessarily mean it to be snippy-- I was just clarifying a couple of things and letting you know what I got out of it-- which is to say: I need to clear up the motivations and make it feel more like HP, which is perfectly fair.

Anyway, my thanks were sincere. I appreciate any feedback I get on anything. It's rare enough as it is, and useful feedback is actually much rarer. I'll try to clear these things up in subsequent chapters and other, future writings.
