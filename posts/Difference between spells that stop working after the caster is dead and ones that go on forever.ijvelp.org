What are your thoughts on why certain spells stop working after the caster is dead (Dumbledore's Petrificus Totalus for e.g.) and some others work long after that (the Hogwarts enchantments cast by the Founders for e.g.)? Also what else could break a spell (other than it's counter-curse)? For instance after Voldemort's death, it's stated that people all over Britain were waking up from the Imperius trance, but it were in fact his Death Eaters that were imperiusing people.


** I think it would be either the difference between a spell and an enchantment or a spell that is tied into something

** Given that Voldemort didn't actually die, most if not all of those awakenings were likely faked.
