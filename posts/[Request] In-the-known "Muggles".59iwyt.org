I'd like to read some Harry Potter fanfiction which features the direct (or /indirect/) interference from Muggles'/Non-mag's world. These interference can be known as (but not limited to)

- An existing unit of military/secret service, specialised in "fixing" magical problem

- Some Muggles know about magic without being Obliviated

- Harry (may be with his gang) asks for help from the Muggle authority

- All-out war between magic and science (preferably when science got magic on the run)

Thanks in advance


** try this author, I think he writes that sort of story pretty well.

When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** In the latter half of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), this develops into a significant portion of the plot.

It's not abandoned...I hope...but it's not been updated in some time.

** Royal Ward linkffn(10556030) is really good! Includes the Malfoy family learning (and liking!) the muggle world. Narcissa Malfoy in Harrods, I mean what sane witch says no to that many clothing shops?

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
