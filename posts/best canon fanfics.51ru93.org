What fanfics do you recommend me that respect the canon? I don't care about the lengh, the characters, etc. I just want them to respect the canon of the books.

Which ones do you guys recommend me?

EDIT: Thank you all for your recommendations, soon I will start to read them. If anybody else have a recommendation not mentioned in this post, I will be glad to read it.


** Canon compliant is really broad! To me those fall into a couple different categories. You could have fics that continue off from where the seventh book ends, like fics that explore the world directly after Voldemort's fall. For that a lot of people recommend linkffn(the first day by little0bird). (A lot of that author's fics are canon compliant, actually.) Or you could read fics that do Potter/Weasley family dynamics since canon gives us all the kids' names and such. Or you could have "missing moments" fics, since in canon we only get the story from Harry's point of view. My favorite from this category explore what was happening at Hogwarts while Harry was away. I'd recommend linkffn(a call to arms by mydearprofessormcgonagall) and linkffn(not from others) for that. Background of other characters can totally fall into canon, like linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky). Are there any particular characters/scenarios you want to read about?

These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend it! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.
