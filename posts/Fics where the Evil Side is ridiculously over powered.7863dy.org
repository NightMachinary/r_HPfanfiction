I want a fic where evil wins and there is no chance of good winning. It can be something as innocent as Draco Malfoy winning over Harry Potter like Quidditch continuosly and ruining his confidence to big stuff like Voldemort killing in style. I am tired of the 70000000000000000 fics where the good guys win. The Evil Side's characters should be fleshed out well


** He corrupted half of the good guys in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/][I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853), and killed the other half, along with Death Eaters whom he no longer needed. The fic ended with his total victory.

I'm of the opinion that there are no â€˜light side' in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), as the three main factions are all controlled by significantly to very evil individuals.

The most ridiculously overpowered evil side I have read is in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), in which Harry was definitely evil and Voldemort boosted himself enormously with a ritual.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** Well there is linkffn(The Nightmare Man by Tiro), its not too heavy on the characterisation but it isn't too bad. The evil definitely wins in the end, everyone light either killed or corrupted. There is on ongoing prequel as well, though the updates have been infrequent for a while now.

** linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll)

Big fic, still in writing, very "bad side" oriented. Non-vanilla sex. Very refreshing like you seem to look for.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

*** Also by Colubrina linkffn(Pygmalion) has the bad guys outhinking the good guys at (almost) every turn.

And I haven't read linkffn(The Bone Man) in awhile but iirc it fits what you're looking for.
