Kinda random/specific request but I was watching DH again, as you do, and was interested in how the dynamic would change, could be Remus or someone else, don't mind pairings or if it's just gen, anything's cool, TIA


** So you really want a Horcrux hunt with other people involved, not necessarily Sirius. Here are my picks:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958-15/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]]: It's really a crossover with Buffy, but stays canon compliant until the Astronomy Tower when Ginny picked the Slayer power. She of course went on the hunt with them and took the lead role. Voldemort on the other hand, knew the good guys had a Slayer among them (but not a Witch Slayer), so he raised an additional army of demons and vampires.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice, Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): An allied force of good Wizards and UK's military launched the Horcrux Hunt, and relegated the Trio to secondary roles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out of Nurmengard and was helping out Harry and his friends. This fic is hiliarious!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville were hunting Horcruxes in two different dimensions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(2818538): This fic came out before DH, and guessed correctly about Harry being a Horcrux and Snape being good. Ginny joined them.
