** Ummm. Seems like this post might be incomplete. A little more detail could go a long way here. Cause i could see it going multiple ways here. All depending on who sasy it and how it's said.

Bellatrix could be like:*"And then Lord Voldemort said 'Harry Potter is dead!'. Funniest shit I've ever heard."* How could that pathetic Half-Blood ever think he could stand up to Our lord and have a chance of winning. We all knew that he was nothing and he died as nothing.

OR

Harry could be like: *"And then Lord Voldemort said 'Harry Potter is dead!'. Funniest shit I've ever heard."* And then I took that Personnaly and said nope. Came right back to life again. I waas like Yo tom? Having a little 'wand' trouble in your old age? Maybe you should hate muggles less, they got Pills for that!

*** Also, Harry's trash talk seems on point for a teen trash talking a senior citizen.

​

It could be even funnier if Ron and Hermione were in the vicinity while Harry is telling this story and are forced to correct Harry when he makes embellishments like this

*** When Harry took that personally-

Fine, you take that(the wand), I'll take this(the cloak)!

Trying to make this about The Last Dance because I'm lame and can't let go of the opportunity to shoehorn Last Dance memes into everything I do and talk about

** "Okay, who had Voldemort with a Killing Curse even though he's already survived it like 12 times now?" Ron calls out. Fawkes lands next to Ron, extending his talons and collecting the Galleons. Phoenixes can bet and have needs too.
