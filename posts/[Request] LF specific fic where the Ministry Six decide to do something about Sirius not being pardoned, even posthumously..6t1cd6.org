Hi everyone. I'm looking for a fic I read /years/ ago - it was definitely post-'03, but I wouldn't swear it was before Book Six came out. It was a post-Book Five story, on ffn. What I can remember of it is that Fudge, in an attempt to retain power, decides to award the Ministry Six (and they are actually referred to by that term, AFAICR) Orders of Merlin. While at the Ministry for the ceremony, Harry approaches Fudge and asks if Sirius' name will be cleared. Fudge attempts to weaselword around it, but eventually says no. On the ministry car ride back, the six talk about this, and they decide to Do Something.

I remember the last word of the last chapter that was posted when I first read it being Ginny smiling and saying 'Murder' when asked what that Something was - but it was pretty clear the author wasn't going grimderp, like they weren't actually going to go kill anyone.

I lost track of this one ages ago, while it was still being actively updated - I've looked for it on and off, and I've used " " terms on Google, but I've never been able to find it again. I'm hoping someone has it in their favourites or something.

Any help would be great, thanks!
