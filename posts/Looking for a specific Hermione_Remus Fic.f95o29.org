:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find a specific fic featuring Hermione/Remus. Could have sworn it was on anarchiveofourown but maybe I'm wrong.

It is a time travel fic that starts with Hermione touching an invention of the twins' and being transported back in time. She becomes fast friends with the Marauder's and Lily. Falls in love with Remus. Gets bitten and marked by Remus. Then suddenly she gets sent back to her time where Remus is about to marry tonks because he believed Hermione was never going to remember him.

If that sounds at all familiar to anyone, I would really appreciate help in locating the fic. Thanks!
