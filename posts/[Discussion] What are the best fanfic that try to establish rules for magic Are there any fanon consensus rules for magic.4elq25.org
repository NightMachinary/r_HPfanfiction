** linkffn(11115934) - The Shadow Of Angmar is a LOTR crossover that's fairly easy to follow with very little LOTR knowledge like me. It does a great job of exploring the questions behind what magic is and how it all fits together.

I'm particularly fond of how potions are explained - each ingredient represents a different unique meaning and to get anywhere you have to pit then against each other to balance their bad effects with their good.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** There's never a consensus.

Common themes include:

- Casting spells takes effort.
- People have innate magical power (which is why Harry is facing Voldemort when his mental prowess is at best middling).
- Sometimes this is formalized as magical cores.
- Spells leave residue. It's possible to detect that residue and tell which spells have been cast in a location.
- Spells leave an imprint on the wands that cast them. It's possible to detect the spells that have recently been cast with a wand.
- Spell residue contains an imprint of the person who cast that spell (a "magical signature"). This magical signature can be matched to a person with accuracy.
- Runes and arithmancy are rigorous ways of doing magic or producing new spells, but they tend to be painstakingly slow. A master of runes and arithmancy won't have any use for them in a duel.
- Protective magic (aka wards) is its own discipline.
- Protective magic is based mostly on runes and arithmancy.
- Mismatched wands make you inept at magic. (This is not outright stated in canon, as far as I recall, but it's a small inference.)
- Bespoke wands are a thing.
- You can detect what sort of wood and core will work for a bespoke wand by passing your hand over wood blocks and cores.
- Wands act as a general power modifier, with bespoke wands being much more powerful than the standard Ollivanders wand.
- Dark magic is any magic that's designed to hurt or control people.
- Dark magic is any magic that requires an intent to hurt or control people.
- Dark magic is any magic with a deleterious psychological effect on the caster.
- Dark magic is any magic that the Ministry decides citizens shouldn't use, nothing more.

Those are the obvious ones I've found.

**** This was a magical effect produced from the unique, or at least quite rare, circumstances between Harry and Voldemort. I was thinking more of a spell that you can cast on a wand to get a tidy list of spells that the wand was used to cast -- in the worst cases, written on parchment in modern English. Something common and reliable enough to be used in routine law enforcement and student disciplinary investigations.

** What sorts of rules are you wondering about?

I don't think there is any consensus, but some of the more popular ones are:

- Magic just is: there are no cores, no 'source', no magical exhaustion, no measuring power levels.

- Wandless magic is limited: push, pull, basic things. You're not casting a wandless stunner, AK or patronus.

- Wordless casting: possible, happens in canon but the mechanics are unclear. This is an interesting one for writers to build on.

*** On your point about magical exhaustion, while I don't agree with the common form of magic core I do believe that doing magic can exhaust the caster. In my head it's more akin to the kind of exertion you have solving a complex problem in math or physics. You don't do much physical work but the concentration needed is still draining. Not exactly canon, but at the same time it's not contradicted by canon either (at least to my admittedly limited knowledge). For some reason I'm against the idea of magic having no cost on the user.

**** Fair enough. I get the idea, and it could work. II've never seen it done well enough.

It seems to flow from the idea that magic is intent based, and it can be mentally tiring to focus so long. So the better focusers are more powerful? Idk, the idea of getting exhausted from thinking hard just comes across as hokey in tge focs I've read.

***** It does, and for it to work the exhaustion part would be minimal. You can expended an enormous amount of mental effort before you get tired. And it wouldn't be in terms of power. More in terms of endurance. The power would come from how creative you are and how gods you are at actually working magic. As opposed to how long you can go keeping all the things required to cast a spell straight.

Basically duels would end not because someone gets exhausted but because someone makes a slip in concentration.

Of course large disparities of knowledge and experience are much more important.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

The thing this fic does best is expanding canon magic. No ancient runes are for warding and enchanting bullshit. No mindscape occlumency. No arithmancy for spell creation. It stops all these awful ideas then explains how the magic should be done.

Edit: linkffn(What You Leave Behind) Also great and expanding on magic.
