Hi all,

I've just finished reading the (abandoned, it seems) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705207]["I Do" series]] and I'm looking for something similar.

Key points I liked:

- Post war against Voldemort

- Harry + Draco = <3

- Golden trio splits over Harry's feelings for Draco (first time I came across a fanfic where the Weasleys + Hermione don't support Harry and he goes his own way, I kinda enjoyed this non-standard take)

- Harry is pro Slytherin

- Harry and Draco behave like adults (most of the time)

- loooooonnnnnng

​

What I definitely did NOT like:

- too cruel and too much violence at times ( I am not a fan of gore and torture)

(- well, the writing wasn't that great)

​

Based on the above, can anyone recommend more stories please ? I'd highly appreciate it :) THAAANK YOOUUUUU


** Have you tried...

Linkao3(running on air)

Its super well written. To the point I don't really read slash and I was so drawn to this one I consumed it.
