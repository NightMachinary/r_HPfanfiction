Most fanfictions involving the political side of the wizarding world, even the well-written ones, typically result in Harry being an instant expert and very quickly getting almost everything he wants out of almost every confrontation. I want to see the opposite- a politics-focused fanfic where the main character has to fight tooth and nail to get what they want.

Politics has its fair share of idiots and complacency, but everyone with any success at all is either devious as hell or knows how to surround themselves with people who are.

No restrictions on time period or main character, just as long as it is competently written, focuses on wizard politics, and doesn't have the good guy constantly winning everything


** /Looking forward to this thread. Political fics (that I've encountered) usually seem too easy for Harry, even if he's a little kid./

"Oh, I studied Wizarding Law one month before coming to Hogwarts! Look at me! I'm an expert now. All of you 40+-year-old adult political veterans are stupid!"

/Nah, I wanna see him get completely and utterly floored on the political field./

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] very brief summary---Voldemort won the war, successfully conquering the UK

Longest fic I have ever read. An actual realistic and detailed look into what it would take to run a country after a hostile takeover. That's not the whole plot but it's long enough that you bet your ass there's enough politics to go around.

*** One of the best earlier fics. Too bad this masterpiece is abandoned and went in a weird direction when the author included fae

** Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament by Saliient91

It starts off with a lot of cliches but it quickly has a case of "reality sets in" and at no point is it dull, in my opinion. The politics isn't the main focus but is a significant part of the story.

In short, Harry quickly realizes he'd need political support to survive Voldemort and since he's 15, naturally, he's got no idea how to proceed. He comes to the logical conclusion to make a kind of council of trusted individuals to manage his assets (political and fiscal) and advise his actions.

This turns out to be it's own ordeal since at that point in the story he's already figured out that half of what information he has is either false or an outright lie, half of the truth is purposely phrased as to be misleading, and the rest of it is distorted by whatever worldview the person telling it has (and none of that covers lies of omission).

The story is written in 3rd person limited perspective and at no point does the reader know more than Harry does, leaving us and the main character to speculate on what's true and what isn't, who's trying to benefit, how, and why, as well as how any piece of information could've gotten distorted before it reached him. It's a real treat : )

P.S. As a bonus, any attempt to divine the full scope of people's allegiances, responsibilities, and the constraints under which they operate would leave you twisted into pretzels. Compounded by the fact that Harry is, in a legal sense, three different people.
