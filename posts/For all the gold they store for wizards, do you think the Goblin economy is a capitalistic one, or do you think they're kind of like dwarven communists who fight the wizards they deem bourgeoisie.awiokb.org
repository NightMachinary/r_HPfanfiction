** Why would human social conventions apply to a non-human species? Their idea of property rights and ownership has nothing to do with the modern UK legal system, muggle or wizard.

If you look at Discworld's worldbuilding, the species closest to HP's goblins, the dwarfs, are greedy buggers who hoard gold so they can return their parents' investment in raising them to adulthood. After they have earned enough to "free" themselves, they can then leave home, enjoy whatever hobbies or interests they like, and marry out of their own choice. It's a cultural thing.

From the outside, humans only see greedy short folks who love the shinies.

** in Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone they are pretty communist. You can only own the artifacts you yourself made; everything that's not artisanal is produced collectively, and after someone diew, everything they owned goes to communal ownership. Only trifles of sentimental value are inherited. Their position on ownership is also why they are angry at humans keeping goblin - made artifacts, insisting that they can only rent them. Great fic, but abandoned. linkffn(6769957)

** Communism does not produce growth and in the long run will probably not work due to their 'clever nature'.

- [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin]]\\

Due to their clever nature, Communism will probably incentivize goblins to not work hard and that is ultimately bad to a society.

Any creature that practices rational self interest, such as a goblin, will prefer the nature of capitalism then communism as growth is correlated with effort.

*** They're an oppressed minority so I wouldn't be surprised if their society revolved more around the well-being of each other than capitalist society does.

To rephrase, they fit the exact demographic that would and do hold communist ideals. So no.

This feels like an odd way to phrase it if you're not being sarcastic. I would argue that just because they're not completely powerless against the ministry doesn't mean they're on top.

**** I don't refer to a socialist economy that has some amount of private market and private ownership. When I refer to communism I respect it in its purest definition .

There are many more of such articles and I am happy to link it to you. But understand that overall with multiple regression analysis and studying economic behavior that hard communism does not work.

- Also this doesnt need to account for goblin psychology entirly but simply require rational self interest which I'm sure is reasonable
