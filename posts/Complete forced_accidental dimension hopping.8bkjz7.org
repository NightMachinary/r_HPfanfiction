  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Hary never thought something like this would happen to him. The deceit, the confusion, the self-entitlement and selfishness. The very fact that no matter what his fate was the same in the end. A prophecy. It was always the same, even in a world away. Now, somehow finding himself in the elemental nations he finds himself wrapped up in the life of Sasuke Uchiha, the lackey the Sanin known as Orochimaru had sent to capture him. Harry wonders just how he'll get out of this mess, and if he'll ever return to Britain. After all, Voldemort was still alive and kicking, and Hermione...Ron, they were still missing. He didn't have time to be caught in anyone's web. Then again, did he even have a choice?

  Harriet Potter, displaced in a world where people have strange powers and nobody speaks her language, is pretty sure she's screwed. Until, that is, she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children.However, when their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. With assassins on her trail, and a new group threatening the just-found stability of the Shinobi world, Harriet may be hard-pressed to create the family that she's always wanted.

  Hermoine and Ron have finally figured out how to find Harriet after almost five years of looking. With George and Ginny by their sides, they follow their best friend to the Elemental Nations...only to discover she might not need that rescue, after all. Also they, uh, may have forgotten one teeny, tiny little detail...like how exactly they'll be getting back to Wizarding London.

  Harriet Potter, displaced in a world where people have strange powers and nobody speaks her language, is pretty sure she's screwed. Until, that is, she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children.However, when their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. With assassins on her trail, and a new group threatening the just-found stability of the Shinobi world, Harriet may be hard-pressed to create the family that she's always wanted.

  Harriet Potter, displaced in a world where people have strange powers and nobody speaks her language, is pretty sure she's screwed. Until, that is, she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children.However, when their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. With assassins on her trail, and a new group threatening the just-found stability of the Shinobi world, Harriet may be hard-pressed to create the family that she's always wanted.

** Steelbager has some great fics in this category.

/The Power He Knows Not/, a completed HP/LOTR crossover. The dimension hop isn't really the focus of the story, though.

/The Shadow of Angmar/, an in-progress HP/LOTR crossover that is steeped in lore, as well as the mechanics of HP-style magic. The dimension hop is definitely a big part of the plot.

/A New Man/, an on-hiatus HP/Avengers crossover that seems to be leading to a very interesting twist. The dimension hop is a big part of the plot in this one, too.

#+begin_quote
  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Torn from his family and lost in an unfamiliar world Harry Potter will fight with all he has to return to them. He has to navigate self-absorbed geniuses, secretive government agencies, megalomaniacal Norse gods and a huge green rage monster if he is to find his home. Post-epilogue story.
