** This really makes me want to see the premise of Drachenfels adapted to this.

Basically they go to make a play about a vanquished evil, and the evil comes back during the production of the play.

**** Maybe... but Dumbledore is essentially Secretary General of the Wizard UN based on defeating Grindelwald decades earlier. I'd think Harry has some clout based on defeating a dark wizard who managed to come back from the dead.

**** I honestly doubt that. Dumbledore is seen as one of the most powerfull, if not the most powerfull, wizard alive. His death alone puts Voldemort on the top of the threat list worldwide.

**** A Very Potter Musical

That part is hilarious, but imagine being a wizard having to act that out? That would be embarrassing as hell.
