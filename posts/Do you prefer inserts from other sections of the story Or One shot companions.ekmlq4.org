I'm working on my first really big fic, and I'm curious - Most of the original Harry Potter stories are firmly following Harry - we rarely get scenes without him. I've noticed most fan fictions take an alternate route and explain what's happening in other areas of the world - what is your personal preference? An all-encompassing story, or a primary story with offshoot one-shots that show scenes and happenings outside of the MC's sphere?


** Perspective shifting can jarring and takes me out of the story when done poorly. My advice is to stick with a single perspective unless there is a very good reason to follow another character's perspective.

JK Rowling used alternative perspectives sparingly but to a great effect (Voldemort and penseive scenes.)

Anway, in my experience, most readers shy away from OCs and original plots so using Harry as the MC in original plots is a safe way to maintain a healthy audience. OCs are a lot riskier...

It might be interesting to write a fic primarily from Harrys perspective but to have an insert as a secondary protagonist. Id recommend against having the insert as someone very close to Harry to prevent overlap in perspectives.

(Edit) now that I think about it... Fiona in Sir Poleys Natural 20 plays a secondary protagonist well. You follow her through her conflict in the muggle world investigating why she keeps getting obliviated. She doesn"t even really meet up with the primary protag. Milo, till much later.

** I like to see alternate POVs sparingly but I quite dislike jumping between characters a lot. It's the reason I still haven't read Game of Thrones.

** I like alternating POVs provided the majority of POVs are from the main character.
