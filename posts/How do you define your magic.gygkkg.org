** I love the idea of graces, blessings and boons (very nice names as well). Now that you think about it, there seem to be a lot of hexes, jinxes and curses mentioned in the series compared to "good" spells like Episkey.

I'm just wondering - where did you get your name for the Boons (I only recognize Animus)? From Latin?

*** Thanks you! And yep, latin. Do you perchance recognize animus from the animus bell?

Anyway, one examples of a grace is the cheering charm- it's specifically made to cheer people up! The warming charm and most healing spells also work, as do the mending charm and the patronus charm. Another idea I've had is the Steadying charm- incantation 'stabilus'- that can help a nauseated or tired person stay on their feet, (kind of the opposite of the tripping jinx.)

** There is no such thing as power, only control. You bend the magic into different forms, the more control you have the better it's going to turn out. Some people are born with greater control than others and thus have a easier time mastering spells. And some people naturally manipulate their magic in ways suited for different fields.

Another one is; magic is actually magic. There is nothing scientific about it and there is no logic attached. So technology will never be able to sense it or replicate it. Magic is mostly trial and error, there are no set patterns and things that are thought to be true are often disproven.

** I have a pretty bare bones magic system written up, defining the different branches of magic. Inspired by both canon and fanon (canon has some decent ideas but is quite disappointing when really looking into it).

Light Magic:

-Aka "Life Magic"

-Spells that provide protection or healing

-Ex. Patronus, medical spells, shield charms

Dark Magic:

-Aka "Death magic"

-Spells that cause harm or suffering

-Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses

Neutral Magic:

-Magic that does not have a significant positive or negative effect on a subject

-All other magic

Transfiguration:

-Spells that cause a physical transformation to a subject

-Neutral

Charms:

-Spells cause a change in the properties of a subject

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Runes:

-Symbols used to channel magic through

-Used for Rituals, Enchantments, or Alchemy

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Rituals:

-Ceremonies used to cast a long-lasting or permanent effect on a living subject

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Enchantments:

-The act of imbuing a long-lasting or permanent effect on a non-living object

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Potions:

-Drinks created using magical ingredients in order to create a specific effect on the drinker

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Alchemy:

-The process of causing a permanent transformation of one non-living object into another via Runic magic

-Neutral

** When writing, I generally do not pay attention to an elaborate magical system since canon does not seem to have strict rules besides a few which are the result of plot demands (eg no food transfiguration, which even contradicts canon since you can transfigure animals, which can be butchered for meat).

Whenever I need a particular spell, I tend to either straight-up use canon or invent something which is similar to already existing spells (eg a blasting curse which is simply a stronger reducto/movie canon what Umbridge used).

I despise duelling as a sport and tend to avoid it, both while reading and writing. In combat, most spells are either useless in the setting (the fight against magical Nazis and their extermination policies) or too slow to be used outside of cover (eg creating animals). Why would you disarm a Death Eater when you can "disarm" them with Sectumsempra? Why would you not use lethal force against an opponent trying to kill you? There is a reason the world wars were not fought with rubber bullets after all. Flashy fights work well in movies, but tend to be bloat in writing, especially if lives are not at stake (eg a duelling tournament).

This leaves you with an arsenal of ~5 spells for the good side, plus some niece ones not aimed at the enemy (healing, entrenching, stealth). The Dark side is not limited since Dark Magic is properly fucked up and gives you access to basically any way to kill a human being ever invented. And that is probably enough to describe any serious fight I might ever write. IMO it is better to describe the effects spells have and how they look rather than writing something akin to "Harry fired off a chain of spells starting with a foot-lock followed by a body-bind and (...)"

*** When it comes to "lethal" spells, I don't think it's as cut and dry as you make it out to be.

"However, as a small aside, another aspect people always fail to consider is stopping power. People always love to laugh at stunners because of its non-lethality and its countercharm. However, I think stunners are actually one of the better spells in one's repertoire. Take diffindo or sectumsempra. Authors will have their characters use cutting spells instead of stunners. Let's examine the combat capabilities of each spell.

Stunners instantly put down their target. Full stop. They can be added together to become more lethal. One you are hit, you're out of the battle. You're vulnerable to a follow-up spell. It can also be used to halt objects.

Sectumsempra and diffindo are variable. People can easily survive stab and slash wounds and remain conscious from them. Stopping power is lacking compared to the stunning spell though a lucky hit may render a target incapable of fighting.

People can be revived from stunning spells. It's interesting to note that it still takes a while for them to be combat capable once more. However, once stunned, one cannot wake themselves up, leaving one vulnerable to coup de grace). People can be healed from cutting charms with episkey and the counter to sectumsempra. /Because of its lack of stopping power, one can heal oneself of their cut/.

Both spells can be shielded against, blocked, and repelled.

In conclusion, a stunner is better for actually rendering an opponent non-combative. One of the better examples is George Weasley. A sectumsempra that takes off an ear would have killed him had it been a stunner (the fall). Draco Malfoy remains conscious and moving (combat-capable) after being hit with a sectumsempra.

This type of thinking applies to the spells used elsewhere in fics. Blood-boilers, bone breakers, ice spears, etc all lack the stopping power and effectiveness of stunners. The order didn't shy away from killing but neither did they shy away from using more effective curses. The only spells I consider more combat-effective in canon are the killing curse (though this has the drawback of a hefty power requirement - Harry likely can't use it for a majority of his school years) and Dolohov's unnamed curse. And most authors don't even use Dolohov's spell."

In this comment I quoted, I only talked about spells. I disagree with you on animations and transfigurations, I think they add a lot of versatility and ability to fights. Your opponent hiding in a room behind a shield? Conjure, animate, and disillusion.

I do agree with you on writing fights though.

***** Age also seems to be a factor there, at least that's what the scene applies.

And while getting hit by 4 stunners will put you in hospital, getting hit by four Sectumsempra or comparable will probably leave you in 3 or 4 pieces for the undertaker if the damage Harry does on his first attempt is any indicator (or that Snape was sure that he cut amputate a hand).

You are right in a 1v1. Or even if you want to interrogate someone.

However, one thing you are forgetting is that if you cleave through someone's chest or abdomen, they will be in a lot of pain, bleeding heavily and trying to hold that hand to their stump or keep their guts inside. They will, most likely, be unable to heal themselves due to pain and/or having their hands full with their own entrails/limbs. And that will have a psychological impact on their comrades.

If you have the time, any of those is a great force multiplier. But if you are in the middle of a fight, you need to disengage first to get any of those done, and that can leave you quite vulnerable.

***** I disagree considering Dumbledore employed these tactics against Voldemort (the two most capable at magic and combat). It seems that the main limitation of these tactics is skill and not how combat-feasible it is. Also I feel like interrogating someone is kind of difficult if they're stunned.

I think you also underestimate adrenaline and one's ability to fight through pain. Harry throws off the aftermath of /Voldemort's cruciatus/ to dodge Voldemort's spells and get away. I have seen people get shot in the head, chest, and limbs and manage to get away. I've seen people stabbed in the guts who manage to overpower their attackers and get away. People remain combat capable through terrible pain and eventually-lethal injuries. Why do you think assault rifles use higher calibers? Pistol calibers don't often have immediate stopping power, though they inflict wounds that /are/ lethal. These are muggles too, wizards are even more resilient.

******* Yes? That said, the fact that they use it clearly shows that it's very effective in combat. Neville Longbottom might be unable to use it because he isn't a very skilled wizard, but he should if he can cast the spells needed.

I can't believe you missed the whole spiel on how often stopping power is overestimated. We literally see that the spell which cut off an ear is incapable of rendering Draco Malfoy combat-incapable and he's a complete pussy. Sectumsempra may be lethal but may not stop your opponent from taking you with them.

I'd like to see you provide a novel counter argument instead of arguing the same points over and over again without evidence.

******** If you hit properly, your opponent won't be able to take you with him because you cleaved him in 2. Harry almost killed Malfoy with his first attempt and no proper instruction (wand movement and the like). Landing a follow up will probably be a lot easier in that case, almost comparable to outright stunning.

Area of effect spells (anything which explodes) are more dangerous because even a near miss will do a lot of damage (akin to a landmine), or even comparable to an artillery hit a foot from your foot whereas a stunner might scorch the pavement.

And you still haven't addressed the issue of people screaming in pain, which demoralises their side while someone needs to attend them for a lot longer than simply reversing a stunner.

And speaking of explosive spells, if you can reach the same casting speed, the equivalent of a mortar barrage will do a lot more than a comparable barrage of stunners due to secondary effects (shrapnel) and have a significantly suppressive effect, nevermind that it is probably more effective in a target-rich environment.

#+begin_quote
  “Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.

  Levicorpus (nvbl)

  While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . . that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far. Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.
#+end_quote

In either case of Snape casting sectumsempra, there is no description of a difficult or unique wand motion. Snape left notes with the special requirements of another spell. Levicorpus works fine with Harry's upward flick, seemingly demonstrating that wand motions take a backseat to magical theory. Lupin confirms levicorpus works fine and Snape left no special notes for sectrumsempra (like a wand motion needed for full effectivness)

#+begin_quote
  He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefy!”
#+end_quote

This seems to be consistent with other offensive spells as well. It seems that with enough study of magical theory, wand motions can step aside in favor of practice, magical knowledge, and experience. That or some spells do not have unique wand motions.

First cast by Harry.

Later Harry casts sectumsempra with additional practice (something that makes a huge difference with other spells - we see Harry's protego and summoning charm improve immensely with practice) with little improvement in offensive capability.

No mention of Harry lacking knowledge or ability to cast sectumsempra or levicorpus. Along with no improvement in the spell's effectiveness from practice, it seems to be a safe conclusion that Harry is a competent caster of sectumsempra.

  Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword.

  He supported Malfoy across the bathroom
#+end_quote

Again we see the difference between stopping power and lethality. It certainly seems lethal enough but Malfoy (again a complete pussy) is able to move his hands, enough to have grabbed his wand and remain a threat if he wasn't such a coward.

#+begin_quote
  He supported Malfoy across the bathroom
#+end_quote

Even after time has elapsed and more blood has been lost, even after his wounds have been healed, allowing for shock and pain to set in (pain does not always set in after traumatic injuries), Malfoy is able to walk supported by Snape.

#+begin_quote
  The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. . . .
#+end_quote

Well that worked out great for Hermione. One blasting curse we see in the books bounced around, seemingly hard to control. The deadly shrapnel from the spell seems to have cut Harry's cheek and the explosion might have burnt Harry's hand a bit. Such stopping power (incidentally working against the casters) has rendered Harry so combat-incapable that a toddler could take him.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I'm so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have --- must have hit ---”
#+end_quote

Looks like I was mistaken, it was so effective that it did render Harry combat-incapable by snapping his wand. Of course it wasn't intended to so it certainly seems like there are easier ways to disarm people.

#+begin_quote
  The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them ---
#+end_quote

Though not confirmed to be a blasting curse, I'm going to treat it was a blasting curse (and the most successful use of it as well). As a small aside, this seems to what I was going to argue later about shrapnel with blasting curses. Treating a blasting curse like an omnidirectional explosion, I find it unlikely that it would actually result in the release of a lot of deadly shrapnel. If it hits the floor, the shrapnel will be forced down. It's why fragmentation grenades and other shrapnel-based devices rely on careful design to ensure propagation of shrapnel. Indeed, this seems to be confirmed by this passage as Fred's body isn't described as riddle with shrapnel.

Now onto my analysis of the effectiveness. It seems that its main killing power comes from the force of the blast. The curse hit point-blank a group of five people with no shields protecting them. The curse promptly render 1/5 combat-ineffective, seemingly unfazed 2/5 of the group, and both hindered and aided Harry and Hermione by throwing them away (and throwing off any potential enemy's aim. Fair enough, it's effective though a bit risky and seems consistent with other uses of confringo. Four out of five retain wands and are combat-compable afterwards. It seems like confringo doesn't always destroy wands, only when it backfires on the casters.

********** Similarly, a force pushed the death eater. It was more effective, however, because the death eater was on broom.

#+begin_quote
  “Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.
#+end_quote

Turns out we do see another explosion-based spell. This one is, given that it seems to both push and disarm Harry. Not terribly effective considering Harry can still pick up his wand but it is effective. All in all, you've made a point I agree with, though I do think you overestimate its effectiveness. We don't see Voldemort and Dumbledore using explosion curses, another hint towards them not being quite that useful. One explosion curse threatens its own caster on occasion and the other still has limited effectiveness, only pushing with no noticeable heat or shrapnel from the explosion.

You do have a point and I do think it would make a good alternative after the killing curse, stunner, and dolohov's unknown spell. That said, it really pushes people more and might only kill a fraction of some people grouped together. I'd also suspect (intuitively) that a shield charm would find defending against explosion-based curses far more easily, though obviously I have no canonical evidence to support this assertion.

#+begin_quote
  And you still haven't addressed the issue of people screaming in pain, which demoralises their side while someone needs to attend them for a lot longer than simply reversing a stunner.

Well, again lack of stopping power means someone could heal themselves. Someone reversing a stunner is going to be vulnerable (someone stunned also can't revive themselves), someone stunned is vulnerable to a finishing blow,

#+begin_quote
  Winky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position.
#+end_quote

It seems to take a while to recover from a stunning, at a level comparable to recovery from healing via sectumsempra. And again, one can't revive themselves though they can heal themselves. If preventing healing is so important, why not use Dolohov's curse instead of sectumsempra? It's superior in every way to sectumsempra.

#+begin_quote
  And you still haven't addressed the issue of people screaming in pain, which demoralises their side while someone needs to attend them for a lot longer than simply reversing a stunner.
#+end_quote

Back to the first part of this, I'd first like to point out that screaming isn't always guaranteed from trauma. Pain can take a while to kick in. Again, I've seen people walk off stab wounds and getting shot until the adrenaline wears off in treatment. Even if they are screaming, I find it unlikely that the Order or Death Eaters are going to be demoralized to an extent that their fighting is actually impacted. I mean it would take an exceptionally stupid person to focus on screaming (common in battles). I can't find an example in the books of someone freezing up when their colleagues are in pain or killed and I welcome examples to the contrary (I didn't search very thoroughly for this).

I think the most telling evidence is my favor is that we see aurors (elite fighters) favor the stunning spell over cutting spells, and Dumbledore and Voldemort favoring transfiguration. Ironically, it seems the most effective AOE spells are transfigurations and manipulation of said transfigurations.

Split because it was too long.
