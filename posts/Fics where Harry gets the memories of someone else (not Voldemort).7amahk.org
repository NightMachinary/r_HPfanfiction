I believe he gets the memories of three Dark wizards/witches and travels back in time a bit. His goal is to save people who died I think.

Again, most likely abandoned, like most good concepts.

I believe it reads better than my summary would suggest.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** The overly vulgar sorting hat (the thing hardly goes a full sentence that I remember without saying something crude; it's been a while since I read the fic) along with the gryffindor bashing (the only time the house as a whole even remotely approached being that much of a bag of dicks towards Harry in canon was after the Norbert incident) are the reasons I consider this one to be one of my least favorite fics I read all the way through that weren't by robst.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.
