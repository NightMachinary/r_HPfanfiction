I'm looking for a beta reader for one of my stories, and really struggling to find someone who I know will be really great! Any suggestions on locating a beta?


** Truthfully its bloody difficult.

A huge number listed in the FFN directory don't bother even responding to messages let alone take on stories at the minute.

I posted here and in two other subreddits and in total had about dozen people offer to help; of which when contacted perhaps 5 took the story and 3 bothered to respond with feedback and only 2 with notes which were particularly helpful. To those wonderful redditors I am so, so grateful.

I have IRL friends who write but aren't part of HP fandom but I still asked for their help in their areas of expertise - structure, plotting etc.

Personally I think the best way to get a good Beta is to BE a good Beta. I really wanted someone who was willing to do what I do for my authors. i.e. Commit to the story from concept to delivery. To turn around chapters in a timely fashion. I always aim to return notes/coverage to my authors within 48 hour. If it has to be longer because of real life I will still touch base and give a hard deadline for my notes. I will work with an author on any part of their process. Outlining. Line edits. Brit picking or simple proof reading.

That's what I do - I thought that was pretty standard in writing circles. Apparently I was mistaken.

That said the best way is post where the readers are.

Be specific with what you are writing (Is it a drabble? One-Shot or 150K epic?) and its genre and pairing if any.

Be specific about what you need, and the time frame you need it in.

Be prepared to take on more Betas than you need to allow for those who drop away, and for those whose responses you find unhelpful or who's style is not a good fit for you.

Don't give up - even if you don't get what you need right off the bat push on and publish you will probably find people who connect with the material among your reviewers and can always cultivate a relationship with one of them.

*** Thank you for so much for this! I used to have a great beta, who I also beta-d for, but unfortunately I just don't have the time to beta AND write anymore.

Thank you for all the rest of the advice though! It's really helpful! x

**** No dramas. Do you feel confident in telling us a bit about the project? Feel free to PM if you'd prefer.

***** No problem!

It's a sequel to 'The Escapades of Teddy Lupin' (29 chapters, only a few chapters were beta-d, and though I'd like to go back and work on it, I don't have the time right now) called 'The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet'. A few chapters are up now on FFN (my username's the same as here), but I'm taking a posting hiatus bc uni. I plan to write the entire story, and get it beta-d before resuming posting again. It'll probably be the same length as the first (150k words), and because of the length/the fact that it's a sequel, I think a lot of betas are a bit hesitant at taking it on- which I completely understand (although to be fair, I haven't exactly asked anyone specifically yet- just put out a general request on a forum I'm a part of)

****** Yeah Multi chapters, especially epic length ones are always going to be a hard sell.

Is there anyone regularly reviewing who seems to "get it" you might like to ask?

** I've got 4 of the best Betas in the fandom.

One of them I found here on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] in another thread about finding Betas.

The other three I found using a letter I made and sent out to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=202][a list of ff.net Betas]] who had recently updated their profiles, figuring that would make it more likely that they would be frequently online and willing to help. Check through their published work and see if they know grammar, punctuation, etc. Then start mass-mailing,

Here's an example of the form letter that worked for me:

Hello [Recipient],

My name is [Author Name] and I'm looking for a Beta reader for a story I'm writing in the [Fandom] universe. Here are the relevant details:

Current Project:

Genre:

Rating:

Pairing:

Length:

Summary:

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in beta'ing, please reply in a PM and I'll send you the first chapter. If not, no hard feelings.

Regards, [Sender]

You're going to get a lot of rejections and even more who just won't reply. Keep at it. I promise you that having betas makes you a better writer.

** Pure luck.

I got myself a great betareader who is looking over my fic in a thread here on this sub.

You can also try the beta-forums on FFN.

What are you searching for in a beta, anyway? Seems like you have a specific set of tasks in ind.

*** Not really a specific set of tasks as such- I'm just looking for someone with an eye for detail, characterisation and good with cutting superfluous scenes/parts, and plot pacing. Most betas hovering around seem to only focus on the grammar/language aspects of pieces, which isn't really what I'm looking for a second opinion on.

Another difficulty is that the fic is a Teddy Lupin next-gen piece, & next-gen is a little less popular than other eras.

**** I could see what I can do for you. I'm not a native speaker, so my grammar and language is average at best, but I think I got a good sense of flow, detail and characters (its kind of my job, so yea... I hope so). Its, after all, one of those things that doesn't change all that much with language.

If you find no one else, send me a PM and maybe we can work something out.

** The easiest way is the old standby - "You scratch my back, I'll scratch your back." The first part of betaing is just getting a second set of eyes onto your work. Also, find a good community of like-minded individuals.

** I'd say put up a topic here with some information of what you're looking for and what you're writing. Then look for some responses.

The beta catalog at FFN is a very large haystack. You'll probably find someone eventually if you go that route.

Another option is to join one of the still active communities (the only one I know of is DLP), and then get feedback there in a forum setting. Maybe you'll connect with a few posters and can then approach them about becoming a beta.

I've been pondering this question as well, but I decided to put it off until I have more of my story-related research done. I'm also not sure how likely I'm to st
