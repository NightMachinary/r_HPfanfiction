I acknowledge that this is something of a crack!fic, but the idea got into my head the other day and made itself at home. The possibilities of Sirius having to be rescued are amusing, especially if Severus Snape realizes that Sirius was saved because Harry used Snape's Gillyweed.


** Why is it... that about every single prompt thread I see has /that one user/ (or more) who tells you why your idea is stupid? Pointing out the loophole or canon characterizations which would make an as-yet unwritten fanfiction fail? "X would be unrealistic" or "Y would solve that issue before it became an issue". OP has already stated that it would be something of a crack!fic. What happened to peoples' imaginations around here?

*** And its not that hard honestly, just change it to the goblet picks (and kidnaps) the hostages, instead of the judges, and there you go. Might also make the 'after an hour is gone, it wont come back' part a bit more scary :P

**** Entirely subjective. To me, this promp isnt really all that creative. Now that said, sure a writer could take it and turn it into an amazingly creative story, but thats true with ANY prompt or story idea. But because of that, I wont say the idea is stupid, nor will I downvote it, but I wont upvote it either.

Meanwhile a prompt others find boring or generic I may find much more intriguing because of the ripples it "could" create or because I am simply interested in that concept and want to see it tried by different folks over and over. So I will upvote it.

My point is simply, stagant or not, the upvote/downvote element of requests/prompts is entirely subjective on the reader/writer.

*** While to some degree I agree that folks shouldnt be so hasty to just instantly shit on someones post, and certainly not say the idea is stupid, there NEEDS to be discussion, debate, and discourse of various opinions on any thread. Just because someone shares their opinion that this is a silly or stupid idea, doesnt mean that opinion has to be shared by everyone else. But certainly it will be shared by at least some.

So to be blunt, unless a commenter is outright saying your idea is shit, and as long as their post is civil, why are folks so worried about them bringing discussion or discourse about the situation into a thread that might be arguing (hopefully in a nice way) as to why something may or may not work?

Thats a GOOD thing. It leads to development and growth.

** That'd be really cool to see. Sirius could be in dog form that way Fudge doesn't realize it's Black and actually just thinks Harry's an animal lover.

This prompt made think of a nice Ron Bash idea where they actually pick Ron, and Harry decides to save Gabrielle instead because at that point in 4th year Harry would actually miss her more than he would Ron.

*** You'd really need to go into "Ron the Death Eater" territory for that one (or something like it), but if you wanted to showcase that change in a longer fic this would be an awesome way to do it.

Of course, you also need to change Harry a bit to make this work - you're putting a limit on his "saving people thing," which canonically lacks any real limits.

**** That's certainly true, the way I imagine it, it would definitely have to be a longer fic probably a gabrielle x harry fic or even a fleur x harry could make it work. I would definitely have to amplify Ron's jealousy some and maybe make Dumbles oblivious to their falling out.

** How confusing would that be for every other student though. Harry Potter is decided that the thing he would miss most is his dog because Sirius would need to be in that form to avoid arrest. Dogs aren't even allowed at Hogwarts yet Harry pulls a mangy old mutt out of the lake that he only sees for two months of the year. He has close relationships with the entire quidditch team, the Weasley family and Hermione yet he misses his dog most. He never goes home from Hogwarts except for summer and the thing he missed most has to permanently stay home. If he missed it so much you would think he would go home for Christmas to see the dog at least. Even his owl would be thought to have a closer connection to him than a dog he sees for two months a year.

******** your the one who is projecting negativity onto my comments, I was merely asking questions, your the one being all upset about it

oh no my fake internet points how will I recover.

no this is analogous to me saying something outside and another person getting upset because he thought I said something different.

for a reluctantredditor, you manage to pull off the smug Redditor pretty well. Redditors are can really be the most obnoxious people at times

I hope I never have the displeasure of talking to you again in the future feel free to remove my fake internet points and move on Because talking to you is like talking to that smug arrogant self rightous kid in school who just loved acting so much better then everyone else

anyway bye have a day
