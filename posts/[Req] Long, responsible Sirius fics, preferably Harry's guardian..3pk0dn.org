I recently read Innocent by MaurauderLover7 (and the sequels) on FFN and now I'd like to find more well-written fics based on a Sirius that ends up more mature and responsible. Like my title says, preferably he's Harry's guardian, but I'm not super fussy about specifics, as long as Sirius is better characterized than he often is in fanfic.

I don't like bashing on any character, so while I don't mind light bashing, too much of it makes me click out of a fic. This is especially true for Snape, who is one of my favorite characters.

I don't care much for romance, though some light/moderate stuff is ok.

Throw suggestions at me, folks! I appreciate it.


** linkffn(4062601) it is a three part series and has exactly what you are asking for. The first book is all about Sirius trying his hardest to give Harry the best life, the second book is Harry's life at Hogwarts, and the third is, if memory serves me right, a mixture of Hogwarts and fighting Voldemort.

Sirius plays a large role in the story, it is a well written fic, and it has my favorite epilogue ever. I am really surprised I never see it get recommended here.

I suppose I should give some context here though - there will be 3-5 updates over a month or two, then it won't be updated for a month or two. (Lather, rinse repeat....) More than anything, I meant while it wasn't finished, it definitely isn't abandoned.

** Oh! Big one: linkffn(9322278)

Has a very slow build up, and a lot of tropes that aren't very favourable, like a major OC character and a Soul-bond-thingy, but for the most part I found it entertaining. Written by one of those people that isn't a native english speaker, and therefore has better english than myself. I can't remember if they bashed Snape, but it sounds against their style.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
