No war It would be amazing if they all moved in together in the Manor or something like that (not only 4 of them, the more the better) I would like for the friendship and the relationship to happen early. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I don't mind Ron being replaced by Draco


** I'll have to think on this a bit, but off the top of my head, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][TURN]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]] have great Trio + Draco friendships.

*** Thanks for these! I read mostly Dramione, and I feel like there aren't many that enable Draco + Trio friendship because usually it doesn't go over well with Ron...=/
