***** Okay it's Harry Potter and the Bones affair, Amelia and Sirius had a love affair from there teens until a few weeks before his incarceration. The story starts with a few more dementors in book 5 and a dead Dudley. Expansion on purebloods (non jackasses) but not exposed to the muggle world. I haven't got this far, but a lot more complicated family magic, think really dark magic from Sirius, bone magic from Amelia, no horcruxes to any degree. A smarter Dolores Umbridge, smart enough not to leave blatant marks(psychologically torturing kids)(I cant decide if Harry should be scared of small places or big places). A Harry whose body is toxic from basilisks venom, a Hermione cast out of the magical world. Weasleys whose minds are easily affected by imperious(think Arthur axe murderer) A lot of looking to the future and destroyed people. Also a lot of mayhem and a three big plot twists.
