  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

**** This story is in no way a Harry/Hermione pairing, that said it is rather rair in that it does depict Harry dating people before finding someone he loves. Something I personally find far more realistic than him marrying his first crush. Keep in mind the length of this story, it is almost as long as Atlas Shrugged so little things in the first chapter likely aren't a very good indication of any overarching plot. It is very much a slow burn and is also the reason for my OTP.

**** If you see the summary on the desktop page, you'll see that the pairing is Harry/Fleur, it's very decently written even if it takes a bit until it goes off(when it does it's very rewarding though)

** I think searching the smart harry, powerful harry, grey harry and dark harry tags on AO3 would show up a fair few. Maybe also ravenclaw or slytherin harry tags. I've definitely read a lot where harry has a strong drive for learning, usually disguising it though to stay under the radar

**** The first has a multiple relationship setup, but it is not a harem. It can be considered a Harry/Fleur, but it's not the main focus.

The next one doesn't focus on romance at all but the ending implies a relationship that I don't want to spoil.

** There's always HPMOR, where Harry is literally a clone of Tom Riddle. I recommend starting at [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/5][chapter five]], you don't miss much and that's where the author starts to hit his stride. This fic is controversial since Harry here is pretty full of himself, though that does come back to bite him.

** 2 months late here but I just saw this and remembered the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]] series, where (fem) Harry gathers A LOT of knowledge beyond her peers, for many reasons explained in-story, and Tom Riddle keeps trying to convince her of how similar they are. Very AU, crossover/fusion with the Song of the Lioness books.
