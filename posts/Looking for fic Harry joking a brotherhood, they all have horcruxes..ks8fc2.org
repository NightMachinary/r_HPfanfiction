:END:
I've read it before but can't find it in my bookmarks. Harry is hurt badly by the Dursleys and Don't takes him to members of an ancient brotherhood to save him. All memebers are hundreds of years old, powerful, and have made horcruxes. Some members are notable historical/mythological figures. I recall one was Jason and the leader was Osiris.

I also recall Hermione gets stabbed with a cursed dagger by Pansy I think? I makes her sterile but in the epilogue they find work around connected to sacrifices.


** This is When Vernon Didn't Miss by DrT. I think on FicWad you can find it.
