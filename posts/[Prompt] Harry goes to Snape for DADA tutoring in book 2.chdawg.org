Complaining of Lockhart.


** Why would he? That's so out of character for 12 year old Harry especially since Harry was more worried about the whole heir of slytherin thing

*** Snape is a bitter jerk. But book 2 Snape was shown to be competent and I figure they had common ground in how much they despised Lockhart.

**** The issue is we know Harry goes out of his way to avoid Snape through most of his schooling unless he's forced to by someone with authority. It doesn't make sense for Harry who only knows that Snape hates him for no reason to go seaking Snapes help.

That would be like if Harry was in a normal school, needed to learn how to Box because his boxing instructor was a fucking moron and decided to go to Vernon for help.

***** That's actually a pretty good analogy.

I suppose in this prompt he despises Lockhart more than he hates Harry.

I really hate Lockhart's character.

****** I'd love to see a fic where Harry uses the Diary doesn't know who Tom Riddle is at all and starts complaining about Lockhart to the Diary, only for Tom to start writing out spells for him to practice for every year of school he'll ever need.

******* I agree! Plus giving him tips for practicing magic.

It still turns out he's evil, but when Harry starts listing competent defense teachers later on, Tom beats out Crouch Jr and Lupin.

Then in book 6, Harry tells Dumbledore that he should have hired Voldemort, because he's a fantastic teacher.
