:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'd recently found a fic that Luna was a main character. It mentioned her being part of a family that can see past a veil that hid the crumple horned snorcacks(?) amongst the other animals she'd mentioned within the movies and books. I remember Snape just about getting owned by said mythical animals and everyone putting down their wands to not attract their attention. I can't remember the title or if it was a one shot or not

It's a stealth Cthulhu crossover ("the Marsh family from Innsmouth").

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
