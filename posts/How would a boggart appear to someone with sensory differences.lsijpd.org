I'm working on a fic with a blind MC. It would probably turn into a swarm of beetles for them, but I am not sure how a boggart would manifest to someone who can't see it.

Would it just do things to generate the appropriate sensory input for its intended victim, i.e. sounds, touch, smell, etc.? Or would it still change its physical appearance? I guess I'm not sure if it would look like a beetle swarm to sighted people witnessing this happen, or if it would just focus its energy on scaring its victim through sensory stuff they can actually perceive.

Any thoughts? I can't remember reading any fics with this type of situation.


** I'd think it'd still change physical form, at least if you stick by canon. Hermione says that no one knows what they really look like and I I'd think a sensory impaired wizard would've been seen with a bogart before, so it would have to change to look like /something/

*** I'm confused by this response. If a blind person were in the vicinity of a Boggart they wouldn't be able to tell what the Boggart looked like, regardless of if it changed form or not.

**** I think he's saying that at some point, someone would have been around a blind person when a boggart appeared before the blind person. So if the boggart hadn't changed form then the sighted person would know what its true form looked like.

***** Ah, that makes a lot of sense.

Even if not by accident, someone would have thought to try it.

**** Boggarts just turn into whatever the closest person fears, anyone just standing further away, perhaps behind a two way mirror for a really dedicated test, would be able to observe the form it took.

** We don't really know too many details about boggarts, but my guess would be that the boggarts would turn into the beetles, even though the victim can't see them.

My reasoning is that boggarts seem to simply turn into what their victim is afraid of (or some loose representation thereof), regardless of whether or not it actually scares them. When Lupin, for example, was faced with a boggart, it became a full moon. But Lupin is almost certainly not actually afraid of the moon, but of what it does to him, so I don't think the boggart is likely to actually get much fear out of him.

There almost certainly would still be other sensory inputs. I am almost certain that boggarts make sounds in canon, and I am fairly certain they are generally solid, so they should be able to be felt too (though I don't think we ever see them try to actually attack anyone, even when the thing they're pretending to be would, so they might generally not be interested in touching their victims). We know that Harry's boggart produced an aura similar to that of a real dementor, but weaker, so it's probably safe to assume that they can replicate smell and other sensory inputs too.

*** That's a really excellent point about Lupin's boggart, and really helps in figuring out how to write this scene.

**** Another example of this is Hermione's. She isn't afraid of McGonagall like Neville is Snape, but it takes her form to represent Hermione's fear of failure.

** A boggart hides in dark places, so I'd imagine that it would be capable of doing something auditory for a blind person

** Well boggarts seem to be able to do a very thorough job of duplicating the creatures, not only sound and sight, but even strange things like a dementor's despair-inducing presence.

These transformations are the same for everyone and described as shapeshifting.

I'd therefore assume they physically turn into whatever is feared, with all that entails regardless of whether you can actually see/hear etc.

If that wasn't the case then just closing your eyes would be a very easy way to handle boggarts.

** I really like an interpretation of boggarts as using some rudimentary mind magic to determine what you fear. The boggart would simply grab a potential eminent fear from the person if the fear is more "edible", then fill in the other senses if there are other people around.

On that note, I really like interpretations that the boggart in 3rd year was "trained" to only do banal fears. Not necessarily intelligent, but roughly at the level of a particularly smart dog.
