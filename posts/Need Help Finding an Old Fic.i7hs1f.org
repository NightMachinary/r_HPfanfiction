:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I have been trying to find a fic for the past few weeks now, but the last time I read it was a few years ago and honestly a lot of details are pretty hazy. The big details I remember are that it was a wbwl fic, Harry is in Ravenclaw, and it starts later in their Hogwarts tenure (I think like 5th or 6th year). I am not certain about this, but I believe Hermione was also in Ravenclaw. I don't rightly remember if it is a Harmony fic, but I believe they are friends.

The most specific thing I can remember about the fic is that there is a scene where Harry sneaks into a place (I think Dumbledore's office, but again not sure) and tears his robe. Because his family is semi-neglectful, Harry has to transfigure his brother's old robes to appear as Ravenclaw robes. When Dumbledore investigates they bring in Harry but find that the robe piece found in the office were transfigured and his brother takes the fall.

I first read this fic back in highschool, so like it was written at least before 2015-2016, but it is probably older. Any help would be appreciated!
