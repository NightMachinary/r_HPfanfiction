:END:
It was on fanfiction and complete from i remember it followed Dracos brother Fornax/Farnax im pretty sure it was something with nax as their baby sister calls him that and its a nickname. I dont think he was harry and im pretty sure harry did not exist but im not 100% sure on that.

For a birthday they were allowed to pick 2 items from the come and go room with Lucius checking them first and they had a baby sister. I think he went to a egyptian academy possibly called Alexandru the students were allowed to go shopping at the local bazar and he would take a shopping list for those unable to go. Climax was him and a girl student being kidnapped for some reason and i think he maybe died at the end.
