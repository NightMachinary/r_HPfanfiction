I first read "The Shoebox Project" probably around eight years ago now, and I decided to go back and read it again this week. (Up to Chapter 19 right now.)

And it's funny how differently I'm reading it now compared to how I remember reading it then, especially with the dialogue. At the time, I was like "Wow, I love how quick-witted and funny they are!" Now, I'm like "Wow, I love how well they capture the voices of teenagers with decent vocabularies who are trying a little too hard to be witty!"

That's not a knock on the fic, by the way: I think the writing overall is damn good, and to be honest I /was/ that kind of teenager at the time I first read it. I'm also enjoying the story quite a bit more than I thought I might. I remember the first time around I started reading it because it was a Remus/Sirius fic, so my attitude during a lot of it was like "When are they gonna get to the fireworks factory?!" This time around I actually really appreciate the slow-burn, and I've found there's actually a lot to like about the story when I'm not preoccupied with thinking "MAKE OUT ALREADY DAMMIT."


** I just read the SBP for the first time and it was my first Remus/Sirius. I liked it and the dialogue a lot - I thought the friendships were believable and made a lot of sense. There were some parts that were totally weird and took me out of the story though - like the 7th year halloween thing and them going to the beach. None of that really made any sense...

Even though I overall loved reading a marauders story, I might not read any more of them because knowing what happens to the characters in canon makes everything really really sad.
