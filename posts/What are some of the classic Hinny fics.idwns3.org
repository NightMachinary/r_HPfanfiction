So I am going back to the basics - Harry/Ginny. I know it's not the most popular ship, and honestly I haven't read hinny for probably a good 10 years. I poked around on ao3- but I was mostly finding ones where they break up and Harry gets with someone else, or they were way waaaaay to young. So what are some classics? Or just well written fics -classic or no? Thanks for any recommendations!!!


** In terms of classics, I would say

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][stories by Northumbrian]], start with ‚ÄúTales of the Battle‚Äù and go on,
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]]
