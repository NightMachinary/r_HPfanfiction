** I just reread linkffn(Poison Pen by GenkaiFan). It's a fun read for when you're feeling a little vindictive. Be warned, it's a lot of Dumbledore bashing and some secondary Hermione and Ron dislike, though I hesitate to call it full on bashing.

The basic premise is that Harry gets pointed to and contacts the old Potter Family lawyer through a series of events that occurs as a result of Harry getting angry enough to question Dumbledore's greater good, and that just gives him even more tools to question everything he's had to go through.

From there it's a clever (and nonviolent) unraveling of so many plans and schemes, and I found it delightful! If you dislike bashing fics this one might not be for you. If you feel a little cranky and need a good comeuppance fic, this might fit the bill!

** Just finished “Hindsight by Proton6” linkffn(13688165). Czech overall amateur genius, polymath, opera composer, metalurgist, and amateur obstetrician, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman][Jára Cimmrman]] gave advice to budding drama writers that their work has to combine the element of expectation with the element of disappointment. That's exactly what's going while reading this story. “I hope this is going to be better than just your run-of-the-mill Harmony story.” and the disappointment is that, no, it is EXACTLY your run-of-the-mill Harmony story. Supportive (and enabling) Grangers, Amelia Bones ex machina, super!Harry and super!Hermione with their super!relationship, quite heavy Dumbledore and Ron bashing (especially unnecessary in the latter case), quite disturbing non-understanding of what redemption and forgiveness is (I am going to write a special comment about that somewhere). If you read other ones, you read this one.

*** And one more, on the more positive note. I have discovered the author under the nickname “Rumour of an Alchemist” on FFnet, who has written endless (150+) number of stories, a lot of them one-shots, and some of them quite good. So, for example, “Alternate Scene by the Lake 4” linkffn(7919460), is a thought experiment on what-if Snape gave up after the Scene by the Lake, snapped his wand and left the magical world. It so far (I haven't finished the story yet) feels like a romance story with Lily trying to harmonize her guilt (of not standing up for her friend) and other feelings, plus rather realistic picture of not altogether nice Dumbledore distracted by the war effort.

** Let me start by just saying: !!!!!!!!!!

I can't believe what I just read. But in a good way. It's a series of stories, starting with linkao3(15449145). The title of the series is: There is Nothing to Fear. (And there is something freaking bone-chilling about just the title once you know what it's about).

The series seeks to answer the question: What if Tom Riddle had sorted into Gryffindor? (and I'm pleased to say that the author gives a pretty good justification of the twisted little thought process that went into our favorite psychopath asking to be placed there). In short, the answer is: he'd win. And he's so scary because of it!

Everything from HP canon gets completely turned on its head, and it's thrilling. Most of the stories in the series are a bunch of one-shots, showing how things are turned upside down, and they skip around in a very interesting, non-chronological order. I skipped around on them, aiming for the long fic, which stars Hermione Granger returning to Hogwarts (under the rule of Riddle) during the Triwizard Tournament.

There are a lot of aspects that remind me of Prince of the Dark Kingdom, but it's also definitely its own thing. I recommend this series for anyone who's searching for something just a little bit different.

Rating: 4/5 (I absolutely love the plot, and the grammar and punctuation are pristine, but the prose is a little heavy and abstract for me at times in the long fic)

** Book 5? Book 6? Book 6 in the Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady is currently being published at a rate of two chapters each week. The series is one of my absolute favorites. In general, the series revolves around Harry dealing with the Dursley's abuse differently to canon. Harry is passive, manipulative, and secretive to a fault from the beginning of the story, but as you progress through the years (currently on year 4) he develops, heals, grows, and learns to be himself, while unlearning some of his bad habits. It's the slowest of slow burns in that regard, no free power ups or massive confidence boosts that come out of nowhere. He is damaged but working on it.

Wonderful features of this story include Harry's ridiculously vain pet Rainbow Serpent who is eternally disappointed that he failed to kill someone with lightning that one time, a mosaic of an ancient Roman wizard named Ambrosius Aurelianus that Harry talks to quite a bit, Sirius Black with PTSD from both his childhood and Azkaban who still does everything he can to help Harry and is actually pretty good at it due to understanding where he's coming from a bit, a naturally evolving friendship/mentorship with Snape that is one of the best, if not the best, take on this trope in the fandom, and more brilliant additions to wizarding culture than you can shake a stick at. The latest entry is called Unprecedented Competition, but it won't make much sense unless you start at the beginning with the very short pre-Hogwarts fic that establishes the Dursley's behavior and Harry's responses to it, The Definition of Normal. A 1/1 if ever there was one.

linkffn(11591125)

Also ongoing is Loose Cannon by Manatee-Vs-Walrus, with a new chapter every Wednesday... evening? For me it's evening, anyway. Canon-compliant-except-for-the-epilogue, post DH Harry quits the aurors and becomes seeker for the Chudley Cannons, and nothing is ever the same again. Full of humor, romance, enough OC's to fill a football stadium, and a lot of really genuine kindness, heart, and emotion. After wandering out of the story roughly 900,000 words ago, Luna Lovegood has just wandered back into it in the most incredible way. I'd say the story was worth reading just to find out what I'm talking about, but I consider it worth reading for so many other reasons. Absolute 1/1. If you aren't reading it, jump on the train.

linkffn(13452914)

I also read the only crossover with The Matrix I've ever heard of, which ended up being quite good. It's called Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality and was written by SarcasmDragon. It's much more action oriented and plot focused than the first two fics I recommended here. There were a couple of parts in the middle where it felt a little slow that I wished had been tightened up a bit, but on the whole it was a great read. It had a very interesting take on a lot of things from canon (I'm sure from the crossover you can imagine things are... very different, to put it mildly), and there were quite a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming at all, especially this story's Voldemort, which I thought was a stroke of genius on the part of the author. A solid 1/1

linkao3(4135485)

Lastly I started but did not finish Swords and Roses by Sage1988. This is a GoT crossover where Harry Potter is reborn as Harry Tyrell, younger than Loras, older than Margaery. Harry Tyrell has magic and all of Harry Potter's memories, and pretty quickly the plot shoves him out into the world to make his fortune traveling across Essos. This part of the story is a lot of fun. He has a lot of interesting little vignette adventures, for example he fights duels in Braavos, does corporate espionage for the Tourmaline Brotherhood in Qarth, and briefly joins the Golden Company. Just living it up. Then the story gets a lot less fun when he returns to Westeros and the canon plot starts happening. The problem is that Harry Tyrell is so ridiculously OP that the only thing stopping him from resolving all of his problems instantly is the author's will that he not do that so that canon can play out. He can teleport, become invisible, he has the fanon version of the point me spell where you can find literally anything, he can create magically binding contracts that completely remove the possibility of betrayal, oh, and he can summon the spirit of any dead person and make them obey his every command, including training him but also telling him secrets that they would rather not share. Honestly if you were the son of a powerful lord at the start of GoT and could do any two of those things I listed you could solve the entire plot of the show with no trouble at all. Definitely a 0/1 for me, though if you have a stronger stomach for canon rehashing than I do, or if you stop reading when Harry finishes rooting out the pirates on The Stepstones then maybe it would be a 1/1.

linkffn(12853038)

I also read a GoT/Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter crossover called Darkness Reborn by I Like Fear 1-2 that was so absurd I don't even know what to say about it. Harry's female twin is actually Morgoth, and escapes from the void into Westeros, where Harry, who is actually Sauron, is able to join her. They explore the new world a bit, reconnect, make a shitload of orcs, and then set out to conquer the world. The thing that draws me to this is that nagging feeling in the back of my head that Saruman kind of had a point about technology, and that in actuality when people lived free of machinery in harmony with nature they died young and painfully most of the time. Really our world has actually made things a great deal better with our "minds of metal and wheels". Not to say that the very fucking evil MCs of this story really make that argument, they're just evil people doing evil shit for evil's sake, but I can make the argument for them and at least at this point in the story they are stabilizing and rebuilding places as they conquer them. Like the Matrix one I mentioned above there were definitely some parts where I wished the plot was more snappy, but I can't deny enjoying it. 1/1

**** Hahaha, I too have often found that I'm drawn to read stories that people give negative reviews to way more than the positive reviews. I actually started reading one of the fics that has a negative review in this thread today because I wanted to see how bad it was. That artificer one. The post wasn't lying, it ain't great lol

Anyway, I quit reading S&R when it got to the events of the end of A Game of Thrones (or I guess I should say the end of GoT season 1). Up to that point no major plot point had been changed, despite enough pebbles dropped into the pond to displace 95% of the water. Maybe if you persevere the author makes big changes to season 2 or 3, but the internal monologue of Harry implied that he was going to retreat and do nothing to upset the status quo by tacitly supporting Renly while actually doing nothing.

Sounded to me like the fic had become a hopeless canon rehash, so I bailed. Maybe if you stick with it things improve but obviously I don't believe it. Life's too short and there are too many good fics out there to read 200k words of canon rehash on a maybe (says the guy intentionally reading a bad fic to see how bad it is, smh)

** Just finished reading linkffn(13643841). The basic premise is Harry and Susan getting sorted to Slytherin. This fic so far have none of that politicking first year Slytherin. They only care for studying, playing around and quidditch. Author manages to flesh out variety of not-blood purist Slytherin characters.

Harry here is portrayed as a kid with neglected familial love (on the same level as canon). He just wants to live somewhere else than with the Dursleys.

In my opinion the author have done well to capture the essence of kids being kids here. Though it is not yet complete or reaching any sort of conflict in story I think this story has potential

** This week I'm reading Child of Hogwarts, Part III: Master of Death. It has an M rating and recently updated after a hiatus last year.

The Child of Hogwarts series is one of the best canon divergent series that I have read. The divergence point is in the summer between first and second year: Dumbledore takes Harry away from the Dursleys following the aftermath of Dobby's visit.

There's a lot to love about this series. Sirius is spot on. The development of Harry's power is organic and hard earned. Grindelwald features, his uncertain motives adding a layer of mystery to the plot. My favourite part probably has to be the relationship between Harry and Albus though. This Dumbledore very much cares for Harry as a son. Im looking forward to seeing whether this Dumbledore will be willing to allow Harry to sacrifice himself.

I'll link to Part I as that's obviously the best place to begin: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11829846/1/Child-of-Hogwarts-Part-I-The-Lion-the-Snake-and-the-Chamber]])

  First in a series of canon-based stories, which will follow Harry Potter from the summer before COS through Hogwarts. When Harry returns to the Dursleys after the events of PS, his summer gets off to a terrible start. Albus intervenes, taking Harry back to the castle. Come see how multiple POVs and changing relationships slowly shape Harry's world! Mentorship; Training; Adventure.

** Just finished reading 'Harry Potter and the Artificer Legacy by Kairomaru'.

I started reading it several times in the past but never got past chapter 1. There is an actual dearth of artificer or runes-master or even potionsmaster stories in the fanfic universe. It's allways romance, romance, romance, dueling-auroring-fighting and mostly slacking going on (unless he's master of the universe of course, eye-roll).

There's a lot going on in the story that I really didn't like:

The author lends some elements from 'for love of magig by noodlehammer' but doesn't really follow through with them or even use them in some way. His wandless magic is way OP, especially as he can teach it to someone else and they can do the same or better in no time flat.

What really broke immersion or suspended disbelief was the romantic stuff going.

The progression of the artificing itself is to fast.

The characters are not real they are to one-dimensional and to bloody positive and happy.

It's basically a wish fullfilment story.

I did like the artificing stuff though.

*** It really isn't good at all. One thing that made me crazy that I wanted to add to your review is that every chapter begins with a thank you message to a huge block of patrons. After I quit the story I went to check out the Patreon profile, and the author is pulling in $1700 per month for this schlock! I am honestly shocked. I'd say I'm speechless, but I'm not about to shut up, so I guess not.

Noodlehammer, a far superior writer (who yes, has some...issues...), has a subscribe star page where he gets $50 a month. The guy who badly copies (some of) his ideas and writes them up poorly with terrible pacing and ample grammatical errors is out earning the person they copied by a factor of 34.

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!

** Title: Exile

Link: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]])

I picked up this fic from last week's thread. It's about Draco taking a mental health break from the wizarding world. I won't spoil it too much. I totally recommend it if you are in the mood for a serious read. I really loved how it looks at how much parenting and society can screw up kids! Lots of self-introspection and character study. It's a long read though it doesn't really feel long when reading it. I really liked the writing style also. Binged it!

Title: Pandemic

Link: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678]])

I caught up with the latest chapters. Totally recommend it for originality, plot and maturity of characterization. Delphini is now the new Headmistress of Hogwarts. I really liked her character journey so far. She's not the typical BAMF character. She's a healer at the beginning of the fic. I loved how the author wrote the character development for her. There is only one chapter left so I am kind of dreading it because I don't want it to end. On the other hand, it's good when fics end instead of dragging on. Mixed feelings. Don't let the pairing put you off. This is really more of a Cursed Child fic done right.

  Morgana was dead. Her body, once terrible in its beauty and power, lay gutted and lifeless on the bloody battlefield, the prince who had slain her standing triumphantly over her remains. He was speaking, but Emrys barely heard him. Magic still crackled around him, off the tips of his fingers and the ends of his hair. He alone remained standing, untouched by mortal steel or iron, uninjured. He had a clear shot to the prince, but his life would be forfeit if he tried. “Anybody who yields will not be killed,” the prince announced. “Quarter will be offered to anybody who swears fealty to the crown and agrees to abide by its laws.”

A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him.---------------------------------------AKA that unnecessarily long and complicated fic that will lead to an overprotective Harley Keener.Or- that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU literally nobody (including me) was looking for.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.* “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.”

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  Morgana was dead. Her body, once terrible in its beauty and power, lay gutted and lifeless on the bloody battlefield, the prince who had slain her standing triumphantly over her remains. He was speaking, but Emrys barely heard him. Magic still crackled around him, off the tips of his fingers and the ends of his hair. He alone remained standing, untouched by mortal steel or iron, uninjured. He had a clear shot to the prince, but his life would be forfeit if he tried. “Anybody who yields will not be killed,” the prince announced. “Quarter will be offered to anybody who swears fealty to the crown and agrees to abide by its laws.”

  Scorpius Malfoy is the Seeker for Slytherin. Not only that, he's the best Seeker at Hogwarts, and it's his catches that win matches. But this year things are different; Albus Potter has switched to Chaser and the new Gryffindor Seeker is his annoying little sister. This is the story of how one match and one missed catch can change your life.

The way Malfoy joked about his own death or the fact that he had watched muggle TV. Muggle news even."You're a bloody lunatic!" she snorted, and Malfoy's smile widened."Darling," he said in a posh accent. "We're all bloody lunatics, that's why we're here in the first place."

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”
