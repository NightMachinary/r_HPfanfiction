** Oh man, this brings me back to the three year summer between GoF and OotP when I was still hopeful in my ship. Paradigm of Uncertainty came before most of the established tropes, and because the author only had 4 books to work off of, nowadays the characters seem pretty OOC.

People here like to say that Vox Corporis is the definitive H/Hr story. While I also really enjoyed it, there are some aspects (author preferring film canon, some overused tropes) that keep it a tier below Paradigm for me. Or maybe it's just nostalgia speaking.

**** Can someone tell me why Vox Corporis is so well received when I could never get pats the first few chapters (mainly because of how stupid it was to make a 13 y/o Hermione 'comfort' Harry by having sex with him in the infirmary)

***** It's post 4th year, right? Which would make her 15 (which is legal in my country, not that teenagers care about the age of consent). I have more issues with a House Elf who is a dog animagus, to be honest.
