I love this fanfiction!


** Yes.

In a similar fashion, reading Zugrian's Dragon Age crossover makes me want to re-play Dragon Age. :)

**** The author gets Dragon Age, but isn't afraid to let Harry Potter's out-of-world magic mess things up. The characterization is pretty good; I like how it deals with Morrigan.

I'm pretty sure that's just everything the author writes. I mean, the Jurassic Park crossover is ridiculous and I love it to pieces too.

**** I love his fics because of how generally upbeat they are. The good guys don't have everything their way, but things definitely go better for at least most of them than in the canon. That, plus he weaves in a lot of fun wit and banter.

*** I've never played Mass Effect, but I was sometimes around a roommate as he played through the entire trilogy, and I'm pretty sure I checked the wiki for more background information as I read. That was enough for me to enjoy it, though it's been long enough that I can't say for sure how much knowledge is actually necessary.

It probably wouldn't hurt to find a YouTube video or something that gives a short description of the major races and characters.

*** I don't think so? I haven't read it in a while, but from what I recall, you'd have a harder time reading it if you hadn't read Harry Potter. They explain the ME universe pretty well.

*** You may wanna read a wiki summary first, but the story holds up itself. They have done loads of different crossovers, so you may like some others of theirs. Harry five 0 is a Harry Potter/lilo and stitch/ Hawaii five 0 crossover they've done which I loved never having seen the tv show, same for their avatar (not anime) crossover.

**** I love both 1 & 2, most of my issues with the trilogy are in the third game. 1 has the best plot + Wrex, but 2 has a great squad & a ton of gorgeous places you get to visit all over the galaxy. Having multiple base worlds to visit in 2 instead of just going back to the Citadel over & over & over again was something I particularly loved.

Plus, I've beaten the first 2 games about a dozen times each and 5 or so times for the last one (and over 1000 hours on the MP), so I've got the entire series pretty much burned into my brain at this point. And Harry at least gets to properly deal with the starbrat, so I'll forever be grateful to mjimeyg for fixing the ending since Bioware refused to do so.

***** I just don't like how they shoehorn you into working for Cerberus in the second game, though at least they semi-retcon it as a manipulation in 3.

I've played 1 dozens of times. 2 at least 10 or so. 3...once.
