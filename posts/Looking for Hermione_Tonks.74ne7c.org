As noted above. Lengthy is good, slash is also good. Just finished Dignity in Fear, Lordy I hope it updates soon, and I feel a new obsession coming on.

......you're asking for a Hermione/Tonks story. How could /any/ recommendations possibly /not/ be slash?

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** Hmm, I know what you mean, but I haven't been able to really find much. The only thing I recall is a fic where Harry is paired with Luna and it turns out that all of the old myths and fairytales were true.

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will be followed through time. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"
