I'm looking for fics that explore 'greyness' of characters. Where things are never black and white. Preferably with Harry as a main character, wrestling with his own notions and urges and with the fact that his enemies and friends are not always completely right or wrong. My favourite 'grey Harry' story is linkffn(4040612) by the wonderful FoolishWishmaker (hasn't updated in a while but author assured me she'll update in 2018). This Harry is deliciously conflicted by his feelings of kinship towards fellow Slytherins who pledge loyalty to Voldemort. linkao3(294722) also explores murky moral choices.


** My absolute favourite linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom)

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Harry should've known his sudden sixth sense for Dark Marks was a bad sign... Hogwarts has changed after the Dark Lord has won, with new Pureblood regulations, deadly classmates and worst of all, Tom Riddle's mocking voice whispering inside his head. AU dystopia: Voldemort discovers his human horcrux. LV-HP mentoring, no slash.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Perhaps 'Fate's Favourite' and 'Past's Player' are what you're looking for. Fate's Favourite is a finished story in which Tom Riddle comes to Harry's fifth year after Harry has spent a year in the past. So this fic starts out with Harry and Tom already knowing each other. Harry has to make some pretty difficult choices in this fic.

Past's Player is the prequel and explores the year Harry spent in the past. Personally, I like this one more, but unfortunately it was abandoned. Harry is convinced he belongs to the light, but his interactions with Tom show him he's grey, and he struggles with that.

Unfortunately there's some Dumbledore bashing in these stories, but if you can look past that, the interactions and fights between Harry and Tom are wonderful to read.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
