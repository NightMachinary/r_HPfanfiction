I've been reading a lot of HP fanfic lately and Harry's nearly always an Auror in them and I was wondering if anybody had fic recs where Harry's not an Auror? Literally any other career would be fine lol, I want to see something different. Bonus points if it's Drarry bc üëåüèæ

[[https://hd-career-fair.livejournal.com/]]

[[https://hd-fan-fair.livejournal.com/94229.html]]

[[https://hd-fan-fair.livejournal.com/49969.html]]

There is an AO3 archive: [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/hd_career_fair]]

Again if you have Livejournal this person has a bunch of Drarry fic lists including a jobs section:

[[https://sulky-rhino.livejournal.com/23853.html]]

LJ again! I am really sorry if you are not part of it and may consider joining for free. This is a search page and if you look at the tags there are ones for jobs. A lot of times the searches are solved or recs are given!

[[https://accio-hd-fics.livejournal.com/tag/]]

Finally, this person has a really organized Drarry rec archive. This is the 3rd or 4th page in and it has jobs separated by category. There is a goldmine here.

** The most cliche post-Hogwarts jobs for Harry are auror, quidditch player, and Hogwarts professor. Since others have mentioned quidditch player fics, here are some that avoid both of those:

*Harry/Draco*

- Hogwarts Teacher: [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12233&chapter=1][Amalgam]] by Dacro (AKA Frulie)
- Author: [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5307][Chasing a Shadow]] by Irana Potter Snape
- Curse-breaker: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1062926][Making Memories]] by Alisanne

*Other pairings*

- Assassin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417609/1/][In Cold Blood]] by Rorschach's Blot (ultimately H/OFC but really no pairing)
- Seal carver: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][Redefining Life Series]] by OliverSnape (ultimately H/OFC but most of the story takes place while he's still a student, mentor Snape)
- Hogwarts Teacher: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4657164][Obligation is a Pain]] by Amorette (no pairing, pseudo-mentor Snape)
- Race car driver: [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/245035.html][Tracking Changes]] by Montana Dan (no pairing, Severitis)
- School admin, non-Hogwarts: [[http://www.mediageek.ca/arsenicjade/writing/eyeforeye.html][An Eye for an Eye]] by Arsenic (H/D/S)
- Healer: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/376901/I_Got_Tired_of_Waiting][Hiding Under the 9th Earth series]] by I Got Tired of Waiting (AKA IGToW) (multi-pairing [not H/multi], long, multi-part, unfinished)

ETA: Wait, I wasn't finished!!! Everything else is *Harry/Snape*

- Sex shop owner: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/16781][Addition Alley series]] by Oliver Snape
- Potions shop owner: A Fruit Tree in Winter ([[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_holidays/54396.html][IJ]] or [[http://community.livejournal.com/snarry_holidays/18098.html][LJ]]) by Ze Dragon

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
