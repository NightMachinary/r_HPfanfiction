Ginny as extroverted or the "boyish" female type (like in Canon) and falls for quite the opposite personality, so introverted or shy.

Doesnt matter, if it has smut in it, but i can imagine it would be fun, if the introverted, shy girl is the loudest ones of them both in Bed :D


** Hmmm

Edit: why are you guys upvoting this and why does it have the most upvotes of all the comments i literally just left this as a bookmark

*** whats wrong with upvotes? Maybe the content theme is it, that im looking for. Femslash is somethings Guys (and Girls/Woman) are attracted to and if one Female (Ginny) is the dominant one, falling for a shy and reluctant one, i can imagine it will be cute and hot to "conquer" her. And since you left this thread as a Bookmark, i can tell, you are interested too for possible recs.
