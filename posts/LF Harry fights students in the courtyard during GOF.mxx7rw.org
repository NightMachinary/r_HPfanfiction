I only remember one scene but in a short (4 chapters) uncompleted story, Harry fights most of the students in the courtyard during the whole GOF debacle after Malfoy/Ron get into an argument with him. The only professor on his side is Flitwick and Moody, and students are Daphne, Tracey, and Astoria.

In the scene, he basically shoots a spell into the ground sending dirt clods up, and then some how flips over everyone and attacks back (lol)


** Isn't this one with the scene where Hedwig is captured and tortured in the courtyard? I vaguely remember it but don't remember the name unfortunately.\\

  AU GoF. What would have happened if the Schools involved in the Tri-Wiz were less receptive of Harry's name coming out from the Goblet? What if everyone was against him? And where the icy blue-eyed Slytherin Queen fits in all this? OOC!People Powerful!Independent!Harry. Bashing of some characters around. Good but Misguided!Dumbledore and Harry/Daphne! Betaing in process!
