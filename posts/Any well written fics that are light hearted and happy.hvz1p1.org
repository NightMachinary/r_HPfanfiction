I've read quite a few darker stories lately a light hearted one would be nice. Preferably over 100k words but if its close and complete ill take it


** Ooooh I've got just the one for you! One of my absolute favourite fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1349676/1/Bend-It-Like-Weasley][Bend It Like Weasley]] by Jedi Tess of Gryffindor. It's about... well, kids from all the houses coming together to form a quidditch team, coached by a rather unexpected individual. This is the funniest fanfiction I've ever read and I've been reading fics in the HP fandom for a very long time now. It's lighthearted, but with an interesting plot and it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Try it out! :)

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
