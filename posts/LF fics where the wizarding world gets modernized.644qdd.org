I'm looking for fics where the wizarding world gets modernized to muggle standards. Or where there is a lot of interaction between muggles and wizards. Preferably over 50k words, thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s postwar Series shows close interactions between Kingsley's Ministry and the Muggle government. The magicals also developed new hybrid magic/tech products such as Mirrorphone and port-key cars.

--------------

in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]], linkffn(9992917), PC Roberta Beadle was inadvertently drawn into a magical homicide. She became suspicious of Harry's background story and managed to piece lots of things together just by using public information. When she confronted Harry, he told her the truth and brought her onto his team. That was the beginning of the MIT (Muggle Interface Team).

Northumbrian wrote or is writing 6 MIT related stories so far. I like all of them. In chronological order, they are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7071175/1/MLT-Muggle-Liaison-Team][MLT: Muggle Liaison Team]]: Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, Roberta Beadle, and other OC formed the original MIT.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9382930/1/MIT-Secret-Keeper][MIT: Secret Keeper]]: Roberta made acquaintance with Oliver Wood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7085543/1/MIT-Haunted-House-Dead][MIT: Haunted House Dead]]: This is my favorite of this little series. MIT had to solve a murder case involving a cursed artifact at a Muggle manor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6869796/1/MIT-Hampstead-Heath-Corpse][MIT: Hampstead Heath Corpse]]: They had to solve a case involving a mysterious dead person.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12029238/1/MIT-Strange-Place][MIT: Strange Place]]: Anti-Muggle ward on a former Lestrange estate broke down, two Muggle police was caught inside. Narcissa would make an appearance here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10716964/1/MIT-Entente-Cordiale][MIT: Entente Cordiale]]: They had to solve a murder case with the French. Gabrielle would play a key role.

--------------

In Northumbrian's longest and best fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), majority of the story was told from Harry's Muggle neighbor's POV. The Potters moved into a Muggle neighborhood, James Sirius started off at a Muggle primary school, and they were having extensive interactions with other children's parents. In addition, Harry and his team needed to catch a magical serial killer.
