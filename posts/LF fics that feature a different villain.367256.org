Honestly, I just don't like Voldemort as a villain. Are there any good fics that have a different (hopefully better) villain?


** Well, any of the many shitty Voldemort's heir!Harry stories..

Jokes aside, while Shezza's Denarian series does feature Voldemort as a villain at some points, most of the story has the Order of the Blackened Denarius as the main villains. Its also an amazing story, so that helps.

I never understood those. A heir of /A/ is, by definition, someone who will inherit or has inherited property, title, or some other legacy of /A/ upon /A/'s death. Voldemort does not plan to die. Why would he designate an heir? (There are some possible motives for him to have a figurehead heir, to hide his own immortality, but I don't think many VoldeHeir!Harry fics bother with an actual motivation.)

** Are crossovers okay? Because a lot of them have like Darth Vader or whoever as the main antagonist.

** There's this series called the James Potter series, it's got it's own website and it's about James Sirius Potter. I haven't read the whole thing, PDF stories are hard to mark where you're up to so I stopped rather early in the first one BUT the first chapter introduces a new villian. Sorry, I can't find a link, does anyone know what I'm talking about?

*** [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter series]] is actually the first HP fanfic I read. I loved it, wanted more like that, and somehow, after spending way too much time on ffnet, ended up here... I really have no idea how that happened.

*** [[http://www.goodreads.com/series/45293-james-potter][This?]] I came across it once through Goodreads recommendations. I even wanted to ask here if anyone has read/enjoyed it because it seemed weird that a story with so high a rating and so many words would be almost completely unknown to the reddit's fanfic community.
