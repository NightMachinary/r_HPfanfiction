  Things didn't entirely get swept aside after the conclusion of the TWT. Dumbledore doesn't get his way. Riddle or Fudge won't either. Some OCs have large roles.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** No, it is a fringe horror that comes up if you spend too much time trying to figure out how all the points stated in the books can be true at the same time.

Hogwarts being the only school in Britain teaching all wizards. The government being rather incompetent and poorly regulated. Everything they learn at school not really being something specific to school grounds (and could be learned by books). The Secrecy statute and how it is preserved. The fact that Hogwarts is set up as a boarding school (with the trappings of one), but somehow is meant to function as a public school (taking all comers, establishing educational baseline for the population, having to deal with all types of students/parents). The lack of a post-secondary education system.

It can get dark very quickly. The most common way it is usually presented is 'students magic is bound and they/family are mind wiped if they refuse to attend'. Or there is some sort of spell on the general muggle population to make them slowly forget/not care about their kids they sent off (and on the kids to make them distant from their parents).

'course sometimes authors make it so there are lesser schools than Hogwarts, Hogwarts is paid instead of free, or something of the like. Or have a much more competent/authoritarian government system than what is shown in the books. Or just don't dive too deep into it....

***** I would think that they instill a fear in parents of muggleborns that magic is something they needed to learn to control for their own safety; obviously, if they say they going withou a magical education can have negative effects on a wizard, then the whole " the magic will be bound and your memories erased" spiel is another level of the threat ( that actually, annuls the first- if the magic is stripped, then how the magic would be dangerous?)...

​

So, I assume they first say it is for health-safety issues and remind the muggle parents that a wizard had a LONGER life than a mundane, so their child would have to, eventually, either fake certificates to explain the slow aging or return to the magical world when old THEN, if this did not work out, they would say they simply the magic away from the child.

​

In my mind, as a parent, this would be the only way I would agree to have my child go to a school where I am not even allowed to visit. ( also, tuition is free.)
