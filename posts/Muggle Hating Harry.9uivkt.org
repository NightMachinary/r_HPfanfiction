Never seen it done well. No slash please!


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) does it very well, to the point where Harry's debates with Hermione over Muggles make me a little uncomfortable because I'm unsure who's side I'm on

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

*** I never found myself in that position, honestly. Most of his beliefs about muggles are still utterly, inescapably wrong, even if he has better justification than any pureblood to adopt them. His only defensible ideas relate to the potential for the muggle world to completely wipe out the wizarding world in the event of a SoS collapse, but even there his positions ignore that in order to do so, muggles would have to essentially nuke themselves. The sole doomsday-scenario threat muggles therefore pose is that they could choose to depopulate the Earth itself, which is a situation entirely rectifiable by having a wizard assigned to infiltrate the government of each nation with nuclear capabilities and covertly disarm them. Really, that the wizards haven't done so already is inexcusable bloody-minded apathy, as far as I'm concerned.

** linkffn( Rise of the Wizards).

Has cliches, but they're reasonable, I think. The major problem with the story is the pacing - it's rather uneven. It takes 30 odd chapters to get to seventh year from the end of the fight in OoTP, and has roughly a hundred years in the next 20 chapters.
