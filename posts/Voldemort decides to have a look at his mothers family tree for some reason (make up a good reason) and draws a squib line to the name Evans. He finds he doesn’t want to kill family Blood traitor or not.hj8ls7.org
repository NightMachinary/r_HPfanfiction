- anger

Sirius: /tries to choke Voldemort/

Remus: /frantically holds him back, there will be no cruciatuses at the table/

Voldemort: /smiles smugly, eating soup/

- bargaining: So, can you kill Walburga for baby photo of Harry? I have plenty. Hush, James, I know what I am doing. And, can Regulus come next dinner? Wanker owes me 10 galleons. And as to Wormtail...

- depression: Please, speak 'Paddy', Harry, I don't understand you. How. How is this happening? To my sweet godson Harry? I don't know. I don't even care. /transmutes a fork into a small snake/

Sirius: Hey, Voldemort, u want this totally normal Cream for dessert?

****** I think it depends if he found about it before or after initiating contact. If before, then it could go pretty closely to canon - he /did/ promise to let Lily Evans live, surely she can have other children, he can check the lead later.

I imagine that it would be hard to take prophecy too seriously if he was already immersed in the Potters family life. This kid that blew bubbles at Nagini last Sunday? Will slay me? Nah, impossible (Nagini is such a good judge of characters besides). Even if he believed it, well, he's already observing this 'Chosen One' pretty closely. No inept spies to muddle reports. Surely Great Lord Voldemort himself can handle a baby. Or rather observing if the baby is rising competition. Hmm maybe possible heir? He will have to look into tutoring pre-Hogwarts children. A bit of harmless dark magic exposure never hurt anyone. Except Billy Stubbs rabbit, that is.

***** I /love/ this. I also feel like it kinda fits with the whole theme of the books, a la, love saving the day. which is like, super sappy on its face, but I personally tend to come at it from the angle of developmental and abnormal psych +cuz that's my favorite thing to read about lmao+.

so, given what we know of Tom Marvolo Riddle's early life, he definitely would have had attachment issues and some gnarly PTSD. +both of which, I think, were a bigger factor in his "inability to love" than a love potion because that's horrible jkr why would you do that?+.

and with that sort of developmental damage, it's really hard, as an adult, to interact normally with people. given Sirius' background, I imagine he'd /get it/, and the first time he pranked Marvolo, and Marvolo shat a brick, I could see Sirius both taking him to task, and also offering support. like "hey, I get it, but also u can't act like that, here's a therapist go get help so the potters let u back in their house again you insufferable asshole"

**** On one hand, he killed the muggle Riddles on an entitled whiny teenage angst murder rampage-slash-tantrum, so as a more rational adult he might spare an important wizard family.

On the other hand, adult Voldemort is still a considerably entitled whiny and angsty child who throws a tantrum when things don't go his way, and might be insane from horcruxing besides, so it's hard to know how he would react.
