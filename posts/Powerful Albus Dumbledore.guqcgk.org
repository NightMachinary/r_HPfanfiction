All I ever see is weak Dumbledores that just sit as a headmaster and politician. However, he defeated Grindelwald and also holds Voldemort at a standstill a good 50 years later.

Are there any pics with an appropriately powerful Dumbledore?

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) features a powerful Dumbledore.\\
Cunning enough to effortlessly outmaneuver his opponents politically and with enough magical strength to take on an army should the need arise.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

And I loved every second of it I read.

The world is interesting and fun! And his characters are awesome!

** linkao3(14078862) The Accidental Animagus has a pretty badass Dumbledore.

Let's just put it that he didn't get a position on the ICW by collecting bottle caps, and proves it a few times over.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
