I just started rereading HP and I was reminded of this fanfiction I read when I was way younger. Definitly 4+ years ago.

From what I remember, it was mostly a Dramione fanfiction, but the premise was that Hermione liked Harry and Ron liked Hermione. And at some point Hermione goes dark, and Harry and Ron keep trying to keep her good (like I think Harry agrees to pretend to like Hermione). Also I think there was some Blaise/Ginny.

Also there's a chance I am mixing a ton of fanfictions together.

Hope someone can maybe help. I've been searching and trying to think of more details but I'm hitting dead ends.
