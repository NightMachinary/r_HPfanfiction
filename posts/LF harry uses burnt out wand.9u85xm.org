I cant remember much from the fic, only a scene where Harry is told to close his eyes, gets handed tonks (?) Wand, and uses lumos, though it turns out he is handed a pencil, yet the spell works anyway. Anyone remember what fic it is from?

  Harry is left with the Dursleys just after his godfather had died. One thing leads to the other and Harry is fed up with being a puppet. He breaks free and finds help. And boy, does he start rocking the boat.

** It rings a bell. The one I'm thinking of is old. Really old. Harry/Ginny with super Harry and wandless magic. I remember that in that fic he burnt out his wand casting the patronus at the end of Prisoner and just kind of never noticed he was using a bum wand.

I want to say 2005ish?

Refiners Fire keeps surfacing in my mind, but I don't think that's it, I think I read that fic around the same time as I read refiners fire, but the name of the fic must have been less memorable.

** Could it be linkffn(4190796)? I'm pretty sure it's this one because later on they go looking for Merlin's staff.
