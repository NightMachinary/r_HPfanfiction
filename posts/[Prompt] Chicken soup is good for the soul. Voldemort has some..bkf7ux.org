** "What's this Potter?" Voldemort asked with a smirk as Dolohov forcefully yanked a small vial of milky liquid out of Harry's pocket.

Harry remained silent, he needed to give off an air of defiance, lest Voldemort suspect anything was wrong.

"/Crucio/."

Harry grit his teeth as he felt razor sharp, white hot needles pierce every bit of his body repeatedly, the feeling of his bones being crushed, his tendons ripped, and his flesh dipped in acid. Eventually the pain stopped.

"D-de-defence a-ag-against th-t-t Cru-cr-cucia-cruciatus" He managed to stammer out, in between large gasps of precious air.

Voldemort's blazing red eyes pierced his and Harry felt his mental probe smash into his meager shields, Harry let him see the memory Dumbledore implanted into his mind, after a few tense seconds Voldemort withdrew. The pain from the Cruciatus was nothing compared to the tense anguish of wondering if he bought the ruse or not.

Voldemort began to chuckle, a wretched sound that sent shivers down Harry's spine.

"Well well, it seems dear old Severus came through, pity that this won't be enough to save you Potter." Voldemort gloated as he brought the vial closer for inspection.

With a sick smile on his face Voldemort uncorked the vial, brought it to his lipless mouth and tipped the contents down his throat.

What happened next was something Harry thought was nothing short of a miracle.

As soon as the vial was empty Voldemort's arrogant smirk disappeared and a pained expression was exchanged in its place. He began to groan and clutch at his stomach. An eerie quiet overcame them, and even the Death Eaters surrounding Voldemort started to fidget nervously. Suddenly Harry heard a low, waling scream... Many in fact, and they were getting closer. A window smashed to his right, he slowly turned his head to observe at what looked like tiny, smokey and pale ghosts that resembled Voldemort's face fly rapidly and slam into the man himself. Soon Voldemort began to cry out as more and more of the apparitions came through the window.

After the sixth one Harry himself began to scream as something heavy and /wrong/ began to worm its way out of his scar, he felt warmth trickle down his face and guessed that it was his blood. Soon the heaviness was gone and Harry was left gasping for breath. A feeling of a thousand weights lifted off his shoulders overcame him. He began to pant in relief.

Harry was slowly regaining his breath when he noticed the eerie quiet. He dared open his eyes and widened them in shock when he saw what had become of his enemy.

Instead of the pale, bald, snake like creature with baleful red eyes. A normal looking man sat hunched over before him. He had short and messy dark brown hair that was beginning to go gray, a normal British pale complexion and though Harry couldn't see them very well he nonetheless caught a glimpse of soft brown eyes peeking out between his normal length fingers as Voldemort... No, /Tom/ held his face with his hands, moaning.

"What have I done?" He heard Tom whisper. "What have I become?" He cried. Actual tears seeping down his red cheeks as he wept. Harry was stunned, was this... Remorse? Had it worked?

"W-what... What was that, Harry?" Tom asked in a quiet, soft, /vulnerable/ voice.

"Chicken Soup." Harry replied. "It's good for the soul."
