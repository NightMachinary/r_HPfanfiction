** "I think it's fair to say that people bash Harmony in general way more than we bash Ron or Ginny."

On one side : "Yeah, Harmony can't really work, they're like brother and sister, plus Harry never really liked Hermione's idea of fun"

On the other side : "Ron is a fucking loser he deserves to die why do people like him look he's weak and ugly and he smells" and "Ginny's such a cunt and a useless slut fangirl she gotta use love potions to have things"

​

Yeah I'm filling the truth here

** I imagine I'm one of those people who you would consider to be a Harry/Hermione hater. I do not believe that Harry and Hermione, authentic to their canon characterizations, would be compatible as romantic partners.

That said, I don't think most people really hate it. To hate a romantic pairing between two fictional characters is, in my mind, foolish and a waste of energy. /They're fictional people/.

I think most people simply disagree with the idea that Harry/Hermione are better than Harry/Ginny and Harry/Ron. This can lead to vitriol.

I would note, however, that's it's not exactly like Harry/Hermione fans are innocent. I'm not sure if you've ever been on [[/r/HPHarmony]] but the people there are very vocal and uncompromising in their beliefs. Just look at the survey manipulation posts that they had. It doesn't help that many Harry/Hermione supporters look very negatively on Ron, who happens to be one of my favorite characters. I assume many others like him as well.

I think a lot of the "bashing" is the criticism of the supporters' overly fervent support. Is it right? No.

That said, this post seems like it will just add fuel onto the flames.

*** I see your sarcasm. But anyway, that was only because that user is hated in our community because he regularly comes into [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] just to say bad stuff about. Basically, that person joined the sub just to say negative things. I'm sure you would hate that if someone did that to you.

** Personally, i do not ship Harmony, but I do agree with this. I assume it is because in most Harmony fics Hermione becomes perfect, ‘beautiful' and effectively a Mary Sue OOC character. Plus, most of us probably hate the fact that she becomes way too perfect in fanon. Also, in different ship fics (Harryxfleur HarryxDaphne etc) although it is not Hermione centric she features prominently and way too much. Sometimes she is also shipped with them.

*** In most Harmony fics I've read - and I read a lot - Hermione becomes a spineless damsel who will happily follow Harry's lead no matter what. If she disagrees, he will lecture her, and then she'll nod and agree. In short, she loses out on all agency so Harry can save her and be the strong man.
