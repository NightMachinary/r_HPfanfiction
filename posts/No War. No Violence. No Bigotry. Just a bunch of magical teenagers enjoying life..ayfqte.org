  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** What's Her Name in Hufflepuff

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/]]

Honestly, it's so unlike the average HP fanfic I struggle to define it. Best way I can put it, it's fluffy slice of life in Hogwarts, including Actual Magic (it's apparently a rarity in this fandom). It's updated about once a month.

*** Ambition and cunning aren't opposite to the OP. Fred and George would have done quite well in Slytherin imo.

It is quite ambitious to start your own business from scratch and even more cunning to do it without your family, who you live with, from knowing about it. That's ignoring the cunning associated with pranks.

Let's also not forget the sex jokes about Slytherin and how great their cunninglingus is. I had to stretch that, but I'm sure someone could play it off.

Not sure if it fills all the criteria; recommended this because of those moments where the crew were acting like teens-playing poker, inventing a magic game (freezing the lake so they can go ice skating), dating, etc.

  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?

** This fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]] id: 2889350 is pretty good. The only violence relates to fighting zombies. Otherwise its mostly just a teenage Harry hanging around and going with Bill on a summer adventure where harry learns to grow up. And yes I know you said no violence but I think this is the type of fic you might be looking for. His other one The Lie I've lived is another classic.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.
