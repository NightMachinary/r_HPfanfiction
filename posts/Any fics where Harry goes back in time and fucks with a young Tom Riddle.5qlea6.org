** I think you really mean 'fucks around with', but anyway, I recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838/][Realignment]] on Space Battles, too.

No, "a hard time"

Wait, "to show him the wrong end of the wand"

**** Not necessarily. In this context, it /could/, but has just as much possibility to mean "messing around with."

** Well, linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB) is a young-Tom centric fic where Harry is trying to kill him? Far more chapters on Spacebattles, but the author is working on crossposting.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered destinies]] was the first fic I read, so that might be biasing my opinion a bit, but it's what came to mind and I remember it as one of the most engrossing I've ever read.

Basic premise is that Harry goes back in time to stop the bloodshed of the war by "fucking with" a young Tom Riddle, so to speak.

#+begin_quote
  Hadrian is the youngest of the infamous Princes of Hell. He's known as the Prince of Death, Necromancy and Immortality; he has legions of demons beneath him and endless power and influence - so he's still at a bit of a loss as to how this unworthy human Dark Lord managed to summon him of all demons. Or, you know, why he's decided to stick around and help him.
