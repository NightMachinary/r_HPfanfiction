He can still be his usual sour self. Preferably something with a scene where he saves his love interest from a dire/dangerous situation.

  1998. Severus Snape has survived the Second Wizarding War. Presumed dead, still dealing with the traumas of his past, having nowhere to go and no sense of purpose, he returns to Spinner´s End to battle his inner demons. Meanwhile, Dark Lord´s remaining followers begin to regroup and plan revenge with help from foreign allies the British Ministry has never managed to track down and is powerless to fight. The scattered Death Eaters suspect Snape is alive and still has sensitive information that could lead them to a powerful artifact.To further complicate Snape´s already perilous situation, an Irish historian moves into the abandoned house next door. She brings a heavy baggage of family secrets and previously unknown connections to the magical world, and gradually becomes a fixture of Snape´s life, inadvertently changing it. Alternative Universe/What if.

  Severus Snape survived the war and Nagini's bite. He's seriously pissed off about it and lying low at Spinner's End, fearing retribution and the dragging-out-into-the-open of his private life. Until, one day, there is a knock on the door ... Introducing Elena (OC), a Muggle student of linguistics and dancing teacher who finds out that she is really a witch ...

  Sequel to my first story 'Educating Elena':Several months after his mysterious survival, tables and tabloids are turning against Severus Snape. He faces a conspiracy, legal troubles and has no reason to be in a good mood. And then there's a capricious woman to consider ... This is all about the big question: can there be happiness for Snape?

** Can I direct you towards my fic, 'Behind the Hatred'? I'm not sure it fits your rescue brief but there is a dire situation / Severus rescue of sorts in Chapter 10. (Then it gets very spicy in chapter 11!)
