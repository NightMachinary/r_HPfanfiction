I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago, I think it was on fanfiction.net. Dudley is a social worker who gets called in on a suspected case of child abuse - he meets Hermione there who works for the ministry in the same capacity and who came because the child turned his mother's abusive boyfriend into a cockroach. I think Harry ends up adopting the kid, who is really Zacharias Smith's son.

Ring a bell for anyone?


** linkao3(Dudley's Memories) Pretty sure this is it :)

*** Yep, definitely it. I think I've read most worthwhile "Redeemed Dudley" fics, this is the only one that that fits the description.

Interestingly enough, most fics that give Dudley a role and portray him not as monster are way above average imo.

**** Because they're written by people who acknowledge that character development is a thing and that the world isn't black and white. It's already a step up from most writers :P

Do you have any good redeemed Dudley recs?

***** "Perfectly Normal, thank you very much" comes to mind. Don't have the link here, but should be easy to find with Google.

*** I would also recommend this to people. It's a good story and so are the sequels.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.
