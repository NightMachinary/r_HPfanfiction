I've always really enjoyed stories where Harry or Ginny run away and go into hiding for various reasons only to be discovered by the other one in their new life. Anyone know of well written stories that fit this criteria?


** Do you have any examples of such a story?

*** Here's one example. It was one of the first fanfictions I read about 7 years ago. It doesn't have the best writing but I really loved the premise. [[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/1645464/1/A-Lost-Love]]

Edit: here's another example [[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5189189/1/The-World-I-Leave-Behind]]

*** Thanks I'll check this out! Although to be honest, I'm really looking for stories that are a bit longer. I usually read only novel length fics.

Another one without Ginny, but it does have Hermione. It's not novel length, but it is spanned over a long period of time, so there is that.

Also, it's really good!
