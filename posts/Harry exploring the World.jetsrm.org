I'm looking for fics that involve Harry going to other places and learning magic, finding magical creatures, delving into ancient ruins, and fighting beasts from mythologies.

Whether this is after dealing with Voldemort, or not, I don't really mind.

I'd prefer no romance, and I'd rather not have Slash.

Humour is a definite plus, whether that be crack or not.


** Linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot)

It has Harry starting to travel and experiencing inadvertent adventures.

It is mostly crack and humor but has some serious moments.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** You might like my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis". Harry, Hermione and Ron travel the world, exploring ancient ruins, finding and sometimes fighting magical creatures of all kinds, learning new magic and fighting beasts from mythology while they search for the lost City/Island of Atlantis.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** linkao3(The Venom Peddler). Parselmagic story where Harry raises a nest of basilisks and in one part, travels to Australia where that type of thing is more common. It's only part of the book but it's a memorable part.

*** Just read this one recently and I thought it was a pretty decent fic. I do feel like it needed just one more chapter, one of those â€˜20 years later' epilogues. not that it is bad without it, just my opinion.

**** Yeah the ending was no good at all, but most of the rest of the book was pretty good, I thought.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
