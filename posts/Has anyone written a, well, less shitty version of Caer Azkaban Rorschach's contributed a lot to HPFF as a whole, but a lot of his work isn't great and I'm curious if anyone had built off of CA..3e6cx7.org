#+TITLE: Has anyone written a, well, less shitty version of Caer Azkaban? Rorschach's contributed a lot to HPFF as a whole, but a lot of his work isn't great and I'm curious if anyone had built off of CA.

** Rorschach's work is really really hard to work on (even to improve it) because you cant really talk to him. he doesnt well.. respond. (in my experience) that being said, google Azkaban Harry Stories. the first link is a community, its full of them. A fair bit of them are /better/ than Rorschach's attempt.

*** You don't necessarily have to talk to the guy to fix his stuff, but it definitely would help. I did as you said and will take a look at some of those. Thanks.

**** Normally that is correct, but I feel iffy about modifying a work, or even being heavily influenced by a work, without the Author's permission. Its the writer in me. I know how hard it is to work on a work. its brutal to come up with everything, and to make sure its great. Fanfiction is extremely hard because of HOW its updated. All books are written with the thought of being read as a whole work while fanfiction is written is spurts, leaps, and bounds. An author will work on a story for six months, and maybe finish ten chapters, but with how the internet is you cant DO that with fanfiction. You have to have a ton of work prewritten, or you have to be extremely quick to work on it. A Fanfic author duo I really love is the author of the Harleywing series and they do the HARDEST style of writing ever. They bounce it between themselves, write the work, proof it, beta it, then publish it, all in generally a week per chapter. Most of the time having two to four chapter updates in rapid succession. So keeping ALL of what I said in mind, I try my hardest to get a response from the author before I use or modify anything from their work. If nothing else because I respect the work they put into it.
