  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

**** Maybe give it another chapter or two to hit its stride.

Think of it like this: in the magical world, the genre of this story would be something like 'slice of life', but for people with magic dealing with magic things.

That isn't exactly right, but it hopefully points you closer to the right direction for understanding what makes this story special.

** A little self-promotion never hurt anyone, right?

This is my WIP (currently just under 50k but will be much longer), AU from Seer!Luna's point of view, and it's all about her studying blood magic and starting her own school for girls. It's Luna/Ginny but the ship isn't the main focus of the fic and there won't really be explicit smut.

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood grows up a Seer, the child of prophecy, and best friends with Ginny Weasley. After Ginny is possessed by the Dark Lord during her first year at Hogwarts, Luna founds a magical school for girls to explore the ancient art of women's blood magic, defensive magic, and rhetorical diplomacy. She fights the rising tide of darkness with this new brand of old magic, putting her at odds with the Ministry, Hogwarts, and Harry Potter. Luna must choose between traditions when a darker power rises to threaten her brave new world.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)
