Hello!

How do you think HP magic would compare to Azeroth (World of Warcraft) magic? I believe that HP has more utility things and finesse, while Azeroth has stronger spells. Also, if I'm not mistaken, a lot of Azeroth magic isn't instantaneous, while in HP it pretty much is. Another thing to consider is transfiguration and conjuration, I don't think there's anything like that in Azeroth.

How do you think the AK curse would affect some of the stronger beings in Azeroth? Or the various shield spells.


** If you go by game logic, then the average hero is a literally immortal time-traveling, universe-hopping, nameless godslayer.

In the normal lore, the universes would probably be evenly matched at the lowest levels. Past that, it's kind of hard to see HP universe having any sort of effect once you start reaching power levels like the Lich King, Elemental Lords, Old Gods, and planets being literal incubation chambers for celestial beings.

As for comparing solely by magic, transfiguration is mostly limited to animation and shapeshifting (e.g. elementals and druids, respectively). Conjuration exists as well, and is presumably less limited than the HPverse, as mages are able to conjure food.

** Azeroth does have conjuration and transfiguration--Mages can conjure food and drink and turn you into a sheep or a pig. Warlocks can conjure soul stones. Priest Healing, depending on if you're Holy or Disc, will either have some instants (Holy) or be mostly cast-time based (Disc). I recall Shaman healing being heavy on the cast times and Druid healing being chock-full of instants. One thing Azeroth has that HP doesn't seem to is the concept of cool downs on spells.

I played for 10 years and got a little statue, but I haven't played in a really long time and it's probably all different now.

I would imagine a Disc priest's Shield would counter an Avada Kedavra--I know it's saved my ass from many a one-shot! :D

** To answer your last question, I think the Killing Curse would kill anything short of a god as long as it has a soul. Of course, this is unless a character specifically wields some sort of soul magic, at which point they may be able to counter the "kicks the soul into the afterlife" effect.

*** Hm...if you go by that then any soul-destroying warlock spell should mean instant death as well, but they don't (maybe all that magic infusing Azeroth gives beings there a little resistance? So maybe the AK is damned dangerous for them, but not a one-shot?

And it can probably blocked by shields - not only the ones mages/priests/paladins cast, but also by physical ones and maybe even by full body-armor (if the spell doesn't actually hit the body, then it can't affect you...hell, I sometimes ask myself why nobody in HP has tried that, because physical objects seem to help with the AK, so why not a knight's armor or even something like the Iron Man Armor...hell, even Police Riot Gear should at least be able to take one hit...even more if you count those ballistic shields!)

** AK would presumably not affect a lot of the stronger beings on Azeroth as their souls work in different ways. I think some player spells would block AK such as spell-reflect, iceblock, divine shield etc...

**** I think they were just answering the OP in a similar fashion to the question.

**** Why? Just because you don't like us shortening Avada Kedavra? The initials are A and K, so AK! Hell, it is kind of funny that one of the worlds deadliest (by bodycount because it's been in every major war since it has been created!) weapons is called the AK-47!
