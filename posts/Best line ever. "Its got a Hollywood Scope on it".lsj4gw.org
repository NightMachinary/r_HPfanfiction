Luna grabbed the other end of the mouth organ and a second later, she found herself stumbling for her footing on a sandy beach.

"Where are we," she gasped as she looked around at a gorgeously pristine beach, bordered by incredibly lush vegetation, ferns and coconut trees. Behind them rose a hill covered with more lush green vegetation.

"Oh, just a small-uninhabited island in the Pacific, I needed somewhere reasonably remote to test my idea out," said Harry as he once again started digging around inside his backpack. Then he pulled out a large metal object from inside it.

"That - is a really, really big gun," said Luna in surprise.

"The Barrett M82A1, they say it can put a bullet right through an engine block. Sirius helped me find one of these. We nicked it from a Drug Baron with a serious fetish for weapons," said Harry.

Harry started setting the gun up on a little rocky outpost, sighting down the large telescopic sight attached to it.

"Doesn't it take time and training to learn how to use of one of those?" asked Luna.

"Nah, it's got a Hollywood scope on it," said Harry.

"What's a Hollywood scope?"

"You know," said Harry, waving his arms around for emphasis. "In the movies, they'll have a sniper or an assassin who's supposedly a great shot and then they show him shooting someone and they have the shot where the camera is looking through the telescopic sight and the sniper's lining up the target in the little cross hairs and you think - jeez, that looks easy. Anyone could do that, if all you have to do is look through the scope and line up the target in the little cross."

"And... I take it it's not as easy in real life," said Luna.

"Well, it usually isn't. The bullet drops as it travels so you have to adjust for that. Then you also have to take the wind factor into account and adjust for that and probably a few other things that I'm not aware of. Anyway, the scope is enchanted to adjust for all of those things so all I have to do is... just like in the movies - line up the target in the little cross hairs and press the trigger," explained Harry.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
