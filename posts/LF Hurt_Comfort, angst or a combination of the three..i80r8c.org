Harry doesn't have to be in the story or the main character, but if he is:

No ridiculously over powerful Harry, Harry smarter and stronger then in canon is fine, but nothing out there.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes or not, doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing (If at all possible, but understand that might be too high to ask for).
