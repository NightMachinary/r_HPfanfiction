I'm just about finished with A Butterfly Effect and I find myself with a hunger for more femHarry stories. Femslash is preferred, but certainly not a necessity.

Thank you for any recommendations you have for me.


** There are a couple of good ones, imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]] is a fem!harry/snape. It's a mammoth of fanfic, currently sitting at over 500k words. It's a slow burn if there ever was one. The author said there won't be any romance between the two until Harriet is out of school. It's in 4th year right now, so there is a long, long ways to go. The author updates pretty frequently though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived]] is a fem!harry with an interesting twist. It appears as though Harry, in this fic, is actually a boy, but everyone sees and treats him as a girl. It hasn't updated in a while, so I'm not sure if it's abandoned yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is one of the better fem!harry's that I've come across. It's well written and pretty captivating. It only goes through year 1 and, as far as I know, there is no sequel yet. I'm not sure if the author intends to continue it (this author has written a bunch of stuff), but it's definitely worth a read anyway.

Hope this was useful!

*** Wouldn't say so much based off Tamora Pierce as inspired by. Nearly identical concept, but based entirely in the HP world.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is a good one. "Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal." It's complete, but there's an unfinished sequel out there.

** One of my all time favorites is the Severus' Rose series. It's still WIP as of its next-gen phase, but complete through year 7. It has its flaws for sure, but I just can't help it, it makes me all warm and fuzzy and happy. So yeah, it's heavy on the parent-child drama and the fluff. Not femslash, Biological father Severitus fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10509859/1/Duplicitous-Destiny][Duplicitous Destiny]] doesn't qualify, but it's related. Harry dies in first year and Daphne Greengrass takes his place.

** I've never understood the fem Harry thing. Then again I don't understand gay Harry either, so what do I know.

*** fem!Harry is interesting because it's a good way for subtle changes everywhere. Would Snape be quite as harsh if Harry didn't look like James? Would Hermione be more understanding of the Quidditch obsession? What about interactions with Draco? And would Sirius really egg Harry on to be more like James rather than play responsible guardian?

There are quite a few interesting things, and they could cause a whole lot of changes.

**** Also, would there have been more or less abuse at the hands of the Dursleys? Would a fem Harry have been subjected to sexual abuse in addition to the physical & emotional abuse that boy Harry faced?

***** Or on the contrary, would the Dursley's have treated Harry more normally if he had been a girl?
