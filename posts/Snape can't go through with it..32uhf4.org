Iirc, we see Snape hesitate to kill Dumbledore in canon; I'm looking for a fic where he backs out and turns on the death eaters. Maybe afterwards he can tell Dumbledore to consider amputation.


** I'd like to see how that would work around the Unbreakable Vow Snape made. I'm assuming that in canon, if he didn't kill Dumbledore when Draco failed to, he would have died based on the rules set forth in his vow to Narcissa.

Maybe he could wilfully misinterpret that. I'm sure Voldemort dishes out multiple orders a day. Plus she never set a time limit. Either way, the wording is not iron clad, which I'm sure Rowling did intentionally, so it would seem like Snape could wriggle out of it.

** I think there was a fic where Snape just grabs Draco and runs away with him to protect him, although I can't seem to remember the name... I think it was not the main plot either...
