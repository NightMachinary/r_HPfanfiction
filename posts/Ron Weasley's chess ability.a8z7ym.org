Ron's chess game in Sorcerer's Stone is extremely underrated. When Dumbledore called the game “the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years”, I don't think that that was just him being kind. Ron, at twelve years old, beat the chess set transfigured by someone five times his age. His win is even more impressive when you considered the number of handicaps he played with.

McGonagall's set could only be defeated if it was checkmated. Retrospectively, Ron could've been beaten or failed in *five* different ways. If Ron gets taken prematurely (Harry and Hermione aren't good enough to win w/o him), if Ron got checkmated, if the match ended in a stalemate, if Hermione got injured (I doubt Harry and Ron could have figured out the logic riddle on their own), and if Harry got taken (Ron and Hermione don't have the protection of Lily's sacrifice to defeat Quirellmort).

I'm not sure how this Reddit feels about taking aspects from the movies that the books don't explain or contradict with as canon. In any case, in the chess scene, the board position and moves made are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZvGw-VRfo4][here]]. Ron actually has the chance to sacrifice Harry and win unscathed. However, he tells Harry and Hermione this.

#+begin_quote
  "Yes..." said Ron softly, "*It's the only way*... I've got to be taken."

  "NO” Harry and Hermione shouted.

  "That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!"

  "But --"

  "Do you want to stop Snape or not?"

  "Ron --"

  "Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!"

  There was no alternative.

  "Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go - now, don't hang around once you've won."
#+end_quote

And unlike in the movie, the trio /are/ the pieces and are not just playing with them. They watch stone pieces get destroyed on impact. It's pretty safe to assume that Ron thinks he's going to die or at the very least be severely injured. I'm sure that's why he told them not to stick around.

So JKR has Ron, with this completely incredible win and /six/ more books to hone and expand on his ability, and she does nothing with it. Harry is the doer and Hermione was the knower. It would have been cool to have Ron as the “know how to do-er”.

Now, I know that being good at chess does not equate to one being tactical or a strategist in real life. However, Ron is a fictional character. There is an entire [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess][TVtropes page]] on that very thing happening. It is not uncommon for chess to be used to demonstrate the tactical abilities of characters in such mediums. Charles Xavier/Magneto from X-men and Sherlock Holmes/Professor Moriarty from /Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows/ are examples of this.

Well, I guess that's why fanfiction exists.

What do you think of Ron's chess match in Sorcerer's Stone?

Would you have liked to see him as a more tactical person or a "know how to do-er" as I call it?


** If Ron's chess ability gets mentioned in a fic it's either in a disparaging way where people say that being good at chess means nothing when it comes to strategy or on the other hand his ability immediately qualifies him to be a strategic leader in the war. Either way it's often a poorly handled aspect of his character. Although that also seems to be the fate of Ron in general when it comes to fanfics.

I'd like to see Ron being developed from being good at chess to developing an interest in logic puzzles in general or becoming interested in historical battle tactics and war strategy in his later years. That seems like a natural progression for his character without encroaching to much on Hermione as the knowledge provider and Harry as the hands on guy.

** I'm not a Ron fan, but he definitely gets the short end of the stick a lot of the time. I always picture the Pure-Blood community being big on chess so I have this headcanon that at some point, Ron plays all the Slytherins and kicks everyone's asses and so they all respect (and/or resent) him after that.

** This has got to be one of the best HP posts I've read in a long, long time! And the video you included, analyzing Ron's moves in the movie, was brilliant.

I am not a big fan of Ron, but your post highlights what a disservice JKR has done to the character. Ron could easily have been the guy who strategized the break-in into the ministry/Gringotts. Instead we have what this sub frequently criticizes - an almost genius Hermione coming up with incredible plans at every stage. In fact, I don't think in canon, Ron ever comes up with any good idea while the trio are on the run - except probably at the very end, when he suggests the use of basilisk fangs, which, let's be honest, was merely a plot device to make Hermione to kiss him.

Like I said on this sub a few days ago, Ron (in both canon and fanfics) is basically the wizarding equivalent of the stereotypical hillbilly. Towards the end of the series, Ron was basically reduced to a glutton with a massive hate boner for Slytherins, who cracked some good jokes from time to time and frequently suffered from massive bouts of jealousy. That was it.

Absolutely agreed. I thought the Book 1 Ron had a lot of potential that could've been used and made him a very cool and useful asset.

I would love to read some fanfictions where Ron does something like that, and isn't just a mostly useless, tactless, and dumb kid who I would want to punch during certain scenes.

** It /is/ a shame that the chess victory just happened dramatically, earned points, and was then swept under the rug and ignored.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) never actually has that game, but expands on Ron's skill a bit more, without treating him as the next Napoleon. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) has an interesting take on it, too, though I don't believe it has any lasting plot implications.

** It could have been emphasized in subtle ways, like Ron arranging 'defenses' for the DA club, whether those being meant to confuse someone or being more physical, but nope, that is left up to Hermione and Harry. I might as well make a list.

First Year:

1. When he notices Snape chanting at Harry, he could also make note of Quirrel staring at Harry and tell Hermione to make sure that Snape breaks Quirrel's eye contact by standing up, or whatever. We were already expecting Quirrel by the end, so that wouldn't be that much more evidence against him.

Second Year:

1. He could have tried out /a/ tactic to get evidence, such as giving a camera to someone that might be late, or just setting up a camera, with cameras being shown to fail to take a picture of a Basilisk already, with Hermione finding out it was a Basilisk by chance again.

2. He could have messed up with deciding to get Gilderoy instead of Harry deciding to get Gilderoy.

Third Year:

1. Ron could have set up a few defenses against Sirius Black, or at least given the twins some direction if not literally everyone in Gryffindor in their year. This wouldn't interfere with the book's ending that much as well.

Fourth Year:

He was a bit of a punk during this year, and excluded from most of the events, so maybe not this year.

Fifth Year:

1. 'Defenses' like I mentioned earlier.
2. Ron could have tried to get Harry out of getting punished, at least once after Harry revealed the blood quill.

Sixth Year:

1. Ron could have organized people a bit against the Death Eater's invasion of Hogwarts, stepping up to lead even former DA Club members in that situation would probably grant him a lot of respect from the fandom, even if he failed.
2. He could have kept the DA Club running as well.

Seventh Year:

1. Ron could have organized the attempt to help the Muggleborns that were being Holocausted by Umbridge.
2. Ron could have organized students in the Battle of Hogwarts a bit more.

** I've seen this done well with in The Arithmancer by WhiteSquirrel. The story is Hermione focused and she and Ron don't end up together, but he's definitely not bashed and WhiteSquirrel absolutely puts him in situations where he's a competent, useful tactician. He also ends up taking Runes and it makes sense - I see rune clusters easily being like logic puzzles or geometric proofs, where everything only works if they're combined in a certain way, and therefore I can see Ron being good at it.

In general, I don't care much for canon Ron, but he's got potential, it's just completely untapped. His major flaws are laziness and jealousy, perfectly reasonable flaws for a well rounded character to begin with, but nothing ever happens that forces him to address those and so he never does. And considering the fact that he really does kind of come across as the jock who's kinda a bully if he thinks you're weird, if you look at it from the perspective of literally anyone outside of Harry, especially since I have a feeling a lot of fanfic writers were indeed bullied in school, it's easy to see why he gets super written off by a lot of people. I like a story where Ron grows the heck up and actually does reach his potential 'cause it's there, but until forced to confront and overcome his laziness and jealousy it'll never be there.

** I loved that chess scene with Ron, it showed that he was not just tagging along because he was nice and Harry needed a male friend. I agree with you that it's a pity Rowling did not really develop his character in that direction, throughout most of the books his positive traits seemed to have been reduced to being a nice person who could be very foolish and moody, culminating in him leaving Harry and Hemione in frustration on their hunt for the Horncruxes. I would even go as far as to say that his character and abilities never got to shine again after that incident, which makes it also seem very strange to me that Hemione should fall in love with him.

*** How was that a terrible move? From what I can tell, it was basically the only option since Ron's next move would be checkmate if white didn't get any protection onto row 3.

Hermione's rook owned the F column, the bishop held the diagonal, and moving the knight into place would have trapped the king. Preemptively defending against the knight gave white a few extra turns to at least try. If anything the mistakes were after QxC3, in which case white could have grabbed more pieces; but still ultimately would have lost, I think.

Not attacking, just generally curious as someone with a passing interest in chess.

No, after this move white can't try anything anymore. Everything after that move is automatic and leads to a loss (unless black is too stupid to keep checking when he can check). Unless I'm overlooking a way out for white after this. Can't see one.

I think Qf5 is the only move white can make that potentially keeps the game going (Qf5, Nh3+, Kf1, Rxf5, Nxf5, ...)? Maybe there's more that I'm not seeing... I'm bad at chess (but might have seen that Qxc5 is a losing move).

***** Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, I even tried putting this set up into the chess.com analysis board and it has white losing in every scenario. I agree that forfeiting at that point is most likely the correct option, but if you were wanting to drag it out to take out as many pieces as possible then keep playing, I guess; I've met a lot of people who do just this.

The only problem with moving Qxf5 is that the c5 is now open after the Rxc3 move. This allows for Bxc5, putting the king in check and moving Kxf1, resulting in the queen being taken by the Rxf5 move. From there it escalates into a series of trading pieces until white is screwed. No matter how you look at it, like you said white is screwed.

The original rook move to c5 by black is of course inspired and hard to find. I'd certainly overlook it, because it seems so obviously terrible and I wouldn't even continue analyzing the position.

I just think that a good player would have found a better move than Qxc3 in response which makes me doubt the abilities of white a bit. I mean, if you decide to continue playing as white the first thing you would consider is possible checks and think through those (and one of those 3 possible checks after Qxc3 is basically a checkmate -- with some pro-forma intermediate moves).

Right, it's not that multi layered though. Rc3 is an obvious trap, because why would black sacrifice their rook like that. White knows that their king is entirely stuck, so any kind of check is defcon 1 levels dangerous. So you just look for possible checks (which you would do anyways) that could happen after Qxc3 and pretty much immediately spot the checkmate.

Dangerous traps are those where you think black might actually think that they made a great move here. That's not the case with Rc3. Even if you can't recognize the repercussions, if you're smart you won't play Qxc3 because that's clearly what Black wants you to do for some reason.

In this game, it wasn't so much a trap as it was a delay tactic to protect Harry who was playing the bishop on a3 and give him an escape route that could lead to victory; he didn't HAVE to protect Harry like that.

At least, that's what others are saying. Now I'm wondering if he could have won more quickly by sacrificing the others like people say, or if that was just a happy coincidence of the setup. I'll have to look at it again when I'm more awake for sure.

The basic premise is to make a good, believable story while turning common tropes on their head. For example, my Dumbledore is actually a badass warrior (duel with Grindlewald) who is tired of death and war, and went a bit overboard to maintain peace between everyone, finally realizing at the end of Book 2 that he needs to teach Harry what it means to be a warrior, though reluctantly (McGonagall actually brings him to his senses).

Harry is neither a Lord or obscenely rich, Ron isn't a tactical genius or a blithering idiotic bigot, Hermione isn't the next coming of Stephen Hawking (just a very intelligent child with all the benefits AND flaws of that). Luna isn't hiding behind a mask, or a seer. etc etc... I don't want to give away too much.

Personally, Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters. I'd be interested in seeing how you handled him. Of course, everyone has their own opinion, but to me the most interesting part of Dumbledore is that he has all this power but doesn't use it to crush everyone in his way and allows for (or at least tries to) others to take up the leadership role at times. Preparing another to take up that role would be fantastic to see if handled well, for sure.

So basically you're turning them into realistic people? People who have talents in some areas but are not a prodigy? That sounds very refreshing lol

** Couple of things:

1. Ron couldn't have known Hermione would be needed later. Canon characters are not shown to be particularly genre-savvey. To a lesser extent also true with Harry.

2. Saving 2 additional pieces would be virtually impossible in chess, but only if your opponent knew you had to defend them. If your opponent doesn't, it is a bit more realistic they could be defended

3. You shouldn't assume the chess set is playing at McGonagall's level. Creating AI is usually harder/only has specific knoweldge, no reason to assume it is preforming at the same level.

4. Frankly, that skill set was dropped in canon. Ron as a tactition isn't really addressed again until book 6/7, and then only weakly. I would consider it a missed opportunity. JK could have made him horrible at playing quidditch but a budding coach/play caller, or other showcased of more tactical knoweldge, but she didn't. Or even just expanding the interest: Ron bonding with classmates over chess, Ron knowing a bit about muggle chessmasters, Rons strategic game interest evolving to handle other games more intense than exploding snap...

5. I think many in fanfic take the 'you protected the stone with traps 11 year olds could get around', ie, that it really wasn't all that impressive a feat at the end of book 1 (good for 11 year olds, but not like noone else could have done this)

Most fics ignore or do his chess skills poorly. One I thought did well was Red Knight...

I saw your other comment about the AI so I'll just answer both here. Mcgonagall in the trio's very first transfiguration lesson turns a desk into a pig and back into a desk. Wizards really just have to practice and imagine to make any form of artificial life. The pig is still just really a desk, but it acts like a pig would. That's why I find it so feasible that Mcgonagall could make a competent chess AI /at worst./ Especially when a year before the book's release, it had already been done at such a high level by IBM.

I honestly would have been fine if chess was really just a hobby to Ron's character. If he just sort of references it from time to time like Hermione and /Hogwarts: A History/, I couldn't complain. But to have him play the game he did at twelve, something should have come out of it.

I am not debating what Ron Weasley /is,/ but what I think he /could/ have been. He could have been strategical. And our introduction to that would have been him playing an excellent game of chess. Which is a popular game of strategy. Just like our introduction to Hermione being smart and clever is with the the logic puzzle or Harry being brave with Quirellmort.
