Harry is famous in the wizarding world. From the time he was at the dursleys until hogwarts, what happened to the inevitable fan mail? Looking for fics that explore this.


** Seen as minor plot devices in linkffn(three to backstep; harry potter and the irish choice). Actually, it's what sets off the entire chain of events in Irish Choice, but isn't really mentioned thereafter.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

*** Reading Three to Backstep now. Did they really just call Defense class "Dah-Dah?!" The idea of them spelling out how to pronounce the initialism instead of just putting "DADA" is just baffling to me, it totally brought me out. I'm going to keep reading, but Jesus, that's just /really/ weird.

**** Oh, ha, I just re-read it this weekend and I had forgotten I actually opened it in an editor and replaced that all the way through, it was so obnoxious.

I love being able to edit ebooks.

  "Eww!" Harry shuddered in response. "You know he's gay, right? That's a vision I didn't want. He might actually like the idea of being over a barrel."
#+end_quote

What the hell? God, this fic is /just/ good enough to ignore the bad parts, but Jesus what the fuck. Why homophobia in a /Harry Potter fanfiction/ of all things?

****** That was the only incident, I'm pretty sure. And I think it was supposed to be more about Dumbledore/old people than gay people.

****** You know there is nothing homophobic in that sentence right?? Not wanting to see and old man being fucked in the ass is in fact something normal even among gay men.. probably. Still, nothing hateful in there, he simply doesn't want that image in his head.

** it was publicly known that harry lived with muggles, so its safe to assume that dumbledore let anyone know that they used masking spellst that stopped letters from reaching harry.

and a good series that has harry questioning what happend to his letter is the perfectly normal series. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]] this has harry spend time figiuring out why only certain people can send him letters and what happens after he solves the problem. its a minor plot point but the fic also has harry also answer many letters from fans and explains how sending owls works. a couple of the letters you get to read also have hidden messages or meanings that harry is to young to understand(but are good forshadowing for the reader)
