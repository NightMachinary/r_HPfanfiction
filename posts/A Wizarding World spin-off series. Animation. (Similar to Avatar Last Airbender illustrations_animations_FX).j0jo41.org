The new original series surrounds the talented witch Werna Waterwell as she begins her first term as Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She also teaches Divination, and excels in Charms and Transfiguration.

SEASON 01 Hogwarts welcomes a vibrant, quirky new Headmistress to the school and while the Ministry keeps a tight eye on her teachings, the students find themselves taking advantage of the new professor's kindness.

SEASON 02 Professor Werna Waterwell begins her second year as Headmistress of Hogwarts and the school faces an unprecedented challenge after a group of giants demand to take the castle for themselves.

SEASON 03 To prevent future attacks on the school caused by the giants, new enchantments are established to intensify its defense and a skillful and mysterious Defense Against the Dark Arts professor begins teaching at the school.

SEASON 04 While new and old students alike arrive for another year at Hogwarts, ghosts inside the castle halls begin to disappear and a vision seen by Waterwell shows her a powerful jinx has been cast upon the Forbidden Forest. Hogwarts may never be the same!

SEASON 05 Immediately following the events of season 4, Waterwell and the students of Hogwarts receive unwanted attention from the Daily Prophet and the Headmaster of Ilvermorny, the American School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, arrives at Hogwarts with changes at hand.

SEASON 06 A quiet, intelligent professor begins teaching Muggle Studies and her interest in the convergence of Muggle and Wizarding worlds bring Hogwarts into a peril that changes the fate of both worlds forever.
