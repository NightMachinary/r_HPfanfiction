** A lot depends on what the story is about. The catch-all is [[http://www.fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], which is by far the most read. I recommend posting there and possibly some other site, depending on the story:

A lot of people try to get onto [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/][Mugglenet]], though they have strict quality control and submission requirements. If your writing tends toward Harry/Ginny pairings without bashing either character, then [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][phoenixsong.net]] or [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] would be worth consideration. If your writing tends toward Harry/Hermione pairings, then [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][portkey.org]]. If you write darker, edgier, non-slash stories (including NC-17 work not suitable for fanfiction.net), then [[http://patronuscharm.net/][patronuscharm.net]] (DLP's story site). If you're writing a crossover with the Buffy 'Verse, [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/][TTH]]. If you're writing a crossover with the Dresden Files 'Verse, then the fanfiction section of [[http://www.jimbutcheronline.com/bb/][Jim Butcher's site]].

Some sites such as [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors.net]] are invite-only and virtually impossible to join (I only have one story up on ffa myself, posted in jbern's section), though if you get an invite, go for it.

** Don't limit yourself to one site. Post in everywhere that you can, keep your username consistent between them.

fanfiction.net is a good place to start. It's only major problem is that you can't have sexual content in your story.

ficwad and [[http://www.adultfanfiction.net/]] are the only other sites not specific to a particular "ship" that I know. (they have awful search functionality)

If you have a prominent relationship between major characters in your story, there are probably sites dedicated to that "ship" that will host your stories.

**** for citation, take a look at ToS of the website.

There are lot of stories on there, so it's enforced sporadically - basically if your story has sexual content in it, and enough prudes take the time to complain (as in message moderators) than it's gone. There is also some leeway depending on the moderator - mature rating allows for sexual theme, but not for explicit sexual content. So depending on how a given mod defines "explicit"...

It's a rather annoying aspect of the site, especially when the mods come down on abandoned stories/accounts where the author isn't around to upload the story to a different site - then a piece of fiction just dies.

**** There was a James/Lily story that had a good plot--I had to know what would happen, so I read the whole thing--but there were SO many sexual scenes.

** I used to read and write on fanfiction.net it's a great website because there are a lot of stories and the comments are usually quite generous. The less great part of this website is that the searchcriteria are very vague. That's why I now use archiveofourown.org

The searchcriteria is just much broader and better. Some examples.

-You can pull up all the stories from a specific week/month/year or anything that's published within any amount of time.

-You can specify complete/incomplete

-You can request single-chapter stories

-Obviously you can chose any amount of words you need the story to be (at least 1000, less than 5000, between 10000 and 50000 etc)

-Rating includes explicite for the more 'adult' stories.

-You can chose warnings such as Violence/Major Character Death/Rape/Non-Con or Underage.

-You can specify if you're looking for F/M, F/F, M/M etc

-You can search for as much characters as you want (vs the limit of two in Fanfiction.net)

-You can also look for pairings, this includes triangles (Hermione/Harry, Hermione/Harry/Ron etc)

-You can search for additional tags. (Alternate universe, genderswap, PWP, First kiss, first time, anal etc whatever specific thing you're looking for) AND MUCH MORE!!!

If you're looking for a specific story (such as a particular love triangle, a specific au, a genderswap, a certain kind of sexthing or whatever)

The reviews are much fewer than fanfiction.net but because of the tags readers know wether the storie is up their ally or not. So the people who do read are much more likely to enjoy it much more.

Edit: As my internet is pretty flaky. A great feature of this website is also that after you chose a story you can chose 'entire work' this shows all the chapters on one page. It's clearly indicated when a new chapter starts but you don't have to click to open a new one. So if you're internet acts up you can just continue reading cause you don't have to click for the next chapter.

**** Absolutely! The HP community needs to know this. It makes browsing so much more pleasant. Only thing FF's got that AO3 doesn't is the world option (as in next gen, marauders, founders, hogwarts etc)

Edit: Though I've just noticed you can now add up to 4 characters in FF.net (though you can still only select two if you're looking for a story)

***** The tagging system so much smoother, so when I'm looking for specific fics, I can. The only issue was how long it took to get an account lol.
