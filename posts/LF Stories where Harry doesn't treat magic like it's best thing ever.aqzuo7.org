I'm looking for stories where Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts but doesn't treat magic like it's the best thing since sliced bread, in the sense that, even if he likes it and studies it, it doesn't become an all-consuming focus to the detriment of his mundane studies.

Would prefer stories that begin before for during the first year at Hogwarts, but anything that gives background will suffice.


** Isn't that canon? Throughout the Books, he shows remarkable lack of interest in learning beyond what's required. He only works hard if his own life is threatened, and even then, he still doesn't have much enthusiasm in learning magic.

If you want a fic with such Harry, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]], linkffn(6466185).

*** Maybe I should have clarified. I'm looking for a version of Harry where he keeps up with his mundane studies, so English, Math, Science, mundane history, art, etc.

Unless he's a genius and an autodidact, he's going to run into a wall when he attempts to learn calculus on his own.

***** Calculus text books from the public library during the summer?

Calculus isn't even that hard. The top high schools in Beijing offer to teach calculus to students in any grade.

****** I know calculus isn't hard, it certainly isn't for me. But a lot of students do have trouble with it when they're first introduced to it.

******* I don't know, man, my father introduced me to the idea of calculus when I was in seventh grade, and by ninth grade, I was teaching myself calculus out of a college textbook, yet I'm only over average intelligence, and I'm not particularly good at math, just hard working and willing to put my head down grind out the work.

I mean, I'm not asking Harry to learn calculus as a 9th grader, but it's not inconceivable for him to teach himself algebra and the like and get to at least a high school level in math and science on his own because he cares about what the mundane world considers areas of studies. It'd fight right in with a Ravenclaw Harry, for example.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** linkao3(12424344) - grey space by noaacat is set in an au-canon divergence where magical children don't attend Hogwarts until 14. this fic only covers Harry's life pre-fourteen but he certainly isn't grateful for magic. It's one of my all time favourite works. Very heavy on the angst and there are no main pairings.

Edit: another good one linkao3(15780843) still updating

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
