Looking for a fic where a character from canon attends Beauxbatons for some reason or another. Preferably not because of Voldemort. I guess I'm looking for a fic where Beauxbatons is explored, perhaps there's a romance. OCs allowed, but I'd prefer some canon characters thrown in. Not looking for anything dark tbh or a bunch of wild magic thrown in about how everyone is a Veela so they can all read minds and curse people out of their eyes. Thanks!


** linkffn(10070079) Hermione goes to Beauxbatons in year 4 (?) because her parents are afraid that something will happen to her in Hogwarts (not entirely unreasonable)

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.

** I've been writing a story where Harry goes to Beauxbatons because of the "threat" Sirius Black poses during Harry's third year. It's only two chapters so far but I'm pretty excited for its future.
