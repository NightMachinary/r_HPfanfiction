When Riddle attacked Potters on that fateful night, he lost his body, but still wasn't dead.

How many other options of doing the same exist besides Horcruxes, if Dumbledore wasn't able to check everyone of them?

At the same time the Books lists just two ways for immortality: Philosopher's Stone and Horcrux.


** Horcruxes, despite fanon where everyone and their mother is apparently aware of them, are rare, arcane, and horribly forbidden. Whether Dumbledore was even aware of them in '81 is unknown.

Further, it's entirely possible that he /did/ know prior to the Diary's discovery in '93, but had no actual proof of it.

*** If Slughorn, a Potions teacher and talented but not world-class Wizard who is more interested in social climbing than research, knows enough about Horcruxes to answer Tom Riddle's questions, then I find it extremely hard to believe that Albus Dumbledore, an older, more talented, more academic and educated Wizard with a semi-Dark backstory and a successful victory against the last Dark Lord, is unaware of them or how they work.

Either they're dark and not too well known, but a talented older Wizard or someone with an interest in Dark Magic like Snape or Riddle would be aware of them to some extent, in which case Dumbledore should have had a far more cogent plan for them when he got proof in CoS, or they're super dark and super secret, in which case Riddle finding out about them in school is weird and his Potions teacher knowing what they are, let alone any detail on them, is utterly nonsensical.

#+begin_quote
  "But all the same, Tom. . . keep it quiet, what I've told--that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. . . "
#+end_quote

Later:

#+begin_quote
  "You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information..."
#+end_quote

As for why Dumbledore didn't figure it out, as op said, he may have guessed but had no proof. He planned for Voldemort's return a decade and a half in advance. I doubt he didn't explore the how and why that could happen. And contrary to popular belief, Dumbledore was outsmarted a few times.

#+end_quote

Two ways of immortality that we know about. Dumbledore might know more, and Voldemort is likely to know things about fouler magic that Dumbledore can't even suspect.

Dumbledore knew about the prophesy 'Will mark him as his equal'. And in the prologue we see him tell McGonagall that scars can be useful. He didn't know then, at least in my imagining, that it was a Horcrux. Whatever suspicions he had or developed were only that. Until Harry talked to a snake. Then delivered the remains of the diary horcrux to him. After which Dumbledore began hunting rumor and memory. That Voldemort made a horcurx is true, not a theory. And he's made multiple, enough that he intended one of his safeguards to life as a weapon.

** Dumbledore /did/ suspect Voldemort had made a Horcrux before that point. He just didn't have any evidence to prove it until the diary:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received what I considered *certain proof* that Voldemort had split his soul.” (HBP, Chapter 23, emphasis mine)

However, it wasn't until the diary that Dumbledore began to believe that Voldemort had made multiple Horcruxes:

#+begin_quote
  “The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made --- or been planning to make --- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense." (HBP, Chapter 23)

** u/4ecks:
#+begin_quote
  Why didn't Dumbledore figure out about Horcruxes before Harry's 2nd year?
#+end_quote

Because the plot didn't need him to.

That's basically the long-story-short of why Dumbledore seems to sit on his ass and twiddle his thumbs for years at a time, while our heroes go forth to fight evil without him. It's a symptom of JKR's questionable math and worldbuilding outside of the little bubble she creates around her protagonists. If you try to rationalize things with in-story explanations, all you get is either a Manipulative Dumbledore who knew everything and did nothing, or an Incompetent Dumbledore, who was clever enough to figure everything out but didn't, because reasons.

You might as well ask what Dumbledore had been doing between Voldemort's job interview (~1957), where he called Tom out for running an evil street gang of magical thugs, and he /knew/ Tom was a bad egg, and Voldemort's rise in the First War in the mid 1970's.

Or what Dumbledore had been doing between the time Grindelwald left him in 1900 to "Change the World", and Grindelwald murdering muggles, Aurors, and taking over governments in his rise to power. In Crimes of Grindelwald, the Aurors approach Dumbles begging for help against Grindy in 1927, but according to JKR's timeline, Dumbledore doesn't actually confront Grindy in person until 1945.

You'd think he'd have learned once that Dark Lords have to be nipped in the bud, instead of waiting for them to achieve their full forms.

** This opens the door to a wider question: What did Dumbledore DO in the 11 years between Voldemort's defeat and Harry starting school?

Prepare the chosen one for his inevitable showdown? No.

Cut away at the Dark Lord's power base in the Ministry and Wizengamot so he wouldn't rise again with power? No.

Research and figure out if/how Voldemort survived and a way to counter it? Seemingly no.

Pass laws and push for reforms that would make a 2nd War less attractive to people? No.

Improve Hogwarts' education practically or socially to reduce future Death Eater numbers and give people a way to protect themselves? Hahaha no.

Come up with a plan that can be implemented if and when Voldemort returns, so as to not be blindsided? No.

Dumbledore is a plot device, not a character. He does and knows what he needs to to make plot events happen, regardless of any other factors like logic.

Canonically, he spends 11 years knowing Voldemort will return and knowing Harry is the only option to defeat him, and aside from putting Harry with the Dursleys to keep him safe (the success/failure of that choice notwithstanding) he does....nothing. Or at least, nothing that any other character mentions or that leaves any noticeable impact on the story.

Then, once he DOES learn about the Horcruxes, he spends 3+ years doing...nothing again. He doesn't mention them, go and find one, or do anything that suggests he's working on it, until HBP, at which time he locates one and immediately dies to it, leaving Harry with just enough information to muddle through. Either it took him 4 years to figure out about the Locket, Ring and maybe a founder's item or two, and he immediately died upon finding a horcrux, or he didn't start looking till GoF at the earliest and found the horcruxes fairly fast before immediately dying.

For christ's sake, either way, he leaves Slughorn with a war-critical memory for years before bothering to try and get it, and then leaves the job to Harry.

Neither option makes him look like the immensely wise and powerful wizard we're told he is.

You can write an in-universe explanation for it quite easily:

Dumbledore was looking from CoS, but it was much harder than it appears to gather the info he did, and he was busy with other things. He wanted Slughorn's memory but would have had to hurt him to get it as Slughorn is an Occlumens of Snape tier. Although Dumbledore barely had any information after 4 years, and Harry figured out just as much info in a few months by sheer luck, Dumbledore nonetheless was operating at peak efficiency in his information gathering efforts given the restrictions.

But JK doesn't bother, she just leaves it as a blank question and hopes you'll fill it with something that matches her priorities.
