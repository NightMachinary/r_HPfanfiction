Title I need it for a story I plan to write. What are your thoughts?


** So, when they say in the books that drinking unicorn blood leads to a cursed half life, I don't think it means that your lifespan is going to be half of what it is other wise. Rather, I think that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S6TTHB7Gxo&feature=youtu.be&t=20s][Captain Barbossa describes it best]].

*** That's a good way to put it. I had an idea that it wasn't his mother's protection that saved Harry from Quirrel, but the Unicorn's Curse. Quirrel would be unable to touch anything pure of heart.

** I like the ambiance of the answer from [[/u/yarglethatbargle][u/yarglethatbargle]]. For my own part, I assumed that Quirrel was the one living a half-life, as it was his body that needed restoring while carrying Voldemort's soul along with his own. Canon suggests that long-term possession/occupancy had burned out all the small animals near Riddle's hiding place in Albania, so Quirrel may have needed extraordinary restoration to keep together.

This also plays into the burning effect Harry's touch had on him at the end. His protection against Voldemort's soul was destroying the battlefield a.k.a. Quirrel's body.

** My guess is that it will heal you in the short term but it is toxic in the long term. Like it will heal your wounds but give you cancer or something like that, though probably more of a magical ailment than something so mundane.

  Hermione isn't just a bookworm. Harry isn't just a scarhead. Ron isn't just a red headed troublemaker. Malfoy isn't just a dirty death-eater spawn. Wait, Malfoy? What happens when Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger are partnered up in an Unspeakable mission that could get one or both of them killed. Do Harry and Ron help? Or just hope that Malfoy is the one who ends up dead?

** Oh, I just thought of an interesting aspect of drinking unicorn blood. When I was doing a bit of reading up on the Patronus Charm for my own story, the HP Wiki indicated that only the pure of heart could cast a patronus and that if someone who didn't meet the requirements tried, bad things would happen.

So! A character is in a situation where they are desperate enough to kill one of the purest beings on the planet and drink its blood. Afterwards, they feel fine. They feel great, in fact. All that stuff about the consumption of unicorn blood cursing a person is hogwash! Oh, better send Mum a patronus with a message that I'm bringing a salad to dinner on Sunday. What the hell? I can't cast ...

OMG, what if that character is an Auror and needs to be able to cast a corporeal Patronus in a professional capacity? And he or she has to keep the fact that they've drunk unicorn blood and now they can no longer cast a Patronus a secret? And they go into a spiral of addiction and lies and deception and ... and ...

Also! What if! Phoenix tears could dispel the curse caused by the drinking of the blood? But what phoenix would shed tears for such a person? Unless the person really had NO CHOICE but to drink the blood, either by coercion or a really terrible circumstance (disease, curse, really awful MIL).

Yes ... very interesting ...

**** That's true! Hmm ... here is what I'd read on it:

Enraged, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself, and tried to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent, but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell. Maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his entire body.

Apparently this guy is mentioned on Pottermore, so this information is likely not canon. Cool idea tho.
