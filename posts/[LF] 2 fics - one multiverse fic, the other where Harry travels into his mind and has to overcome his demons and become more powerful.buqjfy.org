:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
+1) In this postwar fic, Canon!Harry is given a pendulum or pendant, and he travels to alternate universes where various things have happened and meets his alternative selves. There are at least eight different scenarios. Some of the fic is Snarry, some Harrymort and some gen.+

+It's not on Ao3 or FFN, it's on another site with he author's own fic. The author has also written an interactive HP fic.+ - Harry Potter and the Pendulum of Choice by Ruslight. With thanks to heresy23

+2) In the second fic, Harry has to go inside his own head/mind, where he meets aspects of himself - Innocence, which is very small, like an eight-year-old version of himself, then Wrath, which is large, Courage, which is massive because he relies on it so much, and Cunning/Intelligence/Wisdom.+ The Well-Organised Mind by FalconLux, thanks to FutureDetective

Thanks in advance.

#+begin_quote
  Trying to deal with his grief after losing Sirius, Harry makes an effort to ‚Äúclear his mind‚Äù before going to bed. It works this time, and Harry discovers that his supposed Power isn't love at all. He soon finds that his trust has not always been well placed. His choices for taking control of his life may be fewer than he'd hoped.WARNING: This is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be completed. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
