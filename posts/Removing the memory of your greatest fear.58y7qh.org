I had just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image]] and being a big fan of doctor who I realised that a weeping angel would be my boggart as well.

Which brings me to the question, what would a boggart become if the memory of your greatest fear was obliviated


** When Harry gets near Dementors he "remembers" his mothers death. But that memory should have been subject to infantile amnesia - he has for all intents and purposes been obliviated of that memory. Yet the dementor still makes him recall it because it is his worst experience.

So it seems to me that you could obliviate a traumatic event and a dementor would still make you relive it when its nearby.

As for boggarts... I'm not sure. Dementors could be special here since they seem to attack the /soul/ and not the /mind/, and the soul doesn't forget. So do boggarts look into your mind for your greatest fear or into your soul?

*** I think there's a difference between forgetting something and having the memory removed, magically speaking.

** Whatever you think is most scary. I mean, in PoA the boggart turns into pretty ordinary things, mostly monsters.

I don't think that the boggart in canon doesn't turn in what it's actually your greatest fear, but what you think it is. For example, there's a ton of things more scary than giant snakes and spiders like all like all of your family dying, being subjected to never-ending torture etc., but most people don't actually think of what is truly the most terrifying thing for them.

** Your second greatest fear... it's not rocket science. 2 fears, first fear is gone. 2-1 = 1. 1 = second fear, now FIRST fear.

Also, if I saw a weeping angel I would fucking bolt. Screw 'Ridiuklus' I ain't staying near that shit!
