Also, I specifically remember one between Ginny and Harry that occurred after the CoS stuff, and it was physically painful for both of them. If anyone remembers that fic, I'd appreciate it!


** Right H/G soulbond was my intro into fanfiction. In addition to the Bonds of time series:

linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs) might be the one you think about. It gets painful, especially towards the end, Post-CoS.

linkffn(The meaning of one by sovran) is a quality H/G soulbond. Starts a bit weird in PS, but the second part is written well.

I also remember linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond by Council) positively. It has a more realistic portrayal of what it would be like to hear each other's thoughts and the attached problems.

I also think I liked linkffn(It's OK Not To Be OK (But I Promise, I'm Trying) by rayrae118), but I don't remember the actual plot from the top of my head.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
