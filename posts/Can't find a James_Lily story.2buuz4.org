I'll admit I read it years and years ago, I think at that time I was only reading on HPFF, but it could be on FF.net too.

The only thing that sticks out it memory is that one of Lily's friends gets pregnant in school, but it turns out that it's some dark curse that's growing inside her and there's a lot of drama surrounding the whole thing.

Good luck.
