hi, i literally just made a reddit so i could ask for help on finding a specific fanfic! lately i've been listening to a podcast about fanfic, and it made remember a fic i used to read on freaking quizilla of all places! it was called the necromancer, and the main character was an original character that was either a year or two below harry & was ostracized by pretty much everyone at hogwarts for being a necromancer. it was SO GOOD and i want to revisit it, but obviously can't find it because quizilla is gone. can anyone help me??
