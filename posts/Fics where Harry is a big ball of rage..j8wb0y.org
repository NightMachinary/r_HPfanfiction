Really in a pissy mood, reading about Harry tearing someone a new one would be really cathartic.

** The classic example is linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven), it's even in the name. It's also awful, but that kind of comes with the territory; extremely angry Harrys generally make for poor writing. The angriest Harry I can think of off the top of my head that still has a decent story is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia).

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** The best ones I can think of are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12110685/chapters/27461091][All Impulse and No Control]], where Harry loses his filter and becomes a ranting, angry, nuisance. It is HPDM, but nothing happens till like the end and it's easily ignored. The other is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11588556/1/Ignition][Ignition]], where Harry has fire powers and a temper. Sadly it was abandoned before it could go anywhere, but what's there is pretty good I think.

** If you don't mind a little crack sprinkled into your fanfiction, I'm writing one right now where Harry is constantly angry, exploding at people and getting vengeance for the fate he was damned to:
