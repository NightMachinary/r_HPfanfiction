Basically I am looking for a story that tells most/all of Snapes life, one that follows canon. The prince's tale was one of my favorite chapters and i would love if someone has expanded on it in great detail.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
