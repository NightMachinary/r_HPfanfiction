I used to read Merlin fics waaay back in my og fic reading years and have recently got back into HP fics.

What are the best crossover stories? I am both too afraid and too lazy to try and find it myself. Its been a while since I went near Merlin side of ffnet...

Ideally not Merther if possible but other slash/pairings are fine provided they are well written and serve the story well.

Thank you

  AR. Merlin has changed Camelot forever but while that part of his life is complete, destiny has a new task for him. Now he has to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, hide the fact that he's the Merlin, and defeat a Dark Lord that's messing with magic he knows nothing about.

  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.
