So, it occurred to me at some point that a Night Fury (The main character's dragon the the httyd films) is described as the 'unholy offspring of lightning and death', and it then occurred to me that in loose terms, Harry could also be described as thus. This led me to wanting to possibly write some sort of crossover between the series, though exactly how I want to go about this is fuzzy at best currently.

So I thought I'd survey the community and see what sort of ideas people might have for such a crossover, any neat ideas on how to work it, or potential tie-ins I may be overlooking.

I know that the obvious idea would be making Harry a Night Fury animagius or some such, and while that's a cool idea, it's not exactly thrilling or new. Dragon animagius is an unfortunately popular trope and if there's a better work in I'd love to find it. Having Harry find and train/ride/etc. a Night Fury is also an option, but it would also be semi-cliche.

Does anyone have any ideas for a HTTYD x HP crossover? Thoughts? Suggestions? I would love to have some input since I'm keen to do SOMETHING with this, since the connection seems like it could have potential to be something neat if applied correctly.


** Time travel into the past, fuse Burk with some Scandinavian island? Or something, I don't really know much about nordic culture.

Use the oldie but goodie Veil of Death multiverse travel. Arrives in the Green Death's lair a few years after it is killed. The lair would be an old ritual site used by Burk Mystics, before it got taken over by the Green Death. But seriously, Harry and grandma Elder having tea together would be awesome.

Also, "the unholy offspring of lightning and death" being applied to Harry? I like the way you think.

*** I'd been giving the veil a hard look for this true, so I might look at it and see what i can do with it that isn't already cliche'd to death. Harry interacting with the elder sounds hysterical and i hadn't even considered the possibility oh man.

And yep. it's been rattling in my head for a while now; it doesn't help that harry shares a color scheme with night Fury's either, being green and back.

**** Yup, the Veil is a tried and true transdimensional trope (tralliteration!) . It's just so useful, and is part of what makes crossovers so easy to facilitate. MoD!Harry + Veil = whatever the hell you want. Don't worry about cliches concerning the Veil, it's just a vehicle to get you to where you need to go. It's an excuse, and as long as you don't get too stupid with it nobody will care that it's an excuse. But of course, if you want to do more with it then by all means. I just don't have any ideas in that specific direction.

But yeah, there's all sorts of fun stuff you can do with a HTTYD crossover. Harry chatting with the elder. Harry finding an old grizzled veteran nightfury that's searching for unhatched or baby furies - this could easily turn into a mentor/student situation for him and Hiccup. Harry gets stranded on an island and starts terraforming it to his own needs, and when Hiccup and co pass by they get a nice big WTF from this strange island. Harry gets picked up by trader/fisher/some other clan and goes on adventures. Harry gets worshiped as a god/high priest - Have him meet Valka and suddenly WOAH SHIT TWO DRAGON PRIESTS! They could work together or be opposing forces. You /could/ make him a NightFury animagus if you have any fresh ideas in that area, but I haven't really thought about it.

Fun. Stuff.

** Perhaps have Harry resurrected as Hiccup? Instead of being obsessed with technology and inventions, he's obsessed with magic.

There's tons of dragon bits out and about, so making a wand shouldn't be impossible. Perhaps the HTTYD dragons make for weaker wands and that his desire to shoot down the Night Fury is to get some more potent dragon parts?
