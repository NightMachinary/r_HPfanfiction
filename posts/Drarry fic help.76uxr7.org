***** There's this counciler lady he has to talk too for probation not a mind healer i dont think. she tells him to do muggle things.

I dont remember how or why draco ends up in a dentist office watching a movie and is peeved that the nurse keeps calling other peoples names during.

And then somehow him and harry meet? Harry invites him to friends quiddach game and draco makes these animated patches that are magicly animated-it went in to alot of detail about the stitching idk harry praises him for it and they talk about the potter stinks buttons as well.

They play the game cant remember who won. They go to the pub afterwords and the fic ends with draco admitting he is deeply in love with potter.

You are right it doesnt narrow it down much at all xc. Its been over a year since i read it ive gone through my ao3 history back a whole year. Im thinking it might have been deleted :/
