In canon, we're /told/ that he didn't know its true value and just thought the Gaunt Ring was a nice family trinket. However, are we really sure of that? If I recall correctly, it's just Dumbledore's assumption, and it's never confirmed. I like to think he /did/ know (though perhaps he only found out /after/ he made the ring into a Horcrux --- by the way, technically, was the Horcrux the band, the stone, or the whole thing?), but, having no loved ones, didn't have anyone to call back and thus didn't even try it. This is interesting because it explains his claim to Harry in /Philosopher's Stone/ that "together, [they] could bring [James and Lily] back". Though, as another way for him to be telling the truth, you could also argue that Voldy simply buys into the "the Peverell brothers were gifted wizards who /built/ the Hallows" theory, and thus thinks himself skilled enough to replicate the Resurrection Stone if he set his mind to it.


** Personally, I think Voldemort was lying through his teeth. He didn't have any way of bringing James and Lily back, but neither did he have any intentions of letting Harry join him. He was just talking out of his non-existent ear, making promises he did not intend to keep, just to get Harry to give him the Philosopher's Stone. And then he could kill him afterwards.

*** It's possible, of course. But surely the thought of making his supposed downfall into a loyal minion would have been a sweet one? And on some level, "I am a living god" Voldy must have thought himself capable of bringing the dead back to life if he tried --- he just never had any incentive to so he never tried and found out how wrong he was.

*** Why is it so impossible for him to bring them back? In a world where Prior Incantato from brother wands can bring back a spirit, where the resurrection stone does it on its own, why can't people be brought back from the dead?

I can see how that idea wouldn't appeal to voldemort as a method of immortality as it would rely on a third party to help him once he is gone.

I could see it being within his power to bring them back, but I can also see that power, or even knowledge of it being possible considered a very dark art.

**** Impossible, perhaps not -- though in both cases it was only the spirits that were brought back, and only very temporarily.

Voldemort's intent, definitely not. He'd promise anything to Harry, but I don't think he had any intention of keeping it.

** I think ring was also horcrux because it was cracked through middle.

*** Heh. Could be a case of Dumbledore's "bash the ring with a sword" method not being very subtle. I mean, if he cleaved the whole damn ring in two, it could have cracked both the band and stone even if he only meant to destroy one of the two.

**** Well it can bring people from dead, i would reckon that it is more resistant.

** Maybe he tried to use it, but didn't have any loved ones so he thought it didn't work.

*** I don't know --- the books are unclear on whether the stone just works on your loved ones, or if it can call back anybody but most people just /use/ it on their loved ones because that's who most people want to bring back. I remember stories where Harry uses it to call back Cadmus Peverell himself, for instance, thereby getting more info on the other Hallows.

** No. He didn't know. It's in the book, assumption or not.

*** Could we have a quote? As I said, it doesn't count if it's just Dumbledore assuming Voldemort didn't know. He's not always 100-percent right.
