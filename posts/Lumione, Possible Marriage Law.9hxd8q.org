So I don't remember this fic at all but was going through some inspo documents from an old hard drive and this paragraph was there with no title or author, of course. Maybe marriage law, maybe not, obviously it starts during/near the end of her 7th year after the war. That's all I've got!

"Hermione had read about graduation and talked to other students that had graduated and apparently everyone got something different when they left the school. Bill opened his envelope and was doused in magic that made it possible for him to read ancient runes whenever he saw them, Charlie got the address of a dragon keeper that he would apprentice under, Percy got the name of the ministry official he would shadow for the summer. As Harry and Ron didn't finish proper schooling but were allowed to graduate anyway Harry had received the name of the Aura he would be working with and Ron got the name of the Quidditch team he would work with. Hermione was nervous what hers would say: Wife, Lucius Malfoy. That would be all she did with her life."

** Any ideas on what this fic could be? Gone through a ton and none fit the bill!
