** That's the Indy!Harry route which only few fanfiction writers get right. Will Harry become an independent dark wizard faction (against both Dumbledore and Voldemort)? Someone more Grindelwaldian, maybe even breaking out ol' man Gellert to have an ally against Dumbledore and Voldemort? A pro-Muggle-born and/or pro-creature radical?

**** Harry staying in Bill's room and finding a book on curse breaking and getting really interested in it could be a good lead up to it too. Or he's talking about the films with Hermione and Ron mentions it's "so he's basically a muggle curse breaker?"

It's actually be a really good chance to show more of the magical world as well as actually make runes useful for what he does in a non magic way, reading warnings and such. It'd be a really fun read I think.

  uses Runes for everything magical in life (despite Runes being just a dead language)
#+end_quote

Honestly, I agree with most of what you said, but when people complain about this it just grinds my gears.

YES! Runes in canon are just a language but, honestly, fuck that! We already have one of the most plot dependant, lazyass magical system ever, let us place some limits and logic in it for fuck's sake!

I honestly don't understand people that complain endlessly about Runes being used in a more D&D capacity as a magical language and binding method, it just fits the many, many others more consistent and expansive magical systems in fiction and allows authors to make HP magic deeper and less wishy-washy 'whatever, it's a children's book'.

'AriThmAnCy iS jUsT dIviNatioN' Yes! We know, fuck that too! How are spells made in canon? Does everyone in the world speak Latin spells? Even the people whose language /predates/ Latin by thousands of years(China, Japan, Africa, Greece, German, Anglo Saxons)?

Using magical math to create and modify spells makes more sense than someone reading a spell created by a guy and casting it perfectly despite not having the faintest idea of what it did? What did Snape just list the Somatic component in a universal, all reaching Master Spell List? What if a guy in Italy also made a spell whose incantation is Sectumsempra, which one would work? How is that done?

At least math is universal.

I agree overused tropes and bad writing are bad and make for bad stories, but don't couple that with expanding the magical systems and adding more things to it to enrich the story.

*** Agree with most what you point out, but...

#+begin_quote
  shows them that backwater wizarding Britain is centuries behind the rest of the magical world
#+end_quote

There is nearly no other way history can evolve from what happened in canon. An awful lot of people have died on both sides - and a fair lot of the old purebloods on the Dark side who managed to survive /hopefully/ ended in Azkaban. That means that suddenly the muggle-born and half-blood magical people have more political leverage and can actually push for sweeping changes in society.

Besides - that the Wizarding world was massively behind Muggle society was glaring all over the seven books. Up until maybe ~1950 I'd say that Wizard and Muggle societies were relatively similar - patriarchal in structure, nowhere near as democratic as modern Muggle societies are, technologically newspapers and radio being the dominant form of mass communication, with the Wizarding society even being at the advantage (Floo network, Apparition, two-way mirrors, animated photos). But since then, Muggle society improved so massively - women got full equality, democracy spread throughout Europe while nobilities got the finger, TVs, computers and phones became a thing - that one has to be blind to ignore just how stuck in the past Wizard societies are.
