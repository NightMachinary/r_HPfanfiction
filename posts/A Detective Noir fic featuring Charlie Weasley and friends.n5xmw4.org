I wanted to recommend this great fic called Vanishing Act that I came across last weekend. It's a detective noir type story that features Charlie Weasley, Tonks, and others in their age group as most of the main characters. You do get occasional peaks at older characters, like Arthur, Molly, Moody, and Dumbledore, as well as younger characters like Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The fic spends a lot of time focused on the end of the first war and the time in between that and Voldemort's return, usually based on the perspective of Charlie and his friends . However, it's not your typical "7 years of Hogwarts" fic trope like you might see for the Marauders.

Since Charlie's year group features prominently, there are quite a few OCs, but they're well written. The fic has great worldbuilding as well, and the plot is intriguing. I said above that it's a detective noir type story - it centers on people attacking muggleborns, but it's not like the Quidditch World Cup from Goblet of Fire on repeat. It's a lot more sinister than that, and there's enough twists and turns to surprise more often than usual.

Ao3 says that it's currently at 150 chapters and 250K+ words, so there's plenty to read to catch up. Last update was today so no worries about it being abandoned. Like I said, it's a great fic, centering on a relatively seldom used character set. Highly recommend it.

** Holy shit! I was just scrolling and had to do a double take ha. Thank you so much for recommending my fic! I am kind of in shock. Wow. I am so glad you liked it enough to post on here. You are amazing!

Now I am going to be walking around giggling to myself about this all morning. You made my day.

  Shizuka Joestar, Joseph's adopted daughter, has grown a lot since the Bizarre Summer of 1999. Now in 2016, following the passing of both her parents, she returns to Japan to get away from some of the pressure of the United States. Soon she finds herself weaved into something far wilder than she ever could have imagined, joining a group of mysterious thieves against a new slew of insidious Stand users and a conspiracy that threatens the world at large.Originally posted on Spacebattles, I finally decided to crosspost here too. Original editing/proofreading by Nitewind over on SB.

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.
