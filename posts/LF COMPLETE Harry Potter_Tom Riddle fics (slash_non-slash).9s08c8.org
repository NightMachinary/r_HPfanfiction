Hi! I've scoured most Tom Riddle threads and I'm still on a Tom binge so I'd like to request for your favorite HP/TR fics.

I'd particularly prefer Tom Riddle being in his Hogwarts years but I'm really not picky. But I'd really like for the characters to be some semblance of their canon characteristics. If it's romance, I'd prefer slow burn and that they dislike each other at the start.

No fem!Harry/Tom please, I want them to really be who they are and build a relationship (romantic or otherwise) based on that. Also, no snakey Voldemort please.

Otherwise, I'll look at anything complete and preferably novel-length! Thank you and I hope I did this right!

**** I feel like all the everyone knows all the completed fics. You have linkffn(Paraslenic) , linkffn(Fate's Favorite) , what else? I guess there's also linkffn(Death of Today) or linkffn(Dark and Light). Watermelonsmellinfellon writes a lot of Tomarry, you might find something on their profile. I think linkffn(The Consort Tournament) is completed?

********* I found the whole Harry making a horcrux because he was forced to kinda cringey (I'm on my phone so I'm not sure how to block texts if this is a spoiler). Then the emotional downward spiral to the end kinda sucked. I think Tom is manipulative but Harry's character should have had more backbone. But man, I'm really into the idea of Tom going forward into the future vs Harry time travel fics.

Off the top of my head, I can't really think of a fic I can recommend that's complete and worth the read. I guess my fave romance is Kisses Cursed but it's AU. I've read Xerosis already. And I'm currently on one called Praeclarus Anguis but I might drop it because I'm not into flirty&controlling Tom.

** Well it doesn't feature Tom in his Hogwarts years and they don't fall in love, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] by the Wayland Smith is a fic which centres on Harry and Tom as immortals around about a hundred and fifty years after the end of the war which came to a conclusion with a peace treaty between the two of them - Tom keeps his kingdom confined to England and Harry functions as Tom's last horcrux. They get dragged into a convoluted plot through shennanigans. Tom's resumed a fairly human looking appearance, but he's a murderous bastard who, to the degree that he cares about Harry, basically cares about him as a possession.

The story continues on in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11842318/1/Traveller][Traveller]] and potentially in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]], though that's speculation on my part. Each story is self-contained and I'd say they make for a good read.

** I think a classic is linkao3(Stand Against the Moon by Batsutousai), and it has a recently finished sequel, which I liked a lot more linkao3(Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai).

Also, a medical but magical AU is linkffn(Diagnosis by sistersgrimmlover). I think it's based on Greys Anatomy but it's a fantastic read.

A cracky one is linkffn(Labor of Insanity by estalita11), about an accidentally pregnant TMR/LV.

RenderedReversed has many unfinished Tomarry fics that are incredible, though some are heavy AU like linkffn(The Game by Rendered Reversed; Zubats, Zubats Everywhere). A finished fluffy oneshot is linkffn(Reading the Signs by Rendered Reversed).

I'm sure there are plenty more, but these are the ones of the top of my head that I recently (re)read.

******** My preferences are on my first post! But specifically I'd prefer complete more than anything. Tom Riddle and not Voldemort. Same or similar age. School age or just recent grad Tom. Time travel is the most believable AU. I'm most open to non-Hogwarts AUs. Complete fics and in character fics are what I'm mostly after.

I'd prefer neither were entirely out of character. But most of all, I dislike obsessively in-love Tom with flirty or noncon themes. The Tom I like is highly intelligent, manipulative, very unlikely to love (which is why I like slow burn), and is still incredibly drawn to power. The Harry I like, if school age, is rash and doesn't understand the capacity of his powers but not stupid (more street smart than intelligent). If not school age, I think of Harry as a war hardened, overprotective man who is still relatively shy in terms of relationships.

Gosh that's a lot. These are the characters I've built in my head over the span of 10 years of fanfic reading. I have them for other characters too haha. Thanks ahead of time!

********* Complete Tomarry

you've probs read it but harry in tom's era complete and long: linkffn(Words Fail)

linkffn(Verdict of their Vagaries) I've been reccing this a lot lately, but it's long completed, tom's era, just post-grad, very disfunctional relationship

linkffn(2171770) long complete. You know those fics were the adult voldemort corrupts young harry through harry's horcrux? This is the opposite. War veteran bodiless harry speaks to young tom riddle through horcrux connection. And without giving spoilers, Harry's efforts do not make riddle any less corrupt than he is in canon.

linkffn(Time of love and rogues) Harry and Tom grow up together as incestuous siblings... i think. Don't remember a lot but long and complete and tomarry

linkffn(The snake and his lion) Short but completed. in character. Harry in tom's era (though I think he's originally from there so gen-mix)

Incomplete but worth a read:

linkffn(Teaching History is Old News). I found this really funny. Tom and Harry young adults, mixed gen so they went to school together. It's not complete, but it's slow burn. And there is a bit of a cliff hanger. But there's a lot of solid material, and I think it's still updating. Plus it's relatively in character for both of their personalities

linkffn(wand cores). Not completed, but if you like a war hardened harry and an in character young tom riddle, this is really good. Tom's era. Plus they befriend grindelwald and dumbledore. Both of which doesn't usually happen in the same fic.

linkffn(When Harry Met Tom). I know its fem!Harry, but carnivorous muffin is a really good writer. I'd give it a shot. And it's time travel harry in tom's era hogwarts
