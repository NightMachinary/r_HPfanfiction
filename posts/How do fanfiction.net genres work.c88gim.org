I've been repeatedly told my story is in the wrong category - too much drama, too much humor, too much mystery - and should be re-categorized. I rather assumed fantasy/adventure to be a pretty generic description, but it seems people want something specific from that combination which my story is not providing.

Could you please give me a detailed rundown on the expectations of readers for any fanfic genre(s) you're familiar with? I don't want to be falsely advertising my story to the wrong audience - that doesn't help anyone.


** It helps if you ignore the genres of the original work and focus on the genres that relate to the specific plot you're writing. When people write HP fic, they usually don't label it “fantasy” because they didn't add any new fantasy elements, just used the ones already in the series.

If there's a focus on a pairing, definitely use the romance label.

** I think one issue is that a lot of people conflate genre with tropes in a fic. If, for example, a fic features an "arranged marriage" in a non-trivial manner it would generally be conflated in peoples' minds as a romance story. But what if it features other tropes, like say "OP main character" or "Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived?" Is it still a romance genre?

Maybe the best way to go forward is try to identify the tropes that are prominent in your fic, then consider where those usually belong. This is, admittedly, not a perfect methodology by any stretch. It may however help end the commentary about miscategorization from reviewers. If I am being honest though, I doubt it will end no matter what you do, short of not having any genre at all. Any change will be liked by some and disputed by others.

Best answer though is, this is trivial at best and you should focus on what you want your story to be, not what others want to label it. Its your baby, so to speak.
