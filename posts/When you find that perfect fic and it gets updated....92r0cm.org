**** /YES!/ This. So much this. Once an author announces that they're rewriting, you can safely disregard the new story. In all my years, I've seen three fics pass the length of the original, and two of those three died anyway.

*** As someone who's done this (although the one time I made it a dedicated chapter, it was a hiatus that I /did/ come back from), I much prefer it to a fic where reliable regular updates suddenly stop with no explanation, and you're forever left wondering whether it's dead or not. That's why I always try to keep my readers informed of my update schedule.

**** I wouldn't mind that so much. It's when updates stop for a long time (like - a year), you finally get a notification that there's a new chapter, and... it's an announcement that it's abandoned or being rewritten. Those are very frustrating.

I'd rather they didn't get my hopes up, or put it in the bio instead, so I won't get the notification. People who really care will eventually check the bio.

*** Same, this is why I'm basically a nazi concerning reading WIP fics. I read mostly completed fics and if it's WIP I look to see if it was updated in the last year (if not... meh I'll surely stumble back later on it and see what's what), the ratio number of chapter/words and number of months it's up and I also go see the author's page to see if he usually finishes his fics or if he as plenty of unfinished and seemingly abandoned fics (like "Hey I've a new idea, I must write it... what my other ongoing fics... meh no time"). I also read what's written by the author on his page to see if there is a reason for potential pauses.

This may or may not seem extreme but by this way I seem to mostly avoid the abandoned fics.

**** Ditto to pretty much everything here. I will only touch a wip if they've updated in the last two to three months and the start date isn't three years ago or something. Sometimes I will even skip to the last chapter and skim for author's notes to check that there isn't something about a hiatus. In my opinion, if the story is that good I will run into it again after it is updated.

I swear my dream author is one that will tell me in a one line note when they plan to post an update/what their update schedule is.

Praise don't mean shit. Especially not depending on where you write and in what fandom. I wrote complete trash for 3 years. I got over 300 reviews in that time, and /two/ of them were anything other than praise. It's why I eventually gave up writing altogether- it was so hard to get actually useful feedback, and I could tell I was improving glacially, but I kept getting more and more positive feedback until all I could feel towards my readers was disgust and contempt, because they actaully /liked/ my trash and I couldn't stand that.

***** This is why I'm scared of leaving reviews. As much as I want to praise their writing, I don't want to make it look like I'm taking them for a writing god.

So what I do is, leave things on where/how they could expand the story but other than that I don't know if I should leave grammar or spelling mistakes. Given the fact that I'm not that good in english, I'm not sure if I'm qualified for criticizing their writing. Heck, I'm not even good at criticizing!

I want to support writers, but I'm not really sure of what to say to them on reviews.

****** When I leave a review, I always make it a point to comment on one thing I think the writer did well, and one thing I think they did poorly, and (if I can) how they could have done better with the latter. If I can help somebody else improve their work, I aim to do so, but knowing how to improve is as much about knowing what /did/ work as it is about knowing what /didn't./

I'm just getting to the end of a complete rewrite, but I just deleted the old material and started posting the rewritten story as a new fic.

It's hard to lose the few hard-won reviews and favourites I had, I admit, but they wouldn't be relevant now in any case.

** Eh for me it depends. If I liked it enough to epub it and save it to repeatedly read ( even if it's not finished, sometimes they are just that good ), I end up deeply curious as to what changed.

Though they truly rarely ever get completed to the point that I can actually compare.

Otoh, if I read it and forgot about it, I'm not likely to be upset about it and won't remember enough to care what changed just to be happy that it still exists.

Beyond that, I won't care at all. I'll read a wip, and if it starts looking could, I'll try to actively forget about it until it's finished. At least this way I'll feel like there's always a good story coming.

** I completely rewrote a story once, several years later, because I had developed my writing skills more and still loved the idea but knew I could do a better version now. I didn't change any plot, though. Just updated the style/narration/pacing. I also completed the 90k word rewrite in under a month. I had a few people saying they liked the old one (which was still available on another platform) but most responses to the rewrite were positive.
