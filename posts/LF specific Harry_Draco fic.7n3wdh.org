I remember that Harry and Draco "wake up" to find themselves as a couple and try to hide it. It's post hogwarts, Ron and Hermione hang out with them often as friends of both and notice that the couple doesn't act as usual. Maybe, I'm not sure, there was a scene of either Harry or Draco sitting on the bench and talking to someone. They ended up together after all.


** I suggest looking in here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/]] Would probably have a better chance at finding it.

** I know of two stories like this. Not sure if either is exactly what you're looking for or not.

They are [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/poison_pen/TF.html][Tempus Fugit]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1143478/1/Time-out-of-Place][Time out of Place]].
