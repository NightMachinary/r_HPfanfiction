Mine is a not very-well-known Draco/Hermione fic that doesn't even exist on the internet anymore called /Not Quite A Drug/ by xylitol/./ There was something raw about that story that I really connected with, and I felt like I was waiting for an answer to one of life's mysteries in the story that was never answered when I first read it as a teenager. Even now, there is just something about that story that grabbed me--but it stopped just as it was building up.

​

So what story bothers you in its unfinished state?

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** For me it would have to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/][Error of Soul]] Which has a fascinating take on soulbonds.

Based on the fact that some soulbond fanfiction lets the main characters share thoughts and memories through the bond, This fic looks at the consequences no one else talks about.

Like would you REALLY want to hear the stream of consciousness of someone else? If you have shared memories how does that affect your sense of self? There's a kinda chilling description of how the Weasley twins don't know which one is Fred and which one is George, because with shared memories and identical bodys it's hard to remember who was doing what an hour ago, let alone 10 years ago.

I really wanted to see this go through with Harry and Hermione, but it stops short.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** You're probably not gonna believe me, but I am the author of NQAD. I can't believe I found a recent reference to it. Goddamn I started that story when I was 17. I'm 31 now.

*** HOLY SHIT. I believe you mostly because I want to. It does have the intensity of being written by a teenager--in the best way possible of course. I was a teen when I read it. I just want you to know that of all the hundreds of Dramione stories I've ever read, that one has always struck me the deepest.
