Mizuni-sama's Prince of the Dark Kingdom is arguably one of the greatest pieces of Harry Potter fanfiction ever written. It included some of the most intricate and inventive world building, most dynamic relationships, and consistent characterisation of any Harry Potter fic I can think of. It also included painful grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and was insanely long. Unfortunately it was abandoned four years ago (to my horror, I had only finished reading it shortly before the last chapter was posted). I don't know whether the author died or simply decided to stop without ever giving the readers word that she had. I am inclined to think it must have been the former after she had been writing for seven or eight years, but who knows? In any case, I was wondering whether anyone else who had read the story had any ideas on how they would have liked it to go?

For my money I would have liked to see Tom Riddle (the diary) finally caught and obliterated, not by Harry or Voldemort, but by the wizards and witches he used as pawns; I am inclined to think that either the queen of France would eventually have put Harry in a position where he was either obliged to temporarily defeat Voldemort or that somehow Britain would have been thoroughly sealed off from the rest of the world like a new Atlantis. In the latter case Voldemort might have partially won, but he would also have lost, Harry, probably on the outside would wander the world until his reincarnation, always hoping to be reborn within the lost islands.


** Spoilers for the uninitiated:

- Harry was going to kill Voldemort eventually, and Voldemort was going to be okay with it.
- Voldemort would learn Harry's birthday, but would be terribly conflicted and finally unable to finish the boy fated to be his equal.
- Snape was still going to kill Dumbledore, either that or secretly join him to help bring about Harry defeating Voldemort.
- Harry was probably going to end up with Hermione. I mean, it would have been more appropriate for Harry to remain celibate or end up with an OC, but that seems to be the way things were going. Voldemort was going to kill her, Harry wouldn't let him.
- After Voldemort dies, Harry ends up in a career as a druid, like Carrigan, and the book essentially ends with Harry meeting Tom Riddle's reincarnation.
- Voldemort's renaissance of the pagan arts would still have continued with his death, with Harry as its champion, but with Harry now assuming a nomadic, reclusive lifestyle even as a more democratic style of governance took over.
- Europe would hem-and-haw, but Voldemort was probably going to kill the French Royalty at some point and try to keep pushing further before his end came.
- Various characters end up together (Draco/Natalie, Ron/OC, probably a lot of slash pairings as well, etc.).

Just some thoughts.

*** God ending with Harry meeting voldemorts reincarnation would've been incredible. Very sad we'll likely never get to read that

**** Well it was either that or my other thought:

Voldemort dies and becomes the Winter King after dethroning Gundalari, and when Harry dies he succeeds Voldemort as the Spring King. Which is sort of the metaphor of all my earlier take. Voldemort is the winter of darkness, Harry brings light and spring by overthrowing him.

*** I think I may love you for this post, it would have brought such a neat conclusion to the whole affair.I kind of doubt Tom Riddle (from the diary) would have survived, he was never really canny enough I felt, but otherwise this would have been great. Unless you mean the soul as a whole's reincarnation in which case that's very plausible.

*** Well, he deserved to, but I could never quite believe he would. He always seemed one remarkable man trying to turn the tide of history.

**** Yesss.

It was abandoned during its seventh year, so there are over a million words of awesomeness.

** Shit... it's been a while since I've read it but-

I think endgame is that Harry becomes the next faerie king or whatever it was with that faerie princess being his squeeze, them ruling together, whatever. War and subterfuge with France causing everything to go to shit for Voldemort.

*** I had almost entirely forgotten that subplot, but you could well be right. It would have had to turn up again at some point after all.
