so i was reading some fic where draco was teaching harry occlumency and he talks about picturing a lake and throwing rocks that represents unwanted feelings and emotions to â€˜clear his mind'. anyway i desk with emotions that go all over the place and often find myself in arguments with my family but get overwhelmed with emotions. i've been using this technique to gather myself and it's really been working. like when i get an unhelpful emotion and chuck it into the lake. i try to do it before i sleep so i can sleep easily and it seems to be helping. better than any other mindfulness shit my camhs worker has given me. It's funny that a mf fic gave me this
