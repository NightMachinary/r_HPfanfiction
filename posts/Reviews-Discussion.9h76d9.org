My fellow HPFF authors and readers, what reviews have inspired you to continue to write/ read a story. I have been on a hiatus (due to writing my own original story) and saw I got a review of "This was not a story it was an experience. I'm hurt and in love with this story all at the same time." . Not only did this give me some inspiration to finish my original, but also to continue with some WIP HPFF.

​

Soooo...Authors, do you get this motivation from reviews? (And if yes please share the review that really got you motivated). Readers, is there any reviews that really made you want to read a ff ? (I guess you can state ones that turned you away from a ff, but I really would like to keep this post positive).

​

Also, authors who think you have something really original, but have lower reviews, post your story and I personally would like to review (and I hope some others would too).

​

Thanks!


** I had a reviewer repeatedly tell me the main character was weak, while I was building up to a grand climax. It was quite satisfying when I actually posted said climax, he said 'Nice chapter' with no criticism whatsoever. :-3

My personal favourite review ever, though, was on my (broken, in need of revamp, but weirdly popular) HP/SW crossover:

#+begin_quote
  So, you've created one of the most fascinating hp/sw amalgrams. Ever. Yet it seems low priority. Would my heartfelt plea inspire you to focus on generating a huge, satisfying, novel length story with a generous side of sequels? You really are on to something here.
#+end_quote

which made me giddy for days and did single-handedly bump it up in priority level from 6th, behind nearly every other project on my plate, to 3rd - about to become 2nd tomorrow once I post the final chapter of my first fic.

** Motivating, maybe, but it was certainly gratifying to get this sort of review:

#+begin_quote
  "Excellent story so far! It's so much more than the smut fic I was looking for, and boy am I glad for that."
#+end_quote

though it was tempered later by

#+begin_quote
  "then again, I just binge read this after getting my wisdom teeth pulled, so forgive me if this comment is ramble and disjointed"
#+end_quote

I have to admit that some of the more critical reviews have been de-motivating, so I've adopted a policy not to take action on any review until I've had three days to let the emotional sting subside. Besides, sometimes, they're right.

** I think my favorite recent one was:

xScottx chapter 21 . Mar 25 Worst fucking last 3 chapters I ever read and I read absolute shit before. You should be ashamed of yourself. As soon as I started liking this shit you go ruin it. Give me my fucking time back loser.

And:

Ashfold chapter 21 . Jan 1 Honestly, it hurts me to write a negative review here because you're one of my favourite writers on this site. But the Christmas chapter of Pureblood Princess was self indulgent and honestly a bit insulting. There's so much great content that could've been put into a Christmas story for Pureblood Princess and having 90% of the chapter being nonsense.

This one I loved. Heaven forbid I write something I want to write and post it as free readily available content on the internet. Apparently that's insulting!

*** Yeah, but one of the reasons you enjoyed writing it was that you /knew/ it was going to troll the f*** out of everyone!

** I once had a review that inspired me to write a sequel to a fic. But otherwise I don't really get many reviews: almost none on my new story, so it would would do me no good to look for motivation there. I am quite envious of writers who get plenty of reviews, it must be very empowering.

** Well that's fantastic. Now I want to read /your/ fic! Can you post a link?

Since you offered, I'd love to hear what you think of my story. I'm definitely up for constructive criticism because I'll probably play around with the plot and the character development once it's complete. I'm happy with the way it's turning out, but I also think it could be better.

#+begin_quote
  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

**** I like the note in the summary and note in chapter 1. Lot's of description. Really unique. I thought it was a little slow at first but by chapter 5 and 7 picked up really quite nicely. Great Job!

** Half of my reviews are generic "update soon pls" which are quite motivating... I guess. Some guest reviewers show up even if I'm a day late asking me why I haven't updated.

Since my story is a fix-it of sorts, I'm not hoarding a ton of critical reviews. But that's okay too. I write stories that I wanted to read and I'm the most pickiest person I know, who hates to stray far away from canon. I guess I should be glad I have people reading my fic at all, since I know it isn't something with an extremely original plot or interesting world building. It's only the characters and their relationships that matter and I like my story enough to not allow myself to be demotivated with a few negative words.
