:END:
So back in the day I used to enjoy reading fanfictions, specifically Harry Potter ones and especially ones about Ron and Hermione. I haven't read fanfic in such a long time, but my friends and I did a Harry Potter marathon recently and I kind of got back into reading fanfiction. There is one specific fanfic that I read on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] that I randomly thought of today that I don't remember the title of and I wanted to see if I could find it again, but so far no luck. I tried to put in keywords that I thought were from the fanfic thinking that it would maybe come up, but I haven't found anything.

It doesn't help that I barely remember anything about it, but I'll try to explain what I can. So basically I'm pretty sure it's set after the last book, but not sure how long after. Ron and Hermione are together, I think married, but maybe just dating? The main thing of this story is that Hermione is kidnapped, but I don't remember why, and Harry and Ron have to find her. What I remember the most from the story is that she was tortured and it was like kind of dark. The torture was kind of bad, but the only thing that I specifically remember was that the person who took her like cut off her hair. Like there was more than that, but I don't know why I specifically remember that part so well. She was found, but obviously she was very affected by the experience.

I know. I know. It's kind of dark. Don't judge me. I just remember when I was younger I thought it was written so well and I'm really curious to read it now that I'm older see if I think the writing is as good as I once thought it was. Most fanfics that I've read years later that I thought were really good are actually pretty horrible and it's interesting to see how your views change and what you think is good is very different from when you were younger, Also, I know this is the most vague description ever and this makes absolutely no sense, but maybe someone will be able to decipher what I'm talking about. If not then I'll just move on with the rest of my life lmao

Thanks!
