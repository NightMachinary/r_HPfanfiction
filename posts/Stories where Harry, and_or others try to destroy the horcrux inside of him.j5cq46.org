I'm not looking for Dumbledore to get bashed, but Harry and/or others being disappointed/shocked or what have you, from finding out, is perfectly fine.

I'd rather Harry still work with Dumbledore, even if, he no longer trusts him. Though that's not mandatory, I just do NOT want him being evil/dark.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

Would love it, if Harry had to deal with what he went through, with his past, with the Dursley's, though that's not mandatory.

NO Weasley bashing, I love the Weasley's, and hate when the author has them using Harry's fame and fortune.

Am fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.
