Hogwarts ghosts-centric fanfics, specifically nearly headless nick (he's my favourite character) but any ghost is nice! I prefer light-hearted fanfics (e.x : humor, feel-good, etc), but again, everything is nice, as long as it's centered around Hogwarts ghost :)


** Eep, I'm not the only one that loves the ghosts! :) I have them helping with mischief in my long series but I don't think it's ghost centered enough to offer but I'll be watching to have more to read for my ghost fix. :)

** There is one where Regulus is a Hogwarts ghost. I can't think of where it might be though, I don't think I bookmarked it

** Most of the ones I can think of are either new ghosts from canon characters, rather than canon ghosts. I can think of one or two where Myrtle is a more prominent character, but not the MAIN character---except for two stories where she's a voyeuse (which I had forgotten had a female construction) peeping on Harry with Snape.

Pretty sure those are not what you're looking for.
