Hi guys;

If you're looking for a fanfic about Hogwarts and the D.A. during the Horcrux hunt, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]]. It's beautifully written and I highly recommend it.


** While I'm not interested in reading that type of fic, I noticed no one else had replied so I wanted to let you know I appreciate anyone who recs fics here, so THANKS!
