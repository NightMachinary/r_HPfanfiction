The current trend on HP Shitposting over on F***book is "wholesome Uncle Vernon," featuring memes of Vernon encouraging the heck out of Harry, loving the idea of magic, and pointing his gun at Voldemort instead of Hagrid. And I'm NGL I'm here for it.

So, hit me with your best recs for kind Dursley fics - preferably Vernon giving the Death Eaters the business end of his pistol but I'll take anything where they treat Harry right and actually see the benefits of having a wizard in the family.


** Linkffn(A better man by Valandar) fits the bill. Vernon gets a second chance and tries to do right by Harry. I like it because it's not a total heel turn, he still has trouble accepting magic, but tries his best.

Edit: Been a while since I read it - started again and realized that Vernon doesn't come back with his knowledge of the original timeline, just a vague sense that he ought to be more tolerant of the Potters and it butterflies from there. EditEdit: Never mind, must have been thinking of a different fic where Vernon wasn't totally accepting, he's full on Mr Rogers-level tolerant in this one. Definitely fits your prompt though.

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

*** Actually, not even that ... he mostly gets one big push in his wedding to treat James and Lilly well, and it kind of snowballs from there on its own.

And to add something on my own, there is “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel” linkffn(13137899), where Vernon is just an normal husband, the main character is Petunia, but it is still worthy of reading. One story where very bad Dumbledore doesn't bother me, because it is not just bashing, it is well developed part of the story.

***** Two other Good!Dursleys fics by kgfinkel are linkffn(13575326) and linkffn(13715486).

Wand Crafter's story I definitely enjoyed quite a lot, and would anticipate each new update. It also features Hufflepuff!Harry, Hermione and Neville.

I'm not currently up-to-date with A Pinch of Salt, but it feature a talented-at-cooking Harry, and meeting Remus earlier on.

If I can think of anymore Good!Dursleys fics, I'll link them (I'm sure I've read more) but I cannot think of any others at this stage.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was introduced to 'magic' and magic wands earlier than canon by his primary schoolteacher Miss Honeybloom. It was also during that class, he was introduced to and became lifelong friends with a certain Miss Hermione Granger. Armed with a burgeoning knowledge of wandcrafting, an inquisitive best friend and a supportive aunt and uncle; magic awaits!

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

** Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian: linkffn(13308768)

Petunia's somewhere in-between a Muggle and a full-on Witch - magical enough to brew potions and generally be part of the magical world (eligible to take on magical guardianship, start businesses, have a Gringotts account et cetera), not quite magical enough to attend Hogwarts as a child. Features a misguided-but-not-evil Dumbledore, so fair warning on that front.

  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?

** linkffn(Acceptance by AsphodelWolf15). Vernon doesn't care for magic at all, but Petunia regrets losing her sister and decides to treat Harry like her own son.

linkffn(A Different Dursley Family by Lucillia). Vernon and Petunia had different experiences growing up.

linkffn(Barbaric World by Luiz4200). Harry doesn't want to leave the Dursleys for the magical world.

linkffn(A New Chance by White-Blackbird). The Dursleys start out as in canon, but turn good after Harry is mistreated at Hogwarts.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chamber of Known Facts by millenialraven). When Harry is dropped off, one of the Potters' friends explains things to the Dursleys.

linkao3(Mr. and Mrs. Dursley-Evans' Very Extraordinary Morning by JustASimpleHo). I haven't read this one yet.

linkffn(Crafting Magic by kgfinkel). I haven't read this one yet, either.

  UPDATE (1 MAY 2020): Now being re-written thanks to my wonderful beta [[/u/wrackspurts][u/wrackspurts]]_nargles! Re-written chapters will be marked with an asterisk.Why were the Dursleys so mean?Harry's personality, his actions, his choices, even those in the later books, are all influenced by his upbringing at the Dursley's horrid household. Had he been raised differently, would he have made the same decisions? Would he still have been on the side of the Light? Would the story of Harry Potter still fundamentally be the same as we know it today?What if the Dursleys were good? And not only good but kind? And raised him right, in a loving household, as he deserved?A prologue to Harry Potter-Dursley-Evans And That Supremely Surreptitious Stone, but a work that can be read alone as a short story. Follows the same flow and structure of the first chapter of the first book.

  If Vernon and Petunia were so concerned about their image why did they treat Harry the way they did? A child with a bad reputation living in their house forced them to tell tales, when it would have been much easier if they treated him like part of the family. How would Harry have turned out if he was accepted? (This is not for Dumbledore fans)
