** I agree with you, but this discussion is quite over done. He's either incredibly stupid or extremely evil. There's really no middle ground imo. His actions and inaction is morally reprehensible and probably illegal.

*** Hardly fits the profile of stupid or evil. I prefer to think he has flexible morals to achieve what he sees as best for the magical population as a whole or that he had a lapse of giving a single fuck that lasted 17 years.

** Ain't that hard, just read canon. About the dragon thing - not only Dumbledore allowed that, but so did Karkaroff, Madam Maxime and the Ministry Officials from Britain, France and wherever Durmstrang is. So either you accept that the Wizarding World is opperating under different standards or you can hang on to the opinion that they are all crazy, evil or immoral. For the rest of your points, just look up any discussion on the topic. Different people have tried to explain time and time again that no, Dumbledore is not evil, that yes, for most of these things there are explanations (given in canon, so maybe just read the books again). This discussion has a beard longer than Dumbledore's.

** I want to point out that we don't have a absolute knowledge. The story ia written from Harry's POV therefore it's impossibile to say without reasonable doubt that dumbedore's actions weren't at least between the most optimal. Sure from harry pov they sucked but this doesn't imply that they were bad. We don't know all the politiking that went on behind the scenes , we know only what happens.

Everyone is a general after the battle...
