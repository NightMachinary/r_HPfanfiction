** DO you want to like copy everything from Harry?

The premise works without a FIdeliius and traitor...

Now, I always wondered if how the odd circumstances that let to Harry surviving the killing curse could be replicated in Neville. I mean, sure ALice could be as willing to sacrifice herself for her son, but part of what made that work with Harry was because Lily had an option Voldemort was offering her to live because of Snape, and she choose not to.

Not sure, one of Alice's parents was a Slytherin and she was a pureblood? Maybe Voldemort offered to spare her? Though it seems unlikely that's a strong enough reason to let her live, after all, Voldemort is a heartless fucker, and Alice had already opposed Voldemort like 3 times already.

*** It can be, but the author would have to use something like Voldemort's second war idea of not "spilling too much magical blood."

**** It was only sacrifice because Lily had an option to live. If there is no option to leave, then you are only offering yourself to die first

** You can still keep the Harry stuff the same. Peter gave the secret to Bellatrix instead.

**** I imagine this Peter who has had 15 years more to mature, would stick by his friends plus he has grown attached to harry

though I imagine he would never confess how low he sank during the first war to anyone nor would he let anyone see the guilt he still carries because of it

I imagine in this timeline, harry might have become friends with ron and neville at a younger age

due to sirius thinking it might be good for young harry to have people his own age to talk too

Peter would then suggest relatives of people who used to be in the order. Remus would bring up neville and sirius would bring up how that ministry workery who pestered him about his bike mentioned he had a son that would be similar age to harry Peter would go 'oh arthur, he married gideon and fabians sister'

so harry, ron and neville become friends at a younger age

I imagine peter would turn spy, when voldemort returns Peter would march himself to dumbledores office to confess his actions during the last war, and then say he wants to become a spy for the order

** You also need to put attention to the motivation for Bellatrix to attack the Potters in the first place. In canon, she attacked the LOngbottoms because she thought Voldemort had it wrong or something, that it was Neville being a pureblood who was the true danger. Harry is a halfblood and Bellatrix thought him inferior than Neville... now she is out for revenge, so she ought to get caught doing something. Just thought I needed to remind you that.

** Voldemort doesn't have to go to their house. Lily and James didn't stay inside all day, everyday. Someone close to them under the Imperius Curse could lure them out. Or they could make Neville sick enough to force a St. Mungos visit.

I don't see how the Potters would be tortured without Peter giving up the location. The Longbottoms had jobs whereas the Potters didn't.

As for the meat of the story: I don't think Neville survives. He floundered under criticism and expectation in canon and here there's no Harry to set an example/look up to.

*** perhaps the potter torture happens months later after everyone starts letting their gaurd down

James and lilly tired of being copped up decide to leave harry with sirius for a night so they can spend some time outside.

**** This would be fine for a "looser" swap. A strict (I don't believe this is truly possible) one has Karkaroff outing at least the Lestranges, who are off to prison. Now young BCJ is a wild card I don't think most knew about. Still, it would take a lot to convince me he could overpower James /and/ Lily by himself or that he'd have the balls to do it.

***** maybe due to the slight changes Karkaroff never gets caught

so he is with lestranges and BCJ

we know during the first wizarding war voldemort liked to divide his followers up so none of them would know all the others

** If the Potters are Crucioed to insanity, that would seal Severus' side in the war as surely as killing her would (in fact, I read a pre-DH Snape fic once where he had unrequited feelings for Alice and turned due to danger, and later torture, of her). And unless he is unaware of the Potter child completely, would probably have turned around the same time anyway -- even if Voldemort's primary target would be Neville, I can't see him leave Harry alone -- covering all bases, etc. He simply just happened to be interrupted in canon after all.
