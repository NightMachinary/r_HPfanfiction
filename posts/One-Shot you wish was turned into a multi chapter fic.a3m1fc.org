You know those one-shots you get to the end of and wish there was more? What one do you really, really, really wish was longer? For me it would be Anything But Slytherin by IP82, I just want to explore that AU more so badly.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

*** I think I've read Proud to have a Witch in the Family before because it was vaguely familiar but I didn't remember it.\\
I vaguely remember reading a fic a couple of years ago that had a Satanist Harry that was all right, can't remember the title though.

** I wish that [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][Children of Set]] was a multi chapter fic. linkffn(7452468)

Ansketil has great ideas for adventures that Tom Riddle might have had while he journeyed abroad after his graduation. The short story itself is excellent, but Ansketil also includes snippets of Riddle's travels in their other fics. I wish that they would bring all these ideas together in one fleshed-out story of his descent into darkness while questing for knowledge and power. There are very few fics that touch on that period of his life, and I think Ansketil could do it justice.

** Linkffn(A Collection of Harmonious One Shots) chapter one. It falls into Evil/Manipulative!Order of the Phoenix tropes, which I know a lot of people are fed up with, but I would have liked to have seen it continue into a series.
