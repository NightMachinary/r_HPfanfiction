** Noo not at all. Ao3 is great! I only use Ao3 it's my favorite site since you can really filter for what you want. Of course there is a lot of smut but I would say to equal parts there are fics that don't focus on that at all. Ao3 is just a fic site that doesn't delete fics even if they are highly controversal. If it's not illegal you can usually post anything there if it's tagged correctly. That's why so many people think that there is only smut but you can filter all that out if you want. There are soo many fics and many authors crosspost to fanfiction.net Ao3 is really great if you want to look for specific tropes and since they have introduced the "exclude tags" filter category you can literally filter all the smut out if you want.

In practice, no. Good luck finding a fic featuring X as a/the main character. Or finding a romance story about a rarepair that doesn't just feature them in the background. Or finding all stories published since some date.

These things are around 70% of the things I want to use a filtering system for, and on AO3 they're simply awful. AO3 is just as terrible as FFN, but it has different flaws.

** Ao3 does host a lot of smut stories in this fandom, but there are also plenty of great non-smut fics there as well. These days most authors crosspost their stories to both FFN and Ao3, so you find the same mix of gen and romance stories on both sites, just in somewhat different proportions.

*** Sometimes, I find the FFN filtering more useful. It is the inferior system by far, but because you are limited to four characters, excluding characters means that they won't be important, but might still appear. Which is useful if you want to exclude fics where someone is the MC, but not every fic with them in it.

For example, I am not fond of Obi-Wan in a central role. On FFN, I can exclude him and still get a lot of fics where he appears in some fashion. Archive just axes everything with him in it if I exclude him. Same applies for Ron. I don't mind him in the background, but find him boring if he gets too much narrative focus. On FFN, that's not a problem. On archive, excluding Ron blocks a lot of longer fics with Harry in them.

Tl;dr: Archive is good for never seeing a character again, FFN is better for excluding someone as main character.

I don't like a hard limit since sometimes a fic really does have a large cast of very important characters (more than 4 at least) but still. I love AO3 though wouldn't trade it for anything. But finding fics actually about minor characters and not just tagging them cause they show up in one scene is hell.

** I always just filter out “Explicit” fics and have a pretty okay time of it. Smut fics seem to get a disproportionate amount of kudos compared to non-smut fics so I'll either sort by “number of bookmarks” or “upload date” to try and find quality fics. In the past year or so, AO3 overhauled their tag filtering system so you can finally exclude tags you don't want. I usually just exclude pairings I don't want to read about right now.

There's a [[https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/21152-ao3-relationship-savior][userscript]] that automatically hides works with too many relationships, which I think is useful as well for filtering out the sort of fic I don't want to read.

** Honestly, I think fics on AO3 concentrate more on relationships in general rather than detailing out an actual plot. The large majority of fics on Ao3 are either smutfics, shipfics or fluff fics.Nothing bad about that if you like it, but it does explain the difference in smutfics between Ao3 and FF.net. They also tend to be more well written imo, I just rarely find fics that interest me on there.

**** Yeah, as a reader that prefers gen and avoids anything with more than a little romance in it, and doesn't particularly like fluff/slice of life fics either, I haven't found many HP fics on AO3 that fit my criteria, that aren't also on FF. In other fandoms I read AO3 has a fair amount of gen fics too. But in HP, there are some, but not that many. Where as FF has lots. At least from what I've seen every time I've looked. And from fics I've been linked to from here.

However even in other fandoms I think AO3 has a higher ratio of romance to gen than FF. It's just more lopsided than usual for HP.

FFN tags are limiting but you can easily find fics that you are you looking for with the exception of gender-bents fics and smut.

You should try using the Exclude tag, excluding explicit shoooould do it but you will always get stragglers how are not tagged.

There's one of your problem right there. You could get rid of all of those tags (the ones that actually exist on any stories) from your search results by just excluding a single meta tag: [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter*s*Tom%20Riddle%20%7C%20Voldemort][Harry Potter/Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. The same principle applies to other common tags; there's almost always a parent tag you can use to exclude all of the other tags that are synonyms. In my opinion, the ships that are /actually/ annoying to exclude are the multi-pairings, i.e. Voldemort/Lucius/Severus and the like, since there tend to be many iterations to exclude beyond the obvious.

Looks like Ao3 just doesn't deal well with users trying to exclude tags that don't exist, and tag names are sensitive to capitalization. So in this case "m/m" is excluding many fics that don't actually have an "m/m" tag on them, and the same for "drarry" and "slash". Check out the results if you use the capitalized versions of the same tags:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=Slash%2CM%2FM%2CDrarry&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=F&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=15000&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=en&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][Capitalised]]

If you compare those two results you'll see that the uncapitalised version excludes many fics that don't actually have a drarry, slash, or m/m tag on them.

***** It's quick and easy to see the accurate numbers due to Ao3s tagging system. No need for hyperbole.

  it's just what you see most.

By "most" do you mean 26% of the total results when not simply using the exclude filters to remove the stories you aren't interested in?

****** Most does not mean majority. It means most common. Draco/Harry is the most common pairing on AO3. You see it the most. I am right in this case. I know you can filter it out, but that reduces the amount of stories I want to read by a lot. For the reason, I use FFN, because there are more stories there that I would consider reading, so there are more that I am likely to read.
