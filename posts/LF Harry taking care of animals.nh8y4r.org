LF any fic where Harry finds he owns Potter land that's filled with magical creatures. He's got to do some restoration at first due to decades of neglect, maybe the House elves have been keeping everything alive but need Harry's magic/funds/directive to really bring the area back to top shape. Doesn't have to be exactly as described, just any stories that feature Harry and care of animals/magical creatures:)

Thanks!!

  Harry loves his sheep, his dogs, the tranquil countryside farm he's turned into a home. He doesn't need Draco Malfoy screwing it all up. But, god, what else is he supposed to do about Draco Malfoy sleeping with a lamb in his bed?

  Fem!Harry, god!Harry. Mu was there minding his mountain, when a woman came and rocked his world away. It wasn't quite love at first sight, but Mary did always had a way with Death.
