Ron was dating Hermione, Harry dating Ginny, but then Harry and Hermione decided to trick them to keep them out of harms way. Unfortunately this back fires and in the final battle Ron is 'killed'. Five years later it's revealed Ron's still alive but disfigured from the battle. Story deals with the portrayal of Ron as a 'side-kick' and 'comedic relief' as he returns. Ginny's also pregnant with Harry's child if it helps. I read it before on fanfiction.net but can no longer find it. If you remember it or something similar that would be extremely helpful as I'm slowly going crazy trying to find it.
