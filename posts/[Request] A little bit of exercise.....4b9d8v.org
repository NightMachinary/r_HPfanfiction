So any story that Harry does something about his body, goes to the gym, goes for runs whatever as long as it's believable (no Greek Olympian body after 2 weeks). If it's after 5th year all the better.

Any mentions of him having a growth spurt and he somehow becomes 6" 2 from 5" 7 then you lose points.

I thought I'd found a story but as soon as Harry called Vernon a piece of shit to which his reply was "Don't call me a piece of shit you orphan faggot" I couldn't carry on. From Ancestry of the Samurai I think it was called.

A real masterpiece. I'll be sure to use this in one of my fanfics in the future.

*** Ya pretty much this. Sort by Harry/Hermione and I bet 70% of them are like this, at least if they were published around that time.

  "Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody..." After seeing too many mistakes, Moody took matters into his own hands to make sure that Harry was properly prepared - by thinking outside of the box.
