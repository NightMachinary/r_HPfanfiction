Fairly obvious what I'm asking.

I'm currently working on a fic, which I publish (slowly) on Wattpad. I've got 16 chapters published, 17 written and the 18th is a work in progress. I have a wonderful editor and we do several rounds before anything goes out, as well as discussing the future of the story.

Basically, I'm wondering whether I should start publishing on other fanfiction sites, or if I should just keep it on Wattpad? Thanks in advance for your help (if I get any.)


** I don't think crossposting could hurt. Posting on fanfiction.net and/or Ao3 as well would certainly give you more readers and feedback!

** I've never read on Wattpad, but having looked around, I think it might have more of an audience for original fic, not fanfic. If you want more fanfic readers, I think you'd do well to publish on either FFN or Ao3, or both.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5vb6yb/anything_worth_reading_on_wattpad/][Look at this thread and see what people think on stories on Wattpad]]. Add to this that the site is incredibly user-unfriendly and you have almost no one reading there.

Post it to FFN and AO3, those are basically the only relevant fanfiction hubs.
