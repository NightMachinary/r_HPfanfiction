I've had this ambition to write a story where Draco slowly transforms into a flobberworm. My only worry is that people will treat it like a troll fic.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise][This concept]] and I are very good friends.


** I once had a random idea for a /Lolita/-esque Snarry deconstruction narrated by Snape from Azkaban.

** "In a more realistic version of the Potter world, if Harry was a girl and she ended up in the Little Hangleton graveyard... they'd rape her. So, how do I make a version of Girl!Harry that won't be emotionally destroyed by that?"

**** This came about when I noticed that Voldemort had gone out of his way to kill Florean during the summer after Order of the Phoenix; I mean, what would provoke such an early action against an otherwise innocuous shop owner? How lactose-intolerant can you get?

Ergo- there's a bit more to Florean than meets the eye.

******* There was one I read ages ago where Hermione time travels to Tom Riddle's school years and manages to accidentally kill him when she gives him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and he goes into anaphylactic shock. I don't remember how she got him to actually eat it, as presumably he would know that he had a nut allergy...

** I've had this idea a while ago, you tell me if it's bizarre enough.

There's this random 29-year-old Muggle who is living in a shitty apartment, working a shitty job, and spending all his free time playing video games or fapping to porn or whatever. Then one night while walking home back from his crappy job and lamenting his life, this guy encounters a bunch of Dark wizards torturing Muggles, and they catch him and give him a taste of Cruciatus, or perhaps something more inventive.

When they're about to finish him off, he asks his tormentor what time it is. The wizard chuckles and grants the poor Muggle his last wish. As the dude watches the attacker raise his wand to finish him off, his last thought is that he's just turned 30, and that he's going to die a virgin.

And then he becomes a fucking wizard. Because that's how it works.

The guy then slaughters them all, or, I dunno, makes them his underlings and tries to become a Dark Lord. I haven't really thought that far ahead since it's unlikely I'm ever going to write this.

** I don't know if this is bizzare enough for this thread, but I kind of want to write an Umbridge-centric fic that's a variation of the incredibly stupid 'hogwarts reads the HP books' trope, except Umbridge reads them privately. She then uses the information in various nefarious ways; maybe gaining political leverage in the Ministry, maybe deciding to throw her lot in with Voldemort by kidnapping/assassinating Harry, or maybe deciding to join the Order of the Phoenix, and tearing the organization apart just by being her poisonous self.

Also, it would be fun to write Trelawny with a Time-Turner: invisible, drunk on sherry, and making her predictions come true. Being a Seer is harder work than most people realize. Seriously, did you really think a /fox/ killed Lavender Brown's rabbit?
