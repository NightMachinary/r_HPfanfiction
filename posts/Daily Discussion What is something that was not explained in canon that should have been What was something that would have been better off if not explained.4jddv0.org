** I think asking what should have been explained is too easy. Whether or not you abhor the nitpicking of the story's plot, you have to admit there are questions. Granted, answering most of those questions would simply result in a worse story, but that doesn't change the fact that many things were left unanswered. I'm sure you've seen it already, blandge, but for the others who haven't [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7EARedHair][ARedHair]] pretty much covers all of it.

The real interesting part is what shouldn't have been explained. And the answer to that in my opinion -- and this isn't just because I dislike what the fanon has done with the information -- is Snape's memories, and his love (platonic or otherwise) for Lily. I think ending it the way Saving Private Ryan ended would have been so much better. Harry asking why he did what he did, and Snape telling him, "No, those memories are just for me", or something along those lines. Just like Dumbledore didn't explain every little detail, Snape shouldn't either. "Because it was right!" or "I did what I had to do..." is all the reasoning he needs.

Just throwing that out there as an idea.

This. I actually liked Snape - or perhaps I should say the /idea/ of Snape - before DH, but after I read that chapter, he was ruined for me. The fanon take only made it worse.

Before DH, I had two different ideas on his backstory and why he was on Dumbledore's team, both of which I liked, but the second was my favorite and much more likely.

One: Rumors of his Death Eater sympathies were as exaggerated as the rumors of his vampirism. He was definitely a jerk, which was why he got along so well with some of them, but he had never joined (edited: except for spying purposes, meaning he never joined in spirit). This was never a very likely theory, but I love that kind of storyline, partly because it's usually humorous.

Two: He joined as a teenager, then saw some things that made him grow up and realise that this was not just talk - it was people's lives. He then spent the rest of his life doing the right thing, just because it was right. He still wasn't a nice person at all, but he was a good person when people's lives were at stake. This was actually possible, before DH, and was my headcanon.

DH made that impossible - apparently, obsession with one particular person is way more admirable than doing the right thing for its own sake. :P

***** Because the only motivation we see is Snape's desire to save Lily, and after she dies, that becomes a desire for revenge rather than loyalty to Dumbledore or care for Harry. Snape may (and I think this is true for other Death Eaters) have felt horrible about killing and torture, but it was only the possibility that Lily might die that he actually overcame his fear of Voldermort and acted.

****** I'd say it's pretty normal for him to ignore the horrors of Voldemort until the consequences are made personal to him i.e. Lily being targeted. People often ignore problems faced by others until they are made personal to them. Lily's death was the event that changed Snape's mind, but I doubt he still believed in Voldemort's message and wanted him dead solely to avenge Lily.

He was motivated by more than just Lily, but her death was the emotional touchstone for him that reminded him of why he was taking such great personal risk to oppose Voldemort.

** I'm curious about the religious aspect/lack thereof in the wizarding world. In our own mundane reality it's easy to justify an agnostic or atheist perspective (which is my own belief), but in a world with actual, undeniable magic? There's more likely to be one or many divine beings, right? Especially when you consider that immortal souls are known to be real, and an afterlife of some kind seems generally accepted in the wizarding society.

Also: if you lived in a world where magic was clearly a real and normal part of life, and souls very definitely existed, why would anyone get so bent out of shape about death? They're just going on to "the next great adventure", right? What was Voldemort's problem?

*** Voldemort went through the most torturous thing ever... he was in an orphanage during the great depression. No one seems to remember that. Tom Riddle grew up hungry, beaten, teased and for all intensive purposes tortured for 11 years. and what caused that? Death. Death of his mother put him in this orphanage unloved, and tortured. He most likely subconsciencely blamed death for every single thing that went wrong with him during his stay in that orphanage. thus his sentence of his mother couldnt have been a witch as she died. Magic was his way of protecting himself from all his enemies, INCLUDING death.

** The Horcrux and the wandlore were this really awkward last-minute exposition, I always felt. I never liked the MMO-quest given to Harry "destroy 7 soul-anchors; 2/7 destroyed". The wandlore was just there for the Hallows (which I found to be completely redundant extra quest-objects).

I would have preferred if Voldemorts survival as a wraith was kept mystical. And I would have preferred, as I keep on saying, a seventh book with a civil war plot instead of the horcrux chase.

What would have deserved more explanation was the magical society as a whole and magic in particular. I know Rowling sai something along the lines of "magic is magic", but we know it follows rules.

Dumbledore only mentioned that the diary was a horcrux or acted like one, in the six book after they were introduced. other than possession, the diary acted exactly as a penesive, where you can project memories or thoughts. Just a darker more sinister form. Nagini was Voldemort's familiar, of course he can control her better than any other parseltongue. the Locket felt like it was added just like every other trinket that is never mentioned again. (how did one of the blacks get an order of merlin first class anyway?). The hallows and Horcruxes were bullshit. Rowling didnt feel confident writing a legit war, so she made it a treasure hunt which she had been doing all along. (first, second, and portions of the fourth were Harry and Co. hunting things.)

How, exactly? It set the tone for how other Horcruxes would act in the future, and it's connected to the other Horcruxes, so it could be considered a "sneak peek" of book 6, whereas the Pensieve isn't connected to the Horcruxes at all: it only reminds Harry of the diary because they both involve reliving a memory.

#+begin_quote
  Nagini was Voldemort's familiar
#+end_quote

Literally nowhere in the books does it say anything like this. Also, Dumbledore even says in book 6 that the reason Voldemort has far more control over her than over any other snake is that a part of his soul is inside her, and not that she is his "familiar". Such concepts, while appealing, aren't mentioned at all in canon.

****** The entire concept of a horcrux, as it was written, is garbage. The locket foreshadowed nothing, the snake again foreshadows nothing as Nagini was controlled by a Parseltongue, and for all we know Harry can do the same thing if he found a snake. Also for reference, explaining how "foreshadowing" is foreshadowing does not make it so. So Dumbledore saying that Voldemort controlling Nagini better due to the soul shard being inside her is not a fair point. Especially since the whole scene is dedicated to tell Harry what the horcruxes are.

I didnt pull that concept out of my ass. I actually thought of it while reading the 7th book. I read it and realized that Rowling didnt want to write a war. Considering how much she tackled with the Harry Potter series, it only leaves three options. One she didnt think it would work, which most fans could make a great argument against; two, she didnt feel confident enough about some form of the story to include a war, which is entirely possible. She may have felt that writing a war would not have worked for the characters in the story; or three she wanted to end on the seventh book and a war storyline would take to much effort which is again possible. Via that logic, two of them include that JK didnt feel confident about writing a war story.

To address your point about the diary setting the tone, you are right since Dumbledore defined what a Horcrux did using the diary as the example.

my biggest issue with the Horcruxes were that they existed for over 60 years for Voldemort and not a single person other than Dumbledore and Regulus ever figured out that he had them? HOW? The Death Eaters all use dark magic, and Im willing to bet they each have a library much like the Blacks did, so how is it that not a single person ever thought about it? "Wow my boss said he is immortal should probably look into that" never crossed their minds? what about the fact that Voldemort made the protections over his horcruxes so easy to pass that three kids who never finished school could do it? It screams to me that there was not any thought whatsoever into it from before book six. Its one of the MAJOR reasons book six sucks so much for me. It was in my opinion, JK's attempt to cover the major plot point of a Villian who had immortality, and make that person able to be killed. (for reference the other reasons book Six sucks for me is that I really dislike the childishness of Harry, the way Ginny is written, the monster in harry's chest, and I really really really dislike Slughorn for some reason. probably due to bad memories of a chem teacher.)

TL;DR Horcruxes arent really foreshadowed since dumbledore uses each of the examples you gave except for the locket which was just a trinket that no-one cared about. The apprehension towards writing about a war is logic based on my part, not pulled out of my ass. I would like to state however that I like that you responded to the Black comment however... it was a random tangent of mine and I wasnt expecting it to be mentioned ever again lol

*** Magic in the HP books is a mix of Soft Magic (since we have very little, I'd almost say no, understanding about the rules of magic) and Hard Magic (Since the little we do know is "Say X --> Spell X happens). This basically gives magic a sense of wonder since you don't really get what's happening (like LotR), but you still understand what's going on when they start fighting or use a specific spell (like Mistborn).

So while it would have been cool to understand how everything about magic worked, it would have undermined the "magical" feeling the books have. Also as you mentioned this let's you come up with your own rules, as long as they fit with what little we know (which is always nice for FF).

And part of the reason I say it is that I really do want to see it as a story, a story that shows how Tom had became Voldemort, and you can't have an interesting story with character development if eleven year old Tom Riddle is pretty much the same 71 years old Voldemort mentally.

Theoretically, not a horrific childhood, poor, sure, perhaps abuse, and he somehow comes out incredibly cruel and "evil".

From watching documentaries like the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdOkTeXREa8][1940's House]], and doing loads of research online to find out what life for orphans in the WWII era was like, Tom Riddle basically had it around the same - if not worse - than Harry had it.

Even then, Harry had at least some people who cared about him - including Dumbledore and Sirius - out there; a whole wizarding world who revered his name; riches in his family's Gringotts vault; and a later adoptive family, in the form of the Weasley clan. Tom Riddle had none of that.

Orphans were treated extremely poorly during the WWII time period by the general UK populace, mainly because families who already had children, and were struggling to survive on rationing, were asked or were forced by the UK government to take care of orphan children as well.

Additionally, medical care was all but non-existent for orphaned children during the time period, seeing as how most doctors and nurses went off to be field medics. Teaching, too, was in short supply, as the disastrous "Operation Pied Piper", which occurred on the same day (1 September 1939) that Tom Riddle went to King's Cross for his second year at Hogwarts, scattered both teachers and put children's education [for Muggles, at least] into chaos.

Even then, families put their /own/ children above the orphan "street rats" they took in, and in some cases, even neglected orphan children by refusing them care, food, or other necessities.

There was a very real hatred, prejudice, and discrimination against poor, orphaned, and destitute children in the WWII era.

You're referring to Harry's Hogwarts years. I referred to pre-11 years old Tom and pre-11 years old Harry, simply because that's the earliest we see Tom, and because both their lives changed considerably after. And Tom had made quite a few allies and was idolized in his Hogwarts years.

I don't care what some documentray says about orphans in the 40's, for two reasons: 1. Other orphans (and generally people who suffered a horrible childhood) didn't reach his level of insanity and evil, and 2. (most importantly) none of that showed in the text. Cole's Orphanage wasn't a terrible place. They had vacations at the beach and pet rabbits, Tom had his own room (better than what Harry had) and the caretaker was generally well meaning. There is no evidence in-text that Tom was abused, certainly not the kind of abuse that creates someone like Voldemort. And Harry's personal abuse was much worse than any wide prejudice against orphans, because he had to suffer it alone, and it was aimed directly at him, unlike Tom, who was in "good company" (as well as in top of the pecking order).

I expected Tom to be given a backstory that truly shows why he turned so evil and mentally unbalanced. I got none of that. if you're going to create a villain that is so far beyond the limits of "normal evil", you can't give him a "normal backstory". You have to make it something specific, because otherwise you can't explain why all of his fellow orphans didn't come out the same way. Maybe it doesn't work like that in real life, but it has to work like that in fiction, where people expect reasonable cause and effect. It's bad storytelling and bad characterization, it's unsatisfying, and it's just not /interesting/. It's the most banal of Freudian excuses. And it's not even something we've /seen/. All we've seen is Tom acting like little Damien in a relatively good environment.

*********** If you meant to refer specifically to pre-11-years-old Tom and Harry, then I would suggest editing your post to clarify that. Until you clarified it in your reply, I assumed that you meant more than just the two's childhoods would be open to explaining why Tom chose the path of becoming Lord Voldemort.

However, as the UK was leading up to war even in Tom's childhood, I think my point(s) still should be considered in the explanation of "why Tom turned out the way he did". It took years of planning, for example, to implement something as large-scale as Operation Pied Piper, and plans for, or actual, drafting was already taking place by that point in time. The people were already expecting war, and to many, it was only a matter of time before war broke out.

Even in the magical world, we know that Grindelwald, despite never launching an assault on the UK, was also rising to power in continental Europe. It was a starkly different time, place, and mentality that the general UK populace and government had at the time, as compared to the time period where Harry grew up. Whereas Tom grew up during an era where a major war, a /world/ war, was looming on the horizon, Harry grew up in a time of peace.

This also reflects in the stark differences of their characters: while Lord Voldemort wants to wage war upon the Ministry of Magic, and take over magical Britain, Harry does /not/ want to go to war. In fact, throughout the books, Harry wants nothing more than to live a peaceful life, free of the threat of a next wizarding war and Dark Lord. However, due to Voldemort's actions that set the Prophecy in motion, Harry feels that he must defeat Voldemort nonetheless.

#+begin_quote
  I don't care what some documentray says about orphans in the 40's
#+end_quote

Well, I think that you should, especially since it's what actually happened during that time period. Also, the documentary isn't about orphans, it's what the Muggle UK (specifically, London, where Tom's orphanage was located) had to go through during the WWII era.

Although Rowling didn't write about it in the books, that doesn't make it completely irrelevant, especially since Rowling /did/ do some research for Ilvermorny for Pottermore and the /Fantastic Beasts/ film. If she does write about it, she will likely do the same or similar research, including watching the documentary, in order to make writing about Tom's youth realistic.

Likewise, even though Rowling did not write directly about Tom Riddle's development into the person he ultimately became (Lord Voldemort), it is still implied. "Offscreen" character development is often used by novelists and authors as a tool to save time, and in Rowling's case, this is especially true. Since Tom Riddle's entire character development was not directly relevant to the plot, save for the main characters learning about his Horcruxes, Riddle's development was not shown "on-screen".

Now, if the books had Tom Riddle as the protagonist, and not Harry, that would be a /very/ different story. However, the title of the books are "Harry Potter", so Rowling most likely chose to omit the majority of Riddle's character development. Likewise, there's also the fact that such omission would make Voldemort, as a villain, more "mysterious" to the reader(s) and audience, something that Rowling likely intended.

#+begin_quote
  Cole's Orphanage wasn't a terrible place.
#+end_quote

That's a pretty generalizing statement to make, especially since we don't know a lot about Cole's Orphanage to begin with. Also, it's called "Wool's Orphanage" in the /Half-Blood Prince/ film.

#+begin_quote
  They had vacations at the beach
#+end_quote

- That was only one known vacation, and it seemed to be more of a "field trip".

- Said beach was clearly dangerous in some regards, given the description of it in the books; what happened there with Tom terrorizing those two children, which is never fully explained; and due to the high cliffs depicted in the films.

#+begin_quote
  pet rabbits
#+end_quote

If you watched the 1940's House documentary, it explains that, at the time period, children and people in general were encouraged by the UK government to raise rabbits...with the intent of killing and eating them. While most treated them as pets, they were also distributed in order to wind up on the children's dinner plates.

So, while a rabbit hanging from the rafters is disturbing, killing the rabbit really wasn't that big of a deal for the time period. The rabbit would have probably been killed, skinned, and made into rabbit stew anyways.

#+end_quote

Lumos, Rowling's anti-orphanage charity, actually used the official studies of this on their website, but raising children in an orphanage has been shown and proven, many times, to cause sociopathic and antisocial tendencies in many children, Tom Riddle included. Also included is a host of other mental illnesses and disabilities.

This is because children /are/ often neglected in orphanages, especially as infants and toddlers. Neglect is a form of abuse, one that runs rampant in orphanages, and one that is used by Rowling herself to spearhead efforts to completely abolish such institutions. [[http://wearelumos.org/problems/child-abuse-and-neglect][Lumos even has its own website dedicated to exposing child abuse and neglect in orphanages]], and also [[http://wearelumos.org/the-problem][as another webpage on it]].

#+begin_quote
  Across the globe 8 million children are living in institutions that deny them individual love and care. More than 80% are not orphans. They are separated from their families because they are poor, disabled or from an ethnic minority. As a result, many suffer lifelong physical and emotional harm...A small percentage are in institutions due to behavioural problems or due to being abused or neglected. This is a violation of their rights...Social services are insufficient to meet the needs of poor families or protect children from abuse.

  Decision makers resist closing institutions because they cannot imagine a system of family based care and lack the resources to fund and manage the change. Personnel resist for fear of losing their jobs. Stigma attached to children in care makes communities reluctant to accept them.
#+end_quote

Rowling also reaffirmed this in a 2007 interview, where she stated, "Everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him." [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][(Source)]] This is also in line with Lumos's slogan, which is "[Loving families], not orphanages."

#+begin_quote
  if you're going to create a villain that is so far beyond the limits of "normal evil", you can't give him a "normal backstory"
#+end_quote

But that's the whole message of the Harry Potter books and films. Tom Riddle /did/ have "a normal backstory", albeit a tragic one. One of the main messages and themes of Rowling's books is, "it is not our abilities who make us who we are, but our choices". Especially since one of the major lines of dialogue from Dumbledore from the films is, "I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices".

Tom Riddle wasn't so evil because he was born that way, but because he /chose/ the path of becoming "the greatest Dark Lord who ever lived". This is a message also stated, and implied, many times in both the books and films.

#+begin_quote

If you feel that way, then I think the true issue you have is with how J.K. Rowling wrote Lord Voldemort (and Tom Riddle) in the series. Unfortunately, all I can do is to try and explain Rowling's public stance(s).

************ Oh god, you keep pasting blocks of texts while completely ignoring my point.

I could go and point out a couple of errors in your post, but it doesn't matter, just as real life orphanages don't matter, simply because they /weren't/ in the story, where orphanages /weren't/ shown as terrible places (the vacation was each year, Mrs. Cole liked to drink but wasn't abusive when she drank) and because there's nothing in it to suggest "this turned a child into an insane sadistic dark lord". You're completely ignoring any literary cause and effect and just saying "well it wasn't a very nice place, so that's an ok backstory", but no, it isn't. Millions of children suffered what Tom had and worse, and the world is not crawling with Voldemorts, even if it produced some sociopaths.

It's about choices, yes, but what experiences made Tom make those choices? nobody knows. Rowling included. But I think it's a story worth pursuing - at least if you don't handwave it away with "oh he was at an orphanage, so now he's a dark lord!". You might be satisfied with that, but I look for characters who actually have a reason for the way they act.

I'm not the best person in my line of work but I still go on courses and get more qualifications to try to be better, as do most of my peers, and that's just for our own benefit. If the whole world depended on me being the best at my job I don't think that it would be achievable but I'd get off my arse and give it a go. Maybe I'm the odd one.

******* My point was that he learned new spells, both independently and in class, and even enjoyed testing them on people he didn't like, while the original post said he hadn't learned any new spells.

People get so obsessed with Harry learning magic and training, that they forget that this is what he actually does at school most of the time. We don't see even half of all the things he learns, only what is plot relevant.

********* Indeed, that's exactly my problem with Harry, his obsession with being a nobody ("...but I am just Harry!" - as he tells Hagrid) stunts his growth (his true potential only shows itself while he's in danger and fighting for his life - otherwise he's a damned under-achiever) IMHO (and it's probably because of the Dursleys, they after all treated him like he wasn't worth shit, so he himself has very low self-esteem and no sense of self-worth to speak off (I mean most of us wouldn't dream of sacrificing ourselves - even for loved ones (parents, girlfriends, friends, children etc.) - until all other options are exhausted (and some might not even do it then - and IMHO that's nothing to be ashamed off either because our own life isn't worth less than the lives of loved ones etc.!)! Harry doesn't think like that, his first course of action is taking any threat head on by putting himself in the line of fire (he doesn't involve adults etc. because his trust in them has been ruined (Dursleys - but also McGonagall just dismissing him/telling him to keep his head down and because Dumbledore doesn't listen to him anyway!)))

There's of course also Hermione and Ron - both of them are part of the problem (there's enough fanfictions that present this point, so I am not the only one thinking this) as both would probably not like an accomplished Harry (Hermione thrives and prides herself on being the trio's brain and Ronald hates being in the shadow of his more accomplished siblings and in Harry's, too (there would probably be no living with him if Harry suddenly became interested in his grades etc. for example if he wanted to switch electives (runes and arithmancy instead of making up stupid death-predictions (divination) and being nice to Hagrid (care of magical creatures)) and if he didn't want to play chess and rather do homework etc.)

****** And then he had a sad about it. He had a breakdown because he responded to an Unforgivable with a (special) cutting curse. That's never made sense to me. He knew that Draco was up to something bad. He believed that Draco had tried to kill Katie Bell and Ron and he still had a sad because of the bathroom incident.

Barely.

Not really, no. He was relatively calm about the entire deal, more afraid about getting caught cheating than about killing Draco. And most teenagers would have a great emotional impact to cutting a schoolmate to the point of near death.

******** Maybe I just don't get it. I wouldn't feel too terrible about hurting a person who was trying to torture me, at best.

This is the problem with being an adult and trying to reason with a book aimed at children. Harry sat through how many detentions because of his completely justifiable self defense? It's complete BS. So much of it is complete BS--to an adult. And I just can't relate to how a teenager would think about these things.

********* UK morality is also a factor here. I say this because on another thread I was reading today, Americans seemed to be shocked that you can be sent to jail for self defense in the UK, if the actions are seen to be excessive.

By those standards, Harry's were. He could have run, or stunned or disarmed Draco, instead he cut him up.

********** Well, it's justifiable: Harry didn't know if Draco had backup (so - permanently - disabling him (a stunner can be countered by Enervate and a disarming charm can be countered by say having a second wand or hell, a knife or something)) and if someone points a gun at you (any wand is a LETHAL WEAPON after all) then shooting to disable and/or kill is ok in my book!

** Oh god there's so many, and its too easy to be really vague in a response to that question. The obvious one would just be more details on magic itself and how it works.

But if I had to choose the 1 thing that ALWAYS stuck out to me was the interplay between life and death in the Wizarding world as that plays such a huge part of the story. Of course perhaps that couldn't be explained for obvious reasons.

A close second would be more details on the department of mysteries and all contained within.

*** Yes. Explain the thing that's literally ALL ABOUT being mysterious. In addition, a thing that most people who like HP fic forget is that magic doesn't need to be explained in JKR's world. Like most other things, it's just a vehicle for the story.

** I would have liked a little more on Lily. To me it's improbable that Dumbledore, McGonagall and all the other teachers that taught her had not a thing to say about her to her orphaned and friendless son who came to the same school she did, for six years, just twenty years after she herself had been there. Similarly that every person who knew her in school is now dead. Surely friends of the dead mother of a celebrity should be falling over each other to befriend him or comfort him?

I also would have liked an explanation for why Remus didn't reach out to Harry sooner instead of coming across him by chance through his work. Sure, he was poor, but they literally live in a magic world where you can send magic silver messages for free. Or an explanation that he did reach out, but was blocked by Dumbledore/the Dursleys/the protective charms on the house, etc.
