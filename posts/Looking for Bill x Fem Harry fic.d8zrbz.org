:END:
The fic had fem harry raised by Sirius and was set in a very formal wizarding world. Bill was either Lord Weasely or Prewitt and Aunt Muriel didn't want him associated with the Blacks so she tried to force him to court other people. I think she made him meet Fleur who was friends with, or at least knew, Fem Harry.


** That sounds like Blood of the Godfather. Unfortunately, the author decided to rewrite it and deleted the original. linkao3(17160074)
