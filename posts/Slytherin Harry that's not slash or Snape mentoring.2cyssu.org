HBS made me want to read other Slytherin!Harry stories, but I've never really liked slash or Harry/Snape mentor fics. The only one I can find is the Warlock of Slythering on ff.net, but that's been abandoned... any recs?


** There are many such stories. i'll link a few:

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], 270k words, WIP (last update was a few days ago).

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

Also, Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] series, a couple hundred thousand words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape. Feared Potions Professor. Head of Slytherin House. For years, he had eagerly awaited the son of the person he hated more than all others. And if there was one thing he discovered, it was that Harry Potter was NOT the son of James Potter. What he was would change his life and the lives of everything around him. The saviour had returned, not as the Perfect Gryffindor, as so many had hoped, but as the Perfect Slytherin, and the fallout would be felt for all time.
#+end_quote

Adari's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4086213/1/Lost-Hope][Lost Hope]], 64k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from the hat which contains all four founders?
#+end_quote

Mira Mirth's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], 205k words, WIP (last update was Nov. 2013).

#+begin_quote
  As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts---and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be.

*** I'm current reading Hogwarts Battle School (HBS) as well and that's what made me want to read more Slytherin Harry fics.

Yay! Complete fics! Thank you, I'll check them out and see how good they are.

*** Seconding Mira Mirth's /On the Way to Greatness/. Not quite what the OP seems to want, but still good are:

Time travel instead of AU, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] by E4mj does years-as-sequels and is a WIP at Year 3, last updated in July 2014. Slightly odd premise for the time travel, but becomes very good as it gets going. Total is around 250k so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry do?]] by Big D on a Diet is pretty well known and frequently hilarious series of one-shots totallying 44k.

**** truncation_error says it's n × 100k words long, but the page he links to lists only 2 stories of 8-10k words each. Can you give the links to “full” (and if possible not registration-walled) versions?

***** Sorry for the delay in replying. Originally, it also took me a while to figure out how to browse Fanfictionauthors.net. I think their UI is ... not as good as it could be. To find the rest of the stories, you go to the top of the webpage, select the "Fanfiction" drop-down menu, select Harry Potter (and, if you want, select a pairing from the submenu). This should bring you to a page with all of the HP stories from jeconais.

Anyways, you can find the rest of the stories here: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#HarryWednesday]]. Truncation_error also apparently as a counting error, as I see approximately 140k words.

** Another I just thought of is The Grey Maiden series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1015585/Chris-Widger][Chris Widger]], a rather old, dated series that you might find readable. When I read it several years ago, I found it angsty yet (reasonably) solid storytelling. I believe he got through five books of the canon rehash (900k+ words) before abandoning the effort.

*** Read his ff.net profile, the stories seem to be pretty solid. Will check them out!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5562313/1/Out-of-the-Depths]]

My take on the Slytherin!Harry genre. What if Harry's less-than-happy childhood had left him more jaded than canon? No pairings, and you won't find any eleven year olds talking as if they were at a Renaissance fair here either.

Probably the best one I've read that isn't abandoned, it seems more realistic than most fics that have Harry in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection]]

1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

This author separated the years into different fics and is currently in year 5. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't diverge that much from canon and seems to focus on how much would be the same despite Harry being in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8774038/1/Harry-Silvertongue]]

Ten-year-old Harry Potter meets a kindred soul in secret who changes his whole outlook on his life with the Dursleys. Burned into Harry's mind with the violent death of his only friend, the lessons imparted guide him through his time at Hogwarts. AU, Slytherin!Harry.

Haven't read this in a while, but I remember liking it a lot, biggest con seems to be the large gaps between updates.
