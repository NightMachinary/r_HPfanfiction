And to ad on to that any that the jailed death eaters take harry under there wing (because at the end of the day he IS just a kid)


** I'm very sorry but I have to note:

"there" is for "Look over there!"

"their" is for "It's their child."

** There is some from back in the day. I somewhat remember one where Harry is imperiused into firing a killing curse at Cedric's dead body right as they return to Hogwarts. It was a Harry/Susan Bones fic.

I also vaguely remember a Harry/Seamus one and possibly a Harry/Human!Hedwig one.

However, in none of these do the jailed Death Eaters take Harry under their wing. Not seen that in a fic.

*** That first one I think I've read part of - I ended up quitting because the author kept using deus ex machina to make sure Harry kept suffering as much as possible and nothing could go well for him.
