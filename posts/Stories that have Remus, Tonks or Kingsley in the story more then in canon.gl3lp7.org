What was Remus' missions during the second war? What kind of spying jobs did Nymphadora do for the Order?

I love both of them, but it just kind of sucks that all it boiled down to was: Tonks gets romantic feelings for Remus, Remus tries to ignore it, ends up falling for her. Gets her pregnant, tries to leave (Thank you Harry, for smacking some verbal sense into him), Tonks has the baby, and then they die.

They can be together in the story, but I'd like to see them being more then just a couple. I'd like to see their lives, what it's like being two very different people in the Order fighting a war, putting their lives on the possible line, et cetra.

Another thing that makes me mad is that Remus never really stays in touch with Harry, yes Remus is part of the Order and doing missions for Dumbledore, but he was also James, Lily and Sirius' friend, I get it, Harry has to do things without adults by his side, still irksome though.

Extra notes: I'd like to see more stories focused on Kingsley Shacklebolt, doesn't have to be the main character (Neither do Remus or Tonks), just as long as one of them is in the story more then in canon. What did he do in the order, before the order, before he became Minister, et cetra.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings, can be on any site.

If Harry is in the story: No OP Harry, No Harem Harry. If Harry is a "Lord" I don't want him being Draco Malfoy 2.0, I want him to still help people. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Actually, he does not have to. You can tell a perfectly fine story where adults support the MC to the best of their abilities and the MC still ends up in a lot of trouble. For example, Lupin cannot do anything about the TWT or Umbridge (short of murder that is). And it would make Harry better adjusted. Hell, you can have Lupin raise Harry and then die in book 5 or 6 if you want that big "1v1" finale.

Lupin had no reason to stay away from Harry, and not even the narrative argument holds up (it would be doable with a few tweaks). In the grand picture of things, it would not change much if Lupin made the occasional visit. All you'd have to change would be the Dursley bits and the introduction to the magical world.

Which is one of the reasons I don't like him (the other being his handling of Tonks, either commit and be true to your word or shoot her down, everything else is unfair towards her).

** You might enjoy “[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1][Shifts]] ” by Fernwithy. It's old and was written before DH came out but still good. It is an alternate idea of what Remus was up to during OotP. Tonks definitely plays a part. There is also a sequel. If you like it I encourage you to check out all of the author's fics. I remember liking them all.

*** Thanks, I don't mind older stories, as long as the grammar is good. It can be non canon, I don't care, thanks!

** You might like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]. It's essentially a retelling but if Sirius breaks out when Harry is 8, so there's quite a few changes. It focuses a lot on Sirius and Harry but Lupin and Tonks get their fair share of time too! I will say it kinda has a slow-ish pace to it but I like that in some fics. There are sequels that follow Harry's Hogwarts years too

*** I would have recommended this one if you hadn't :). It's my current gold standard for stories where Harry has a supportive (albeit flawed) parental figure. And of course, with Sirius as his guardian, Remus has a huge role.

** On the subject of Remus and Tonks I always recommend Taura Normas "Flying Colours" and the sequel "Shadow Boxing" (Part 3 of the story will come later this year). Its on AO3 and Funfuction.net. The story is about their relationship and its really close to canon, but it also shows them doing cool order stuff, there are great action scenes etc. Plus its so well written. Its like reading the actual book!
