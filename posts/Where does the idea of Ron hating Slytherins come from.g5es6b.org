Isn't his grandmother a Slytherin? Also if he hates them that much wouldn't he stop being friend with Harry when he finds out he was the "heir" of Slytherin?


** I guess people take this exchange:

#+begin_quote
  'what house are your brothers in?' asked Harry.

  'Gryffindor,' said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. 'Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.'
#+end_quote

and extrapolate from it that Ron hates Slytherin and everyone in it.

The only real meaning I get from it though is that Ron thinks his parents would react badly if he ended up in Slytherin.

In Philosopher's Stone he said-

"There's no witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin."

** In the first book he worries how his parents would react should he end up in Slytherin.

In the second book, after finding out that blood purity really started with Salazar Slytherin he says that he would never want to be part of his house.

Obviously lots of fanfic writer interpreted this as him being the biggest Slytherin hater in the UK and condemning any possible friendly interaction anybody has with a Slytherin.

Conveniently people forget that Harry is the one who hates Slytherin the most from the Trio, especially since he seems to associates the house with Voldemort.

Well, to be fair, Voldemort is the heir of Slytherin and a direct descendant of Salazar, not to mention that he exhibits the trait which got Harry bullied throughout the second year (parseltongue) due to the association with Slytherin.

** On a narrative level, Ron and Hermione serve different purposes to compress characteristics of the wizarding world. For Hermione, it is the view of a complete outsider with no formal ties to the wizarding world (and all its implications). For Ron, its shorthand for the wider cultural, social, and thought processes of the wizarding world.

What this means for Ron is that he is meant to serve as sort of the general cultural backdrop for how the "old families" actually think and/or why they believe as they do. Some people don't realize this, but Ron's view is not unique towards Slytherins. Rather he, like many in each of the houses, tends to categorize outside his own house in a pejorative way (see other statements to and about Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws). One shouldn't take this as "he's a bigot," as much as this is probably pretty normal for all the houses.

And, moreover, his fear of ending up in Slytherin has as much to do with his family's legacy of Gryffindor status (while its not exclusive, there is a general trend and their is a reason the term "black sheep" is used for some family members). Its probably not surprising that a lot of purebloods/halfbloods end up feeling pressured to live up to their family's expectations (perceived or otherwise). We see the same thing in Draco in Philosopher's Stone too, where he comments about his Slytherin heritage. And I would bet a fair amount that most families tend to be dominantly in one house or another in a similar vein.

But as for the fanfiction side of things, fanon internalization of this idea to justify people disliking a character they already dislike. Specifically, making him this out-and-out anti-Slytherin crusader (instead of you know, rooting for his team? like everyone else?) lets one write a story where it paints Slytherin in a positive light or rationalize having Harry not be friends with him. In other words, its a means to an end, and a fairly lazy one at that. There are far more realistic ways to make Harry split with his friends that don't involve caricaturing Ron and Hermione.

** Ron is collateral damage in (typically) Gray!Independent!Political!Harry's story or (less frequently) BizzaroWorld^{1}!Slytherin!Hermione story. For the Harry fic, either Ron is an obstacle to Harry getting better (i.e., faux-aristocratic Slytherin) friends or, if Harry is Slytherin himself, Ron makes for a useful foil for Draco---a bumbling, low-class adversary who is easily put in his place; and something similar goes for Hermione, but there, he is someone Draco can protect Hermione from.

​

^{1} --- You know, the kind where Gryffindors exhibit more blood prejudice than Slytherins, and where Draco and Snape are friendly and supportive.

** I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byu3g9/does_ron_have_prejudice_against_slytherin/][this discussion]] about it from a while back.

The way I take it, Ron is somewhat anti-Slytherin in canon, and that gets exacerbated in fanfiction. Of the trio, he's also the one likeliest to have held those views for a while - since both Harry and Hermione grew up in the muggle world. So if looking for one member of the trio to make more anti-Slytherin, well... He's the logical choice because of that.

I think it's also an offshoot people have of making the Weasleys into super-Gryffindors - like, making them archetypical Gryffindors one and all, which would make them hate Slytherin with a passion and thus be passed down to Ron.

Obviously canon Ron is a lot more chill about it - but at the same time, canon Slytherins are unreasonably bad/unnuanced, so he probably could stand to be a bit more prejudiced against them there ;)

*** But...isn't it more logical that Hermione and Harry would hate slytherins much more than Ron? I mean sure Ron may have been taught that Slytherins are all bad (which I doubt because I don't think his father would allow his own mother to be badmouthed) but they didn't do something personal to him at that time. While Harry had his parents murdered by a man who proclaimed himself as the heir of Slytherin as for Hermione, the founder of this house wants people like her dead and Malfoy call her a Mudblood.

**** I don't think so. Hermione and Harry both join the Wizarding World at an older age - so they don't have 11 years of being taught that Slytherin is the evil wizard's house.

It's possible that they would eventually hate it more, sure. But it strikes me as much more reasonable that, coming from a different cultural standpoint on it, they wouldn't have the same biases from birth. For instance, we know that Harry hates Slytherin in canon basically because Hagrid and Ron tell him that it's the bad house/Voldemort went there, and that he thinks Draco is an ass. It's very easy to think of that being changed - it's harder to think of someone with 10+ years of being taught that.

If I use the story to guide the reader to a certain conclusion about a character then guess what, I just used the story to guide the reader to my opinion. It's fan-fiction it's not factual canon by definition.

Whether you accept it or not Ron has verbally expressed a notion that he would not rather be in Slytherin, which is probably like everyone else in any house they don't want to be in X other house. According to the definition of prejudice, preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience they are prejudiced.

Are Harry and Hermione prejudiced, yes according to that definition they are as well.

Harry hates them more than Ron, I'd argue. Draco was a pretty good way to turn him away, but Voldemort being a Slytherin would have fucked him up after 2nd year.

And Hermione tries to stay above lumping them all in, but still fails, only subconsciously. She may not say "I hate all Slytherins", but she doesn't have any Slytherin friends or contacts.

** He was bullied by Draco to a greater or lesser extent ever since he met him. I'm sure if the Slytherins he first encountered upon entering Hogwarts were nice to him he would have had a better view of the house. I don't think most eleven year olds are capable of nuanced thought. If time and again as a child you're treated badly by a particular group of people it's only natural, however wrongly, that you come to form the opinion they're all bad. I do think fanfiction has a tendency to make his opinions more heightened than canon though and I don't like this.

I see the whole of Slytherin house as upper class with two very notable exceptions: Riddle and Snape. I always saw part of their motivation was trying to fit in with the great and good (sarcasm that). Let me see if I can find a better explanation for class, it's so embedded into English culture it's hard for me to unpick - anyone who can explain it clearly feel free to step in.

** His family wouldn't seem to like it very much which worried him before the Sorting. Then Severus being immature. Then Salazar being against muggleborns. Then Draco saying he wished Hermione was the next victim to be murdered by Slytherin's Monster. Lucius setting the Diary on Ginny. Then Voldy being Salazar's descendant. Then the fact that literally no Slytherin beyond Slughorn shows Harry or the Trio any kindness.

So we get a lot of comments about not wanting to be in Slytherin and Slytherin being horrible. Or that one bit in GoF where they mocked the idea of a Slytherin being Chosen as Hogwarts' Champion since Warrington put his name in the Goblet of Fire.

Add on that Slytherins always end up being in the group causing trouble, and the dislike continued to grow.

Malfoy's goons starting stuff all the time. Inquisitorial Squad of Slytherins being up Umbridge's butt, for example. Death Eaters mostly being Slytherins. Parkinson suggesting handing Harry over to Voldy in DH when Voldy gave them a chance to.

I think Ron didn't turn on Harry in 2nd Year because Harry still knows nothing about magic and is very obviously confused about speaking to animals being a thing that all magical people CAN'T do.

His jealousy over Harry being rich is annoying considering he's got a much better life that Harry would die for. His feelings of inadequacy about his schooling inspired Harry to not try as hard just so Ron won't be offended like he is when Hermione succeeds too much, which is annoying even if she needs to learn to chill.

People do overdo it in bashing him in fic, but I understand why others(and myself) really don't like him. Most HP characters have some really shady facets of their personalities that make them a bit bash-worthy in some way or another.
