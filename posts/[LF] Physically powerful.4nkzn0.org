I'm looking for fics, where the protagonist is physically dominating compared to other characters. And by this I don't mean the sexual BDSM or whatever, but like, s/he has dragon blood, or is a vampire etc, that kind of physical power. Of course both genders are welcome.


** "Cold Blood"

*** Is this the one where [[/spoiler][the basilisk venom and phoenix tears, plus something with the dragon from the First Task makes Harry into a weird dragon person, and somehow transfers it to Hermione?]] Because if it is, I always found it to be a weird one.

**** Yes. Though the explanation is quite detailed in the story.

***** I do remember it being fairly coherent. Weird, but coherent. In some ways, it reminded me of the 30s and 40s pulp fiction stories.

****** I'd not consider it weird, not compared to canon.
