I read one long, incomplete fic with this premise in it that I can't remember the name of and I'm reading another with it right now ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]] by The madness in me) but I was curious if anyone knows of any other ones and/or the name of the incomplete one. In it Voldemort won and the Potters fled to Germany where they worked as artists but they later die and Harry gets sent off to Hogwarts. And Harry becomes an apprentice of sorts to Voldemort and later Sirius and Remus in a werewolf colony becomes a major part of it.

Edit: It's Prince of the Dark Kingdom.


** I really like a similar story, where Harry is Voldemort's apprentice, but then is subverted by a painting Horcrux. It is in two parts, the first if which is linkffn(Ice Crux)

  The Boy-Who-Lived didn't exist. Voldemort attained the final victory. As a feared authoritarian figure, he rules the Wizarding World and Hogwarts in the shadows. And when a magically talented Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts, he attracts the unwanted attention of the Dark Lord. Following a magnificent duel Harry is blackmailed into becoming his second apprentice.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** Linkffn(The Imposter Complex) is updating regularly still and has a ton of Diary vs Shade conflict, both indirect and direct.

Edit: I believe the incomplete one you were mentioning was linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)?

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

*** Yes that's it! I stopped at a random place because the story seemed to veer way off it's original goals and the fic is incomplete so might as well. But I do want to reread it and similar fics to it. The Impostor Complex sounds good.
