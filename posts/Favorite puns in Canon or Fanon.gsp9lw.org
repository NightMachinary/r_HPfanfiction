I have to say, one of my favorites is also one of the most overlooked, given the response it go when I commented about it in a thread, and it blew at least one other redditor's mind.

Grimmauld Place = Describes the location rather well, as it's a Grim Old Place. Also a nice call back to Sirius's animagus form, which resembles a Grim(or is a Grim, depending on which fanfic you're reading).

Also, did anyone note the pun I hid in this topic?


** Sirius's father's name is Orion. If the Black family follows the same naming tradition as my family and many others, Sirius's middle name is therefore Orion, making his initials SOB, which is perfect on so many levels His mom is kind of a bitch.

** Grimmald Place has always been one of my favorites. Privet Drive is a more subtle one: privet is usually planted as a hedge, a barrier behind which Harry is hidden but also trapped. (I've always thought Kreacher/creature was demeaning, and it makes me think less JKR every time.)

One of my favorite fanon ones is when somebody threatens Rita that they will squash her like a bug, and she isn't sure whether they know her secret or it's just a turn of phrase.

P.S. I noticed your solar flair.

*** I'm so glad someone did.

As an added bonus, it's the same color as the “Meta” flair.

** My personal favorites is the Diagon Alley and Nocturn Alley.

Diagon Alley = diagonally Knockturn Alley = nocturnally

There's also that one bit in one of the books, can't remember if it's Order of the Phoenix or not but...

"Sirius said seriously" Can't get better than that.

  "I don't know," she replied slowly. Shouldering people out of their path, she made her way to the front of the blockage; oddly enough, several students, mostly the ones in fourth, fifth, and sixth year, covered their mouths as if to suppress their laughter when she passed. Once she had a clear view of the Great Hall, her eyes widened and she muttered, "I'll kill her. I'm seriously going to /murder/ her."

  "What? Who?" He looked over her shoulder and gaped. "Oh, her."

  Reluctantly, he moved his eyes to the banner over the Gryffindor table, and suddenly the reason for the spectators' reactions to Hermione was perfectly clear. He had to choke down the guffaw that threatened to spill out, wary of further inciting her ire. For once, Luna was going to be hiding behind /him/ today!

  This flag, too, was in appropriate colors for the Lions' den. Over and over again, a golden individual dressed in robes and pointy hat climbed onto a set of parapets only to fall over the edge and windmill his arms in sudden panic. Glancing over the words again, Harry wondered where his most childish of lovers had misplaced her sense of self-preservation.

  /Society for the Promotion of Leaping off the Astronomy Tower/

  /Take the Jump... If You're Brave Enough!/

  "Huh. I wonder if she still has some aggression over being bullied throughout her years here that she's trying to work out of her system?"

  "If she wants aggression, I can certainly give her some," Hermione snarled in response.

  /I'm probably about to join Luna in the doghouse, but.../ "I take that means we /aren't/ going to be joining SPLAT?"
