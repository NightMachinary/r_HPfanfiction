A few that I've enjoyed:

linkffn(Dear Order)

linkffn(The Wendell that Wasn't by opalish) & linkffn(The Desk by opalish)

linkffn(A Mistaken Sorting by Silver Pard)

linkffn(Full Circle by tetsurashian)

linkao3(Best Laid Plans by esama)

Both recently-written ones and classic ones are welcome. Obscure ones all the more welcome. Slight bashing is okay.

I've enjoyed linkffn(Oh God, Not Again!) and linkffn(When In Doubt, Obliviate) too though these two isn't all crack, so long fics are fine as well, but please keep it light-hearted.

And please not Seventh Horcux or A Black Comedy. Somehow I just can't get into those two at all, though god knows I've tried.

Any suggestions?


** If you're into Naruto, linkffn(11634921) is a fucking hilarious crack fic.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** Huh, I wasn't all that into Japanese comic crossovers before, but a few days ago I rushed through There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket on AO3, and it was hella good. Enjoyed it a ton even though I've never watched Bleach and only knew Ichigo and Rukia before reading that, so I'm gonna give this a try. The first few chapters looks pretty amazing. Thanks!

***** From my experience, Crack fics tend to be very parodyish and silly, and usually involves significant OOCness (I think the term might be derived from Crack Cocaine, but I'm not sure). There can be Humor stories without crack. For example, linkffn(6045275) would probably be more cracky than, say, Oh God Not Again. Linkffn(3373788) would be a very extreme example of crack. I'm nowhere near an expert, this is just what I've inferred from experience, so I could be completely wrong. Anyway, I reccomend linkffn(2217444) and linkffn(4951074).

**** The origin is that either the author had to be high to have come up with the idea, or the reader had to be high to make sense of it. Or both. Oneshots are where it generally works best, as otherwise it risks quickly decaying into a rotten mess that makes you scratch your head and go "WTF did I just read!"

** I wouldn't call /Dear Order/ a crack-fic --- it's a humor story, but does not really forego logic and characterization for a cheap laugh, which would be my definition of a crack-fic.

linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) is really good. You might also want to have a look at linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake), although it's come to an abrupt halt.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.
