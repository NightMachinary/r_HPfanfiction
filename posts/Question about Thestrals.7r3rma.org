Would my OC be able to see thestrals? Her parents were killed when she was four and she remembers them very clearly. Would she have been old enough to process the death?

Though she wasn't there when they were killed, so maybe not.


** You have to see the death and process it. So no.

** If she didn't witness their deaths directly, then no. Harry presumably saw his parents die in front of him when he was one, yet can't see Thestrals until Cedric is killed.

Though it is your story, you can always add in an experience to your OC's life where they watch someone die, if you would really like them to be able to see them.

*** Though, I had the idea that her uncle would erase that actual memory so she doesn't remember being there.

**** That could be interesting; she can see the Thestrals, yet not remember ever witnessing a death, and raise suspicions that her memory was tampered with.

***** Yeah, if I decide to go this way she's housemates with the estranged niece of one of her parent's killers.

*** This is more of a knock on the movies than your answer, but shouldn't Harry have seen the thestrals since second year? He did kill Quirrell after all.

**** The caveat is always witness the death and process it. At 11 he might not have fully understood what was hapening, and I think it's implied he passed out before it was done.

The bigger knock is shouldn't he have seen the Thestrals as he was leaving school in his fourth year, and not just as he arrived in his fifth. Which is then the 'well he hasn't processed Cedric's death yet' argument comes in.

No, it's the other way around. Harry /heard/ his parents die, but couldn't /see/ it from the crib (hence why the memory the Dementors bring up is just their shrieks with no visual but a flash of green). He had long processed that his parents were gone by the time Cedric died.

** There are stages of emotional development that kids go through, and I really think a child would have to get beyond a certain point before the loss of the person really sinks in, and translates that to recognize their own mortality. I think 9 is about the youngest you'd expect that.

*** So, that would be a no for her being able to see thestrals by the age of 12/13 unless I have someone else die in her life.
