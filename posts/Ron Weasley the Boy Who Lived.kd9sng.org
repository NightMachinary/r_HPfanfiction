An old fic idea I just remembered. In the original version Ron, Harry, & Hermione argue when entering the room of requirements which puts them in a grass is greener plot. Ron is the boy who lived & only survivor of his families massacre. Harry is the muggle born child of dentists. Hermione grew up in the magical world with plenty of siblings. Incorporate that part or not as you will, or just stick to the titles prompt


** ok i would actually love to read a fic like this. I assume Ron grew up with his aunt muriel then?
