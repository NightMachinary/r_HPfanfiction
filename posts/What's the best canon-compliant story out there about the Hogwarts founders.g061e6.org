** Well I know one fic that had Salazar Slytherin as a Basque who left Spain to escape the Moorish and Christian battles after losing his wife and son, had Helga and Ravenclaw as Viking witches allied to a Pictish king only to be captured in battle, And Gryffindor who was an earl of King Aethelston who asked for Hogwarts Valley as a boon after helping Aethelstan unite Britain. All in flashbacks.

It also is a harem fic that ended up leading to a four book series that spanned billions of years and at least three galaxies, so the founders bit was just part of book one. Not linking due to nsfw content.\\
Harry Potter and the Four Founders.
