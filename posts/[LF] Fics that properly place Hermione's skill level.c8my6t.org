In a Universe where Barty Crouch Jr, Percy, and Bill all get 12 OWLs, Dawlish gets all Outstandings on his NEWTs, Dumbledore performs magic unseen by examiners, Riddle makes a Horcrux in magical high school along with top marks, Snape modifies potions and invents spells, the Marauder's become Animagi, Harry does a patronus as a third year, Hermione's academic achievement is good, but with her one E, not particularly impressive.

Are there any fics where her proper level is placed? linkffn(The lie I've lived) is a pretty good example. I don't mind fics where she thinks she's more skilled than she actually, but diminishing her achievements (having her get mediocre grades) for the sake of the story is frowned upon for this request.

Some Examples: linkffn(Rise of the wizards) linkffn(The Sorting Hat's Stand) linkffn(The Mind Arts) linkffn(The blood of the Phoenix)


** One point I've tried to stress in my linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) is that Hermione is a very good student, but not necessarily a very powerful witch. She's good at things like artifact-crafting but her casting is slow and she loses control easily under emotional pressure, making her dueling average at best. (She feels a bit inadequate about it.)

*** I'll be honest. I'm not that big a fan of Hermione. She has her positive traits in canon, such as her loyalty and her ruthlessness to protect her friends, but I feel her negative traits get explained away and that she never really grows as a character.

It's not bad writing, and I enjoyed what you did with Grindelwald, but that sort of ease solving problems or abusing rituals just doesn't sit well with me, as well as marginalizing Wizarding Britain's politicians. But, I do like that you at least have her confront that sort of thing. It's rare for a fanfiction writer.

You hover that fine line between a crack fic and something serious.

That's my thoughts too. The exact opposite happens to Ron, his good traits are downplayed and his negative traits are +empathized+ emphasized.

Love the flair btw.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

***** I keep a ebook for references. He ended up having noticably better brews. The DA coins was a NEWT charm, but again, pales in comparison to the aforementioned. Barty Crouch Jr was 19 when he went to Azkaban, was under the imperious for over a decade and still had the skill to confund the goblet of fire.

Snape invented things and was renowned for knowing curses.

The Marauders became Animagi and made the Marauder's map.

I'm not saying she's bad or stupid, but we end up getting quite a few more extraordinary students in comparison.
