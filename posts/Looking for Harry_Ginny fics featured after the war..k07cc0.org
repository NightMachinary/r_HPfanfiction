I'm feeling basic. I've read a lot of Northumbrian's stories, but that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about. I love reading fics where Harry and Ginny find out they're having a baby, announce it to people, when they announce an engagement, etc. I love shorts but just as equally love long fics.

I believe I've read most canon-compliant “after the war” fics that are longer. And I can't stand after the war fics that diverge from canon for some reason.

Any recommendations would be appreciated!


** [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Stories by Mrs_Granger]]? (Summer goes before Winter) Those are long stories, but they seem to me as basic and vanilla (in the good sense of the word) as the Northumbiran's ones.

** Have you read the collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]? I imagine you have, but those are my favorites!

I've also enjoyed the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][Teatime stories by frombluetored]], although they are probably more properly "next-gen" rather than "after the war".
