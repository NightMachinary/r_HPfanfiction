I know it's not likely, but I just want this amusing idea in a story. It likely wouldn't end because of statute of secrecy, though.


** The problem with this that even if they forged documents and/or Confounded and/or Obliviated people to get into non-magical Uni/college, that doesn't mean they'll be able to keep up with the work. People going from high school/college (in the UK) to college/uni have problems, and they were just in school a few months back! Imagine someone who essentially dropped out of school at 10/11 (if the person is Muggleborn/raised) and coming back for post-secondary education with little to no catch up.

Unless they're on some potion regimen to enhance memory and retain information, that scenario will not go down well. Hopefully the wizard has an insider as well, or else the ruse will be discovered sooner or later.

**** in Exile, Draco (eventually) studies to enter muggle uni because he's not allowed to do magic as part of his punishment. It was interesting to read about certain things that we as muggles take for granted that wouldn't be as intuitive for somebody raised in the wizarding world.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

**** Same. Unless the wizard/witch has been doing correspondence courses and tests/qualifications during their Hogwarts years. But then, they wouldn't need forged docs (Unless the studying was informal).

BrilliantLady has her 'Perfectly Normal' series linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal]]) that does 'taking non-magical classes during Hogwarts' as a subplot for Harry, starting in his second year to keep his options open and fulfill his dream of becoming a Doctor.

[SELF-PROMO]

My fic is also doing something similar, but starting first year and it's more of a secret (among other things):

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

** While it would be funny yo imagine a Muggleborn to try to present his NEWT score (on a parchment) to an administrion clerck of the college, any Muggleborn who wish to enroll probably just confuse the person responsable for admitions or forge some certificates with transfiguration.
