I don't mind gen, slash, or any genre! Rating doesn't matter either.

I'm just looking for fics where people treat Harry well! For example, Sirius, after adopting Harry, buys him stuff he doesn't really need and is ridiculously expensive, tries to gift Harry with all the missed birthday presents, etc Or a Drarry fic, where Draco tries to dress and dine Harry, treating him to fancy stuff and such

I read such a depressing fic a while ago, so I really really really want to see a fic where Harry is treated well, maybe to a level where it's a bit excessive The pampering part doesn't have to be the main part of the fic, just a little bit would be fine! I read everything, so please recommend anything!!


** I found this fic incredibly well written, but it's unfortunately abandoned. I don't usually like fics that start before/during first year, but I loved this one.

It takes Harry being pampered to the extreme. linkffn(2366955)

  Seven Year AU. Suppose the Dursleys had not been Harry's only living relations. How might the young hero that we know and adore have been changed by a loving childhood? The differences might not be as universally positive as one might think. Discontinued.

** So you basically want Harry having a nice childhood:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily met Mrs Granger on that fateful Halloween night, and everything changed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU, even in Muggle world. James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and ran off with Harry to the Continent. Harry never went to Hogwarts and made his career in the Muggle military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry was raised by a loving OC Muggle family, but Muggles had their own design on the Magical World. Things already escalated during Year 1.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), Harry ran away at age 5 and was picked by the Grangers. Dumbledore found out soon and was actually happy about the situation. He also told them about Harry's real deal and brought Tonkses to help them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings and had lots of fun together.

In both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542;10937871), Harry was raised by 'good' Dursleys.

There are lots of 'Harry raised by Sirius' fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] especially likes this theme. However, my favorite here is still [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), where a more cunning and sinister Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore and had ruled magical Britain for almost 20 years. Dumbledore would however make his return after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. He and Sirius prepared Harry extensively for the eventual showdown with Malfoy and Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart found and raised Harry. He was sorted into Slytherin, and things heated up already in Year 1. [[/spoiler][Voldemort got neutralized quickly, and Draco somehow got the Diary]].

--------------

Finally, the Dursleys had the misfortune of bringing Harrymort into the house in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

#+begin_quote
  I was five years old when Petunia Dursley realized that she would never be rid of me. I know this because she began sobbing while insisting that she would never be rid of me.

  Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of.
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  I stroked the parchment of my Hogwarts letter with fondness.

  The youngest Dursley nearly wet himself at the deranged smile on my face. That was an expression usually reserved for our little "chats" (These usually involved quite a bit more screaming than chatting. Still, I always healed him at the end, so it's not like he has anything to complain about).

  My "loving" relatives were more than happy to ship me off to Hogwarts where I would be far, far away from them. The desire was mutual. Even with training, the three were barely tolerable.

**** If you want to see happy postwar fics, there are literally thousands of canon-compliant ones. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5521420/1/Aurors-and-Schoolgirls][Aurors and School Girls]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6506699/1/Epithalamium][Epithalamium]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers of Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(5521420;6506699;6331126), are really good, and they are also part of a massive postwar series written by the same author.

If you want Harry to find lots of love and happiness during Hogwarts era, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ...

** How about Cake by Astolat? It's an adorably funny oneshot, Harry/Draco. It starts with the absurd premise that Harry has never really had a proper birthday party, so Draco starts sending him gifts. linkao3(7678270)

** Balm of the Soul. Linkffn(12064203)

Too bad it's likely dead, and only 2 chapters. I'd still recommend reading it for sure.

There's not much to spoil, but I'll tag it anyway. Here's a short summary:

[[/spoiler][Harry's exposure to Dementors at the end of his third year isn't something to be brushed off, and it comes out that he was abused by the Dursleys. To start making up for it, Dumbledore offers Harry choices of rehabilitation resorts. Harry semi-spitefully chooses the most expensive one. It's staffed entirely by Veela - but - there's no actual smut in it.]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's reaction to a hundred dementor's is severe enough to knock that foreign soul fragment loose. Now his thought processes feel almost alien, foreign memories keep triggering to the forefront of his mind, and he feels cut off from the people closest to him. As such, Harry needs some help recovering from the ordeal, and everything else in his messed up life.

Undoubtedly. Like, damn. Child abuse, two faced murder man melted to death, gargantuan basilisk, soul eating misery monsters. There was never a kid who needed therapy more.

You're welcome :)

Just a fair warning - I probably should've made this clearer, but the staff do get.. up close and personal. It never crosses over into smut but it does lean towards it.

**** Ahh... I haven't read it in a while. Rereading it, it does get a little bit smutty. Although it's mostly a personal spa treatment kind of thing.

My mistake.
