** My headcanon for this is that Lupin and any other friends of Lily and James simply didn't know where Harry was. They could've asked Dumbledore, but I don't think he would've told them. He would've just assured them that Harry was safe, and because it's Dumbledore, they would probably not question it.

*** Add to this that Lupin and the Dementors are very clearly an allegory for depression; Remus Lupin has a lot of reasons to close up and ignore the world for a while after the deaths and betrayals of his friends, so reaching out to Harry might make sense in a logical standpoint, there's really nothing logical about the behavior of someone severely depressed. Often, it is just the struggle of a new day, every day, that takes up 100% of your energy in that sort of state.

**** True. And aside from all that's happened in his life, he's a werewolf. I see a lot of Remus bashing in some fanfics. They often say that it's no big deal that he's a werewolf, that just takes up one night in a month, he's free to do whatever he wants in the meantime. Like what? So he has to go through extremely painful transformation which likely feels like all his bones break and then snap together, his skin stretches, then his mind is overtaken by an animal one, he can't control himself, he has to live with the knowledge that he might attack and kill someone if they stumble upon him during transformation, and the only potion that allows him to keep his mind is very rare and expensive, and he likely can't afford it outside of Hogwarts. And it doesn't even help with the pain. But it's okay because it happens /only/ once a month! Ugh...

**** I think in the summer before Harry's third year it was already generally known that Harry lives with his Muggle relatives. He even told some of the people at Hogwarts. It wouldn't surprise me if it was mentioned in some article in the Daily Prophet or something. But that likely wasn't the case before Harry started attending Hogwarts, never mind the first few years after Voldemort's fall. Didn't Dumbledore even mention that it was a very hectic time when no-one was sure who was an ally and who was the enemy? I think back then Harry's location was kept almost completely secret, perhaps only between Dumbles and McGonagall. After all, if even Harry's godfather turned out to be a traitor, then who could Dumbledore trust?

**** Thank you it was interesting, when starting I thought it could very well get to the top of my preferred retelling fanfictions. Than the second part disappointed me for two reasons. First of all, polygamy in any form just doesn't work for me. Yes, it might be wet dream (literally) of many teenagers, but it is just weird and unrealistic. I wouldn't care if the result was Harry/Hermione or even better (because she is so underutilized) Harry/Padma, but this seems to much like the author just wasn't able to decide. Second, and yes it is about relationships again, there was obvious Chekhov gun in Marcia McCartney being possible romantic interest for too-single Sirius (“He is Auror, she is PI, they solve crime.”), but then in the end the sudden turn towards one-night stand with consequences just didn't make sense to me. I would like to cry with the apostle “Foolish Galatians! You started from Spirit and now you want to continue in flesh?” Pity.

** It's easy to blame Remus for not visiting Harry knowing what we all know, but I dont think it's fair to do so. I'm a couple of years older than Remus/James/Lily when they died and honestly, I wouldn't check up on the kid if my best friend were to die and leave their toddler orphaned unless they explicitly asked me too look after them, or if I knew that they didn't have anybody to look after them. I wouldn't visit a toddler if I knew they were in custody of their aunt (who've I never met and would have no reason to believe would abuse the child), because I'd think they be save there if their parents entrusted the care of their child to them.

If he had a kid and I was not the godfather or asked to look after him I wouldn't check on him if he was in the custody of a blood relative. If we met I'd tell stories about our time as best friends and help him if he asked but I wouldn't actively seek him out. Also considering Remus had a pretty shitty life I don't think Harry was a priority at all. Like the dude had to deal with being a werewolf for gosh sakes.

**** I think I would casually check on them. Send a gift and a card on birthday and Christmas but no more. Visit when they're old enough, if their guardians allowed it.

However my best friend's child isn't as special as Harry.

Harry is hidden to the magical world and wizards. For his safety (Death Eaters could want to finish the job) and his sanity (not good to grow up as a legend). Since my relationship with his parents is common knowledge, it's likely that anyone who want to find Harry would watch me in the hope I (or one of my owl post) would lead them to Harry.

No can do.

On top of that, I do not have severe depression nor believe that people are better off without me. I don't think that people would be ostracized if they hang out with me and people found out the truth about me.

** i think most don't take in a few factors and also look only at Harry's side. here's a few points.

1. Being a werewolf is traumatic, leaves you desolate as most won't hire you, never mind the poor/scars. Lupin just saw his family die. ( best friends) betrayed by the only living member outside himself.

2. as others mentioned. No one knew who to trust or what was going on. and Only 1 man did, and he canonically thought Sirius had betrayed the potters.. why not lupin also?

3. No one knew where to harry was most likely outside Mongoical, Hagrid, and Dumbledore.( which oddly considering hargids luck with secrets? maybe more should have LOL... "i shouldn't have said that..")

4. if he did know. 1. How do you approach Harry and the Dursleys. Hi! i am one of the freak kind you all hate here to check on my godson? wait whos not my godson! oh yeah i have no job, and am a monster and look like a criminal or vagabond? 2. do you think the Dursleys even wanted the man around. or 3. Lupins very self-hating mindset ( i mean he left his wife and child due to his self-hate.) wouldn't allow him near harry.

5. Many including people here also are doing the "Hero Syndrome"s aka Id do better!. trust me life happens,. shit happens. I've had family i loved that when our main connection died. (my grand mother) you both drift apart if you think they're ok. so if lupin was told its good by Dumbledore or Mcgonical? why would he go randomly check.

​

I personally hate Lupin's arc. He's not a bad man. but they force him to be a villain in some eyes because they aren't adult enough get it. He's a brilliant yet Depressed man. Never mind the whole Tonk's and him angle. they were Horrible for each other. and are romanaced also as badly as snape and lily

​

Tonks and Lupin were very unhealthy which so many "fan love". but irl if any of our freaking 25 yr old sister/cousin etc was pining for a broke jobless, could become a weapon of mass destruction etc. they got married and he's still a jobless broke and than we found out he Left her and a snot nosed 17 yr old had to go tell him to man the fuck up cause he had issues? Id be on that guys house giving him a piece of my mind.

Considering we hear jackshit about Lily's friends apart from Snape, I assume she's a bit like Harry: superficially popular but not incredibly trusting and with a very small circle of friends. I think Snape was her closest friend throughout her time at Hogwarts while she also hung out with other girls like how Harry would speak to Dean and Seamus. Once she stopped being best friends with Snape, she got attached to the Marauders whom she became close friends with until her death.

***** Hagrid got the pictures of James and Lily for Harry in book 1 from their friends. Some of them were still alive as of then. I think that since Lily and James upon graduation literally immediately began OOTP training and fighting a war, they didn't have much time for friends that weren't also doing the same. Lily probably grew apart from her friends because they either died in the war or weren't actively fighting the war. Then to top it off they were in hiding for over a year and really only spoke to the Order.

Now, I understand why Remus wouldn't go. It could be dangerous for Harry, yes. He was suffering from his lack of job due to being a werewolf (utter bullshit on the Ministry part) and from the transformation. Also he probably spent some time mourning his best friends. But I also don't think he would have never tried. I think Dumbledore never let him and made him believe Harry was fine and happy.

My problem with that, is that Dumbledore never bothered to check, even though Minerva warned him when they left Harry there, which just doesn't bode well with me at all. I think it would be very possible for Remus to visit Harry at least once a year if Dumbledore wanted to make it possible. He just didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Two short stories of Harry Potter with one question: what if a witch had instead been born a wizard, or vice versa? Male Ginny and Female Remus each star in their own story of a single change and the difference it makes. Canon compliant soft AU, with a single character changing sex and gender in each story.

** Look, some may condone thar guy for no visiting Harry at Durzkaban. To some degree, I can do it, too. But after his return to Wizarding World? Two years, and absolutely NOTHING! More over, at third year he was a teacher at Hogwarts, and what? Does he rush to Harry? Tries to talk to him, told him about his parents? Does he want to know Harry? No. He doesn't give a duck. Yeah, he helps Harry with Patronus, but let's be honest here, any sane and competent teacher would do it, considering dementor's love to Harry. Most of the bashing his character receives is well earned. If anything, there is not enough Lupin bashing, imo.
