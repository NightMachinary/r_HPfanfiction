It's a Harry/Multi story where Harrys power is unlocked pretty sure it's after OoTP. One thing I definitely remember is the power leak that Harry has makes everyone around him have an orgasm as he does as well or something similar to that obviously rated M. If you know what it is let me know! Thanks!

** Is it a power that Dumbledore has intentionally let build up so that Harry's releasage is inevitable? Something like the 'Witches Secret' stories on hpffarchive maybe.

** Perhaps Searching For The Power? I remember something about him unlocking patronus memories which would arouse those that looked into his eyes.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many
