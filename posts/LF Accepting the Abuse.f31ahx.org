I'm looking for a good fic that talks about what happened to Harry with the Dursleys. Either main story, or just a mention, I need something that makes Harry realise how bad they were to him. Maybe like a trial for child neglect when Dudley comes to his senses or something. Any website.


** Can't remember anything off the top of my head. As for Dudley coming to his senses, I like this fic linkffn(4172226).

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] by noaacat) has Harry spend more time with the Dursleys but also has him get to see how other families work, so there's an actual realization moment where Harry fully understands how messed up his living situation is.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]] by SilchasRuin) is a pretty light hearted and fun fic but there's this slow burning background plot of Harry actually comprehending that the Dursleys will never love him.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
