Any nice one shots/short fics with Harry and Mrs Weasley or another mother like figure? Like in Gof when Molly hugs him, or DH when she gives him the watch.

General family moments also appreciated.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Not a short fic by any means, and it takes a long time for it to get there, but linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) has Harry shelter Narcissa over a summer holiday and she becomes a very motherly figure to him.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** "Dinner With The Weasleys" is closer to the general family moments you mentioned, but it really is a great fic.

Consider this the fanfic equivalent of the big Sunday dinners with your grandparents and cousins after church.
