Hey guys,

it's a me again ;)

This time I'd love fanfictions where Harry (or any other main character) decides to not have children (especially Harry though because I really could see that, as he'd want to break the cycle of neglect/abuse (children of abusers are often abusers themselves and many don't have children if they've been abused as children - not that that's the only reason (I myself had a great childhood and I don't like children much...maybe because I was bullied at school))

Constraints: No (main-character) slash (background is ok!), at best (unless really good) no Harry/Ginny and no background Draco/Hermione (or Hermione/Snape...)

Stage is yours, go for it! :)


** I don't have a fic for you because I've never come across one, but I just want to chime in on something you brought up.

"especially Harry though because I really could see that, as he'd want to break the cycle of neglect/abuse "

Harry in the books doesn't act like a child of abuse, he seems to ignore what he has been through at the hand of the Dursleys. So he's not a typical case study. Also, Harry wants a family, so having kids would be logical for him. His children adore him and it looked as though he was content and at peace. So I'm not really sure if you will find fics where Harry has no desire for children, goes against his heart's desire.

*** I disagree - hell, I think that the epilogue is quite OC (Harry grew up a muggle basically, so why would he have children more or less straight out of Hogwarts? It doesn't make sense, most people don't do this nowadays - except maybe the religious screw ups in the US (sorry, but fanatics are something I despise, no matter what people are fanatical about...I just don't like zealots!))

Well, in a way he is - he conforms to his friends too much (let's Ron decide for him whether to study or be lazy (let's face it: Ron's an abysmal student!)), he doesn't speak up if he's hurt (Umbridge...sorry, but Dumbledore and McGonagall should have been charged with abuse for that! Oh, and Snape - a normal teenager would not accept being treated like he was by Snape!), he doesn't have much self-worth (that's why it's so easy for him to sacrifice himself - I mean IMHO that should be hard as hell and I personally wouldn't do it, not for a world that does not deserve it...let them live under Voldemort's rule for a few years, till the last pureblood accepts that following that maniac was not a good idea!)

I'd think if he really was content (found a nice - but ambitious - witch (children are in the way of ambition, unless you stick them with a nanny all the time or have one parent sacrifice all his/her ambitions!) which supports him and shows him that he doesn't need rugrats in order to be fulfilled etc.), he could do without :)

ps: Your heart's desire can change - at 11 I had other desires than I do today (so the mirror would show me something different now than what it would have shown me back then!)

**** Harry's hearts desire never really changed, he wanted a family. Of course, he never really thought much of a future after hearing the prophecy. The epilogue is 19 years later, he didn't have kids right out of school! Albus was 11, James is 12, so that means he waited seven years to have kids, so that means he was 24, which is after he and Ginny have established a career for themselves. Sure, Harry was influenced by Ron in care of rule breaking and studies, but Harry had kids first (plus he had a godson, lil Teddy) in this regard, Rose is Albus' contemporary as is Scorpius. So Harry took his time.

So Harry grew up muggle, it looked like he kept part of that while being a wizard. So that part is moot. Is it so bloody horrible that Harry got married and had a family of his own, something he has desperately wanted his whole life? So he started at 24, big deal, the wizarding world doesn't seem to have an university system, they go straight from school to the work place or mastery. Auror academy is what, 3 years, so Harry was 20-21 when he became an Auror and then 3 years on the job. That's reasonable.

Harry seems to like being a father, if the advice he gave Albus is any indication of what he is like, then being a dad suits him. It shows what has learned, that the mistakes of the past have left their mark and he has gained much insight for the better due to them.

He's not you, please don't mistake your personal feelings for his. In all honesty, the way Harry is in the books after his life with the Dursleys (which consequences pop up in the books) would never happen in RL. The fact that none of his primary teachers caught on or the neighbors is utterly ridiculous. This is a story, Harry has plot shield. The character of Harry works as a father, it was natural and that the main trio waited seven -eight years is acceptable.

***** Did I say him having kids is bad? I don't think so! I said I could understand him not wanting any!

AND: I am looking for fanfiction to read, so I think my tastes are important aren't they (I wouldn't read real books I don't like, so why should I read fanfiction I don't like?)?

ps: I didn't post that request to argue - you can open a topic if you want to discuss this further!

****** You bring up his past as a way to justify not wanting children, yet it is exactly said past that gives him that desire, a desire for family. You are better off with finding fics where Harry is still a child.

*** While this article may dispel the myth that /all/ victims become abusers (which seems like a straw man "myth" in its all-encompassing assertion, but one which I admit might reasonably seem worrying to a former victim), it seems to strongly support a theory that victims are /much more/ likely to become abusers than non-victims.

For example, the Hunter and Kilstrom study which the article describes as "more balanced" concluded that 18% of victims became abusers compared to one out of 233 non-victims becoming an abuser (0.4%, though I'd say the study population is too small to put any faith in that number).

While this may show that victims certainly are not /destined/ to become abusers, if you turn it around and look at the population of abusers and ask where did they come from -- the vast majority of them were victims themselves. Based on this article.

Let the downvotes commence!

**** You have a point, but the fact still remains that the vast majority of victims do /not/ go on to perpetuate the cycle, and casually throwing out statements that they do like the OP did actively harms victims and can have a horrible impact. Figuring out the whys and hows of childhood abuse is a complex issue, and it's horrible to see these assumptions being made so frequently.

**** u/munin295:
#+begin_quote
  the vast majority of them were victims themselves
#+end_quote

That didn't make any sense. If we assume a stable number of abusers in the population, and only 18% come from former victims, then 82% must come from non-victims.

Basically, even though victims are individually more likely to become abusers, there are so many more non-victims in the population that they produce more abusers despite any single individual non-victim being less likely to do so.

*** Is it? I've seen something like this first hand (sure it does not happen all the time - maybe not even half the time, but it does happen!) - well, I've witnessed it (I myself was not the victim of something like this, my dad has never hit me and neither has my stepmother (she dragged me around by the ear sometimes...but that's it)) at a friends house in my teens! (My friends dad was into physical punishment (smacking his son around) and so was his father (I did - it was well known in my little village that the grandfather was worse, but the father still couldn't help himself...maybe because he was too young, maybe because he didn't know how to raise a child otherwise - I don't know, but the beaten became the beater in this case!)

**** All the scientific evidence strongly suggests that your experience is one of the few exceptions rather than the rules. The "cause" may also have been something other than his own upbringing.
