After the first run through when Harry is entered against his will, he decides to use the next run through to enter others against their will.

Albus Dumbledore

Peter Pettigrew

Barty Crouch Jr

Tom Marvolo Riddle

Draco Malfoy

Ron Weasley

Any number of other people. Some to reveal them, some to have the goblet strip away their magic, some just to watch them fail.

If something like this already exists, let me know. If someone wants to write it, I'll beta for it.

  AU, taking place during GoF. How Harry fulfilled the prophecy without ever learning about it: He is given a weapon and gets creative with it. The Dark Lord doesn't know, and never will.

** That would be quite impossible because of the age line. Also I don't know why Harry would want to do any of that to either Ron or Dumbledore.

*** Maybe he pits Ron in to show him what Harry had to deal with in the tournament. Kind of like a just desserts situation. Ron wanted to join, and didn't stick by Harry's side despite all theshit they've been through the last few years. Just to be clear, I like Ron. I think he's an immature berk, but he's a teenager, it's expected. I don't think him, and Hermione work as a couple(I also don't think Harry/Hermione work either).

Honestly, i'd have liked if no-one got in a relationship right out of a war, and school. JKR was mental with that epilogue. They need time to find themselves, and i'm gonna stop now. This got away from me a bit.

**** Well the epilogue happens 19 years after. Most wounds were healed by then.

***** Maybe, but I still argue on the pairings since JKR herself stated she'd made them on her desires, not on what would actually happen.

*** Maybe since it's a groundhog day fic, after 3 runs the line sees his mind as an adult and he passes without issue.

There are other ways to get through explored in other fics: tunneling, throwing crumpled paper from outside the line, getting an older student to do it, flying to the top of the room on a broom where the line doesn't reach.

And Ron because either Harry gets annoyed at his jealousy over and over, or wants to give him eternal glory and money.

Dumbledore because I like fics where Harry realizes how much Dumbles manipulates his life.
