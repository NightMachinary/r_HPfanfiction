Basically, if Harry was Geralt of Rivia and Colin was Dandelion.

"Toss a knut to your Savior..."


** When a humble bard

Graced a ride along

With Potter of Hollows

Along came this song

‚Äã

When the Silver Stag fought

A parsel tongued devil

His army of soul eaters

At his hem did they revel

‚Äã

They came after me

With masterful deceit

Broke down my Kodak

And they left me petrified

‚Äã

While the devil's wand

Crucioed our tender meat

And so cried the Savior

He can't be beat

‚Äã

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

Oh, hallways of learning, oh

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

‚Äã

At the edge of the wards

Fight the mighty horde

That despairs and breaks you

And bring you the morn, oh

‚Äã

He repelled every dementor

Far back to the North Sea

To the fortress prison

From whence it came

‚Äã

He wiped out your boggart

Got Avada Kedavraed in his chest

He's a friend of the Light

So give him the rest

‚Äã

That's my epic tale

Our champion prevailed

Defeated the villain

Now pour him some fireale

‚Äã

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

Oh, hallways of learning, oh

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

‚Äã

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

Oh, hallways of learning, oh

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

‚Äã

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

Oh, hallways of learning, oh

Toss a knut to your Savior

Oh, hallways of learning

‚Äã

****** What about Morag Macdougal and Ernest Macmillan? McLaggen? I actually headcanon in my fanfic that Ernest is half Scottish from his father's side and his mother is Irish, and that the Macdougals lost their Wizengamot seat for participating in the Scottish Rebellion of 1745 against the direct orders of the Ministry, making them destitutes but still very traditional.

Now that I think about it, it would be very interesting to see a very traditional pure-blood family from Scotland, Ireland, or Wales arguing with Dumbledore for their child(ren) to be able to receive an education in (insert region)-Gaelic. I realise they would probably have to resort to private tutors/homeschooling, but just thinking about it is funny. You can just be sure there is an ancient and forgotten bylaw dating from the Founders' time that goes along the lines of children who correspond to a certain sets of requirements can receive an education at Hogwarts in any of the languages native to the British Isles and that could be so exploited.
