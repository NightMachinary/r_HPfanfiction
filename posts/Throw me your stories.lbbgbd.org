I want to read something, probably review, give me your stories. Rules might seem like a lot, but if you read them you'll see they're actually not that restricting:

1.  If you're going to throw something dark at me it better be for a good reason, if it's just edgy for edgy's sake I'll probably drop it soon.
2.  I have no trouble reading WIPs. You can throw me your stuff that's 2% done and had a last update around the time JKR invented Luna. No problem.
3.  Something original is hard to come by these days, so extra points for that.
4.  It's funny or a crack? I love those, don't care. Throw them at me.
5.  I'll probably drop anything with bashing
6.  About romance, I'm a dude, I care more about plot than romance. That being said, I can handle the fluffiest thing you can send, no problem. Extra points for if it's fluffy one chap, action-packed the next, funny after, then fluffly again... I can take all genres in the same fix at once.
7.  No world building and piggy backing on the already defined Hogwarts setting? No problem, give it to me. Extensive World building detailing the adult wizard life or Germany Wizarding society? Or Brazil's? Great, I'll read it too.
8.  That being said, I don't speak Portuguese and my German only goes as far as "Der Mann trinkts Wasser". I can do Spanish though. (If you still throw me something in German I might give it a chance with Goggle translate's help, but I don't promise anything)
9.  I can read 10 words fics or 500K behemoth series... just give me time with the longest ones and it's your job to keep my interest in the long ones, or I may drop them.
10. I like canon, as my flair says, but obviously don't want to read what I already know. So Time TRavels or single point of divergence work fine. interesting crossover with fandoms I know or AUs are okay I guess
11. About pairings... I just need to buy it. Simple rules:

    1. I would probably expect canon pairings if things are up to certain point in fics. I would probably drop it if the fic starts with Hermione confessing her love to Harry in GOF. But a Harry falling for some other girl before sixth year (or noticing Ginny) is actually ok if done well. Bonus points, if canon still holds and Harry notices Ginny once he is dating someone else, can go anyway in end pairing in that case.
    2. I'm not against the concept of other pairings, but I have a strong idea of who the characters are. If you want to sell me Hermione/Harry you better make it an AU or early single point of divergence, there's a certain point in the books after which Harry/Hermione relationship has turned sister/brother and there's no going back after that.
    3. Bashing or cheap tricks like "THe Grangers happen to be Harry's dentists before Hogwarts" are not going to feel believable to me.
    4. Straight dude here, so not looking for slash for slash sake. I see Remus with Tonks, not Sirius. That, however, is more related to my faithfulness to canon than anything else. I welcome gay characters if it makes sense. I'll oppose people making Dumbledore straight for no reason. If you have Dumbledore there or another gay character, I'm not against romance if it is for plot or characterizations reasons, actually I'm all for it.

12. I usually steer away from OOC. That being said I understand single point of divergence or AUs can alter personality in a believable way. I would be okay with a more opened Harry who is good with girls if he grew up with Sirius. Or a confident Ron if he grew with money.
13. I'm open to OCs... even as MC. Better if they don't feel as Mary Sues and there's some connection to the original characters.... Like... a story of Dudley's magical daughter... or Harry Potter's great grandson... or some dude who went to school with Aberforth.

Big action, lots of humour, real tug on the heartstrings and all the right moments, big ass mystery in the middle, completed story with 3 well composed arcs throughout? And Pirates???

** Oh sweet mine checks almost all of your boxes. It is a canon compliant prequel set between the end of the first war and the second war. It is heavily plot driven, since I suck at romance. It is not finished, but it is 210k and I update every five days. I plan on finishing it by summer. Charlie features heavily, with Tonks and a bunch of OCs.

My OC isn't directly connected to any main canon characters, but spent the Triwizard year at Hogwarts and had a fling with Terry Boot. Hope you enjoy it!

  Life is a precious thing, one that is often taken for granted. Taking the time to reflect on the life you've lived is important. Harry certainly believed in this as he remembered his chance encounter with a blonde Slytherin to the life they built together.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  An accident at Azkaban flings 20 year old Auror Harry Potter back to October 31st, 1981. No one is getting out of this unscathed. Slightly cracked super powered time traveling baby. T for naughty language.

** Okay, here you are. Linkffn(13098062)

It's all OC, ongoing, set after canon. It's not the pinnacle of literature but I'm proud of it on the whole; particularly the characters, and the action scenes. I conceptualized the MC as a darker analogue to Dumbledore. I'd love to hear thoughts about it, even (especially) critical ones.

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.
