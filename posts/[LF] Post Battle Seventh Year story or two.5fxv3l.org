I'm looking for a story set after the Battle, with Harry, Ron and Hermione going back to Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, Ginny and (I think) Hermione being assigned as Aurors, with a mission involving Draco being on the bad side.

Another one I'm looking for features Amelia being the replacement for Minerva as Transfiguration Professor in another After the Battle story.
