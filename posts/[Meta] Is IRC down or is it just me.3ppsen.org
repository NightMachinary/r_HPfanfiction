*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat][Internet Relay Chat (IRC)]] is just that, an internet chatting service. [[/r/hpfanfiction]] has a IRC chatroom that you can chat with fellow users on. Usually located [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hpfanfiction&uio=d4][here]], but I can't connect today for some reason.
