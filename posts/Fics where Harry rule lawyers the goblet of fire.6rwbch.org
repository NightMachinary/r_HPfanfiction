I never understood why Harry fights the dragon and all that. Why doesn't he shoot a spell or two and then surrender, having participated? Are there any fics where Harry or somebody else does that? Or just follows the word of the goblet of fire without following the spirit.


** "Inspected By No 13" by Clell65619 is a fic where Harry employs the power of bureaucracy to circumvent fighting the dragon. Although, his newfound paperpusher powers are soon shown to have their own price, when he discovers that his shiny badge and flash clipboard come with an actual job.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Harry never put his name in the cup. No one would believe him, so he leaves Hogwarts searching for a way to fight the wizarding contract, using the thing that holds him to it; the law.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Mm, I did see one like this once, but I don't remember enough unique stuff about it to google for it.

Um...I think it was one where Harry set up a wizarding tent during the First Task, using technicalities like the judges being forbidden to interfere with the task (lest they lose their magic, of course) but also that he couldn't leave until the task was complete or the tournament ended, but it was possible for the judges to declare the tournament over so they could all leave (but they didn't want to do that), and Harry secretly summoned Dobby to his tent to bring him food so he could stay for ages.

I don't remember it having a continuation, so it might be a one-shot or in a collection.

**** Yep, that would be it, thanks.

...Makes me wonder, though, shouldn't Dobby helping Harry by providing food and shelter constitute interference with the task that would cost him his magic?
