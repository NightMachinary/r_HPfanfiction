** I would like some more as well! The stories I see usually just have them as a side-plot, but I would love to see something more interesting. Here are two pretty decent Harry/Ginny writers: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] and [[http://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeduration.html][little0bird]].

******** Order of the Phoenix, 'The Second War Begins':

#+begin_quote
  All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it -- how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him -- nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.

  ‘Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione.

  ‘Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.

  ‘Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.

Most stories are plot oriented rather than romance oriented. 1-6, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 and 20 are especially recommended. 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 16 and 17 are complete, while the rest are WIP or abandoned. 6 seemed especially promising, but was abandoned very early. 10, 18, 19 and 20 are only minor HG.

**** After the end's greatest strength is its writing quality. Even after so many years it probably remains the best written fix in the fandom. The characterizations of the main characters are excellent, no other fanatic comes close to capturing Ron's "Ron-ness" the way this fic does: his dialogue may well have been written by Jkr herself. And Draco Malfoy is just the perfect antagonist here: the story doesn't make him extra evil, and his motivations are easy to understand, and that mixture of arrogance, cowardice and cunningness is so very Draco. The main plot is engaging, and when the time comes to deliver -- the Quidditch match, Sirius storming Azkaban, Draco's blackmail and the last stand against the dementors -- the fic delivers in spades.

There are some parts I didn't like -- I wasn't all that fond of the main romance, and Ginny's characterization was jarring at times, but I loved the story overall.

** Got to love Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent, which is book one of a long, completed trilogy (sorry, can't find the link right now but google should have it pretty easily). The trilogy as a whole is called the "Triangle Prophecy" series.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] is amazing. There is a sequel about other characters, but I never did read that one. I just loved nearly everything about the original though: the characters were done so well, and the action too, but mostly it was mind-blowing to read a fanfic that drew such an emotional response from me without resorting to grimdark territory. Far and away the best time travel fic around.

I'll try to think of some more and edit later. There was one that involved Harry and company sharing a masked vigilante identity, killing death eaters. It was a one word title, but I can't seem to recall that word. It had a Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny (both with good intentions) sort of thing going on. That one also rocked.
