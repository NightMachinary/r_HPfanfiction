I want a fic where Harry grows up with no prophecy and Voldemort is gone or didnt exist. It would be great if he had a sister and he was overprotective too. I would like it to be long and cover all the years and pre Hogwarts pls!


** To be fair, that probably isn't written due to the idea is, boring, unless they add some excitement to it there wouldn't be many readers, I definitely would read it, but I haven't seen one yet
