So the basic premise is that since kids are inherently not the best at doing household chores to an adult's satisfaction and the Dursley's don't have enough patience to find workarounds instead of Harry having to do chores Vernon gets fed up and sends him away telling him to find some work to do (thinking about a mowing a neighbor's lawn or something like that).

Harry though, instead, walks around a bit and finds a ‘new age' shop that had just opened with a sign saying “now hiring”, so with a shrug he enters and goes talk with the owner (who just thinks he is cute and, since there aren't any customers at the moment, indulges him by explaining about what they sell). Harry gets intrigued about all these supposed magic and asks to learn a little, promising to work at the shop as compensation. The owner doesn't actually think he will go along with it and isn't really that interested in having a small children as a store-clerk, but don't have the heart to tell him that and so gives him some magazines to read in the shop and let's him ‘help' around. The Dursley's are honestly too happy about Harry disappearing for the evening without pulling out the roses in the garden, or burning the kitchen down, or throwing away important documents that he thought was trash while storing candy wrappers and bad drawings among Vernon's things, or...

Things go from there without much change until Harry starts trying to apply what he learns about mysticism and alternative healing in practice and his magic acts up to make it work, all those around are /very/ surprised at that while Harry is happy that his first foray in magic worked.

Personally, I am not a practicer or believer of alternative healing or new age stuff in general, so I tried to keep this very open-ended to be filled by anyone who /does/ know about it. What I /did/ find out from a quick research on Google was that the movement is integrated by, among others, people who adhered to the esoteric movement which was first popularized in the second century (so, much before the Statute of Secret would be formalized) and focused on acquiring and using knowledge about mystical practices (including non-christian religions such as the one adopted by the celt people). So it wouldn't be much of a stretch to imagine that some magical practices from before the Statute would have been passed down, as well as ‘folk magic' from cultures that were later pushed-aside by the society. I imagine that the Harry that would get to Hogwarts in this AU would be much closer to Trewlaneys characterization though.


** When I first read the thread title, I pictured a muggleborn version of Diagon Alley. You know, the disenfranchised muggleborn who "leave" the magical world and decide to make their own.

** Your prompt made me think of the beginning of "A Very Slytherin Harry" by geoffaree.

Harry finds a magic snake in the garden and starts talking to it, he uses the snake to find an apothecary run by a wizard and gets a job there.
