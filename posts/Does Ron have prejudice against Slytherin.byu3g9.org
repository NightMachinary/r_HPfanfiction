Do we have any actual evidence of his hatred in the books? Cause the fandom seems to make him really anti-slytherin In many fics, specially in AUs


** It's not that Ron has a prejudice against Slytherin, [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/596635888446218240?lang=en][*JK Rowling has a prejudice against Slytherins.*]]

To quote the great creator:

#+begin_quote
  "Not all Slytherins think they're racially superior. But all those who do are Slytherins."
#+end_quote

.

We can look at how Slytherins are portrayed in terms of characters. The Slytherin students at Hogwarts are described in terms of their physically ugly looks more than other Houses. Flint's teeth, Draco's pointy face, Pansy's pug nose, Crabbe and Goyle's trollish looks and demeanor. Slughorn, Regulus, and Andromeda Tonks are held up as "good" Slytherins, but Andromeda is a barely there character, Regulus didn't turn because he decided that racism was bad. He turned because his beloved family servant was tortured by Voldy. Slughorn can't remember his students' names and thinks Lily was so talented she couldn't have been Muggleborn.

#+begin_quote
  "Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good."
#+end_quote

Gee, I guess she's a credit to her race. He also does this to Tom Riddle, who is known as a charity student of uncertain background.

#+begin_quote
  "I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple. I have excellent contacts at the Ministry."

  "I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away. "I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing."

  "Nonsense," said Slughorn briskly, "couldn't be plainer you come from *decent wizarding stock,* abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet."
#+end_quote

Thanks, Slughorn. You are the most positively portrayed Slytherin the story has ever had.

.

And how is Slytherin introduced in the books? Before Harry even meets Ron, who fanon has decided hates those "Slimy Slytherins", we have this:

#+begin_quote
  "I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been---imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you? I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window.

  "That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. ‘He works at Hogwarts.'

  "Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"

  "He's the gamekeeper,'" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  "‘etter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,' said Hagrid darkly. ‘There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."
#+end_quote

.

Harry was never going to end up in Slytherin, no matter what the Hat told him about all houses having good potential for him. The Hat can say one thing, but JKR knows differently.

#+begin_quote
  "I always imagine that the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on, because it's strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it."
#+end_quote

  racially superior
#+end_quote

Wait, is this Rowling's actual line?

Does she imagine that muggles, muggleborns, half-bloods, and purebloods are different /races/....?

That's absolutely ridiculous, even if you assume she's talking about Slytherins and not putting forth her own interpretation.... since the opposite of this is racially equal, which assumes race to be a relevant idea for magical people.

I can't even begin to get into just how stupid this is, on so many levels.

What we colloquially know as "races" (black, white, Asian, etc) are just generalizations of genetic differences presented by geographic distance and difference.

Scientists isolate differences in genes and smaller genetic data like alleles to form region-dependent haplogroups. This genetic clustering can be broken down to even smaller but genetically distinct regions - to the level of even regions within France - but there is highest variation between the wider circles, such as Europe or Asia.

Canon magic is clearly shown to be a near random thing, and one that presents in Indians (Patils), Africans (Shacklebolt), Asians (Chang), and is even random within those races - is a muggleborn with magic suddenly a different race....?

This framing by Rowling makes absolutely no sense. Much like many things in her books, I suppose.

***** It doesn't make sense as such, on any level - that's my point.

My other point is that Rowling implicitly acknowledges that there's a racial difference between wizards and muggles, which, again, makes absolutely no sense.

*** Slytherin House was founded explicitly to segregate students based on their blood purity. Saying somebody is "prejudiced against Slytherin" is like saying somebody is "prejudiced against Hitler Youth."

I know that Slytherin as a house doesn't /only/ care about blood purity --- it cares about ambition and cunning and so on --- but at the same time, Hitler Youth wasn't /only/ about Nazism --- it also taught kids about hiking and camping and stuff.

And I understand that most kids don't choose to be sent to Slytherin, and it's unreasonable to assume every 11 year old is a blood purist beyond saving. But at the same time, it's totally delusional to pretend that Slytherin as an institution exists on equal ethical foundations to every other house, or that it doesn't play a role in indoctrinating wizarding youth into an evil ideology.

People always get so very defensive about Slytherin, and act as if it was treated unfairly by Rowling, but the blood purity in the books is a /very/ obvious magical analogue for real world racism. Slytherin, the Death Eaters and the Ministry all embody very unpleasant and and all too real racist institutions. People in this fandom sometimes glorify Death Eaters, but if you replaced the muggle lynching in Book 4 with its real world historical counterpart I doubt they would feel so comfortable romanticizing prejudice.

And again, I'm not saying that everyone who identifies with Slytherin is a Nazi, but at the same time nobody should act so outraged that Magical Hitler Youth wasn't portrayed in a positive light.

**** I feel like comparing Slytherin to the Hitler Youth is a bit unfair. Slytherin isn't the Hitler Youth, it's Eton and other schools like it in the UK. It's for upper class children who grow up to be disproportionately influential adults, many of whom are incredibly reactionary. These schools play a massive role in upholding the class structure in the UK. Most of the leaders of the British fascists attended those types of schools, as well as many colonialists. JK Rowling was a single mother on benefits so naturally she portrayed magical Eton as a place that produced terrible people.

**** If Salazar Slytherin's history and ideology are well known, and people are aware that his house is being used a propaganda mill to brainwash impressionable kids into being wizarding Nazis, isn't it the moral responsibility of all the Headmasters over the last 1000 years to do something about the issue? Yet Dumbledore didn't do anything about it, and neither did his predecessors, and neither did Harry Potter. Because Slytherin house exists to the present day, and even to 2020, where Harry's son gets sorted into Slytherin and will therefore, as you said, undergo racist indoctrination as well.

Instead of pointing fingers at Slytherin being the Evil House, perhaps it's worth considering that the entire social institution of Wizarding Britain propagates its beliefs and sustains its existence, by virtue of the fact that they allow it to exist. Some people criticize the ideology, some people fight against it, some people steer clear of Slytherin members. But they don't do anything about the House itself. If there's an analogy to be found, I'd imagine it'd be that.

From Cursed Child:

#+begin_quote
  *ALBUS:* Dad . . .

  *ALBUS pulls on HARRY's robes. HARRY looks down.*

  Do you think --- what if I am --- what if I'm put in Slytherin . . .

  *HARRY:* And what would be wrong with that?

  *ALBUS:* Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It's not a House of brave wizards.

  *HARRY:* Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew. Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus. I promise you, there is nothing to be frightened of there.

Again, I fully agree. They should have done something about Slytherin decades ago, but blood purity is a prevalent and socially accepted ideology the magical Britain. And that's sadly not hard to believe --- racial segregation existed in the USA all the way until the mid 50's.

But I also think you're deflecting somewhat. You can't say that Sytherin isn't evil just because the rest of wizarding society bares some responsibility for allowing it's existence. That would be like saying Jim Crow laws weren't evil because the rest of America shared some of the blame.

Also, I think JKR said that canon Slytherin was reformed after the war, and it now admits muggleborns and doesn't segregate based on blood purity, so perhaps the depiction of Slytherin in the Cursed Child makes sense in that context.

** No he isn't. He shows "some" prejudice on the Horgwarts Express (when he says to Harry that every bad wizard went to Slytherin), but he is only 11 at this point (and most of this prejudice comes from his parents I would say). I have a lot more problems with a character like Hagrid, who shows the same prejudice while in his 50's (or 60's?).

Once at school, I don't remember Ron showing any prejudice to Slytherin, in fact I don't even remember Ron showing any thoughts to Slytherins. He hates Malfoy (that always try to edge him on with Harry) and his gangs, but beyond that he doesn't seem to care at all about the other Slytherins in school.

Even Harry seems to show more anti Slytherin prejudices, saying things like all the Slytherins hate him (though he had it's because he keeps beating them at Quidditch, showing some kind of . . . innocence in the middle of a civil war).

​

So no, I don't think Ron ever been truly prejudiced against Slytherin (except maybe right after the "Weasley is our King" song, though he could have redirected all his anger on Malfoy), and his fanon characterization of "You can't be with her, she is a /Snake/!" is just that, fanon.

That's a very good point, especially since it was Hagrid and not Ron who said the line about bad wizards going to Slytherin. The movie gives Ron the line, mainly because Harry's first meeting with Malfoy was cut and the movie needed to give Harry a reason to plead with the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin.

On the train ride, Ron's main concern is what his family will say if he's not in Gryffindor like everyone else. His line is "I don't suppose Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

(Even here he's echoing Hermione, who has just come and gone, saying that she wants to be in Gryffindor because it sounds "by far the best, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.")

You're right otherwise... I went through the books and Ron barely mentions Slytherin at all, Over the course of the series he really only has two real anti-Slytherin moments (once where he's upset at learning Salazar Slytherin was the one who started this whole "Pureblood" thing, and once after the Sorting Hat has urged the Houses to stand together and Ron's all "I'm not standing together with Slytherins").

So I would say he has SOME prejudices, but of the main three characters Ron definitely displays the LEAST anti-Slytherin prejudices.

** Ron despises Malfoy, but that's pretty much it. That, and quiditch, which is Malfoy related.

Sure, in the first book he says some unflattering stuff, but most of it is Hagrid. Harry is a lot more paranoid about slytherin than ron.

** Nope. Ron being unreasonably anti-Slytherin is almost entirely fabricated by fanon.

Ron's line from the movies about how "No wizard that ever went bad wasn't in slytherin" is actually Hagrid's line in canon. Book-Ron actually expresses far less anti-Slytherin sentiment than Harry does.
