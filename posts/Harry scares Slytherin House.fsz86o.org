So, I'm looking for fics like Shadow Magic and I'm Still Here where Harry scares Slytherin House somehow. He can be in Slytherin too, or a different house entirely, I just want him to do something that gets the house chattering and scared.

Shadow Magic - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15432591/chapters/35821539]]

I'm Still Here - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/3/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]] It happens in this chapter. He also scares the Ravenclaw after the first task.

*** Oh, that sounds familiar. Something to do with the Dragon, right? The Ravenclaw scare, I mean?

**** When the dragon went on a rampage Harry killed her. The Ravenclaw house was worried what would happen if Luna asked him to come after them.

*** Ah, stealing witches. The fic that so pushes the ongoing debate whether good worldbuilding is sufficient to overcome a paedophilic grooming subplot. I still have no idea which side I agree with, but I did enjoy the fic when I read it. Thanks for the rec!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
