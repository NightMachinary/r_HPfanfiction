:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Just to reiterate: I personally have not ever seen such a fic. The person who mentioned it was not sure whether Harry was the one raising the miniature dragons for this purpose.

No idea what, if any, pairings might be in the fic, and don't really care. Mini dragons delivering the post FTW!


** Perhaps “By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept” by Deco linkffn(8864658)?

*** I appreciate the quick response but, dear God! How long does this story take to get to that point? There are 142 chapters and the first four so far have been rather tedious.

**** For those following along, the first miniature dragon finally appears in Chapter 30. Harry (and Dudley) are 4th years---the story started before he was even born---and the end of that same chapter came with Petunia's notice that Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire.

**** Alrighty, at the end of Chapter 47 we have the translated diary entries from the beginning of the original breeding (several failures so far), and a third dragon (small only because of age and breed) has joined our menagerie. The second task has occurred, but there's no mention yet of a maze desecrating the quidditch pitch (note that this may not appear in the fic until the actual task, who knows?).

... and have I mentioned that this is supposed to be a Severitis on top of all this?

It's possible that my impatience with this fic is that it's all Petunia-centric, and she's just infuriating as a constant POV, even with her being nicer (and more emotionally messed up) than canon.

**** Chapter 27 and Petunia and Snape have just had their first amicable conversation. Not a mini dragon in sight.

**** And as we progress to the end of Chapter 40, we're still as yet in the early stages of translating the diary in which the breeding of the current (and still only) miniature dragon. We're somewhere between the Yule Ball and the second task.

...

Edited to add: a second dragon appeared in Chapter 41. It was a runt, made even smaller by application of potions while still in the egg. The size of a horse as a hatchling---not like the mini one who sits on people's shoulders---but not expected to get larger. Don't know if this will be the original breeding pair; the miniaturization seems to be a process applied to eggs, and not necessarily selective breeding (until there's a breeding population of already-small ones, I supose).

...

Jesus Christ, at the start of chapter 43 of *142* I just noticed */this isn't a completed story/*. I'm doomed. Those mini dragons as post carriers better be freaking awesome.

**** I never said I like the story, just that it has mini-dragons (the author uses term “sporting dragon”, if I remember correctly). It is tedious and I have never discovered what is actually its plotline. Moreover, although I am a big fan of Petunia-centred stories, this is going against everything I like them about them. Author decided to make Petunia into completely different persona than what she was to make her acceptable. That is not the redemption/conversion path I would like to follow.

***** The dragon is a "sport," which is a genetics term for an individual that is physically different from the norm---i.e., a mutated individual that appears to be a one-off. Once you get more of them in a way that naturally perpetuates itself, you have a new breed.

And yes, I appreciate that one does not always like the stories that are the answer to a search, and I was not complaining about that. As I said, I appreciate your quick (and apparently accurate) identification of the story in question.

This Petunia infuriates me because she started out submissive, allegedly got stronger, but still weakly gives in at every turn. An occasional POV change would be quite refreshing, but there aren't any significant ones (there may have been very short scenes that I don't clearly recall). Everybody fromher house elves, the dragons, Dumbledore, and the boys are easily able to manipulate her into changing her mind, no matter how adamant she claims to be at the beginning of the discussion. She can't even tell Sirius that she doesn't want to marry him! (He's only doing it to try to get access to Harry.)

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
